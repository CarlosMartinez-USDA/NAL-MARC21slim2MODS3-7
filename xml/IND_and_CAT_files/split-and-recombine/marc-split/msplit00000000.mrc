Cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases are known to catalyze the oxidation of a variety of aromatic compounds with atmospheric dioxygen. Protein engineering campaigns led to the identification of novel P450 variants, which yielded improvements in respect to activity, specificity, and stability. An effective screening strategy is crucial for the identification of improved enzymes with desired characteristics in large mutant libraries. Here, we report a first screening system designed for screening of P450 variants capable to produce hydroquinones. The hydroquinone quantification assay is based on the interaction of 4-nitrophenylacetonitrile (NpCN) with hydroquinones under alkaline conditions. In the 96-well plate format, a low detection limit (5 μM) and a broad linear detection range (5 to 250 μM) were obtained. The NpCN assay can be used for the quantification of dihydroxylated aromatic compounds such as hydroquinones, catechols, and benzoquinones. We chose the hydroxylation of pseudocumene by P450 BM3 as a target reaction and screened for improved trimethylhydroquinone (TMHQ) formation. The new P450 BM3 variant AW2 (R47Q, Y51F, I401M, A330P) was identified by screening a saturation mutagenesis library of amino acid position A330 with the NpCN assay. In summary, a 70-fold improved TMHQ formation was achieved with P450 BM3 AW2 when compared to the wild type (WT) and a 1.8-fold improved TMHQ formation compared to the recently reported P450 BM3 M3 (R47S, Y51W, A330F, I401M).  aPublisher supplied data  a635734cH2020 Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3abenzene 3abenzoquinones 3acatalysts 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3aevolution 3ahydroquinone 3ahydroxylation 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprotein engineering 3ascreening1 aSauer, Daniel F.1 aDhoke, Gaurao V.1 aDavari, Mehdi D.1 aRuff, Anna Joëlle1 aSchwaneberg, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2285-42020 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Nov., v. 102, no. 22 p.9657-9667dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9328-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04321naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245007500180300001600255500000900271520270700280592002802987650001603015650003403031650002203065650001503087650001303102650002503115650002103140650001203161650002103173650002003194650001103214650003103225650001603256650002603272650000903298650001103307650002103318650001103339650001403350650000703364650001103371650001103382650001003393650000903403651001303412651001303425700001903438773020703457856009403664852000903758655001203767IND60665890620221121222217.0191028e198704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066589062DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600020006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbarick, K.

The objective of this study was to compare the standard DTPA soil test method with the ammonium bicarbonate (NH₄HCO₃)-DTPA (AB-DTPA) procedure for extraction of trace elements, and to correlate extractable levels with elemental concentration in leaf of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L., cv. Fordhook Giant) grown in the greenhouse and in the grain and straw of hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Vona) grown in the field. For the greenhouse study, sewage sludges containing low (Fort Collins, CO) and high (Chicago, IL) metal conent were added to Nunn clay loam (Aridic Argiustolls, pH = 8.0) and Redfeather loamy sand (Lithic Cryoboralfs, pH = 5.3) at rates ranging from 0 to 120 Mg dry sludge ha⁻¹ in 15 Mg ha⁻¹ increments. For the greenhouse study, coefficients of correlation (r) for the greenhouse study between AB-DTPA and plant concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn in Swiss chard were > 0.90 for the calcareous soil (Nunn) and > 0.93 (except for Cu) for the acidic soil (Redfeather). Even though DTPA extracted less Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn than AB-DTPA, the r values between these two extractants were > 0.98 for each metal. For the field studies involving addition of a low metal sludge from Littleton/Englewood, CO, to four sets of plots from 1982 to 1985, only the DTPA levels of Zn correlated significantly (r = 0.84) with the associated grain concentration. In contrast, AB-DTPA provided significant correlations between soil levels and concentrations of Cd (r = 0.57) and P (r = 0.43) in straw and the Ni (r = 0.42), Pb (r = 0.83), Zn (r = 0.82), and P (r = 0.39) in the grain. The field studies indicate that when a low metal sludge is applied at rates consistent with N needs of the crop, levels of AB-DTPA extractable Zn and possibly Pb should indicate the potential for Zn and Pb uptake into wheat. Because the concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Ni in the sludge applied did not result in plant uptake at levels that were significantly different from those in the untreated control, nonsignificant correlations were found. Also, AB-DTPA extraction of soils showed that adequate P was present so that no response to the P added with the sludge was expected. For the field study, the r values between AB-DTPA and DTPA were > 0.95 for each metal. The results indicate that AB-DTPA is as valid as, if not superior to, DTPA for metal extraction and offers the additional advantage in allowing nutrient analysis if one wants to assess both plant nutrients and trace metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiustolls 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacid soils 3aammonium 3aammonium bicarbonate 3aapplication rate 3acadmium 3acalcareous soils 3aclay loam soils 3acopper 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahard red winter wheat 3alead 3aleaves 3aloamy sand soils 3anickel 3anutrients 3apH 3asewage 3asludge 3astraw 3azinc 3aColorado 3aIllinois1 aWorkman, S.

The effects of different concentrations of sodium alginate, gelatin, and calcium chloride on the mechanical strength of CAG microbeads were determined using a self-made puncture force tester. Following this, the microbeads were immersed in DMEM media for a specified period to test its decay resistance. A diffusion model including a calculation formula of diffusion coefficient was built to investigate the diffusion of glucose and bovine serum albumin (BSA) through the wall of the microbeads. Furthermore, the feasibility of the microbeads for in vitro culture was identified using neural stem cells from Kunming mouse. Through a systematic approach and comprehensive analysis, the optimal gelatin conditions for microbead preparation were determined; the final combination of parameters of 1.5 % (wt%) sodium alginate (SA), 0.5 % (wt%) gelatin, and 4 % (wt%) CaCl₂were the best conditions for NSC cultures. This experiment demonstrated that CAG microbeads had good cytocompatibility that made it suitable for the culture and successfully maintained stemness of neural stem cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abovine serum albumin 3acalcium chloride 3adiffusivity 3agelatin 3aglucose 3ain vitro culture 3amice 3asodium alginate 3astem cells 2aAlginatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCells, Cultured 2aGelatinxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMaterials Testing 2aMice 2aMicrospheres 2aNeural Stem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism.1 aLi, Liying1 aLi, Ruipeng1 aLim, Mayasari1 aLiu, Peng1 aLiu, Tianqing0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 June, v. 173, no. 3 p.838-850dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-0874-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001800245520159600263592002801859650001501887650001601902650002101918650001501939650002101954650001101975650001401986650001702000650001902017700001802036700002002054700001902074700003002093700002502123700002102148700001902169700002202188700002902210700002002239773011102259856008602370852000902456655001202465IND60530005320170413000000.0160720e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053000532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b017362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsypova, Alina10aSensor Based on Aptamer Folding to Detect Low-Molecular Weight Analytes  ap. 7566-7574.  aAptamers have emerged as promising biorecognition elements in the development of biosensors. The present work focuses on the application of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) for the enantioselective detection of a low molecular weight target molecule (less than 200 Da) by aptamer-based sensors. While QCM-D is a powerful technique for label-free, real-time characterization and quantification of molecular interactions at interfaces, the detection of small molecules interacting with immobilized receptors still remains a challenge. In the present study, we take advantage of the aptamer conformational changes upon the target binding that induces displacement of water acoustically coupled to the sensing layer. As a consequence, this phenomenon leads to a significant enhancement of the detection signal. The methodology is exemplified with the enantioselective recognition of a low molecular weight model compound, L-tyrosinamide (L-Tym). QCM-D monitoring of L-Tym interaction with the aptamer monolayer leads to an appreciable signal that can be further exploited for analytical purposes or thermodynamics studies. Furthermore, in situ combination of QCM-D with spectroscopic ellipsometry unambiguously demonstrates that the conformational change induces a nanometric decrease of the aptamer monolayer thickness. Since QCM-D is sensitive to the whole mass of the sensing layer including water that is acoustically coupled, a decrease in thickness of the highly hydrated aptamer layer induces a sizable release of water that can be easily detected by QCM-D.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aenantiomers 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3aoligonucleotides 3aquartz 3areceptors 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamics1 aThakar, Dhruv1 aDejeu, Jérôme1 aBonnet, Hugues1 aVan der Heyden, Angéline1 aDubacheva, Galina V.1 aRichter, Ralf P.1 aDefrancq, Eric1 aSpinelli, Nicolas1 aCoche-Guérente, Liliane1 aLabbé, Pierre,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 04, v. 87, no. 15 p.7566-7574dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b017363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010400160300001600264520056900280592002800849650002100877650002600898650001800924650001700942650002500959650003000984650002001014650003201034653002801066653001801094653002601112700001701138700001701155773013601172856007401308852000901382655001201391IND60691738420221120221229.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173842DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.9002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasui, Hironori10aSelective Incorporation of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids into Organelle Phospholipids of Animal Cells  ap. 900-902.  aThe selective incorporation of linoleic (18:2(n-6)) and docosa-hexaenoic (22:6(n-3)) acids into phospholipids of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane was investigated by changing the ratio of 22:6(n-3) against 18:2(n-6) in a medium, in which Chinese hamster V79-R cells were grown.

It was found that the Alcalase hydrolysate exhibited the highest angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Then, Alcalase hydrolysate was further hydrolyzed with protease and separated by an ultrafiltration membrane system. Finally, two peptides responsible for ACE inhibitory activity were identified to be MVGSAPGVL (829Da) and LGPLGHQ (720Da), with IC50 values of 3.09 and 4.22μM, respectively. Moreover, the free radical-scavenging activity of the purified peptides was determined in human endothelial cells. In addition, the antioxidative mechanism of the purified peptides was evaluated by protein and gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes. The current study demonstrated that the peptides derived from skate skin gelatin could be used in the food industry as functional ingredients with potent antihypertensive and antioxidant benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendothelial cells 3aenzyme activity 3afood industry 3afree radical scavengers 3afunctional foods 3agelatin 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3askin (animal) 3asubtilisin 3aultrafiltration 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aCell Survival 2aFish Proteinsxchemistry 2aFree Radical Scavengersxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGelatinxchemistry 2aHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cellsxchemistryxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPeptidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPeptidyl-Dipeptidase Axchemistry 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSkates, Fish. 2aSkinxchemistry 2aSubtilisinsxchemistry 0aBioactive peptides 0aACE inhibition 0aROS 0aAntioxidative enzymes 0aHuman endothelial 0aSkate skin1 aRyu, BoMi1 aKim, Se-Kwon0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 143 p.246-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245004200212300001200254506007600266520143900342592002801781506003701809650001301846650002501859650001701884650001801901650002101919650001701940650002601957650001001983650001801993650000902011650001102020650002202031650002502053650001302078650002002091650001502111650002102126650001602147653002002163653001602183653001802199653004502217773012002262856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60590628620221207081224.0180314e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059062862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.02.0012doi7 aPMC59676372pmcid7 a294083622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNauseef, William M.10aBiosynthesis of human myeloperoxidase  ap. 1-9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of Chordata peroxidase subfamily [1] expressed in mammals, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), express conserved motifs around the heme prosthetic group essential for their activity, a calcium-binding site, and at least two covalent bonds linking the heme group to the protein backbone. Although most studies of the biosynthesis of these peroxidases have focused on MPO, many of the features described occur during biosynthesis of other members of the protein subfamily. Whereas MPO biosynthesis includes events typical for proteins generated in the secretory pathway, the importance and consequences of heme insertion are events uniquely associated with peroxidases.This Review summarizes decades of work elucidating specific steps in the biosynthetic pathway of human MPO. Discussion includes cotranslational glycosylation and subsequent modifications of the N-linked carbohydrate sidechains, contributions by molecular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum, cleavage of the propeptide from proMPO, and proteolytic processing of protomers and dimerization to yield mature MPO. Parallels between the biosynthesis of MPO and TPO as well as the impact of inherited mutations in the MPO gene on normal biosynthesis will be summarized. Lastly, specific gaps in our knowledge revealed by this review of our current understanding will be highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChordata 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrates 3achemical bonding 3adimerization 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3aheme 3ahumans 3aiodide peroxidase 3amolecular chaperones 3amutation 3amyeloperoxidase 3aperoxidase 3aprotein subunits 3aproteolysis 0aMyeloperoxidase 0aPeroxidases 0aHeme proteins 0aCyclooxygenase-peroxidase protein family0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 642 p.1-9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245010700163300001600270520113700286592002801423650001401451650002301465650002701488650001601515650002301531650001301554650001501567650001501582653001801597653001601615653001501631653001301646653001101659700001701670700001401687700001401701700001801715700001601733773010601749856008701855852000901942655001201951IND60582574120221118003214.0200717e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058257412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Li10aNutrient transferring from wastewater to desert through artificial cultivation of desert cyanobacteria  ap. 947-953.  aRealizing the reasonable allocation of resources is possible to solve the dual problems of resources and environment. Therefore, in this study desert cyanobacterium Scytonema javanicum was cultivated in artificial synthetic wastewater to explore the feasibility of nutrient transferring from wastewater to desert. After inoculation, S. javanicum grew well in the wastewater; nitrogen and phosphorus were gradually removed from the wastewater. In general, cyanobacterial biomass, exopolysaccharide content, COD, nitrogen and phosphorus contents were all significantly affected by the cultivation time, wastewater dilution treatment and their interaction (P<0.001). Comprehensively considering the producing period, biomass accumulation and nutrient removal efficiency, cultivation time of cyanobacterium S. javanicum in the synthetic wastewater should be controlled around 20days, with wastewater dilution ratio at 1:1. Conclusively, desert cyanobacterium S. javanicum is a promising species for nutrient transferring from wastewater to desert, and its maximum biomass yield could reach 3.91mgChl-aL⁻¹ in the synthetic wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScytonema 3abiomass production 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorophyll 3aexopolysaccharides 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 0aCyanobacteria 0aCultivation 0aWastewater 0aNutrient 0aDesert1 aZhu, Qiuheng1 aYang, Lie1 aLi, Bolin1 aHu, Chunxiang1 aLan, Shubin0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Jan., v. 247 p.947-953dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245015400187300001600341520098700357592002801344650001601372650001801388650002501406650001801431650001301449650001601462650001501478650001401493650001801507650001301525650002801538650002901566650004701595650002601642650001601668650002701684650001301711650002001724650004401744650004701788650001701835653001601852653001401868653001201882653001801894653001301912653001701925653001601942700001501958700001501973773010001988856008702088852000902175655001202184IND50069336820221119025216.0190402e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006933682DNAL7 a240542392pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiya10aKinetic changes of nutrients and antioxidant capacities of germinated soybean (Glycine max L.) and mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) with germination time  ap. 268-276.  aThe objectives of this research were to systematically assess the functional values of germinated soybean and mung bean, and to determine the optimal germination time for yielding functional substances.

Results showed that germination had positive enhancement effects on bioactive compounds in beans. Both compositions and contents of isoflavones in soybean were influenced by germination, three-day germination was optimal time for production of germinated soybean with the highest total isoflavone content (4.68mg/g dry product), the contents of genistein, daidzein, total aglycone in germinated soybean were increased 3, 2.4, and 2.5 folds, respectively, as compared to non-germinated soybean.

The wetland (Chainat 1; CNT1) and upland (Kum Hom CMU; KH CMU) rice varieties were grown under waterlogged and well-drained soil conditions with or without Zn fertilizer application. Zinc fertilizer (ZnSO₄) was applied at 0 and 60 kg ha⁻¹ in three stages at tillering, booting, and flowering. In the wetland variety, CNT1, grain yield decreased by 18.0% in the well-drained soil compared to the waterlogged conditions, but there was an 8.9% decrease in grain yield in the waterlogged soil compared to the well-drained soil in the upland variety, KH CMU. Applying Zn fertilizer affected yields differently between the varieties, decreasing grain yield by 11.9% in CNT1 while having no effect in KH CMU. For grain Zn concentrations in brown rice, applying Zn fertilizer increased Zn concentration by 16.5–23.1% in CNT1 and KH CMU under both growing conditions. In the well-drained soil, applying Zn fertilizer increased straw Zn concentration by 51.6% in CNT1 and by 43.4% in KH CMU compared with the waterlogged conditions. These results indicated that the wetland and upland rice varieties responded differently to Zn fertilizer application when grown in different conditions. Applying Zn fertilizer in the appropriate rice variety and growing conditions would help farmers to improve both the desirable grain yield and Zn concentration in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abrown rice 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3asoil 3astraw 3atillering 3awetlands 3azinc 3azinc fertilizers1 aLordkaew, Sithisavet 1 aProm-u-thai, Chanakan 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168300001400295520110300309592002801412650001301440650001801453650001201471650001501483650001501498650000901513650001101522650001601533650001601549650001101565651001001576653001301586653004501599653002401644653002001668700001401688700001901702700001801721700001901739700001401758700001601772700001601788773010401804856008701908852000901995655001202004IND60567278120221120025608.0190409e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056727812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xin-Yu12aA novel method for contributing to composting start-up at low temperature by inoculating cold-adapted microbial consortium  ap. 39-47.  aLow temperature climate presented a technical challenge to start-up composting in northern region of China. This study investigated if the cold-adapted microbial consortium (CAMC) could promote composting start-up at low temperature. In this work, the CAMC was inoculated when food waste was composted at 10°C. The results showed that inoculating CAMC accelerated the piles temperature effectively, the piles passed through the start-up period within 37h. Moreover, the inoculants could enhance the abundances of dominant strains related to organic matters degradation rate. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the relationships among indigenous bacteria, organic substrates degradation and temperature evolution were influenced by the inoculants. Furthermore, the heat generation value and degradation rate of the hydrolysable carbohydrate, lipids and protein were significantly enhanced with CAMC inoculated. This work demonstrated that inoculating CAMC was beneficial to composting self-heating, it provided a novel biotechnology support to ensure the normal start-up of winter composting.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3aclimate 3acomposting 3afood waste 3aheat 3alipids 3amethodology 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aBio-heat 0aCold-adapted microbial consortium (CAMC) 0aComposting start-up 0aLow temperature1 aZhao, Yue1 aSun, Qing-Hong1 aWang, Xue-Qin1 aCui, Hong-Yang1 aZhang, Xu1 aLi, Yan-Jie1 aWei, Zi-Min0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Aug., v. 238 p.39-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011200163300001800275520169600293592002801989650002302017650001302040650002102053650001502074650001602089650001602105650002002121650002602141650003802167650000902205650001102214650001202225700001502237700001402252700001602266700001802282773011102300856008602411852000902497655001202506IND60530005920221118071535.0160720e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053000592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b018142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aRing-Oven Washing Technique Integrated Paper-based Immunodevice for Sensitive Detection of Cancer Biomarker  ap. 7951-7957.  aA paper-based microfluidic immunodevice has recently attracted considerable interest for point-of-care testing (POCT) and a washing procedure was used as a standard procedure in immunoassay to eliminate the nonspecific binding protein from a paper surface. However, the traditional washing method cannot get rid of the nonspecific binding protein more completely to get a lower background. In this work, a novel washing strategy with a ring-oven technique integrated on a paper-based immunodevice was presented, which can effectively wash a nonspecific binding protein and enable a low background for sensitive detection of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). By immobilizing the antibody on the detection area and incorporating the temperature-controlled ring-oven under the paper-based device, the continuous washing solution can carry the nonspecific binding protein to the waste area freely by capillary force and then the waste area dried quickly by heating. The paper device, which is matched to the size of the ring-oven, is composed of eight microfluidic channels by the simple and rapid paper-cutting fabrication method. With the HRP-catalyzed 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)–H₂O₂ colorimetric detection method, a lower detection limit of 0.03 ng/mL CEA can be obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The washing efficiency for the nonspecific binding protein was improved a lot compared to the traditional washing methods, and the established paper-based device can be used in the determination of CEA in human serum with high sensitivity. The paper-based device provides a new washing strategy for sensitive immunoassay and point-of-care diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibody detection 3aantigens 3abinding proteins 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aheat 3ahumans 3awashing1 aGuo, Yumei1 aZhao, Mei1 aLi, Huifang1 aZhang, Zhujun0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 04, v. 87, no. 15 p.7951-7957dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b018143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001400213245011400227300001600341500002400357520128900381650001501670650001801685650002001703650001201723650001001735650001501745650001801760650001601778650001101794650001201805650003501817650001901852650001501871650002101886650001201907650001601919650002601935650002201961650002701983650004802010650004402058650001202102650001402114651001702128653002502145653002202170653002402192653001702216653001802233653002602251653003002277653002602307700001602333700002002349700001702369773011702386852000902503856008002512930003302592945002502625946001302650655001202663IND4419145320221120204627.0090414e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441914532DNAL7 a197916082pmid7 a10.1603/022.038.01182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF821 0aF600 0aF300 0aL300 0aL0011 aRoets, F.10aMite-Mediated Hyperphoretic Dispersal of Ophiostoma spp. from the Infructescences of South African Protea spp  ap. 143-152.  aIncludes references  aOphiostomatoid fungi are well known as economically important pathogens and agents of timber degradation. A unique assemblage of these arthropod-associated organisms including species of Gondwanamyces G. J. Marais and M. J. Wingf., and Ophiostoma Syd. and P. Syd. occur in the floral heads (infructescences) of Protea L. species in South Africa. It has recently been discovered that Ophiostoma found in Protea flower-heads are vectored by mites (Acarina) including species of: Tarsonemus Canestrini and Fonzago, Proctolaelaps Berlese, and Trichouropoda Berlese. It is, however, not known how the mites carry the fungi between host plants. In this study, we consider two possible modes of mite dispersal. These include self-dispersal between infructescences and dispersal through insect vectors. Results showed that, as infructescences desiccate, mites self-disperse to fresh moist infructescences. Long-range dispersal is achieved through a phoretic association with three beetle species: Genuchus hottentottus (F.), Trichostetha fascicularis L., and T. capensis L. The long-range, hyperphoretic dispersal of O. splendens G. J. Marais and M. J. Wingf. and O. phasma Roets et al. seemed effective, because their hosts were colonized during the first flowering season 3-4 yr after fire. 3aOphiostoma 3afungal spores 3aspore dispersal 3aphoresy 3amites 3aTarsonemus 3aProctolaelaps 3ahost plants 3aProtea 3aflowers 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3ainsect vectors 3aColeoptera 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aFlowersxmicrobiology 2aMitesxphysiology 2aOphiostomaxphysiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aProteaceaexmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aSeasons 2aSymbiosis 3aSouth Africa 0aOphiostoma splendens 0aOphiostoma phasma 0afungal transmission 0ahyperphoresy 0aTrichouropoda 0aGenuchus hottentottus 0aTrichostetha fascicularis 0aTrichostetha capensis1 aCrous, P.W.1 aWingfield, M.J.1 aDreyer, L.L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2009 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.143-152dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/022.038.01183Available from publisher's Web site  a20090427b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle03207naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013200170300001400302520153900316592002801855650001301883650002701896650002101923650002901944650001101973650002601984650003002010650002602040650001202066650001202078650002002090650001502110650001102125650001502136650002602151650002502177650001202202650001202214650003002226650001602256650001502272650001102287650002202298651001002320653001902330653001402349653001902363653001402382700002302396700002002419773009602439856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60629531720221118034826.0200106e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062953172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Tarundeep10aWeed control in Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton with pre mix of pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl in north-west India  ap. 69-75.  aCotton is the most important cash crop in North-west India. It is highly sensitive to weed competition during initial growth stages. Lack of selective post-emergence herbicides for broad spectrum weed control has been among major cotton production constraints in the region. Farmers had to rely on non-selective herbicides and or hand-weedings for post-emergence control of weeds. Efficacy of a new pre-mix of pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl for selective post-emergence weed control in cotton was evaluated in a field study conducted over two consecutive cropping seasons at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, India. Pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl at 100–125 g ha⁻¹ significantly reduced density and dry biomass of annual grasses and broadleaved weeds in both years; it gave effective control (>88%) of Trianthema portulacastrum L., Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Digitaria sanguinalis and Acrachne racemosa, fair to good control (<80%) of Digera arvensis and no control of Cyperus rotundus. Pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl at 125 g ha⁻¹ gave the highest seed cotton yield (2226–2367 kg ha⁻¹) which was 42–45% higher than unsprayed control and equivalent to pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl at 100 g ha⁻¹ and weed free check in both years. The study demonstrated that pre-mix of pyrithiobac sodium plus quizalofop ethyl at 100–125 g ha⁻¹ could be a suitable option for post-emergence selective control of grass and broadleaved weeds in Bt cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrachne 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCyperus rotundus 3aDactyloctenium aegyptium 3aDigera 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aTrianthema portulacastrum 3aagricultural colleges 3aannuals 3abiomass 3abroadleaf weeds 3acash crops 3acotton 3acrop yield 3acrop-weed competition 3adevelopmental stages 3afarmers 3agrasses 3apostemergent weed control 3apyrithiobac 3aquizalofop 3asodium 3atransgenic plants 3aIndia 0aBroad spectrum 0aHerbicide 0aPost-emergence 0aSelective1 aBhullar, Makhan S.1 aKaur, Simerjeet0 tCrop protection.g2019 May, v. 119 p.69-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008900167300001600256520140000272592002801672650001201700650001601712650002001728650001101748650002901759650000901788650001601797651001001813700001701823773013301840856008301973852000902056655001202065IND60780963420221118095131.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078096342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-022-04039-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoonia, Neeraj10aAlpha power exponentiated Teissier distribution with application to climate datasets  ap. 339-353.  aIn the global warming era, discovering new probability distribution for modelling the meteorological parameters is highly desirable. Particularly, in some instances, experts’ interest lies mainly in the extreme values like maximum rainfall, temperature, level of flood water, etc. In this article, we introduced a probability distribution for modelling annual maximum rainfall and temperature of four locations in India. We derived statistical properties of the proposed model like survival function, hazard rate function, median, mode, skewness, kurtosis, etc. The proposed model exhibits decreasing, increasing, and uni-modal density functions including bathtub-shaped, increasing, and decreasing hazard rates. Parameters of the proposed model were estimated using the method of maximum likelihood estimation. At last, four real-life datasets, two of annual maximum rainfall and another two of temperature, were used to show the efficiency of the proposed model. Four distributions, namely Gumbel (type 1 generalized extreme value distribution), Fréchet (type 2 generalized extreme value distribution), Teissier, and exponentiated Teissier distributions, were used for comparison with the proposed model. Later, we calculated the return level of both datasets for different return periods. And the 95% bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for the parameters of the proposed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3arain 3atemperature 3aIndia1 aAzad, Sarita0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2022 July, v. 149, no. 1-2 p.339-353dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04039-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245019700168300001800365520190500383592002802288650002002316650002802336650002202364650002502386650001102411650002102422650001102443650002102454650001302475650002602488650001402514650001502528650000902543650001202552651001002564653003402574653003102608653001302639653003202652700005602684700001302740700001402753700001702767773012102784856008802905852000902993655001203002IND60583757720221119142544.0190206e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058375772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.2352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qiumei10aPartitioning multi-source uncertainties in simulating nitrogen loading in stream water using a coherent, stochastic framework: Application to a rice agricultural watershed in subtropical China  ap. 1298-1313.  aUncertainty is recognized as a critical consideration for accurately predicting stream water nitrogen (N) loading, but identifying the relative contribution of individual uncertainty sources within the total uncertainty remains unclear. In this study, a powerful method, referred to as the Bayesian inference combined with analysis of variance (BayeANOVA) was adopted to detect the timing and magnitude of multiple uncertainty sources and their relative contributions to total uncertainty in simulating daily loadings of three stream water N species (ammonium-N: NH4+-N, nitrate-N: NO3−-N and total N: TN) in a rice agricultural watershed (the Tuojia watershed) as influenced by non-point source N pollution. Five sources of uncertainty have been analyzed in this study, which arise from model structure, parameters, inputs, interaction effects between parameters and inputs, and internal variability (induced by random errors of model or environment). The results show that uncertainty in parameters relating to the processes of both N and hydrologic cycles contributed the largest fractions of total uncertainty in N loading simulations (58.83%, 63.48% and 61.64% for NH4+-N, NO3−-N and TN loading, respectively). Additionally, three of the largest uncertainties (i.e. parameters, inputs and interaction effects) in all three simulated N loadings were on average significantly greater in the rice-growing season relative to the fallow season, primarily due to the excess fertilization application during the rice-growing season. The predicted TN uncertainty was mainly attributed to the inaccuracy of NO3−-N simulation, which contributed to 75.48% of predicted TN uncertainty. It is concluded that reducing the parameter uncertainty of NO3−-N loading simulation during the rice-growing season is the key factor to improving stream water N modeling precision in rice agricultural watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aagricultural watersheds 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanalysis of variance 3afallow 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aparameter uncertainty 3apollution 3aprediction 3arice 3astreams 3aChina 0aStream water nitrogen loading 0aMulti-source uncertainties 0aBayesian 0aRice agricultural watershed1 aXiong, Lihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6990-24141 aLi, Yong1 aLi, Siyue1 aXu, Chong-Yu0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 618 p.1298-1313dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.2353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245011200157500001400269520101100283592002801294650001701322650000801339650002101347650001501368650000901383650004301392650001001435650001201445653001401457653001201471653001501483700001901498700002101517700001801538700001701556773011301573856007501686852000901761655001201770IND60516726120221120134800.0160327s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051672612DNAL7 a10.1017/jan.2013.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, C.A.10aEffects of low dietary aflatoxin B1 on broiler liver concentration without and with Mycosorb® toxin binder  aNAL-light  aA pilot study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of hepatic aflatoxin (AFB1) concentration as a biomarker to assess the in vivo efficacy of a mycotoxin binder in poultry when AFB1 dietary concentrations are low. Diets containing low doses of AFB1 without or with Mycosorb® (MTB), a mycotoxin binder, were fed to broilers from 7 to 21 days of age. The accumulation of AFB1 in liver was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with a detection limit of 5 ng/kg liver. In response to 10 and 50 µg AFB1/kg feed, hepatic AFB1 accumulation was 27 and 145 ng AFB1/kg liver, respectively. At each dietary concentration of AFB1, the inclusion of 5 g MTB/kg of feed reduced (P < 0.1 for 10 μg AFB1/kg feed and P < 0.05 for 50 μg AFB1/kg feed) hepatic AFB1 accumulation by at least 50%. These results suggest that hepatic AFB1 concentration is a suitable biomarker for evaluating mycotoxin binder efficacy in poultry fed the EU maximum dietary concentration of 10 µg of AFB1/kg feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3aage 3aanimal nutrition 3abiomarkers 3adiet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliver 3apoultry 0amycotoxin 0abroiler 0aMycosorb®1 aApajalahti, J.1 aYiannikouris, A.1 aOjanperä, S.1 aKettunen, H.0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2013, v. 2dCambridge University PresswJournal:23123x2049-257X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jan.2013.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001700200245007600217300001600293520069100309592002801000650001001028650001201038650001101050650002001061650001901081650002101100650001901121650001201140650003401152650002901186650002101215650004501236650002601281650003001307650003501337650000901372650003701381650001001418650001001428650002201438653001201460653001701472653002401489653002301513653000801536653001901544700001501563773011601578852000901694856008301703655001201786IND2057050220221120174820.0181203e19951001enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205705022DNAL7 a85588182pmid7 a10.1258/0023677957807399992doi4 a0023-6772(19951001)29:4L.370;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarey, M.

We now report that pharmacological conditioning of pigs with a drug, pentylenetetrazole, known to induce anxiety in man, permits investigation of the presence or absence of this psychological state during exposure to a variety of environmental stimuli encountered during normal husbandry. Such pharmacological conditioning therefore provides a valuable means to assess and improve elements of animal welfare and should be applicable to other species that show operant behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aswine 3aanxiety 3aazoles 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxpsychology 2aAnxietyxphysiopathology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aConditioning, Psychologicalxphysiology. 2aConditioning, Operant 2aConvulsantsxpharmacology 2aDiscrimination, Psychological. 2aMale 2aPentylenetetrazolexpharmacology 2aSmell 2aSound 2aSwinexpsychology 0aANXIETY 0aCONDITIONING 0aDRUG DISCRIMINATION 0aPENTYLENETETRAZOLE 0aPIG 0aANIMAL WELFARE1 aFry, J.

Fr. to accumulate 53 elements from unpolluted acidic sandy soil and polluted alkaline flotation tailing sites in Poland, (ii) to estimate the low-molecular-weight organic acid (LMWOA) profile and contents in fruit bodies, and finally (iii) to explore the possible relationship between elements and LMWOA content in mushrooms. The content of most elements in fruiting bodies collected from the flotation tailings was significantly higher than in mushrooms from the unpolluted soils. The occurrence of elements determined in fruiting bodies of B. badius has been varied (from 0.01 mg kg⁻¹ for Eu, Lu, and Te up to 18,932 mg kg⁻¹ for K). The results established the high importance of element contents in substrate. Among ten organic acids, nine have been found in wide range: from below 0.01 mg kg⁻¹ for fumaric acid to 14.8 mg g⁻¹ for lactic acid. Lactic and succinic acids were dominant in both areas, and citric acid was also in high content in polluted area. The correlation between element contents and the individual and total content of LMWOAs was confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBoletus 3acitric acid 3afruiting bodies 3afumaric acid 3alactic acid 3amine tailings 3amushrooms 3asandy soils 3aPoland1 aMagdziak, Zuzanna1 aGąsecka, Monika1 aNiedzielski, Przemysław1 aKalač, Pavel1 aSiwulski, Marek1 aRzymski, Piotr1 aZalicka, Sylwia1 aSobieralski, Krzysztof0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Oct., v. 23, no. 20 p.20609-20618dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7222-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001200317520144700329592002801776596005601804596005601860650001801916650002101934650001901955650001901974650001901993650001902012650001702031650001302048650002702061650001602088650001902104650002102123700001702144700001602161700002102177700001502198700001802213700001702231700001502248700001702263700001702280700001602297700001402313700001802327700002202345700002702367773014102394856008202535852000902617655001202626IND60654051020221118012928.0190919e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4222-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuriani, A.

Then, the synthesised GO (SDS–GO) was incorporated into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) solution to produce a nanofiltration (NF) membrane through the phase immersion method. The addition of GO into the preparation of membrane solution alters the membrane morphology and improves the hydrophilicity. TiO₂ was also used as an additive for the NF membrane fabrication to further increase the membrane hydrophilicity. The fabricated PVDF/SDS–GO/TiO₂ and PVDF/SDS–GO NF membranes were compared with pure PVDF membrane. Then, the fabricated NF membranes were tested for methylene blue (MB) rejection with 10 ppm MB concentration. On the basis of the dead-end cell measurement operated at the pressure of 2 bar, the PVDF/SDS–GO/TiO₂ presents high MB rejection (92.76%) and the highest dye flux (7.770 L/m² h). This dye flux value was sevenfold higher than that of pure PVDF membrane (1.146 L/m² h) which was due to the utilisation of both GO and TiO₂ that improved the membrane hydrophilicity as indicated by the lowest contact angle (64.0 ± 0.11°). High porosity (57.46%) also resulted in the highest water permeability (4.187 L/m² h bar) of the PVDF/SDS–GO/TiO₂ NF membrane.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017-0001-102-11cTWAS-COMSTECH Join Research Grant  a2015-0154-102-02cFundamental Research Grant Scheme 3acontact angle 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amethylene blue 3ananofiltration 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants 3athermoplastics 3atitanium dioxide1 aMuqoyyanah, 1 aMohamed, A.1 aOthman, M.

This pathogen has spread rapidly across the world, causing high numbers of deaths and significant social and economic impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a suggested zoonotic origin with the potential for cross-species transmission among animals. Antarctica can be considered the only continent free of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential human introduction of this virus to the continent through the activities of research or tourism to minimise the effects on human health, and the potential for virus transmission to Antarctic wildlife. We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. The environmental conditions in Antarctica seem to be favourable for the virus stability. Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. Among Antarctic wildlife previous in silico analyses suggested that cetaceans are at greater risk of infection whereas seals and birds appear to be at a low infection risk. However, caution needed until further research is carried out and consequently, the precautionary principle should be applied. Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (< 5 m) to Antarctic fauna. We highlight measures to reduce the risk as well as identify of knowledge gaps related to this issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acomputer simulation 3afauna 3ahuman health 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3apandemic 3apathogens 3aprecautionary principle 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction 3atourism 3atourists 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3awildlife 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aMitigation measures 0aReverse zoonoses 0aTransmission1 aVarsani, Arvind1 aMorandini, Virginia1 aGrimaldi, Wray1 aVanstreels, Ralph E.T.1 aDiaz, Julia I.1 aBoulinier, Thierry1 aDewar, Meagan1 aGonzález Acuña, Daniel,1 aGray, Rachael1 aMcMahon, Clive R.1 aMiller, Gary1 aPower, Michelle1 aGamble, Amandine1 aWille, Michelle0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.143352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1433523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011500168500001900283520165100302592002801953650002601981650002102007650001302028650001002041650001202051650001902063650001502082650001402097650002302111650001102134650002202145650001902167650002502186700002302211700002702234700002502261700002302286773012202309856008002431852000902511655001202520IND60731961720221121064959.0210326e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073196172DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFormisano, Luigi 10aSuccessive Harvests Modulate the Productive and Physiological Behavior of Three Genovese Pesto Basil Cultivars  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the Italian culinary tradition, young and tender leaves of Genovese basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) are used to prepare pesto sauce, a tasty condiment that attracts the interest of the food processing industry. Like other leafy or aromatic vegetables, basil is harvested more than once during the crop cycle to maximize yield. However, the mechanical stress induced by successive cuts can affect crucial parameters associated with pesto processing (leaf/stem ratio, stem diameter, and dry matter). Our research accordingly aimed to evaluate the impact of successive harvests on three field-grown Genovese basil cultivars (“Aroma 2”, “Eleonora” and “Italiano Classico”) in terms of production, physiological behavior, and technological parameters. Between the first and second harvest, marketable fresh yield and shoot dry biomass increased by 148.4% and 172.9%, respectively; by contrast, the leaf-to-stem ratio decreased by 22.5%, while the dry matter content was unchanged. The increased fresh yield and shoot dry biomass at the second harvest derived from improved photosynthetic efficiency, which enabled higher net CO₂ assimilation, Fᵥ/Fₘ and transpiration as well as reduced stomatal resistance. Our findings suggest that, under the Mediterranean environment, “Italiano Classico” carries superior productive performance and optimal technological characteristics in line with industrial requirements. These promising results warrant further investigation of the impact successive harvests may have on the qualitative components of high-yielding basil genotypes with respect to consumer expectations of the final product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aOcimum basilicum 3aagronomy 3abasil 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acondiments 3acultivars 3adry matter content 3aleaves 3amechanical stress 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance1 aCiriello, Michele 1 aEl-Nakhel, Christophe 1 aKyriacou, Marios  C.1 aRouphael, Youssef 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245013500215520133600350592002801686650001401714650001901728650001201747650001201759650001301771650000901784650001801793650001301811650001801824653000701842653001201849653000801861653000901869653000801878653000901886653000801895653000901903653001001912653001101922653000701933653000801940653000901948653001001957653000901967653001301976653000801989653001401997653000702011653000902018653001202027653002102039653001002060653000902070700005102079700006102130700005902191773009002250856008702340852000902427655001202436IND60753007720221122152012.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075300772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2021.1706732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunez-Salces, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1879-779714aThe secretion of total and acyl ghrelin from the mouse gastric mucosa: Role of nutrients and the lipid chemosensors FFAR4 and CD36  aThis study investigated the nutrient-mediated modulation of total ghrelin (TG) and acyl ghrelin (AG) secretion from the mouse gastric mucosa, and the role of long-chain fatty acid chemosensors, FFAR4 and CD36, in lipid-mediated modulation of TG and AG release.Ex-vivo experiments were conducted using mouse gastric mucosa to examine the effects of nutrients (D-glucose, L-phenylalanine, peptone (mixture of oligopeptides & single amino acids), D-mannitol, α-linolenic acid and fat emulsion (intralipid)) on TG and AG secretion. Additionally, inhibition of FFAR4 and CD36 on α-linolenic acid and intralipid-mediated regulation of TG and AG secretion was assessed.TG and AG secretion were unaffected by glucose and D-mannitol. Peptone stimulated the release of TG and AG. In contrast, L-phenylalanine reduced AG secretion only. Intralipid reduced TG secretion and stimulated AG secretion, and α-linolenic acid reduced AG release, without affecting TG mobilisation. Modulation of ghrelin secretion by lipids occurred in an FFAR4 and CD36-independent manner.Ghrelin secretion is modulated in a nutrient-specific manner by proteins and lipids, with TG and AG displaying independent responses to the same stimuli. In addition, FFAR4 and CD36 do not participate in modulation of TG and AG secretion by α-linolenic acid and intralipid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3agastric mucosa 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3amannitol 3amice 3aoligopeptides 3apeptones 3aphenylalanine 0aAG 0aAH 7614 0aBSA 0aCaSR 0aCCK 0aCD36 0aDAG 0aDMSO 0aFFAR4 0aGHSR1a 0aGI 0aGIP 0aGOAT 0aGPR93 0aLCFA 0aNPS 2143 0aSSO 0aTC LPA5 4 0aTG 0aαLA 0aStomach 0aNutrient sensing 0aFFAR4 0aCD361 aLi, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1010-516X1 aYoung, Richard L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5116-49511 aPage, Amanda J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7086-58650 tPeptides.g2021 Dec., v. 146 p.170673-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2021.1706733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003300146245012300179500001900302520139200321592002801713650001101741650001301752650001501765650001201780650001601792650001501808650002201823650002601845650001301871650001901884650001101903650000701914650001301921650001301934650001701947650002201964650001801986700002702004700002302031700003102054700002102085773012202106856008002228852000902308655001202317IND60731961820221121225351.0210326e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073196182DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-López, José  A.10aAdsorptive and Surface Characterization of Mediterranean Agrifood Processing Wastes: Prospection for Pesticide Removal  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe sustainable management of biomass is a key global challenge that demands compliance with fundamental requirements of social and environmental responsibility and economic effectiveness. Strategies for the valorization of waste biomass from agrifood industries must be in line with sustainable technological management and eco-industrial approaches. The efficient bioremoval of the pesticides imazalil and thiabendazole from aqueous effluents using waste biomass from typically Mediterranean agrifood industries (citrus waste, artichoke agrowaste and olive mill residue) revealed that these residues may be transformed into cost-effective biosorbents. Agrifood wastes present irregular surfaces, many different sized pores and active functional groups on their surface, and they are abundant in nature. The surface and adsorptive properties of olive mill residue, artichoke agrowaste and citrus waste were characterized with respect to elemental composition, microstructure, crystallinity, pore size, presence of active functional groups, thermal stability, and point of zero charge. Olive mill residue showed the highest values of surface area (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method), porosity, crystallinity index, and pH of zero point of charge. Olive mill residue showed the highest efficiency with sorption capacities of 9 mg·g⁻¹ for imazalil and 8.6 mg·g⁻¹ for thiabendazole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aagronomy 3aartichokes 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3acompliance 3acrystal structure 3aelemental composition 3aimazalil 3amicrostructure 3aolives 3apH 3aporosity 3asorption 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3athiabendazole1 aDoval Miñarro, Marta 1 aAngosto, José  M.1 aFernández-Lledó, Javier 1 aObón, José  M.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245013500179300001600314520084400330592002801174650001401202650002401216650001101240650001801251650001701269650002301286650001801309650001401327650001301341653001801354653002001372653001701392653001401409653001101423653001201434700001901446700002201465700002501487700002201512700002601534773010601560856008701666852000901753655001201762IND60567279020221118024650.0190409e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056727902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuntupally, Sudharshan10aRelative evaluation of micronutrients (MN) and its respective nanoparticles (NPs) as additives for the enhanced methane generation  ap. 290-295.  aIn the present work, effect of micro nutrients (MN) (NiCl2, Fe2O3, CoCl2, (NH4)6Mo7O24) was compared with nanoparticles (NPs) of respective MN with cattle manure (CM) slurry in single and bi-phasic anaerobic digestion (AD) at a hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 20days at a mesophilic temperature of 37±2°C for the generation of biogas with enhanced methane (70–80%).

However, systems with desirable insulin release kinetics and high loading capacities have proven difficult to achieve. Here, we report the development of electrostatic complexes (ECs) comprised of insulin, a polycation, and glucose oxidase (GOx). Under normoglycemic physiological conditions, insulin carries a slight negative charge and forms a stable EC with the polycation. In hyperglycemia, the encapsulated glucose-sensing enzyme GOx converts glucose to gluconic acid and lowers the pH of the microenvironment, causing insulin to adopt a positive charge. Thus, the electrostatic interactions are disrupted, and insulin is released. Using a model polycation, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to model these interactions, synthesized ECs with > 50% insulin loading capacity, and determined in vitro release kinetics. We further showed that a single dose of ECs can provide a glycemic profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice that mimics healthy mice over a 9 h period with 2 glucose tolerance tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acations 3adiabetes 3aencapsulation 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aglucose tolerance 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3amolecular dynamics 3apH 3aquality of life 3arisk 0aglucose-responsive 0aelectrostatic complex 0apolycation 0ananoparticle1 aBurns, Delaney M.1 aBasu, Arijit1 aLanger, Robert1 aAnderson, Danq(Dan G.),0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 338 p.71-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007500179300001600254520086900270592002801139650001601167650002401183650001101207650001001218650001301228650001201241650001101253650001001264650002701274650001301301650001701314653002501331653001501356653002001371653002401391700003001415700003001445700006501475700006701540773009801607856008501705852000901790655001201799IND60629532420221118034904.0200106e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062953242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Mireli Trombin de10aFeeding of Lobiopa insularis (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) on strawberries  ap. 180-184.  aLobiopa insularis (Castelnau) (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is a destructive pest, present in the field during the strawberry fruiting season. In this study, we characterized and quantified the damage caused by larvae and adults of L. insularis to strawberries at different ripening stages. Green, semi-ripe, and ripe strawberries were caged with larvae (n = 10) or adults (n = 5) for 72 h. Fruits at the three ripening stages were kept in cages without the presence of insects, representing the controls. The percentage values of damaged fruits varied among the ripening stages. The green strawberries were the least attacked by insects. In contrast, semi-ripe and ripe strawberries were the most prone to pest attack. Adult feeding increased the incidence of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizopus stolonifer. The implications of these findings are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitidulidae 3aRhizopus stolonifer 3aadults 3acages 3afruiting 3ainsects 3alarvae 3apests 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aripening 3astrawberries 0aFragaria × ananassa 0aSap beetle 0aRipening stages 0aRhizopus stolonifer1 aSouza, Michele Trombin de1 aRizzato, Fernanda Bührer1 aZawadneak, Maria A.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0004-56231 aCuquel, Francine Lorena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3026-20580 tCrop protection.g2019 May, v. 119 p.180-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245017200174300002000346520125600366592002801622650001001650650002601660650002501686650001601711650002401727650002701751650001201778650001301790650001101803650001101814650001701825650000901842650001601851650001101867650001501878650001401893650001101907650001001918650001001928650001301938650000901951700002501960700006501985773016902050856008202219852000902301655001202310IND60654051620221118012922.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05203-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirinpur-Valadi, Ali10aStudy of the accumulation of contaminants by Cyperus alternifolius, Lemna minor, Eichhornia crassipes, and Canna × generalis in some contaminated aquatic environments  ap. 21340-21350.  aToday, environmental pollution, especially heavy metal pollution, is known as a new and possibly more dangerous pollutant than other environmental ones. For this purpose, the uptake of four aquatic plants in different environments was chosen. In this experiment, four macrophytes, i.e., umbrella palm (Cyperus alternifolius), duckweed (Lemna minor), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and canna (Canna × generalis), were studied in five contaminated aquatic environments, i.e., Gohar Rood river, Zarjoob river, Eynak lagoon, Anzali lagoon, and control solution (containing Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn). The results showed that the highest uptake rates of cadmium, cobalt, vanadium, chromium, zinc, nickel, and lead were observed for duckweed fronds. The highest bioconcentration factor (BCF) of nickel was related to duckweed stem and water hyacinth root, and the highest BCF of cadmium belonged to duckweed fronds and canna root. The highest rate of uptake of cadmium, chromium, zinc, and lead was related to control. The least amount of uptake of several metals by plants was obtained from the water of Gohar Rood and Zarjoob. Generally, based on the results of this study, it can be stated that duckweed is suitable for the uptake of most heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanna 3aCyperus alternifolius 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aLemna minor 3aaquatic environment 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3afronds 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amacrophytes 3anickel 3apollutants 3apollution 3arivers 3aroots 3astems 3avanadium 3azinc1 aHatamzadeh, Abdollah1 aSedaghathoor, Shahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2438-22990 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 21 p.21340-21350dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05203-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245010700211300001600318500002400334520189800358650003102256650002202287650001902309650002202328650001602350650003202366650001402398650002402412650002002436650001502456650002302471650001602494650001202510650002502522650002802547650002002575650002902595650003502624650002202659653002102681653001702702653002102719653002102740653001902761700001602780773011702796852000902913856008002922930003303002945002503035946001303060655001203073IND4419145420221120204637.0090414e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441914542DNAL7 a197916092pmid7 a10.1603/022.038.01192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aL6001 aBilu, Einat10aParasitized Aphids Are Inferior Prey for a Coccinellid Predator: Implications for Intraguild Predation  ap. 153-158.  aIncludes references  aDiscussions of intraguild predation (IGP) have assumed that the nutritional quality of intraguild (IG) prey is similar to that of any other prey available to the IG predator. It has been suggested therefore that generalist predators do not distinguish between healthy and parasitized aphids and thus function as facultative predators of parasitoids. More recent studies have shown that predators may selectively ingest prey of various nutritional qualities and that predators may have higher body nitrogen composition than herbivores. If so, predators may preferentially feed on other predators (i.e., IG prey) to increase their nitrogen intake. We used a system composed of larvae of the coccinellid Coccinella undecimpunctata (IG predator), the parasitoid Aphidius colemani (IG prey), and their shared food source, the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, to test whether (1) the predator preferentially feeds on parasitized over healthy prey, (2) predatory behavior on parasitized aphids changes with time elapsed after parasitism, and (3) parasitized and healthy aphids differ in their suitability for predator development. Results indicate that, given a choice, C. undecimpunctata larvae show no preference for either parasitized or healthy prey items, regardless of parasitoid age. Feeding time, however, increased with parasitoid age, leading to a reduction in the number of prey consumed per unit time. Mummified prey were protected from predation by C. undecimpunctata larvae but the larvae were able to feed and complete development on mummies with a broken cuticle. These predators, however, had an extended developmental time and lower pupal and adult weights in comparison to larvae fed healthy aphids. That parasitized aphids are inferior prey for C. undecimpunctata larvae should act to reduce intensity of IGP in the field and the negative impact IGP has on herbivore suppression. 3aCoccinella undecimpunctata 3aAphidius colemani 3aMyzus persicae 3apredatory insects 3aparasitoids 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredation 3afeeding preferences 3anutritive value 3aparasitism 3ainsect development 3abody weight 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxparasitology 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aChoice Behavior 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aWaspsxphysiology 0aprey preferences 0aprey quality 0aprey suitability 0aparasitized prey 0amummified prey1 aColl, Moshe0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2009 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.153-158dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/022.038.01193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02302naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007900164300001600243520125800259592002801517650001401545650001001559650001401569650001601583650001701599650001801616650003101634700002101665700001501686700001901701700001801720773012401738856008101862852000901943655001201952IND4393496720221120152401.0151024e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439349672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-007-1078-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayamol, P. N.10aProcess Technology for the Production of Micronutrient Rich Red Palm Olein  ap. 587-596.  aCrude palm oil (CPO) is the richest natural source of carotenes that are destroyed in the conventional processing. There is a growing demand for nutritional products containing bioactive constituents externally fortified or preserved through modified process. A commercially viable process for the production of red palm olein (RPOn) rich in carotenes, tocols and sterols has been developed at pilot scale. The process developed involved neutralization of CPO followed by crystallization at controlled rate of cooling and deodorization of the resultant neutralized and winterized palm olein (WPOn) under controlled conditions of temperature and high vacuum. Analytical data related to micronutrients at each process step was monitored. The RPOn thus produced had not more than 0.25% of free fatty acids (FFA) and it retained more than 80% of the carotenes, about 85% of tocols and 65% of sterols originally present in the CPO. The physico-chemical characteristics of RPOn revealed that it is nutritionally of superior quality compared to that of the commercial refined bleached deodorized (RBD) palm olein currently available in the market. The carotenes, tocols and sterols profile of RPOn by HPLC showed that they were retained in their natural forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3apalm oils 3aolein 3acarotenes 3atocopherols 3aphytosterols 3adeodorization 3aphysicochemical properties1 aBalachandran, C.1 aSamuel, T.1 aSundaresan, A.1 aArumughan, C.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2007 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.587-596dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-007-1078-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012100166300001600287500001500303520082400318592002801142650001801170650002501188650001901213650001101232650001501243650001701258650002201275650001201297653003201309653002001341653002201361653001701383653001001400653002801410700002101438700002501459773009101484856008401575852000901659655001201668IND60553849820221118005504.0180904e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRino, José,10aSTaQTool: Spot tracking and quantification tool for monitoring splicing of single pre-mRNA molecules in living cells  ap. 143-149.  a2019-12-06  aThe vast majority of human protein-coding genes contain up to 90% of non-coding sequence in the form of introns that must be removed from the primary transcripts or pre-mRNAs. Diverse forms of mRNAs encoded from a single gene are created by the differential use of splice sites and alternative splicing is rapidly evolving. Although the kinetic properties of splicing are thought to be critical for proofreading and regulatory mechanisms, tools for making direct experimental measurements of splicing rates are still limited. We recently developed a strategy that permits real-time imaging of fluorescent-labelled introns in single pre-mRNA molecules. Here we describe the software tool that we created for automatic tracking and quantification of intronic fluorescence at the site of transcription in live human cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aimage analysis 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3afluorescence 3acomputer software 3aintrons 0aFluorescence quantification 0aSingle-molecule 0aLive-cell imaging 0aRNA splicing 0agenes 0aFluorescence microscopy1 ade Jesus, Ana C.1 aCarmo-Fonseca, Maria0 tMethods.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 98 p.143-149dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009300163300001600256520154600272592002801818650002001846650001501866650000901881650002001890650001001910650003201920650002201952650001201974650001001986653001601996653002602012653001402038653001602052653000802068700001502076700001302091700001202104700001202116700001302128773012502141856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60625928520221119031450.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062592852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ke10aAutomated calculation of heart girth measurement in pigs using body surface point clouds  ap. 565-573.  aAs increasing number of studies for body measurement purposes in both the animal breeding and production stages, several papers have already evaluated the feasibility of consumer depth sensors for linear body measurement of livestock including pigs and cows. However, taking heart girth measurements is one of the major problems in livestock farming and the current studies remain under-evaluated for automated extraction of livestock girth measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel automatic measurement method for pig heart girth from body surface point clouds. Firstly, we preprocess the original point cloud data with methods including segmentation and pose normalization. Secondly, we resort to point cloud cross-section feature to detect the measuring position of the heart girth. Thirdly, the heart girth point clouds is achieved by slicing point cloud on the measuring position. Finally, the length of the heart girth is obtained by approximating the perimeter of the curve fitted by the heart girth point clouds. Experimental results show that the correct detection rate of measuring position of pig heart girth is 96.5% and the average relative error for heart girth from our method is 7.87%, which demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed measurement method. The program of automated calculation of heart girth measurement in pigs using body surface point clouds and its corresponding data set can be downloaded freely from https://github.com/LiveStockShapeAnalysis/Girth-fitting-methods to livestock industry and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal breeding 3aautomation 3acows 3adata collection 3aheart 3alivestock and meat industry 3alivestock farming 3aslicing 3aswine 0aPoint cloud 0aAutomatic measurement 0aBody size 0aHeart girth 0aPig1 aZhu, Dehai1 aGuo, Hao1 aMa, Qin1 aSu, Wei1 aSu, Yang0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 Jan., v. 156 p.565-573dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245009000207300001400297506007600311520123600387592002801623506003701651650000801688650000801696650001601704650001601720650001101736650001701747650001901764650001401783650001101797650001201808653001401820653001701834653002201851700002001873700002401893700001801917700006501935773008902000856008402089852000902173655001202182IND60553849920221207102333.0180904e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0062doi7 aPMC48084162pmcid7 a268757822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonas, Eric10aImaging viral RNA using multiply labeled tetravalent RNA imaging probes in live cells  ap. 91-98.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViruses represent an important class of pathogens that have had an enormous impact on the health of the human race. They are extraordinarily diverse; viral particles can range in size from ∼80nm to ∼10μm in length, and contain genomes with RNA or DNA strands. Regardless of their genome type, RNA species are frequently generated as a part of their replication process, and for viruses with RNA genomes, their loading into the virion represents a critical step in the creation of infectious particles. RNA imaging tools represent a powerful approach to gain insight into fundamental viral processes, including virus entry, replication, and virion assembly. Imaging viral processes in live cells is critical due to both the heterogeneity of these processes on a per cell basis, and the inherent dynamics of these processes. There are a number of methods for labeling RNA in live cells; we’ll introduce the myriad of methods and then focus on one approach for labeling viral RNA, using multiply-labeled tetravalent RNA imaging probes (MTRIPs), which do not require engineering of the target RNAs. We feel this approach is advantageous given many viral genomes may not tolerate large nucleotide insertions into their sequences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aRNA viruses 3aengineering 3agenome 3ahuman health 3aimage analysis 3apathogens 3avirion 3aviruses 0aViral RNA 0aFluorescence 0aLive cell imaging1 aVanover, Daryll1 aBlanchard, Emmeline1 aZurla, Chiara1 aSantangelo, Philip J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-03390 tMethods.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 98 p.91-98dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245008700178300001400265500000900279520151400288592002801802650001701830650002301847650001201870650001501882650001101897650001701908650000901925650002601934650001901960650000701979650002101986650000902007700002102016773020502037856009402242852000902336655001202345IND60665887320221119141345.0191028e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066588732DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000010012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeita, Liviana10aWater-Soluble Fractions of Heavy Metals during Composting of Municipal Solid Waste  ap. 73-78.  aepub  aThe need to assess the limitations of compost use on agricultural soils has created a demand for information on the availability of metals in municipal solid waste compost. This study was done to determine the water-extractable fractions of Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb and investigate changes in water-soluble organic C during the complete composting of a pile of ground municipal solid waste. Samples were collected every 3 to 5 d for 60 d. The progressive increase in total heavy metals concentrations during the composting period was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the water-extractable amounts of metals. The water-extractable fractions of Pb and Zn decreased rapidly with composting time, and a more complex behavior was observed for Cu and Cd. No relationship was found between pH and extractable fractions of all metals, even if higher amounts of Pb and Zn were extracted when the pH of the composting material was below neutrality. Total soluble C concentration of extracts rapidly decreased during the first days of composting. There was a significant correlation between water-extractable Pb (r = 0.99***) and Zn (r = 0.98**), and water-soluble C of nonhumic decomposition products. The water-extractable fraction of Cu was significantly correlated only with water-soluble humic C (r = 0.94**).¹ No correlation was found for the water-extractable fraction of Cd. The degree of stabilization reached by organic matter appears to be important in determining potential mobility of heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMSW composts 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3acomposting 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amunicipal solid waste 3aorganic matter 3apH 3awater solubility 3azinc1 aDe Nobili, Maria0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1991 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.73-78dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000010012x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011800162300001200280520200400292592002802296650002302324650001202347650003402359650001502393650002702408650001602435650000902451650001402460650001802474650002102492650002402513650002202537650003502559700001902594700001102613700001402624700001702638700001802655700002102673700001702694700001802711773010502729856008302834852000902917655001202926IND60709621220221119034206.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070962122DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02613-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Junji13aAn RTM-GWAS procedure reveals the QTL alleles and candidate genes for three yield-related traits in upland cotton  ap. 416.  aBACKGROUND: Cotton (Gossypium spp.) fiber yield is one of the key target traits, and improved fiber yield has always been thought of as an important objective in the breeding programs and production. Although some studies had been reported for the understanding of genetic bases for cotton yield-related traits, the detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the traits is still very limited. To uncover the whole-genome QTL controlling three yield-related traits in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), phenotypic traits were investigated under four planting environments and 9244 single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage disequilibrium block (SNPLDB) markers were developed in an association panel consisting of 315 accessions. RESULTS: A total of 53, 70 and 68 significant SNPLDB loci associated with boll number (BN), boll weight (BW) and lint percentage (LP), were respectively detected through a restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele genome-wide association study (RTM-GWAS) procedure in multiple environments. The haplotype/allele effects of the significant SNPLDB loci were estimated and the QTL-allele matrices were organized for offering the abbreviated genetic composition of the population. Among the significant SNPLDB loci, six of them were simultaneously identified in two or more single planting environments and were thought of as the stable SNPLDB loci. Additionally, a total of 115 genes were annotated in the nearby regions of the six stable SNPLDB loci, and 16 common potential candidate genes controlling target traits of them were predicted by two RNA-seq data. One of 16 genes (GH_D06G2161) was mainly expressed in the early ovule-development stages, and the stable SNPLDB locus (LDB_19_62926589) was mapped in its promoter region. CONCLUSION: This study identified the QTL alleles and candidate genes that could provide important insights into the genetic basis of yield-related traits in upland cotton and might facilitate breeding cotton varieties with high yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aalleles 3agenome-wide association study 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3alint cotton 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aplant biology 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative traits 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aWang, Caixiang1 aMa, Qi1 aZhang, Ai1 aShi, Chunhui1 aLiu, Juanjuan1 aZhang, Xianliang1 aYang, Delong1 aMa, Xiongfeng0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.416-416dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02613-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011000160300001400270520101100284592002801295596005901323596008901382650001401471650001901485650001801504650001601522650001101538700002101549700001401570700001701584700001701601700001601618700001401634700001401648773011301662856008301775852000901858655001201867IND60762029320221120041559.0220106e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076202932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-021-01546-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yu14aThe phenolic acids from Oplopanax elatus Nakai stems and their potential photo-damage prevention activity  ap. 39-48.  a25 phenolic acids, including four new isolates, eurylophenosides A–D (1–4) and 21 known ones (5–25) were isolated and identified from the stems of Oplopanax elatus Nakai. Among the known compounds 5–9, 11–13, 16, 18–25 were isolated from the genus for the first time; 17 was first obtained from the plant; and the NMR data of 22 was reported here first. Meanwhile, the UVB-induced photodamage model of HaCaT cells was used to study the prevent-photodamage abilities of compounds 1–2, 4–8, 11–13 and 15–25 with a nontoxic concentration at 50 μM. Moreover, a dose-dependent experiment was conducted for active compounds at the concentration of 10, 25, and 50 µM, respectively. Consequently, pretreatment with compounds 1, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24 and 25 could suppress the cell viability decreasing induced by UVB irradiation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicated that phenolic acids were one kind of material basis with prevent-photodamage activity of O. elatus.  aPublisher supplied data  a82074118cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018ZX09735002cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3aOplopanax 3acell viability 3adose response 3airradiation 3amodels1 aCheng, Dongsheng1 aHao, Mimi1 aYan, Jiejing1 aRuan, Jingya1 aHan, Lifeng1 aZhang, Yi1 aWang, Tao0 tNatural medicines.g2022 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.39-48dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-021-01546-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04612naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008400186300001800270520226900288592002802557650001802585650002002603650001602623650001502639650002002654650001702674650002102691650001502712650002902727650002102756650002602777650002802803650004302831650002002874650001302894650001702907650002102924650000902945650001402954650002402968650001902992650001603011650001003027650003003037650002003067650002403087650002203111650006703133650003403200650001803234650001103252650003703263650002803300650001103328650002103339650001803360650000903378650001603387650004903403650001603452650002103468650002403489650001603513700002603529700001903555700001603574700001803590700002303608773008503631856008103716852000903797655001203806IND4470910520221120205518.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447091052DNAL7 a226735942pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2012.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Talib A.10aEffect of low-calorie versus low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in type 2 diabetes  ap. 1016-1021.  aOBJECTIVE: Effective diabetic management requires reasonable weight control. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown the beneficial effects of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes after its long term administration. Furthermore, it favorably alters the cardiac risk factors even in hyperlipidemic obese subjects. These studies have indicated that, in addition to decreasing body weight and improving glycemia, LCKD can be effective in decreasing antidiabetic medication dosage. Similar to the LCKD, the conventional low-calorie, high nutritional value diet is also used for weight loss. The purpose of this study was to understand the beneficial effects of LCKD compared with the low-calorie diet (LCD) in improving glycemia. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-three overweight and obese participants were recruited from the Al-Shaab Clinic for a 24-wk diet intervention trial; 102 of them had type 2 diabetes. The participants were advised to choose LCD or LDKD, depending on their preference. Body weight, body mass index, changes in waist circumference, blood glucose level, changes in hemoglobin and glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, urea and creatinine were determined before and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 wk after the administration of the LCD or LCKD. The initial dose of some antidiabetic medications was decreased to half and some were discontinued at the beginning of the dietary program in the LCKD group. Dietary counseling and further medication adjustment were done on a biweekly basis. RESULTS: The LCD and LCKD had beneficial effects on all the parameters examined. Interestingly, these changes were more significant in subjects who were on the LCKD as compared with those on the LCD. Changes in the level of creatinine were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study shows the beneficial effects of a ketogenic diet over the conventional LCD in obese diabetic subjects. The ketogenic diet appears to improve glycemic control. Therefore, diabetic patients on a ketogenic diet should be under strict medical supervision because the LCKD can significantly lower blood glucose levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3adiet counseling 3adrug therapy 3aglycemic control 3ahemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow calorie diet 3alow carbohydrate diet 3alow density lipoprotein 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutritive value 3apatients 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 3auric acid 3awaist circumference 3aweight control 3aweight loss 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aCaloric Restriction 2aCreatininexblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxcomplicationsxdiet therapy. 2aDiet, Carbohydrate-Restricted 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aDiet, Ketogenic. 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxcomplicationsxdiet therapy. 2aUreaxblood 2aUric Acidxblood 2aWaist Circumference 2aWeight Loss1 aMathew, Thazhumpal C.1 aDashti, Ali A.1 aAsfar, Sami1 aAl-Zaid, Naji1 aDashti, Hussein M.0 tNutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.1016-1021dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2012.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245005300187300001600240520074500256592002801001650001001029650001001039650001201049650001001061650001001071650001201081650001201093650004801105650002401153651002001177651001101197700004401208773009601252856008101348852000901429655001201438IND60081201020221120112829.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008120102DNAL7 a250275882pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-014-1212-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunlop, Jason A.13aAn opilioacarid mite in Cretaceous Burmese amber  ap. 759-763.  aA fossil opilioacarid mite (Parasitiformes: Opilioacarida) in Burmese amber is described as ?Opilioacarus groehni sp. nov.

Our new record is not only the oldest record of Opilioacarida, but it is also one of the oldest examples of the entire Parasitiformes clade.

Pollen grains in Aptosimeae are 3-syncolporate, prolate, sometimes oblate-spheroidal in shape; mainly medium-sized, occasionally in some taxa small; exine sculpture striate, rarely with microperforations and small granules. Pollen grains in Myoporeae are 3-colpate-diorate, spheroidal, rarely oblate-spheroidal or prolate in shape; mainly medium-sized, occasionally in some taxa small; exine sculpture foveolate, microreticulate, rugulate-microperforate, rugulate, sometimes with small granules. Two major pollen types, 3-syncolporate (Aptosimeae) and 3-colpate-diorate (Myoporeae) are recognized by aperture types. Within these pollen types, eight subtypes are distinguished (three in Aptosimeae, five in Myoporeae) based on pollen size, exine sculpture and details of colpi and endoapertures. Our analysis of palynomorphological data (both published earlier and newly reported here) outlines the same main clades as those revealed by molecular phylogenetic studies, corresponding to Aptosimeae, Leucophylleae+Myoporeae and Androya, which differ by their pollen aperture types: 3-syncolporate, 3-colpate-diorate, and 3-colporate, respectively. There are also some differences in exine sculpture patterns. Thus, palynomorphological data are mainly consistent with recent results of molecular phylogenetic studies. Considerations on ancestral pollen character states in early-branching Scrophulariaceae are provided. It is assumed that the colporate type was probably ancestral in Scrophulariaceae; however, the ancestral status of the colpate type cannot be excluded as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScrophulariaceae 3aphylogeny 3apollen 0aexine sculpture 0asystematics 0aphylogeny 0apalynomorphology1 aTsymbalyuk, Zoya M.0 tWilldenowia.g2015 July, v. 45, no. 2 p.209-222dBotanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem (BGBM)wJournal:2039x1868-63977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3372/wi.45.452073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245010000209300001400309506007600323520084700399592002801246506003701274650002201311650002901333650002001362650001501382650001401397650001101411653001901422653001801441653002101459653002301480653002201503653001301525700001901538773008901557856008401646852000901730655001201739IND60553850020221207102425.0180904e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055385002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0072doi7 aPMC48481412pmcid7 a268842612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Joachim10aContinuous changes in structure mapped by manifold embedding of single-particle data in cryo-EM  ap. 61-67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCryo-electron microscopy, when combined with single-particle reconstruction, is a powerful method for studying macromolecular structure. Recent developments in detector technology have pushed the resolution into a range comparable to that of X-ray crystallography. However, cryo-EM is able to separate and thus recover the structure of each of several discrete structures present in the sample. For the more general case involving continuous structural changes, a novel technique employing manifold embedding has been recently demonstrated. Potentially, the entire work-cycle of a molecular machine may be observed as it passes through a continuum of states, and its free-energy landscape may be mapped out. This technique will be outlined and discussed in the context of its application to a large single-particle dataset of yeast ribosomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3acryo-electron microscopy 3adata collection 3alandscapes 3aribosomes 3ayeasts 0aClassification 0aHeterogeneity 0aMachine learning 0aMolecular machines 0aProtein synthesis 0aRibosome1 aOurmazd, Abbas0 tMethods.g2016 May 01, v. 100 p.61-67dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007300159300002000232520072200252592002800974650002401002650001201026650001301038650001601051650001101067650001801078650001801096650001301114650001501127650001301142650001901155650001601174700001101190700002101201700001901222700001401241700001501255700001401270700002001284773012301304856007401427852000901501655001201510IND60664916620221119033527.0190912e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066491662DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra01004c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guoqing10aGreen synthesis and catalytic performance of nanoscale CeO₂ sheets  ap. 20131-20135.  aNanoscale CeO₂ sheets were synthesized by a facile and green hydrothermal precipitation method in a strong alkali solution.

The Rietveld refinement analysis demonstrates that the synthesized CeO₂ sheets have more defect structures than nanoparticles and nanorods. The photocatalytic performance of the CeO₂ sheets was also evaluated by decomposing an azo dye, methyl orange.

This work aimed to design and develop a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application, and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing agricultural productivity. Moreover, this work represents driving agriculture through digital innovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagricultural productivity 3aautomation 3acrops 3afarms 3ahumidity 3ainformation management 3amobile telephones 3aprediction 3asoil water 3atemperature 3avegetables 3awater content 3aThailand 0aData mining 0aKnowledge discovery 0aWireless sensor networks 0aAgriculture data analysis 0aSmart farm 0aIoTs1 aBoonnam, Nathaphon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0625-45761 aKajornkasirat, Siriwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9229-84431 aLekbangpong, Narongsak1 aWanichsombat, Apirat1 aNillaor, Pichetwut1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9149-02090 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 Jan., v. 156 p.467-474dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245013500154300001800289520235700307592002802664650002702692650002602719650001902745650001102764650002302775650001602798650001702814650001902831650001402850650001202864650001302876650001502889650001402904650001402918650001602932650001202948650001302960650002202973650001702995653002603012653001603038653001303054653002503067653002103092700001603113700002003129700001703149773014303166856007303309852000903382655001203391IND60126531320221118091212.0151107e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012653132DNAL7 a10.1603/EC120422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, De-Sen10aAcute Toxicities and Sublethal Effects of Some Conventional Insecticides on Trichogramma chilonis (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)  ap. 1157-1163.  aThe acute toxicity of 10 conventional insecticides to adult of Trichogramma chilonis Ishii (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was bioassayed by membrane method, and then their sublethal effects on the parasitoid were evaluated in the laboratory. Based on sublethal concentration (LC₃₀) values at 8 h after treatment, we determined that adult T. chilonis were the most susceptible to chlorfenapyr, followed by fipronil, spinosad, avermectins, β-cypermethrin, and cartap, with lethal concentration (LC)₃₀ values of 0.3133, 0.3269, 1.5408, 3.2961, 6.1469, and 9.021 mg/liter, respectively. The field-recommended concentrations of chlorfluazuron, indoxacarb, Bacillus thuringiensis, and tebufenozide caused <30% mortality of treated adults; therefore, they were used to evaluate sublethal effects on the parasitoid. After treatment with sublethal concentration of fipronil and avermectins, the longevity of treated females (1.2 and 1.6 d) was significantly shortened and fecundity (34.7 and 1.6) was remarkably decreased; consequently, the life-table parameters (Rₒ,rₘ, λ, and T) of T. chilonis were statistically lower than those in the control. Cartap and spinosad also reduced longevity (8 and 7.9 d) and fecundity (110.77 and 117.2) of treated adults, but cartap enhanced the female percentage of F₁ offspring (61.6%), resulting a statistical higher R₀, rₘ, and λ of treated T. chilonis. In contrast, chlorfluazuron and tebufenozide increased longevity (16.4 and 15.4 d) and fecundity (248 and 256.9) of treated adults but slightly decreased the female percentage of F₁ offspring (31.4 and 38.1%). Although chlorfenapyr showed no adverse influence on longevity and fecundity, it remarkably reduced the female percentage of F₁ offspring (13.5%), leading to a lower R₀, rₘ, and λ of treated T. chilonis. Indoxacarb, B. thuringiensis, and β-cypermethrin had no obvious sublethal effects on the longevity and fecundity of treated adults. Based on these results, we consider B. thuringienesis, chlorfluazuron, indoxacarb, β-cypermethrin, and tebufenozide safe to T. chilonis, suggesting that these insecticides are compatible with this parasitoid when being used in the field. However, fipronil, chlorfenapyr, spinosad, and avermectins were very harmful to T. chilonis. Timing of application of these insecticides was critical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aTrichogramma chilonis 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aapplication timing 3aavermectins 3achlorfenapyr 3achlorfluazuron 3afecundity 3afemales 3afipronil 3aindoxacarb 3alongevity 3amortality 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3aspinosad 3asublethal effects 3atebufenozide 0aTrichogramma chilonis 0ainsecticide 0atoxicity 0alife-table parameter 0asublethal effect1 aHe, Yu-Rong1 aGuo, Xiang-Ling1 aLuo, Yong-Li0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Aug., v. 105, no. 4 p.1157-1163dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC120423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010000170300001600270520165400286592002801940650001001968650001801978650001001996650001602006650002402022650001302046650001202059650002202071650001902093650001502112650001602127650002202143651001002165700002002175700002902195700002602224773009402250856008102344852000902425655001202434IND50074065420221121063250.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007406542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-013-1114-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrascal, Luis M.10aRegional distribution patterns predict bird occurrence in Mediterranean cropland afforestations  ap. 203-211.  aPart of the abandoned cropland in Mediterranean landscapes is being subjected to afforestation dominated by pines. Here we simultaneously evaluate the effect of three categories of factors as predictors of the interspecific variation in bird habitat occupancy of fragmented afforestations, namely regional distribution, habitat preferences, and life-history traits of species. We use the “natural experiment” that highly fragmented pine plantations of central Spain represent due to the prevailing pattern of land ownership of small properties. Many species with marked habitat preferences for woodland habitats were very scarce or were never recorded in this novel habitat within a matrix of deforested agricultural landscape. Interspecific variability in occurrence was mainly explained by regional distribution patterns: occurrence was significantly and positively associated with the proportion of occupied 10 × 10 UTM km squares around the study area, habitat breadth, and population trend of species in the period 1998–2011. It was also positively associated with regional occupancy of mature and large pine plantations. Other predictor variables related to habitat preferences (for woodland, agricultural and urban habitats) or life-history traits (migratory strategy, body mass, and clutch size) were unrelated to the occurrence of species. Thus, small man-made pinewood islands funded by the Common Agrarian Policy within a landscape dominated by Mediterranean agricultural habitats only capture widespread and habitat generalist avian species with increasing population trends, not contributing to enhance truly woodland species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aafforestation 3abirds 3aclutch size 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aislands 3aissues and policy 3aland ownership 3alandscapes 3aplantations 3aurban agriculture 3aSpain1 aGalván, Ismael1 aSánchez-Oliver, Juan S.1 aRey Benayas, José M.0 tEcological research.g2014 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.203-211dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-013-1114-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016500167300001800332520173500350592002802085650001502113650002102128650001402149650001402163700001702177700001202194700002002206700005502226773012002281856008402401852000902485655001202494IND60664368120221123044326.0190910e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066436812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b011032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Nairong10aEffect of Macromonomer Branching on Structural Features and Solution Properties of Long-Subchain Hyperbranched Polymers: The Case of Four-Arm Star Macromonomers  ap. 6566-6577.  aFollowing our recent work on AB₃ macromonomer systems (Macromolecules, 2019, 52, 1065–1082), this work focuses on AB₄ systems to further explore the effect of macromonomer branching on structural features and solution properties of long-subchain hyperbranched polymers (LHPs). Compared with ABₙ macromonomers (n < 3), our results reveal that AB₄ macromonomers tend to undergo less interchain coupling but more intrachain self-cyclization during “click” polyaddition process. Via the triple-detection SEC characterization of resultant LHPs, both intrinsic viscosity ([η]) and radius of gyration (Rg) are found to be scaled to the macromonomer molar mass (Mₘₐcᵣₒ) and the total molar mass (Mₕyₚₑᵣ) as [η]=Kη,AB4MhyperνMmacroμ (ν ≈ 0.40, μ ≈ 0.25, and Kη, AB₄ ≈ 1.72 × 10–² mL/g) and Rg=HR,AB4MhyperαMmacroβ (α ≈ 0.52, β ≈ 0.20, and HR, AB₄ ≈ 1.54 × 10–³ nm). The obtained results clearly demonstrate that (i) the self-similar behavior of LHPs is almost independent of the detailed structures of the macromonomer (AB₂, AB₃, and AB₄) and (ii) the AB₄ system presents Mₘₐcᵣₒ-dependent solution properties (μ ≈ 0.25 and β ≈ 0.20), which is similar to the result for the AB₂ system but totally different from the observed Mₘₐcᵣₒ independence for the AB₃ system (μ ≈ 0 ≈ β). A combination of experimental observation and Langevin dynamics simulation of ABₙ dendrimers and LHPs unambiguously verifies our previously proposed conjecture; that is, the unique synergistic effect of segment back-folding and segment interpenetration exists only in moderately branched LHP systems but not in highly branched ABₙ LHP systems (n > 4).  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrimers 3amolecular weight 3asynergism 3aviscosity1 aUmair, Ahmad1 aZhu, Mo1 aDuan, Xiaozheng1 aLi, Lianwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1996-60460 tMacromolecules.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 52, no. 17 p.6566-6577dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b011033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245017300160520171100333592002802044650002002072650002102092650001502113650001502128650001102143650001202154650002002166650001202186650001302198650003102211650003102242650000702273650001702280650002402297650001402321650001202335650001202347650001002359650001802369700003002387700002602417700001902443700002402462700002202486700002102508773011902529856007302648852000902721655001202730IND60653593320221116163351.0190714e20190603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065359332DNAL7 a10.3390/w110611642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVõ, Anh Tuấn,10aEfficient Removal of Cr(VI) from Water by Biochar and Activated Carbon Prepared through Hydrothermal Carbonization and Pyrolysis: Adsorption-Coupled Reduction Mechanism  aThree carbonaceous porous materials (biochar and activated carbon) were developed from the Tectona grandis tree sawdust. The applied process of two-stage preparation included pre-treatment through hydrothermal carbonization at 190 &deg;C and subsequent pyrolysis at 800 &deg;C. Two chemical activating agents (K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> and ZnCl<inf>2</inf>) were used to prepared activated carbons (K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>-AC and ZnCl<inf>2</inf>-AC), respectively. They were characterized by textural property, morphology, and surface element components and applied to remove Cr(VI) from solution at various solution pH values and initial Cr(VI) concentrations. Results showed that the textural parameters (S<inf>BET</inf> and V<inf>Total</inf>) of the prepared material were 1757 m2/g and 1.027 cm3/g for Zn-Cl<inf>2</inf>-AC, 1013 m2/g and 0.418 cm3/g for K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>-AC, and 792 m2/g and 0.345 cm3/g for biochar. The adsorption process reached the highest efficiency at pH 3.0. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity indicated the decreasing order: ZnCl<inf>2</inf>-AC (127 mg/g) > K<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>-AC (103 mg/g) > biochar (83.5 mg/g). The removal mechanism of Cr(V) from solution was regarded as an adsorption-coupled reduction, namely (1) partial reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) during the adsorption process and (2) adsorption of the Cr(VI) anions through electrostatic attraction and pore filling and the reduced Cr(III) cations through complexation, C&pi;&ndash;cation interaction, cation exchange, and pore filing. Therefore, the prepared biochar and activated carbon can server as promising adsorbents to efficiently remove both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTectona grandis 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3abiochar 3acation exchange 3acations 3achromium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3apH 3aporous media 3apotassium carbonate 3apyrolysis 3asawdust 3atexture 3atrees 3azinc chloride1 aNguyễn, Văn Phượng,1 aOuakouak, Abdelkader 1 aNieva, Aileen 1 aDoma, Bonifacio  T.1 aTran, Hai  Nguyen1 aChao, Huan-Ping 0 tWater.g2019 June 03, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110611643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04584naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012700166300001100293520271400304592002803018650001403046650001503060650001503075650001803090650001703108650002503125650001103150650002003161650001303181650001103194650002403205650001703229650001903246650001703265650002703282650001203309650002003321650002503341650002403366650002203390650003803412650000903450650001703459700005903476700002003535700002103555700002803576700002303604700002003627700002303647700002503670700002203695700001803717773014303735856008303878852000903961655001203970IND60709621820221119034410.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070962182DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-020-00376-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Mette10aSupplement with whey protein hydrolysate in contrast to carbohydrate supports mitochondrial adaptations in trained runners  ap. 46.  aBACKGROUND: Protein supplementation has been suggested to augment endurance training adaptations by increasing mixed muscle and myofibrillar protein synthesis and lean body mass. However, a potential beneficial effect on mitochondrial adaptations is yet to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of consuming whey protein hydrolysate before and whey protein hydrolysate plus carbohydrate (PRO-CHO) after each exercise session during a six-week training period compared to similarly timed intake of isocaloric CHO supplements on biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis, VO₂ₘₐₓ and performance in trained runners. METHODS: Twenty-four trained runners (VO₂ₘₐₓ 60.7 ± 3.7 ml O₂ kg⁻ ¹ min¹) completed a six-week block randomized controlled intervention period, consisting of progressive running training. Subjects were randomly assigned to either PRO-CHO or CHO and matched in pairs for gender, age, VO₂ₘₐₓ, training and performance status. The PRO-CHO group ingested a protein beverage (0.3 g kg⁻ ¹) before and protein-carbohydrate beverage (0.3 g protein kg⁻ ¹ and 1 g carbohydrate kg⁻ ¹) after each exercise session. The CHO group ingested an energy matched carbohydrate beverage. Resting muscle biopsies obtained pre and post intervention were analyzed for mitochondrial specific enzyme activity and mitochondrial protein content. Subjects completed a 6 K time trial (6 K TT) and a VO₂ₘₐₓ test pre, midway (only 6 K TT) and post intervention. RESULTS: Following six weeks of endurance training Cytochrome C (Cyt C) protein content was significantly higher in the PRO-CHO group compared to the CHO group (p < 0.05), with several other mitochondrial proteins (Succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), Cytochrome C oxidase (COX-IV), Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), and Prohibitin (PHB1)) following a similar, but non-significant pattern (p = 0.07–0.14). β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activity was significantly lower after training in the CHO group (p < 0.01), but not in the PRO-CHO group (p = 0.24). VO₂ₘₐₓ and 6 K TT was significantly improved after training with no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: Intake of whey PRO hydrolysate before and whey PRO hydrolysate plus CHO after each exercise session during a six-week endurance training period may augment training effects on specific mitochondrial proteins compared to intake of iso-caloric CHO but does not alter VO₂ₘₐₓ or 6 K TT performance.

A Δ12-desaturases associated with the primary steps of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis were successfully cloned from oil palm and their functions identified. The open reading frames (ORFs) of egFAD2 (GenBank accession: KT023602) consisted of 1176bp and code for 391 amino acids. Their deduced polypeptides showed 75–93% identity to microsomal Δ12-desaturases from other higher plants, and each contained the three histidine clusters typical of the catalytic domains of such enzymes. RT-PCR experiment indicated that the egFAD2 gene exhibited the highest accumulation in the mesocarp of fruits at 120–140 DAP (i.e. the fourth period of fruit development) and, despite having different expression levels, the other four stages were at significantly lower levels compared with the fourth stage. Plasmid pYES2-egFAD2 was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1 using lithium acetate method for expression under the induction of galactose. Yeast cells transformed with plasmid constructs containing egFAD12 produced an appreciable amount of linoleic acids (18:2Δ⁹,¹²), not normally present in wild-type yeast cells, indicating that the genes encoded functional Δ12-desaturase enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3aactive sites 3abiosynthesis 3acrops 3afruiting 3agalactose 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahistidine 3alinoleic acid 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amesocarp 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3apolypeptides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3ayeasts 0aALA 0aCTAB 0aDAP 0aEFAs 0aER 0aFAD2 0aFAMEs 0aGC–MS 0aGLA 0aLA 0aLC-PUFA 0aRACE 0aRT–PCR 0aOil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) 0aΔ12 fatty acid desaturase 0aFunction analysis 0aBiosynthesis of linoleic acid 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aGao, Lingchao1 aYu, Xiaoping1 aCheng, Yuk-shing,1 aLi, Dongdong1 aWang, Xinguang0 tGene.g2016 Oct. 10, v. 591, no. 1 p.21-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245008700156300001800243520123100261592002801492650002401520650001401544650000901558650001001567650001301577650001701590650001001607650002501617650002001642650002901662650002101691650001601712653002401728653002401752653001601776653001701792653001901809700001601828773014301844856007301987852000902060655001202069IND60126531620221118093911.0151107e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012653162DNAL7 a10.1603/EC120572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Qing-Lei10aInfluence of Nutrition on Male Development and Reproduction in Tribolium castaneum  ap. 1471-1476.  aTribolium beetles have evolved over several thousand years to colonize and exploit various food products that vary widely in their nutritional quality. Here Tribolium castaneum was used as a model organism to explore the effect of nutritional quality on male development and reproduction. The results showed, when tested across different qualities of nutritional diets, Tribolium males developed faster and their body size was larger on a high-quality diet, and there were significant correlations between male developmental traits. However, Tribolium males fed different nutritional diets did not show significant variation in olfactory attractiveness, mating rate, insemination rate, sperm defense (P1), sperm offense (P2), and reproductive success within a population context (RSPC). Moreover, there was no significant correlation of male reproductive performances except RSPC with developmental traits, and except for P2 and RSPC, no significant correlations between male reproductive performances. Therefore, although male developmental performance was significantly influenced by diet quality, reproductive performance was not. We discussed these findings and their sexual selection implications in light of its habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium castaneum 3abody size 3adiet 3afoods 3ahabitats 3ainsemination 3amales 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritive value 3areproductive performance 3asexual selection 3aspermatozoa 0aTribolium castaneum 0anutritional quality 0adevelopment 0areproduction 0astored product1 aCheng, Chao0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Aug., v. 105, no. 4 p.1471-1476dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC120573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171300001400291500001500305520139100320592002801711650001601739650002601755650002701781650002001808650001701828650001301845650001601858650002101874653001701895653001801912700002001930700002301950700001801973700001901991700002202010700002002032773007802052856008302130990002302213852000902236655001202245IND60094661220221119183600.0141104e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009466122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujioka, Takahiro10aN-nitrosamine rejection by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes: The importance of membrane characteristics  ap. 67-75.  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of membrane characteristics on the rejection of eight N-nitrosamines was investigated using one nanofiltration (NF), one seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and six low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes. The rejection of the two lowest molecular weight N-nitrosamines, namely N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), varied in the range from 8–82% to 23–94%, respectively. In general, the rejection of NDMA and NMEA increased with decreasing membrane permeability. The impact of membrane characteristics became less important for higher molecular weight N-nitrosamines. Among the four LPRO membranes (i.e. ESPA2, LFC3, TFC-HR and 70LW) that are commonly used for water reclamation applications, similar rejections were obtained for NDMA (37–52%) and NMEA (69–82%). In addition, rejection values of NDMA and NMEA among two LPRO membranes (i.e. ESPA2 and 70LW) were almost identical when compared under variable permeate flux and feed temperature conditions. However, it is noteworthy that the ESPAB membrane could achieve very high rejection of NDMA (as high as 71%) despite having a similar permeability to the LPRO membranes. Results reported here suggest that membrane characteristics associated with permeability such as the pore size and thickness of the active skin layer can be a key factor determining N-nitrosamine rejection.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater reuse 3amembrane permeability 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3areverse osmosis 3adesalination 3aseawater 3atemperature 3amolecular weight 0anitrosamines 0aN-nitrosamine1 aKhan, Stuart J.1 aMcDonald, James A.1 aRoux, Annalie1 aPoussade, Yvan1 aDrewes, Jörg E.,1 aNghiem, Long D.0 tDesalination.g2013 May 1, v. 316 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010600153300002000259520096600279592002801245650002801273650002501301650002101326650001701347650001501364650001201379650002201391650001501413650003301428700001201461700001601473773012301489856007401612852000901686655001201695IND60664917120221117194551.0190912e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066491712DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra01014k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Han10aAlkaline quaternary ammonium hydroxides and their polymer electrolytes for electrochemical capacitors  ap. 21332-21339.  aAqueous quaternary ammonium hydroxides were investigated as electrolytes for electrochemical capacitors (ECs) in both liquid and polymer-gel forms. Alkaline polymer electrolytes, composed of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in different ratios, were developed and characterized. An optimized TEAOH–PVA electrolyte was developed and compared to KOH–PVA under controlled and ambient conditions. The stability of the polymer electrolytes and the solid ECs were characterized using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. While both polymer electrolyte-based ECs demonstrated high rate capability in pristine condition, the TEAOH-based solid EC device showed a much better shelf life than the KOH-based device. This is likely due to the water retention capability of TEAOH, which promoted the amphorous phase and ion mobility, contributing to higher ionic conductivity and better environmental stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ahydroxides 3aliquids 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ashelf life 3atetraethylammonium compounds1 aLi, Jak1 aLian, Keryn0 tRSC advances.g2014 May 15, v. 4, no. 41 p.21332-21339dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra01014k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245005800175300001200233520166000245592002801905596004701933650002401980650001002004650001302014650002102027650000902048650001902057650001002076650002402086650002302110650000902133650002702142650001902169650002402188650001602212700002502228700002202253700002002275700002502295700001702320700002002337700002002357700002502377700002602402700002202428700002102450700002502471700001802496700002502514700002202539700002202561700002202583700001802605773010302623856008302726852000902809655001202818IND60709622220221119034326.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070962222DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-020-02081-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowski, Jordan P.14aThe Tug1 lncRNA locus is essential for male fertility  ap. 237.  aBACKGROUND: Several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to function as components of molecular machines that play fundamental roles in biology. While the number of annotated lncRNAs in mammalian genomes has greatly expanded, studying lncRNA function has been a challenge due to their diverse biological roles and because lncRNA loci can contain multiple molecular modes that may exert function. RESULTS: We previously generated and characterized a cohort of 20 lncRNA loci knockout mice. Here, we extend this initial study and provide a more detailed analysis of the highly conserved lncRNA locus, taurine-upregulated gene 1 (Tug1). We report that Tug1-knockout male mice are sterile with underlying defects including a low number of sperm and abnormal sperm morphology. Because lncRNA loci can contain multiple modes of action, we wanted to determine which, if any, potential elements contained in the Tug1 genomic region have any activity. Using engineered mouse models and cell-based assays, we provide evidence that the Tug1 locus harbors two distinct noncoding regulatory activities, as a cis-DNA repressor that regulates neighboring genes and as a lncRNA that can regulate genes by a trans-based function. We also show that Tug1 contains an evolutionary conserved open reading frame that when overexpressed produces a stable protein which impacts mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting a potential third coding function. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an essential role for the Tug1 locus in male fertility and uncover evidence for distinct molecular modes in the Tug1 locus, thus highlighting the complexity present at lncRNA loci.  aPublisher supplied data  aP01GM099117cBlavatnik Accelerator Program 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenomics 3aknockout mutants 3aloci 3amale fertility 3amales 3amechanism of action 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3anon-coding RNA 3aopen reading frames 3aspermatozoa1 aDumbović, Gabrijela1 aWatson, Audrey R.1 aHwang, Taeyoung1 aJacobs-Palmer, Emily1 aChang, Nydia1 aMuch, Christian1 aTurner, Kyle M.1 aKirkby, Christopher,1 aRubinstein, Nimrod D.1 aGroff, Abigail F.1 aLiapis, Steve C.1 aGerhardinger, Chiara1 aBester, Assaf1 aPandolfi, Pier Paolo1 aClohessy, John G.1 aHoekstra, Hopi E.1 aSauvageau, Martin1 aRinn, John L.0 tGenome biology.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.237-237dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02081-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008000170300001300250520126900263592002801532650002501560650002101585650001201606650001501618650001801633650001501651650001601666650001701682650001801699650001901717650001301736650001801749700002001767700001801787700001701805773007701822856008301899990002301982852000902005655001202014IND60094661420221119183601.0141104e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009466142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, F. Xavier10aStudy on the removal of biodegradable NOM from seawater using biofiltration  ap. 8-16.  aDespite the low biodegradability of seawater NOM, problems associated with biofouling are common in facilities that handle seawater. In this work, a fixed-film aerobic biofilter is proposed as an effective unit for preventing biofouling in such facilities. A packed-bed biofilter with an EBCT=6–11min was employed. The results demonstrated that the DOC is reduced by 6% and the BOD₇ is reduced up to 15%. The LC-OCD analysis revealed that biofiltration abates the LMW neutrals and biopolymer fractions by 33 and 17%, respectively. However, the fractionation with UF membrane showed that the biofiltration process is able to degrade the more biodegradable compounds that have molecular weights that are greater than 1kDa and compounds with molecular weights of less than 1kDa. After biofiltration, the biological activity measured in terms of ATP removal was reduced by 60%. Finally, a test to evaluate the biofilm formation capacity of a water sample revealed reductions of ~94% when comparing biofiltered and non-biofiltered seawater. Therefore, a fixed-film aerobic biofiltration process could be a useful treatment for the removal of biodegradable organic matter from seawater and for improving the water quality in terms of less biofilm formation capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradability 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3abiofouling 3abiopolymers 3adesalination 3afractionation 3aorganic matter 3aseawater 3awater quality1 aRudé, Elisabet1 aLlorens, Joan1 aBaig, Sylvie0 tDesalination.g2013 May 1, v. 316 p.8-16dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007700170300001600247500001900263520079700282592002801079650001201107650001401119650001601133650001001149650001401159650001801173650001101191653002001202653001301222653002001235653002201255653002101277700002101298700002401319773010101343856008601444852000901530655001201539IND60695155720221119042257.0200516e20010301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069515572DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2001.120631632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuh, Sung-Oui14aThe status of Endomyces scopularum—a filamentous fungus and two yeasts  ap. 317-322.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGiven the clouded history of species of Endomyces and the Endomycetales, we determined partial sequences of nuclear small and large subunits of the ribosomal RNA gene for three cultures of Endomyces scopularum, a parasitic fungus of agaric basidiocarps, in order to clarify the phylogenetic position of the species within the ascomycetes.

Of the many different locations for fluorination, one of the least studied is the conjugated linker which connects the donor and acceptor moieties; further, all existing reports primarily explore monofluorinated thiophene units. Herein, we synthesize and compare two conjugated polymers, HTAZ and dFT-HTAZ, which have different thiophene linkers. In HTAZ, a bare thiophene unit connects the donor and acceptor moieties, while dFT-HTAZ utilizes difluorinated thiophene (dFT) linkers. These polymers serve as the model system to explore the impact of dFT units in OSCs; additionally, this is the first publication to investigate polymers containing dFT units paired with non-fullerene acceptors. Compared to HTAZ, the incorporation of the dFT units maintained the optical properties while lowering the energy levels by ∼0.4 eV, which allowed for a much improved Vₒc value of ∼1 V. Importantly, when compared with the appropriate non-fullerene acceptor, dFT-HTAZ:ITIC-Th1 blends reached an efficiency of ∼10%, which is nearly 3× that of the nonfluorinated HTAZ. As most OSC polymers have thiophene linkers, using dFT units could serve as a proficient method to increase OSC performance in many polymer systems, especially those that do not have locations for functionalization on the acceptor moiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3apolymers 3asolar cells 3athiophene1 aYan, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4122-74661 aPeng, Zhengxing1 aDai, Shuixing1 aZhan, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1006-33421 aAde, Harald1 aYou, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0354-19480 tMacromolecules.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 52, no. 17 p.6523-6532dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b011683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04170naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245009300179300001400272520227300286592002802559650001902587650001702606650001902623650001802642650001402660650002602674650002302700650002102723650001202744650001802756650001202774650001902786650001002805650001602815650002902831650001502860650001302875650002502888650001402913650001802927650001002945650001302955650001102968650002402979650000903003650002703012650001403039650001203053651001103065653003303076653002503109653002003134653001303154700003203167700003203199700002303231700002403254700002103278773010303299856008503402852000903487655001203496IND60559854520221116153856.0190408e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055985452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva Chaves, Josimar10aStylosanthes spp. from Amazon savanna harbour diverse and potentially effective rhizobia  ap. 54-61.  aThe Stylosanthes genus stands out among the forage legume species well-adapted to the soil and climatic conditions of tropical regions. This legume establishes a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which can be used to improve the quality of pastures. However, there are few studies about the diversity and symbiotic efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in Stylosanthes plants. Therefore, the objective was to isolate, characterize and evaluate the symbiotic efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in symbiosis with Stylosanthes in savanna areas in Roraima, Brazil. Plants with nodules were collected at 6 sites, including cultivated and native areas of the savanna. Shoots of Stylosanthes with flowers were collected to prepare exsiccatae for species identification. The nodules were surface-sterilized with 5% sodium hypochlorite after the roots were washed, and isolation and morphological characterization were performed in 79 culture medium. The isolates were selected according to their morphology, the representativeness of each collection site and the associated Stylosanthes species. Representative isolates were tested for nodulation in cowpea plants, and the isolates able to nodulate the gene 16S rRNA was sequenced. The symbiotic efficiency was evaluated in Stylosanthes capitata cv. Lavradeiro in greenhouse conditions for 65days. A total of 504 nodules were collected, from which 258 pure isolates were obtained from 5 species of Stylosanthes (S. capitata, S. scabra, S. gracilis, S. humilis and S. angustifolia). The isolates showed significant phenotypic diversity, and 89 isolates were selected. Thirty-one isolates were confirmed to be nodulating bacteria in cowpea plants. These isolates were identified as α-Proteobacteria, with Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium genera, and β-Proteobacteria, with Burkholderia and Herbaspirillum genera. When evaluated in S. capitata, treatment with two Bradyrhizobium isolates, ERR 1178 and ERR 942, resulted in significant production of plant biomass production and N accumulation. These results indicated that a large diversity of α-Proteobacteria and β-Proteobacteria are able to nodulate Stylosanthes spp. and some isolates have potential for testing under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aBurkholderia 3aHerbaspirillum 3aMesorhizobium 3aRhizobium 3aStylosanthes capitata 3abiomass production 3aclimatic factors 3acowpeas 3aculture media 3aflowers 3aforage legumes 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anodulation 3apastures 3aphenotypic variation 3aphytomass 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3asavannas 3ashoots 3asodium hypochlorite 3asoil 3aspecies identification 3asymbiosis 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aBiological nitrogen fixation 0aSymbiotic efficiency 0aTropical forage 0a16S rRNA1 aBaraúna, Alexandre Cardoso1 aMosqueira, Cátia Aparecida1 aGianluppi, Vicente1 aZilli, Jerri Édson1 ada Silva, Krisle0 tApplied soil ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 108 p.54-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009900175506010400274506007600378520145500454592002801909506003701937650002901974650003002003650001302033650001402046650001302060650001102073650002102084650001502105650001602120650000902136650001302145650002402158650001202182650001602194650002502210650002602235650001802261653002002279653001602299653003002315653002002345653001902365653003202384700002102416700002402437773011702461856008702578852000902665655001202674IND60780523520221207061944.0220914e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078052352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Mitchell P.10aRepurposing Fischer-Tropsch and natural gas as bridging technologies for the energy revolution  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImmediate and widespread changes in energy generation and use are critical to safeguard our future on this planet. However, while the necessity of renewable electricity generation is clear, the aviation, transport and mobility, chemical and material sectors are challenging to fully electrify. The age-old Fischer-Tropsch process and natural gas industry could be the bridging solution needed to accelerate the energy revolution in these sectors – temporarily powering obsolete vehicles, acting as renewable energy’s battery, supporting expansion of hydrogen fuel cell technologies and the agricultural and waste sectors as they struggle to keep up with a full switch to biofuels. Natural gas can be converted into hydrogen, synthetic natural gas, or heat during periods of low electricity demand and converted back to electricity again when needed. Moving methane through existing networks and converting it to hydrogen on-site at tanking stations also overcomes hydrogen distribution, storage problems and infrastructure deficiencies. Useful co-products include carbon nanotubes, a valuable engineering material, that offset emissions in the carbon nanotube and black industries. Finally, excess carbon can be converted back into syngas if desired. This flexibility and the compatibility of natural gas with both existing and future technologies provides a unique opportunity to rapidly decarbonise sectors struggling with complex requirements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aadministrative management 3aaviation 3abatteries 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoproducts 3aelectricity 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen fuel cells 3amethane 3anatural gas 3aoil and gas industry 3arenewable electricity 3asynthesis gas 0aFischer-Tropsch 0aNatural gas 0aDecarbonised liquid fuels 0aSector coupling 0aEnergy storage 0aCarbon nanotube co-products1 aKrexner, Theresa1 aBismarck, Alexander0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.115882-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04552naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170300001600275500001500291520226600306592002802572650002402600650001502624650001002639650002602649650002502675650002102700650000902721650002702730650002402757650001102781650000902792650002002801650002602821650002502847650002102872650001802893650001702911650000902928650001102937650001202948650002302960650001802983650002003001650002503021650001303046650002403059650001603083650001203099651001103111653001103122653003503133653002003168653001903188700002103207700001903228700002003247700002203267700001703289700002103306700006203327700005903389700003103448700006203479700002403541700001803565773010503583856008503688852000903773655001203782IND60559854620221116154123.0190408e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055985462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNivelle, Elodie10aFunctional response of soil microbial communities to tillage, cover crops and nitrogen fertilization  ap. 147-155.  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural practices such as tillage, cover crops, and nitrogen (N) fertilization affect physico-chemical and biological soil parameters. However, these factors were often studied separately and their combined effects remain unclear, especially with respect to soil microbial functional diversity and carbon (C) and N content. Thereafter, we aim to assess the links between cropping systems and functional response of microbial communities by using a large range of soil chemical and biological measurements. A 5-yr field experiment was conducted in Northern France using a combination of three factors: i) no-till (NT) vs. conventional tillage (CT); ii) with or without winter cover crops (bare fallow; cover crops with a low prevalence of legumes; cover crop with a high prevalence of legumes); and iii) with or without N fertilization.C and N inputs from cover crops and crop residues, C and N content, enzyme activities, and microbial functional diversity in the topsoil (0–10cm) were measured over an industrial crop rotation: wheat, pea, corn, wheat, flax. No-till combined with any of the cover crops was characterized by increased total soil organic C and N contents by more than 20% between 2010 and 2015. Dehydrogenase and urease activities were significantly greatest under NT, irrespective of the presence of cover crops. Cover crops without N fertilization under no-till led to higher microbial functional activity (faster carbohydrate and phenolic compound degradation) and diversity. Bare fallow had lower soil microbial functional diversity and C and N contents compared with soil under NT and cover crops. On the other hand, NT associated with cover crops allowed to maintain the soil in both C and N, and to promote microbial activities without N fertilization. In conclusion, winter cover crops and/or NT are sustainable agricultural practices resulting in a greater soil quality index. These results demonstrate that NT and use of standard cover crops or cover crops with legumes for 5 years under a low biomass return in industrial crop production have a positive effect on: i) upper soil C content and microbial enzymes, irrespective of N fertilization regime; ii) soil microbial functional diversity in the absence of N fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3ano-tillage 3awheat 3afield experimentation 3afunctional diversity 3anitrogen content 3apeas 3afertilizer application 3asoil microorganisms 3aurease 3aflax 3acrop production 3amicrobial communities 3aconventional tillage 3aindustrial crops 3acrop residues 3asoil quality 3acorn 3afallow 3abiomass 3amicrobial activity 3acrop rotation 3aenzyme activity 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen 3afertilizer analysis 3acover crops 3atopsoil 3aFrance 0acarbon 0aMicrobial functional responses 0aSoil management 0aCarbon content1 aVerzeaux, Julien1 aHabbib, Hazzar1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1 aDecocq, Guillaume1 aRoger, David1 aLacoux, Jérôme1 aDuclercq, Jérôme1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4419-03071 aSpicher, Fabien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9999-955X1 aNava-Saucedo, Jose-Edmundo1 aCatterou, Manuella1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5125-74101 aDubois, Frédéric,1 aTetu, Thierry0 tApplied soil ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 108 p.147-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009100158300001600249500000900265520169200274592002801966650001601994650001302010650001202023650001102035650001302046650002502059650001302084650001902097650000902116650001302125650001502138650002302153650000902176650001602185650001802201650001202219650001402231650001902245700001702264700002502281773019102306856007702497852000902574655001202583IND60665888420221119141023.0191028e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066588842DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.01012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlg, Katrin10aColloidal and Dissolved Phosphorus in Sandy Soils as Affected by Phosphorus Saturation  ap. 926-935.  aepub  aFertilization exceeding crop requirements causes an accumulation of phosphorus (P) in soils, which might increase concentrations of dissolved and colloidal P in drainage. We sampled soils classified as Typic Haplorthods from four fertilization experiments to test (i) whether increasing degrees of phosphorus saturation (DPS) increase concentrations of dissolved and colloidal P, and (ii) if critical DPS levels can be defined for P release from these soils. Oxalate-extractable concentrations of P, iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) were quantified to characterize DPS. Turbidity, zeta potential, dissolved P, and colloidal P, Fe, Al, and carbon (C) concentrations were determined in water and KCl extracts. While concentrations of dissolved P decreased with increasing depth, concentrations of water-extractable colloidal P remained constant. In topsoils 28 ± 17% and in subsoils 94 ± 8% of water-extractable P was bound to colloids. Concentrations of dissolved P increased sharply for DPS > 0.1. Colloidal P concentrations increased with increasing DPS because of an additional mobilization of colloids and due to an increase of the colloids P contents. In addition to DPS, ionic strength and Ca²⁺ affected the release of colloidal P. Hence, using KCl for extraction improved the relationship between DPS and colloidal P compared with water extraction. Accumulation of P in soils increases not only concentrations of dissolved P but also the risk of colloidal P mobilization. Leaching of colloidal P is potentially important for inputs of P into water bodies because colloidal P as the dominant water-extractable P fraction in subsoils was released from soils with relatively low DPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplorthods 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acolloids 3adissolved phosphorus 3adrainage 3aionic strength 3airon 3aleaching 3aphosphorus 3apotassium chloride 3arisk 3asandy soils 3asurface water 3atopsoil 3aturbidity 3azeta potential1 aSiemens, Jan1 aKaupenjohann, Martin0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 May, v. 34, no. 3 p.926-935dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.01013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245005500173300001400228520169500242592002801937650001501965650004201980650001802022650001902040650001802059650001702077650001802094650001702112650001202129653001802141653000802159653003102167653000802198653001702206700002402223773009102247856008402338852000902422655001202431IND60553851020221118005915.0180904e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055385102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaringhalam, Maryam10aPseudouridylation meets next-generation sequencing  ap. 63-72.  aThe isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ), known as pseudouridylation, is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification of stable RNAs. Due to technical limitations in pseudouridine detection methods, studies on pseudouridylation have historically focused on ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, and spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs, where Ψs play a critical role in RNA biogenesis and function. Recently, however, a series of deep sequencing methods—Pseudo-seq, Ψ-seq, PSI-seq, and CeU-seq—has been published to map Ψ positions across the entire transcriptome with single nucleotide resolution. These data have greatly expanded the catalogue of pseudouridylated transcripts, which include messenger RNAs and noncoding RNAs. Furthermore, these methods have revealed conditionally-dependent sites of pseudouridylation that appear in response to cellular stress, suggesting that pseudouridylation may play a role in dynamically modulating RNA function. Collectively, these methods have opened the door to further study of the biological relevance of naturally occurring Ψs. However, an in-depth comparison of these techniques and their results has not yet been undertaken despite all four methods relying on the same basic principle: Ψ detection through selective chemical labeling by the carbodiimide known as CMC. In this article, we will outline the currently available high-throughput Ψ-detection methods and present a comparative analysis of their results. We will then discuss the merits and limitations of these approaches, including those inherent in CMC conjugation, and their potential to further elucidate the function of this ubiquitous and dynamic modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aisomerization 3anon-coding RNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aspliceosomes 3atranscriptome 3atransfer RNA 3auridine 0aPseudouridine 0aRNA 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aRNA 0aModification1 aPapavasiliou, Nina,0 tMethods.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 107 p.63-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013600207300001200343520235600355592002802711650001302739650000902752650001202761650001402773650001102787650002102798650001202819650001002831650000902841651001102850700002102861700002202882700002202904700002302926700001802949700001602967700001902983700001903002773011203021856008303133852000903216655001203225IND60762030920221122151239.0220318e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076203092DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-021-01096-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Rodolphe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4865-927210aModelling bark volume for six commercially important tree species in France: assessment of models and application at regional scale  ap. 104.  aKEY MESSAGE : A set of models of bark thickness at breast height and bark volume are now available for six species in France. A common model suitable for predicting bark volume was proposed for all species. A small but significant altitude effect on bark thickness at breast height was detected for three species. CONTEXT : The growing demand for wood energy and bio-molecules requires a thorough evaluation of forest biomass, particularly bark. AIMS : The objective of this study is to have statistical models of bark volumes for the six main forest species present in North-Eastern France and to be able to estimate regional bark biomasses and quantities of chemical extractives at regional scale. METHODS : A large databank gathering bark thickness measured at different heights in France was used for selecting literature or new alternative models of tree bark volume. These models were applied to the available forest inventory data from North-Eastern France to estimate the regional bark volume. Secondly, by multiplying these volumes by basic density data and extractive content recently obtained, bark biomasses and extractives quantities were deduced. RESULTS : The first results consist in a set of species-specific models of bark thickness at breast height with R² around 0.70 and a relative RMSE around 30% which is an improvement of 0.1 for R² and of 1–2% for relative RMSE depending on the species compared to the best models from the literature. The second results consist in a set of species-specific models of tree bark volumes with R² of 0.90 and a relative RMSE which varies between 22% when bark thickness at breast height is included and 40% when it is predicted. A significant relationship between bark thickness at breast height and altitude was also observed. The bark resources of Grand Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regions were estimated at 558 000 m³/year and 611 000 m³/year respectively representing between 5.5% and 15% of the stem volume depending on the species. The propagation of the measurement error of bark gauge was estimated at 5% for model of bark thickness at breast height and 24% for bark volume model. CONCLUSION : These results constitute an important contribution for a better knowledge of the bark resource at a regional scale and may help to optimise bark valuation by the forest-wood sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abark 3abiomass 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3atrees 3awood 3aFrance1 aBillard, Antoine1 aMothe, Frédéric1 aLonguetaud, Fleur1 aHouballah, Mojtaba1 aBouvet, Alain1 aCuny, Henri1 aColin, Antoine1 aColin, Francis0 tAnnals of forest science.g2021 Dec., v. 78, no. 4 p.104-104dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-021-01096-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300002000301520123200321592002801553650002201581650001701603650001501620650001401635650002801649650002101677650001501698650001101713650002201724650002001746650001801766700002901784700001901813700002601832700002601858773012301884856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60664917920221119033832.0190912e20140502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066491792DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra01029a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhsani, Ali10aElectrochemical and DFT study on the inhibition of 316L stainless steel corrosion in acidic medium by 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-amino-1H-tetrazole  ap. 20031-20037.  a1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-amino-1H-tetrazole was synthesized and its inhibiting action on the corrosion of 316L stainless steel (SS) in sulfuric acid was investigated by means of potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the potentiodynamic polarization measurements the values of βc had small changes with increasing inhibitor concentration, which indicated that the 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-amino-1H-tetrazole was adsorbed on the metal surface and the addition of the inhibitor hindered the acid attack on the SS electrode. The shift in the anodic Tafel slope βₐ might be attributed to the modification of the anodic dissolution process due to the inhibitor module adsorption on the active sites. The results of the investigation show that the newly synthesized compound shows excellent inhibition efficiencies against the corrosion of SS in acidic solution. The adsorption of 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-amino-1H-tetrazole onto the SS surface followed the Langmuir adsorption model with the free energy of adsorption ΔG0ads of −9.44 kJ mol⁻¹. Quantum chemical calculations were employed to give further insight into the mechanism of inhibition action of 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-amino-1H-tetrazole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics 3astainless steel 3asulfuric acid1 aMahjani, Mohammad Ghasem1 aMoshrefi, Reza1 aMostaanzadeh, Hossein1 aShayeh, Javad Shabani0 tRSC advances.g2014 May 02, v. 4, no. 38 p.20031-20037dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra01029a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245017000163300001600333520146900349592002801818650003701846650001501883650002101898650001801919650001701937650001901954650001901973650001301992650001602005650003302021650002002054700001902074700001702093773008002110856008302190990002302273852000902296655001202305IND60094662020221119182341.0141104e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009466202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2013.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang14aThe preparation of antifouling ultrafiltration membrane by surface grafting zwitterionic polymer onto poly(arylene ether sulfone) containing hydroxyl groups membrane  ap. 127-136.  aThis work describes the polymerization of a zwitterionic polymer, poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) [poly(MPC)] onto the poly(arylene ether sulfone) containing hydroxyl groups (PES-OH) membrane via redox graft polymerization using ceric (IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) as initiator. Due to the presence of the activated hydroxyl groups which were used for the immobilization of MPC monomer, the grafting process is facile and effective which avoid the complex and unfavorable pretreatment process and/or hydroxylated treatment. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the chemical compositions and surface morphologies of the unmodified (PES-OH) and modified membrane, respectively. Static water contact angle measurement indicated that the introduction of poly(MPC) promoted remarkably the surface hydrophilicity of the PES-OH membrane. The cycle ultrafiltration experiments for protein solution revealed that nonspecific protein adsorption, especially irreversible protein adsorption, for the zwitterionic membrane was significantly reduced, suggesting superior antifouling performance. This work not only introduces a modification approach to obtain a PES-OH membrane grafting hydrophilic poly(MPC) chains, but also gives the zwitterionic membrane a long time life and excellent ultrafiltration performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aammonium nitrate 3acontact angle 3adesalination 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrafiltration1 aZhang, Shuling1 aWang, Guibin0 tDesalination.g2013 May 1, v. 316 p.127-136dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012200170300001400292520201400306592002802320650002702348650001102375650001102386650002602397650002202423650001702445650002302462650001902485650001802504650001102522650002002533650001702553650001502570650001202585650001302597650002602610651001102636653001102647653001602658653001702674653002402691653001502715653001702730700002402747700002002771700001802791700001902809700002102828773010302849856008502952852000903037655001203046IND60559854920221116153947.0190408e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055985492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisch, Anita C.10aFirst evidence that the sodium ecosystem respiration (SER) hypothesis may also hold for a coastal tropical rainforest  ap. 92-95.  aThe sodium (Na) respiration hypothesis (SER) states that low Na availability limits the activity and density of soil organisms and therefore plays an important role in decomposition processes of tropical forest soils. Support for this hypothesis was found in several studies reporting higher decomposition rates attributed to higher densities of macro-invertebrates after sodium chloride (NaCl) additions. However, it was also suggested that high doses of NaCl might make organic material unpalatable or even toxic for microbes. Most of these studies were conducted in inland tropical rainforests, where atmospheric deposition of Na is low compared to coastal areas and therefore Na limitation may be more severe. We assessed how treating standardized organic material with different NaCl concentrations affects decomposition rates in a coastal primary rainforest on the island of Borneo. For this purpose, we established a multi-factorial short-term (7 days) decomposition experiment in which we incubated cotton cloths (standard organic material). The cloths were treated with 0%, 0.5%, 1%. 2.5% or 5% NaCl solutions and either provided access for all soil decomposer communities (no mesh) or excluded macro-invertebrates >2mm (metal mesh). The cloths were placed in the mineral soil and on top of the litter layer. We found higher decomposition in the mineral soil compared to the top of the litter layer. Decomposition rates of cloths treated with 5% NaCl were significantly higher compared to all other cloths, which provides first evidence that the SER might also hold for coastal systems. In addition, we found higher decomposition for the meshed than the non-meshed cloths suggesting that macro-invertebrates either “grazed” on the smaller invertebrates/microbes or that the smaller soil fauna was more efficient in exploiting NaCl when macro-invertebrates were absent. Overall our findings suggest that Na may also control the activity of soil organisms in coastal tropical forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3acoasts 3acotton 3aecosystem respiration 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicroorganisms 3amineral soils 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil density 3asoil fauna 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3atropical rain forests 3aBorneo 0aBorneo 0aCompetition 0aCotton cloth 0aMacro-invertebrates 0aSoil fauna 0aPalatability1 aZimmermann, Stephan1 aŌhashi, Mizue,1 aFinér, Leena1 aKho, Lip Khoon1 aSchütz, Martin,0 tApplied soil ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 108 p.92-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008200171300001600253520178100269592002802050650001002078650001402088650001202102650001502114650001102129650001402140650001402154650002202168650001602190650001602206700001702222773009402239856004802333852000902381655001202390IND50074065520221121041725.0140425e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007406552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-013-1116-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKipling, Richard P.13aAn investigation of temporal flowering segregation in species-rich grasslands  ap. 213-224.  aProcesses such as competition and facilitation are believed to be important in defining pollination niches in species-rich plant communities. Species with similar floral phenotypes are expected to flower together where this facilitates pollination, while differences in floral phenology are expected if such flowers compete for pollinators. These expectations were tested at seven sites by comparing the observed co-flowering of plants with similar floral phenotypes with null model outcomes. Phenotypic classifications were evaluated using observations of plant–pollinator interactions. Pollinator guilds differed in the number of visits made to flowers in different floral colour and shape categories, indicating that such categories were ecologically relevant. For species with complex flowers, each floral category contained few species, so that the observed low occurrence of co-flowering could be explained by chance. In contrast, within phenotypic categories species with simple flowers bloomed together more than expected at three sites, but these overlaps could be explained by family membership. Most species with complex flowers could be segregated into unique pollination niches by broad floral colour and shape categories, so that there was little opportunity for competition between flowers within such categories. Species with simple floral phenotypes were less well defined by floral phenotype and phenology. Historical sorting may explain differences between complex flowers, while co-flowering between species with simple flowers requires further investigation. Differences found between species with simple and complex flowers suggest that levels of phenotypic specialisation should be taken into account in community level studies of pollination systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agrasslands 3aniches 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aplant communities 3apollination 3apollinators1 aWarren, John0 tEcological research.g2014 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.213-224dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-013-1116-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011900171300001300290520209500303592002802398650001402426650001802440650002102458650001502479650001202494650002902506650001302535650002902548650001802577650001502595650001302610650001002623650001802633650001802651650001102669650002302680650001002703651001902713653001202732653001402744653001802758653001902776653002402795700003002819700002302849773012202872856008302994852000903077655001203086IND60569084620221120043933.0190318e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056908462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsden, Karina A.10aDMPP is ineffective at mitigating N2O emissions from sheep urine patches in a UK grassland under summer conditions  ap. 1-11.  aNitrification inhibitors are a potential technology to mitigate N2O emissions from the urine patches of grazing animals. At present, there is limited information regarding the efficacy of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in reducing N2O emissions from ruminant urine patches, as opposed to the well-studied nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide. In practical terms, urine patches would be deposited to soil at various times following the application of a nitrification inhibitor to soil. We hypothesised that the effectiveness of DMPP in reducing cumulative N2O emissions would decrease the longer the time since DMPP application. This study utilised an automated closed chamber technique, to monitor fluxes of N2O from sheep urine patches (725kg Nha−1; 150ml; 300cm2) deposited to a Eutric Cambisol, where DMPP was applied (1kgha−1) on the same day, 2 weeks before and 4 weeks before urine application. Fluxes were monitored continuously from 4 weeks before, to 9 weeks after, urine application. DMPP was found to be ineffective at reducing cumulative N2O emissions and 9-week urine-N2O emission factors when applied at the same time as the sheep urine, although a low number of replicates were used in this study. Some effect of DMPP in delaying the accumulation of soil NO3− was observed, with effects being greater the shorter the time since DMPP application. The temporal dynamics of N2O fluxes were also altered where DMPP was applied on the same day as the urine. Heterogeneity in soil conditions were deemed responsible for the large spatial variability of N2O emissions observed in this study. The use of Rhizon samplers were useful for detecting spatial variability within the soil solution directly beneath the urine patches (within the flux chambers), which may not have been detected within duplicate urine patches (outside the chambers), where soil sampling was conducted. Further work is required to determine the loading rate and duration of efficacy of DMPP to reduce emissions from urine patches under temperate summer conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3adicyandiamide 3aemissions factor 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrous oxide 3aphosphates 3asamplers 3asheep 3asoil sampling 3asoil solution 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aurine 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDiurnal 0aGrassland 0aNitrous oxide 0aNitrogen cycle 0aMitigation strategy1 aJones, D.

Several therapeutic aptamers with desirable binding and functional properties have been developed and evaluated in preclinical studies over the past 25years. However, for the majority of these aptamers, their clinical potential has yet to be realized. A significant hurdle to the clinical adoption of this novel class of biologicals is the limited information on their secondary and tertiary structure. Knowledge of the RNA’s structure would greatly facilitate and expedite the post-selection optimization steps required for translation, including truncation (to reduce costs of manufacturing), chemical modification (to enhance stability and improve safety) and chemical conjugation (to improve drug properties for combinatorial therapy). Here we describe a structural computational modeling methodology that when coupled to a standard functional assay, can be used to determine key sequence and structural motifs of an RNA aptamer. We applied this methodology to enable the truncation of an aptamer to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with great potential for targeted therapy that had failed previous truncation attempts. This methodology can be easily applied to optimize other aptamers with therapeutic potential.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aantigens 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3afunctional properties 3amanufacturing 3amedicine 3amodels 3anucleotide motifs 3aoligonucleotides 3atherapeutics 3atranslation (genetics) 0aRNA aptamers 0aRNA secondary and tertiary structure 0aStructural algorithms 0aVfold2D model 0aVfold3D model 0aProstate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) 0aA9 aptamer 0aA9g aptamer 0aNAALADase Assay1 aDickey, David D.1 aChen, Shi-Jie1 aGiangrande, Paloma H.0 tMethods.g2016 July 01, v. 103 p.175-179dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001600276520143300292592002801725650003801753650001801791650001701809650001301826650001601839650001901855650002301874650002101897650003701918650001201955650001101967650002101978650001901999650000902018650002402027650001602051650001702067650001402084653003802098653001602136653003102152653002202183700001702205700001402222700001802236700001902254700001902273773012002292856008502412852000902497655001202506IND60583755620221119142224.0200121e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058375562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihui10aResistance risk assessment of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis against phenamacril, a myosin inhibitor  ap. 127-132.  aFusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis (FOM) is one of the most notorious seed-borne diseases worldwide. Phenamacril is a cyanoacrylate fungicide with novel chemical structure and strong inhibitive activity against FOM. To evaluate the risk of FOM developing phenamacril resistance, five phenamacril-resistant mutants with >800μgml⁻¹ minimum inhibitory concentration were obtained by repeated exposure to the fungicide in the laboratory. Compared with the parental isolate, four of the five phenamacril-resistant mutants showed enhanced biological fitness in sporulation and virulence, but not in sensitivity to various stresses (oxidative and osmotic pressure, cell membrane and wall inhibitor). No positive cross-resistance was observed among phenamacril and the other five fungicides, including azoxystrobin, carbendazim, boscalid, fluazinam and tebuconazole. Sequencing alignment results of the myosin 5 from the five resistant mutants and the parental strain indicated that the three resistant mutants fo-2, fo-3 and fo-4 had a single point mutation (S175L), which may confer the resistance of FOM against phenamacril. Interestingly, the resistant mutant fo-4 harbored not only one mutation (S175L) at myosin 5, but also the other mutation (A52G) at β₂-tublin. Our data supported that resistance risk of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis against phenamacril was between the moderate to high level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis 3aFusarium wilt 3aazoxystrobin 3aboscalid 3acarbendazim 3acell membranes 3achemical structure 3across resistance 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amutants 3amyosin 3aosmotic pressure 3apoint mutation 3arisk 3aseed-borne diseases 3asporulation 3atebuconazole 3avirulence 0aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis 0aPhenamacril 0aResistance risk assessment 0aMyosin 5 mutation1 aRen, Weichao1 aWang, Jin1 aChen, Wenchan1 aSang, Chengwei1 aChen, Changjun0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2018 May, v. 147 p.127-132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011300175300002000288520134000308592002801648650001101676650001001687650001401697650001301711650002101724650002401745650000901769650001301778650001401791650001501805650003301820650001601853650001101869650001801880650001401898700002701912700002301939700001901962700003001981773014902011856008102160852000902241655001202250IND60569587920221119205851.0170608e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056958792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7175-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomínguez, Joaquín R.10aParabens abatement from surface waters by electrochemical advanced oxidation with boron doped diamond anodes  ap. 20315-20330.  aThe removal efficiency of four commonly-used parabens by electrochemical advanced oxidation with boron-doped diamond anodes in two different aqueous matrices, namely ultrapure water and surface water from the Guadiana River, has been analyzed. Response surface methodology and a factorial, composite, central, orthogonal, and rotatable (FCCOR) statistical design of experiments have been used to optimize the process. The experimental results clearly show that the initial concentration of pollutants is the factor that influences the removal efficiency in a more remarkable manner in both aqueous matrices. As a rule, as the initial concentration of parabens increases, the removal efficiency decreases. The current density also affects the removal efficiency in a statistically significant manner in both aqueous matrices. In the water river aqueous matrix, a noticeable synergistic effect on the removal efficiency has been observed, probably due to the presence of chloride ions that increase the conductivity of the solution and contribute to the generation of strong secondary oxidant species such as chlorine or HClO/ClO ⁻. The use of a statistical design of experiments made it possible to determine the optimal conditions necessary to achieve total removal of the four parabens in ultrapure and river water aqueous matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aboron 3achlorides 3achlorine 3aelectrochemistry 3aexperimental design 3aions 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aresponse surface methodology 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurface water 3asynergism1 aMuñoz-Peña, Maria J.1 aGonzález, Teresa,1 aPalo, Patricia1 aCuerda-Correa, Eduardo M.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Oct., v. 23, no. 20 p.20315-20330dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7175-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009000160300002000250520156000270592002801830650001101858650002001869650001501889650002201904650001701926650001901943650000901962650001101971650001101982650001501993650003502008650003002043650003702073650001302110650000902123650001702132650001602149650000802165650002502173650001202198700001702210700001302227700001602240700001702256773014902273856008102422852000902503655001202512IND60569588020221119205743.0170608e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056958802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7271-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fu10aDecontamination of electronic waste-polluted soil by ultrasound-assisted soil washing  ap. 20331-20340.  aLaboratorial scale experiments were performed to evaluate the efficacy of a washing process using the combination of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) and tea saponin (TS) for simultaneous desorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) and heavy metals from an electronic waste (e-waste) site. Ultrasonically aided mixing of the field contaminated soil with a combination of MCD and TS solutions simultaneously mobilizes most of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the analyte metal (Pb, Cu, and Ni) burdens. It is found that 15 g/L MCD and 10 g/L TS is an efficient reagent combination reconciling extraction performance and reagent costs. Under these conditions, the removal efficiencies of HOCs and heavy metals are 93.5 and 91.2 %, respectively, after 2 cycles of 60-min ultrasound-assisted washing cycles. By contrast, 86.3 % of HOCs and 88.4 % of metals are removed from the soil in the absence of ultrasound after 3 cycles of 120-min washing. The ultrasound-assisted soil washing could generate high removal efficiency and decrease the operating time significantly. Finally, the feasibility of regenerating and reusing the spent washing solution in extracting pollutants from the soil is also demonstrated. By application of this integrated technology, it is possible to recycle the washing solution for a purpose to reduce the consumption of surfactant solutions. Collectively, it has provided an effective and economic treatment of e-waste-polluted soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3adecontamination 3adesorption 3aelectronic wastes 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophobicity 3alead 3amixing 3anickel 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asaponins 3asoil 3asoil washing 3asurfactants 3atea 3aultrasonic treatment 3awashing1 aYang, Baodan1 aMa, Jing1 aQu, Junfeng1 aLiu, Gangjun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Oct., v. 23, no. 20 p.20331-20340dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7271-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013100174300001400305520105600319592002801375650002201403650001101425650001101436650002801447650001701475650001901492650001201511650002401523650001901547650001401566650002301580650001801603650002601621700001901647700001601666700001401682700002001696700002701716700002101743773011901764856008501883852000901968655001201977IND60583755920221119142333.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058375592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClements, Joseph S.10aN′-mono- and N, N′-diacyl derivatives of benzyl and arylhydrazines as contact insecticides against adult Anopheles gambiae  ap. 33-38.  aNew public health insecticides are urgently required to prevent the spread of vector-borne disease. With the goal of identifying new K+-channel-directed mosquitocides, analogs of the RH-5849 family of diacyl t-butylhydrazines were synthesized and tested for topical toxicity against adult Anopheles gambiae, the African vector of malaria. In total, 80N′-monoacyl and N, N′-diacyl derivatives of benzyl- and arylhydrazines were prepared. Three compounds (2bo, 2kb, 3ab) were identified that were more toxic than RH-5849 and RH-1266. The potencies of these compounds to block K+ currents in An. gambiae and human Kv2.1 channels were assessed to address their possible mechanism of mosquitocidal action. Selectivity for inhibition of An. gambiae Kv2.1 vs human Kv2.1 did not exceed 3-fold. Furthermore, no correlation was seen between the potency of insecticidal action and K+ channel blocking potency. These observations, combined with the minimal knockdown seen with 2bo near its LD50 value, suggests a mode of action outside of the nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aadults 3ahumans 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3alethal dose 50 3amalaria 3amechanism of action 3anervous system 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3apublic health 3avector-borne diseases1 aIslam, Rafique1 aSun, Baonan1 aTong, Fan1 aGross, Aaron D.1 aBloomquist, Jeffrey R.1 aCarlier, Paul R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Nov., v. 143 p.33-38dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003200146245013500178500001900313520158500332592002801917650001801945650001301963650001201976650001401988650001802002650001502020650002602035650001602061650003102077650002402108650002702132650001102159650001802170650001502188650001802203651001002221700002202231700002902253700002002282700003202302700002202334773012202356856008002478852000902558655001202567IND60731959120221121072249.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073195912DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-García, José  G.10aGlyphosate Resistance Confirmation and Field Management of Red Brome (Bromus rubens L.) in Perennial Crops Grown in Southern Spain  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe excessive use of the herbicide glyphosate on annual and perennial crops grown in Southern Spain has caused an increase in resistant weed populations. Bromus rubens has begun to spread through olive and almond cultivars due to low glyphosate control over these species, whereas previously it had been well controlled with field dose (1080 g ae ha⁻¹). Characterization using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers confirmed the presence of B. rubens collected in Andalusia. A rapid shikimic acid accumulation screening showed 17 resistant (R) populations with values between 300 and 700 µg shikimate g⁻¹ fresh weight and three susceptible (S) populations with values between 1200 and 1700 µg shikimate g⁻¹ fresh weight. In dose–response experiments the GR₅₀ values agreed with previous results and the resistance factors (RFs: GR₅₀ R/GR₅₀ S (Br1)) were between 4.35 (Br9) and 7.61 (Br19). Foliar retention assays shown no differences in glyphosate retention in both R and S populations. The tests carried out in a resistant field (Br10) demonstrated the control efficacy of pre-emergence herbicides since flazasulfuron in the tank mix with glyphosate had up to 80% control 15 to 120 days after application (DAA) and grass weed postemergence herbicides, such as propaquizafop + glyphosate and quizalofop + glyphosate, had up to 90% control 15 to 90 DAA. Results confirm the first scientific report of glyphosate-resistant B. rubens worldwide; however, the use of herbicides with another mode of action (MOA) is the best tool for integrated weed management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus rubens 3aagronomy 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3adose response 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3agrass weeds 3aintegrated weed management 3amechanism of action 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aolives 3apropaquizafop 3aquizalofop 3ashikimic acid 3aSpain1 aCastro, Patricia,1 aCruz-Hipólito, Hugo  E.1 aMillan, Teresa 1 aPalma-Bautista, Candelario 1 aDe Prado, Rafael 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013700158300001600295500001400311520105900325592002801384650002101412650001601433650001901449650001801468650001701486650001401503650001001517650002001527650004801547650001601595650001901611650001901630653002101649653001901670653002601689653001801715653001401733700002001747700002001767773013601787856007401923852000901997655001202006IND60691736720221123034820.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173672DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.8302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawai, Misako10aHigh-level Expression of the Chemically Synthesized Gene for Microbial Transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium in Escherichia coli  ap. 830-835.  aNAL-light  aWe developed a novel approach for the high-level production of a microbial transglutaminase (TGase) from Streptoverticillium in E. coli. The direct expression of the TGase gene in E. coli cells did not cause overproduction, probably due to the harmful influence of TGase activity, which introduces covalent crosslinks between proteins. Therefore, we fused the chemically synthesized TGase gene coding for the entire 331 amino acid residues at the amino terminus to a bacteriophage T7 gene 10 leader peptide (260 amino acids) using an inducible expression vector. The TGase gene was expressed as inclusion bodies in the E. coli cytoplasm. Restoring 15 amino acid residues upstream of the amino terminus of the mature TGase by a two-step deletion of the fusion sequence facilitated solubilization and subsequent proteolytic cleavage, thus releasing mature TGase. Although the mature form had less TGase activity than native TGase, because of the poor refolding rate, these results suggest that this system is suitable for the efficient production of TGase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3abacteriophages 3abiotechnology 3acrosslinking 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aproteolysis 3asignal peptide 3asolubilization 0atransglutaminase 0agene synthesis 0ahigh-level expression 0afused protein 0arefolding1 aTakehana, Shino1 aTakagi, Hiroshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 5 p.830-835dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.8303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100002100200245013100221300001600352520090100368592002801269650001701297650001901314650001601333650001401349650001801363650001001381650001201391650001401403650002101417650002101438650002101459650001201480650002401492650001501516650002401531650004901555650002101604650002001625650002001645650002401665650002601689651001701715653002301732653003901755653001801794653001201812653001001824653001401834653001601848653001701864653002101881653001101902653002001913700001901933700001701952773011601969852000902085856008302094655001202177IND2051642820221122034655.0181203e19950401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205164282DNAL7 a76030022pmid7 a10.1258/0023677957807402122doi4 a0023-6772(19950401)29:2L.163;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotgieter, F.

This cell culture system is a convenient and sensitive method for the screening of bedding materials for the presence of compounds that could be potentially harmful to animals and thus the experimental outcome. Cells were exposed to acetone extracts of the different materials or their components. Corn cobs displayed very little or no CYP1A1-inducing or cytotoxic effects, whilst vermiculite and unbleached pulp from pine and eucalyptus showed greater induction and cytotoxic properties. The latter properties were lower than those produced by the different recycled paper extracts.

However, numerous observations show an increasing rate of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and call for comprehensive process-based models to explore its role in climate change. Here, we present a new model system, EC-Earth-PISM, that includes an interactive Greenland Ice Sheet. The model is based on the EC-Earth v2.3 global climate model in which ice sheet surface processes are introduced. This model interacts with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) without anomaly or flux corrections. Under pre-industrial climate conditions, the modeled climate and ice sheet are stable while keeping a realistic interannual variability. In model simulations forced into a warmer climate of four times the pre-industrial CO₂ concentration, the total surface mass balance decreases and the ice sheet loses mass at a rate of about 500 Gt/year. In the climate warming experiments, the resulting freshwater flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet increases 55% more in the experiments with the interactive ice sheet and the climate response is significantly different: the Arctic near-surface air temperature is lower, substantially more winter sea ice covers the northern hemisphere, and the ocean circulation is weaker. Our results indicate that the melt-albedo feedback plays a key role for the response of the ice sheet and its influence on the changing climate in the Arctic. This emphasizes the importance of including interactive ice sheets in climate change projections.  aPublisher supplied data  aCOMBINE, Grant agreement 226520cEU FP7  aSVALIcNordisk Ministerråd  aeSTICC projectscNordisk Ministerråd  aIce2ice, Grant agreement 610055cEU FP7/ERC  aNational Centre for Climate ResearchcDanish State 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate models 3adynamics 3afreshwater 3asea ice 3aArctic region 3aGreenland1 aYang, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0147-20561 aAðalgeirsdóttir, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3442-27331 aSvendsen, S.

Considering the armyworm management and its ability to develop resistance rapidly to synthetic insecticides and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins, we assessed the response of field and laboratory populations of FAW to Bt maize hybrids and Bt-based bioinsecticides. In the laboratory, FAW neonates from two Bt-resistant colonies and three field-collected populations were fed foliage of Bt maize or Bt bioinsecticides incorporated into artificial diet, and larval survival and biomass were recorded after seven days. Larvae of the two laboratory colonies resistant to Bt maize producing Cry1 or Cry2 toxins had high larval survival rates on foliage of specific Bt maize hybrids (i.e., Cry1F or Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab). On foliage of the Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab Bt maize, larvae of one of the field-collected populations had survival rates similar to the Bt-resistant laboratory larvae but had strong growth inhibition. The field-collected larvae had less than 30% survival on foliage of Cry1F maize and larval weights equivalent to those of the Cry1F-resistant colony. In addition, while some larvae survived exposure to formulations of B. thuringiensis kurstaki (i.e., Dipel and Thuricide), the two formulations of B. thuringiensis aizawai (i.e., Agree and Xentari) caused 100% larval mortality in all FAW colonies and the field populations, including the ones showing reduced-susceptibility to Cry1F or Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab Bt maize. This research shows that there are field populations of FAW with different levels of susceptibility to specific Bt toxins and that resistance to Cry1 and/or Cry2 may or may not reduce the efficacy of certain Bt bioinsecticides against the neonates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aartificial diets 3abiomass 3abiopesticides 3acorn 3agrowth retardation 3ahybrids 3ainsecticides 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aneonates 3asurvival rate 3atoxins 3atransgenic plants 3aAfrica 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aSpodoptera frugiperda 0aBiological control 0aInsect resistance management 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aGenetically modified maize1 aSilveira, L.C.P.1 aPitta, R.M.1 aWaquil, J.M.1 aPereira, E.J.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8957-64651 aMendes, S.M.0 tCrop protection.g2019 June, v. 120 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245009000209300001400299506007600313520146800389592002801857506003701885650002601922650000801948650001301956650002601969650001701995650002402012650001002036650000702046650001402053650002602067650002102093650001302114650001102127650001102138653000802149653001802157653001902175653002902194653002602223700005902249700001702308700002702325700001802352700002902370700002702399773010602426856008102532852000902613655001202622IND60590627320221207090426.0190129e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059062732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2018.02.0102doi7 aPMC58847382pmcid7 a294478552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEreku, Luck Tosan10aRPA using a multiplexed cartridge for low cost point of care diagnostics in the field  ap. 84-88.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA point of care device utilising Lab-on-a-Chip technologies that is applicable for biological pathogens was designed, fabricated and tested showing sample in to answer out capabilities. The purpose of the design was to develop a cartridge with the capability to perform nucleic acid extraction and purification from a sample using a chitosan membrane at an acidic pH. Waste was stored within the cartridge with the use of sodium polyacrylate to solidify or gelate the sample in a single chamber. Nucleic acid elution was conducted using the RPA amplification reagents (alkaline pH). Passive valves were used to regulate the fluid flow and a multiplexer was designed to distribute the fluid into six microchambers for amplification reactions. Cartridges were produced using soft lithography of silicone from 3D printed moulds, bonded to glass substrates. The isothermal technique, RPA is employed for amplification. This paper shows the results from two separate experiments: the first using the RPA control nucleic acid, the second showing successful amplification from Chlamydia Trachomatis.Endpoint analysis conducted for the RPA analysis was gel electrophoresis that showed 143 base pair DNA was amplified successfully for positive samples whilst negative samples did not show amplification. End point analysis for Chlamydia Trachomatis samples was fluorescence detection that showed successful detection of 1 copy/μL and 10 copies/μL spiked in a MES buffer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3aDNA 3achitosan 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3aglass 3apH 3apathogens 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolyacrylic acid 3asilicone 3asodium 3awastes 0aRPA 0aPoint of care 0aDNA extraction 0aIsothermal amplification 0aMultiplexed cartridge1 aMackay, Ruth E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6456-69141 aCraw, Pascal1 aNaveenathayalan, Angel1 aStead, Thomas1 aBranavan, Manorharanehru1 aBalachandran, Wamadeva0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 547 p.84-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2018.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166520184200260592002802102650001602130650002002146650001702166650001602183650002002199650001002219653002202229653002602251653004502277653002402322653001902346700001802365700001602383700001702399700001802416773012502434856008502559852000902644655001202653IND60747962420221121065702.0210916e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074796242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1063672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Wenxia10aLightweight convolutional neural network model for field wheat ear disease identification  aManual diagnosis of crop diseases has high cost and low efficiency and has become increasingly unsuitable for the needs of modern agricultural production. This study designed a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model called SimpleNet for the automatic identification of wheat ear diseases, such as glume blotch and scab, in natural scene images taken in the field. SimpleNet was constructed using convolution and inverted residual blocks. In this study, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which combines spatial attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, was introduced into inverted residual blocks to improve the representation ability of the model for disease features so that the model pays attention to important features, suppresses unnecessary features, and reduces the influence of complex backgrounds in the images. In addition, this study designed a feature fusion module to concatenate the down-sampled feature maps output by inverted residual blocks and the average pooling features of the feature maps that input inverted residual blocks to realize the fusion between features of different depths to reduce the loss of the detailed features of wheat ear diseases caused by the networks in the down-sampling process and solve the disappearance of disease features in the process of image feature extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed SimpleNet model achieved an identification accuracy of 94.1% on the test data set, which is higher than that of classic CNN models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet, and lightweight CNN models, such as MobileNet V1, V2, and V3. SimpleNet has only 2.13 M parameters, which is less than those of MobileNet V1, V2, and V3-Large. The designed model can be used for the automatic identification of wheat ear diseases on the mobile terminal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3aear diseases 3aelectronics 3aneural networks 3awheat 0aWheat ear disease 0aTarget identification 0aLightweight convolutional neural network 0aAttention mechanism 0aFeature fusion1 aYang, Xinghua1 aLiang, Dong1 aHu, Gensheng1 aYang, Xianjun0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 189 p.106367-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1063673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001600283520120900299592002801508650002101536650003001557650001101587650001301598650002601611650001301637700006401650773008701714856008501801852000901886655001201895IND60635020920221116140601.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063502092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGörne, Arno L.10aCovalent bonding versus total energy: On the attainability of certain predicted low-energy carbon allotropes  ap. 151-158.  aOn the basis of first-principles calculations, we contrast the favorable total energies of certain carbon allotropes with their uncompetitive bonding strengths as compared with those of graphite or diamond. Clearly, our tentative approach draws from ideas of organic synthesis and retrosynthesis by focusing at those bonds that have to be formed and stabilized or cleaved for preparing a certain C-based material. In particular, the covalent C–C bonds of the carbon allotropes are studied by extracting their crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) energies from plane-wave density-functional theory because this quantum-mechanical measure of covalent bond strength allows for a simple, yet numerically precise allotropic ranking including graphite and diamond. While many of the lowest-energy allotropes feature plainly imperfect bonding, we found a single one (topology 32.4T203 in SACADA) with both strong bonding and favorable total energy at the same time. To help experimentalists in distinguishing this very allotrope from all the other predicted carbon allotropes, we propose IR spectroscopy and predict certain vibrational fingerprints such as to identify 32.4T203 in exploratory syntheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3atopology1 aDronskowski, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1925-96240 tCarbon.g2019 July, v. 148 p.151-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245014700177300001600324520108300340592002801423650001801451650002101469650001301490650001401503650001901517650002401536650001601560650001801576650002401594650001201618650001401630650002001644650001701664650002201681653002601703653002601729653002701755653002201782653001401804653001701818700001801835700002001853700002501873700002201898700002101920773010601941856008702047852000902134655001202143IND60582572820221118003332.0200717e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058257282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayan Patel, Satya10aDevelopment of a thermo-stable and recyclable magnetic nanobiocatalyst for bioprocessing of fruit processing residues and D-allulose synthesis  ap. 633-639.  aThe aim of the study was to covalently immobilize Smt3-D-psicose 3-epimerase onto functionalized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles. After immobilization, Kₘ of the immobilized enzyme increased, however, Vₘₐₓ was nearly the same as that of its free form, indicating that immobilization has no detrimental effects on its catalytic output. The covalent immobilization caused a reduction in the deactivation rate constant (kd) values leading to 4–5 fold enhancement in its half-life at 50–65°C, indicating significant thermal stability of the iron-enzyme nanobioconjugate. The immobilized enzyme showed excellent storage stability by losing only 20% activity even after 60days of storage at 4°C. The immobilized enzyme retained up to 90% of its initial activity even after 10 consecutive cycles of catalyzing D-fructose epimerization reactions. Thus, after immobilization the enzyme exhibited remarkable improvements in thermal tolerance, storage stability and recycling efficiency, useful for development of industrially exploitable process for D-allulose production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3achemical bonding 3afructose 3ahalf life 3aheat tolerance 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3aprocessing residues 3apsicose 3arecycling 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3athermal stability 0aD-psicose 3-epimerase 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aThermal stability 0aRecycling 0aFruit pomace1 aSingh, Vishal1 aSharma, Manisha1 aSangwan, Rajender S.1 aSinghal, Nitin K.1 aSingh, Sudhir P.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Jan., v. 247 p.633-639dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245017800166300001800344520088800362592002801250650001301278650001501291650001901306650001201325650003201337650002501369650001501394653002801409653003101437653002401468653003501492653001101527700001601538700002001554700001901574700002201593700001601615700001801631700001701649700001701666773010801683856008701791852000901878655001201887IND60582572920221118003235.0200717e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058257292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qi10aEffect of hydraulic retention time on the performance of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor system for micropollutants removal from municipal wastewater  ap. 1228-1232.  aThis study evaluated micropollutants removal and membrane fouling behaviour of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (24, 18, 12 and 6h). The results revealed that HRT of 18h was the optimal condition regarding the removal of most selected micropollutants. As the primary removal mechanism in the hybrid system was biodegradation, the attached growth pattern was desirable for enriching slow growing bacteria and developing a diversity of biocoenosis. Thus, the efficient removal of micropollutants was obtained. In terms of membrane fouling propensity analysis, a longer HRT (e.g. HRTs of 24 and 18h) could significantly mitigate membrane fouling when compared with the shortest HRT of 6h. Hence, enhanced system performance could be achieved when the MBBR-MBR system was operated at HRT of 18h.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiocenosis 3abiodegradation 3afouling 3amoving bed biofilm reactors 3amunicipal wastewater 3apollutants 0aMicropollutants removal 0aMoving bed biofilm reactor 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aHydraulic retention time (HRT) 0aSponge1 aNgo, Hao H.1 aNghiem, Long D.1 aHai, Faisal I.1 aPrice, William E.1 aZhang, Jian1 aLiang, Shuang1 aDeng, Lijuan1 aGuo, Wenshan0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Jan., v. 247 p.1228-1232dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013100161300002000292520100300312592002801315650002001343650001801363650001501381650002101396650001101417650001601428650001601444650001701460650001301477650000901490650000901499650001101508650001201519650001001531650002001541650001501561650001001576650001301586700001601599700001601615700002601631700002401657700002001681773014901701856008101850852000901931655001201940IND60569588720221119205610.0170608e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056958872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7182-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Wei10aEfficacy of Si fertilization to modulate the heavy metals absorption by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.)  ap. 20402-20407.  aSilicon-based fertilizers and soil amendments can have direct and indirect positive influences on cultivated plants.

Several types of Si-based substances such as fumed silica, slags from the iron and steel industry, modified slags, and a Si-rich product were tested using barley and pea as silicon accumulative and non-accumulative plants, respectively, at two application rates. The plants were grown under toxic concentrations of heavy metals in a greenhouse. Si-rich materials high in water-soluble Si had a positive effect at both the low and high application rates, and for both plant species. This type of substance can be regarded as Si fertilizer, demonstrating greater efficiency at a low application rate and lessened efficiency at a high application rate for protection of the cultivated plants against accumulation of the heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPisum sativum 3aabsorption 3aapplication rate 3abarley 3afertilizers 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3airon 3apeas 3asilica 3asilicon 3aslags 3asoil amendments 3asolubility 3asteel 3atoxicity1 aYuqiao, Liu1 aQiang, Zhan1 aMatichenkov, Vladimir1 aBocharnikova, Elena1 aDåstøl, Magne0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Oct., v. 23, no. 20 p.20402-20407dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7182-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245009200172500001900264520127600283592002801559650002201587650001301609650002101622650002301643650001601666650002001682650001301702650002001715650000901735650001901744650001701763650002001780650001401800700002101814700002201835773012201857856008001979852000902059655001202068IND60731959620221121105235.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073195962DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadawiec, Aleksandra 10aAgrotechnical Biofortification as a Method to Increase Selenium Content in Spring Wheat  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelenium (Se) is a micronutrient that is insufficiently present in the human diet. Increasing its content in food through appropriately matched agricultural practices may contribute to reducing Se deficit in humans. The study covered the effect of grain, soil, as well as grain and soil fertilization with selenium combined with foliar application at different stages of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) development. The fertilization involved the application of sodium selenate. Fertilization with selenium had no significant effect on the grain yield. Grain application, soil application, and grain and soil application combined with foliar application at particular development stages of the plant significantly contributed to an increase in selenium content in grain. The study showed that the accumulation of selenium in spring wheat depends on the type of fertilization and term of its application. The best method of introducing selenium into the plant is grain and soil fertilization combined with foliar application at the stage of tillering and stem elongation (G + S + F1-2) for which the highest selenium content was obtained (0.696 mg·kg⁻¹ Se). The applied biofortification methods contributed to the increase in selenium in the grain of spring wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3abiofortification 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3ahuman nutrition 3aselenium 3asodium selenate 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3aspring wheat 3astem elongation 3atillering1 aSzulc, Wiesław 1 aRutkowska, Beata 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245014200216300001800358520116900376592002801545650001101573650001101584650002101595650001101616650001001627650003501637650003001672651001201702653003201714653004301746653002601789653003001815653002501845653001201870700002101882700005801903773012101961856008802082852000902170655001202179IND60583756320221119142427.0181010e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058375632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallistl, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9887-336510aHigh levels of medium-chain chlorinated paraffins and polybrominated diphenyl ethers on the inside of several household baking oven doors  ap. 1019-1027.  aFat obtained by wipe tests on the inner surface of 21 baking ovens from Stuttgart (Germany) were analyzed for halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), namely polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), dechlorane plus (DP), short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, MCCPs), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In ~50% of the samples chlorinated paraffins (CPs) were present in the mg/g fat range, i.e. three to four orders of magnitude higher concentrated than the sum of all other target compounds. In contrast the remaining ~50% of the samples were free of CPs, while the other HFRs were comparable in CP-positive and CP-negative samples. The exceptionally high concentrations and exclusive presence of CPs in half of the samples produced strong evidence that these compounds were released from the baking oven itself. This hypothesis was supported by detection of MCCPs at even higher concentrations in the inner components of one dismantled baking oven. The release of substantial amounts of HFRs from the oven casing during its use may contribute to human exposure to these compounds, especially MCCPs and SCCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3aethane 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3aovens 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aGermany 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) 0aChlorinated paraffins 0aPolychlorinated n-alkanes 0aIndoor contamination 0aKitchen1 aSprengel, Jannik1 aVetter, Walter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5592-42650 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 615 p.1019-1027dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001800291520122900309592002801538650001401566650001501580650001701595650001001612650002101622650001101643650002101654650002601675650001801701650002201719650001701741650001901758700002801777700002201805700002301827773011101850856008601961852000902047655001202056IND60530004620221118071208.0160720e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053000462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b016062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueno, Justin10aDeep-Ultraviolet Resonance Raman (DUVRR) Spectroscopy of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Subjected to Thermal Stress  ap. 7880-7886.  aThe structural assessment of Rituximab, an IgG1 mAb, was investigated with deep-ultraviolet resonance Raman (DUVRR) spectroscopy. DUVRR spectroscopy was used to monitor the changes to the secondary structure of Rituximab under thermal stress. DUVRR spectra showed obvious changes from 22 to 72 °C. Specifically, changes in the amide I vibrational mode were assigned to an increase in unordered structure (random coil). Structural changes in samples heated to 72 °C were related to loss in drug potency via a complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) bioassay. The DUVRR spectroscopic method shows promise as a tool for the quality assessment of mAb drug products and would represent an improvement over current methodology in terms of analysis time and sample preparation. To determine the scope of the method, protein pharmaceuticals of different molecular weights (ranging from 4 to 143 kDa) and secondary structure (β-sheet, α-helix and unordered structure) were analyzed. The model illustrated the method’s sensitivity for the analysis of protein drug products of different secondary structure. Results show promise for DUVRR spectroscopy as a rapid screening tool of a variety of formulated protein pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3acomplement 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arapid methods 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3athermal stress1 aḶuṅ Ḍīqânṇā,1 aKauffman, John F.1 aArzhantsev, Sergey0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 04, v. 87, no. 15 p.7880-7886dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b016063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012400163500001900287506002800306506003200334520226300366592002802629596004502657506003702702650001302739650001002752650001702762650001202779650001602791650001102807650001902818650001702837650001602854650002202870650001302892650001402905650001602919650001202935650001502947650000902962650001602971650001102987650001702998651001503015700001703030700001803047700002303065773012203088856008003210903002203290852000903312655001203321IND60731959720221207132932.0210326e20210313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073195972DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhadi, Sara 10aResponse of Rice Algal Assemblage to Fertilizer and Chemical Application: Implications for Early Algal Bloom Management  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aCalifornia water-seeded rice is challenged with the rapid growth of nuisance algae at the beginning of the season. Rice seedlings entangled in the algal mat may not be established, causing empty rice patches in the field. Two separate studies were conducted to (1) evaluate the effect of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) on algae growth, and (2) test various chemical options to control algae. Both studies utilized 19 L buckets inoculated with algae collected from a rice field. In the nutrient evaluation study, 36 nutrient treatments obtained from a combination of nitrogen (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 kg ha⁻¹) and phosphorous (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg ha⁻¹) rates were applied into the buckets, while eight chemicals with potential for algae control (two Protox inhibitor herbicides, four copper-based compounds, hydrogen peroxide, Zinc sulfate) were tested in the second experiment. In addition, a yeast extract-based surfactant (AMP activator) was tested in combination with a chelated copper formulation (Algimycin) and hydrogen peroxide. The studies had a completely randomized design with three replicates and each study was repeated two times. The result from the nutrient evaluation study showed that nitrogen and phosphorus can independently cause change in algae growth as reflected in the fresh and dry biomass. Moreover, low rates of either nitrogen or phosphorus resulted in a rapid increase in algae biomass and water chlorophyll a content, whereas the growth of algae declined at higher rates of applied fertilizer. Among tested chemicals in the second experiment, the chelated formulation of copper (Algimycin PWF) controlled algae (85%) better than the ethanolamine formulations [Cutrine-Ultra (70%) and Cutrine-Plus (52%)] and elemental copper (crystalline copper sulfate) (75%). Protox herbicides (oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon) were able to control algae by up to 70%. Hydrogen peroxide controlled algae by 50% and its efficacy dropped dramatically five days after treatment (DAT). Zinc sulfate was only effective at 1 DAT and algae recovered rapidly after that. Combining fertilizer management practices with chemical options will enable us toward an integrative approach for early algal bloom in the rice cropping system.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagronomy 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3aethanolamine 3afertilizers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitrogen 3aoxadiazon 3aoxyfluorfen 3apaddies 3aphosphorus 3arice 3asurfactants 3ayeasts 3azinc sulfate 3aCalifornia1 aGodar, Amar 1 aMadsen, John 1 aAl-Khatib, Kassim 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 13, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305423Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006400167520183800231592002802069650001602097650001602113650002402129650001502153650001502168650001402183650001102197650002502208650001802233653002002251653001802271653002502289700002302314773012502337856008502462852000902547655001202556IND60747962820221121065540.0210916e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074796282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1063772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yifan12aA dual-head attention model for time series data imputation  aDigital agriculture increasingly relies on the availability and accuracy of measurement data collected from various sensors. Of this data, water quality attracts great attention due to its intended use for crop irrigation, livestock, and other farming activities. Accurate and reliable water quality measurements enable farmers to understand the landscape comprehensively, optimising resource utilisation and reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment. In practice, missing and incomplete data can create biased estimations and reduce the efficiency of many of the valuable applications provided by digital agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to propose a dual-head sequence-to-sequence imputation model (Dual-SSIM) designed to impute missing time series data in sensor networks, therefore reducing the negative consequences of missing and incomplete data. Unlike standard sequence-to-sequence architecture, the Dual-SSIM model features two encoders with gated recurrent units (GRUs) which are used to process temporal information before and after the missing gap separately. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is applied to two encoder outputs concurrently, in order to allow the model to focus on the high relative inputs when estimating missing data. The performance efficacy of Dual-SSIM has been investigated through the monitoring of water quality, sourced from an Australian water quality information system. Experimental results of this investigation indicate that Dual-SSIM outperforms associated alternatives based on the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and dynamic time warping (DTW) scores in imputing two different water quality variables. Therefore, it can be concluded that Dual-SSIM provides an effective and promising approach for water quality data imputation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aelectronics 3ainformation systems 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3amodels 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 0aData imputation 0aDeep learning 0aSequence-to-sequence1 aThorburn, Peter J.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 189 p.106377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1063773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001400263520181900277592002802096650002202124650001602146650002502162650001902187650001902206650003002225650002102255650001102276650002102287650002302308650002002331650002302351650002102374650002602395650002002421650002602441650001302467650001102480650001702491650001702508650001302525650001102538650003302549651001102582653003002593653002102623653001602644653002402660653001602684653001902700653002302719700002202742700001902764700002402783700002202807700006202829773009602891856008502987852000903072655001203081IND60629530620221118034751.0200106e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062953062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠević, Milan10aIntegration of biological and conventional treatments in control of pepper bacterial spot  ap. 46-51.  aBacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is one of the most devastating pepper diseases in Serbia. Questionable seed quality, climatic conditions, and frequent irrigation during summer favour the disease occurrence and spread. The available management practices do not provide adequate disease control. Therefore, development of alternative and more sustainable disease management strategies is needed. Integration of classical and biological treatments could be an effective, environmentally safe option for reducing pepper bacterial spot severity. In order to develop an efficient integrated disease management program, we studied efficacy of biocontrol agents (bacteriophage strain KФ1 and two strains of Bacillus subtilis AAac and QST 713), systemic acquired resistance (SAR) inducer (acibenzolar-S-methyl - ASM), a commercial microbial fertilizer (Slavol), copper based compounds (copper hydroxide and copper oxychloride) in combination with or without mancozeb, and antibiotics (streptomycin sulphate and kasugamycin). They were applied as single treatments in two separate field experiments. Based on the single treatment efficacy, various combinations of the treatments were chosen for further testing in three separate field experiments. Additionally, we evaluated potential negative effect of ASM on pepper growth and yield in the growth chamber experiment. All the tested single treatments significantly reduced disease severity compared to the inoculated control (IC), except microbiological fertilizer and the antagonistic strain AAac. Integration of copper hydroxide, ASM and bacteriophages was the most efficient treatment, reducing the disease intensity by 96–98%. The results indicated that this combination may be an adequate alternative program for control of pepper bacterial spot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aXanthomonas 3aacibenzolar-S-methyl 3abacteriophages 3abiofertilizers 3abiological control agents 3aclimatic factors 3acopper 3acopper hydroxide 3acopper oxychloride 3adisease control 3adisease occurrence 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3agrowth chambers 3airrigation scheduling 3amancozeb 3apepper 3aseed quality 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 3asummer 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aSerbia 0aXanthomonas euvesicatoria 0aCopper compounds 0aAntibiotics 0aResistance inducers 0aAntagonists 0aBacteriophages 0aDisease management1 aGašić, Katarina1 aIgnjatov, Maja1 aMijatović, Mirjana1 aProkić, Anđelka1 aObradović, Aleksa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9425-38710 tCrop protection.g2019 May, v. 119 p.46-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001500200245007600215300001600291520106800307592002801375650001901403650002601422650001901448650002301467650001801490650001601508650001601524650002301540650002101563650001201584650001601596650001301612650001601625650001101641650000901652650002301661650005401684653001901738653002301757653001601780653001201796653002301808653001001831653001501841653001601856653002201872653002501894700001601919700001601935773011601951852000902067856008302076655001202159IND2051642720221120170057.0181203e19950401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205164272DNAL7 a76030012pmid7 a10.1258/0023677957807402762doi4 a0023-6772(19950401)29:2L.152;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilken, G.10aGrowth of Xenopus laevis under different laboratory rearing conditions.  ap. 152-162.  aSince the European frogs (Rana spp.) have fallen under the German endangered species regulation, Xenopus laevis (South African Clawed Frog) is being used increasingly in animal research and education. Optimal growth rates and homogeneity of groups have not necessarily been attained as little statistical analysis of growth data has been available. Following metamorphosis, an as yet not understood variability of growth is exhibited by X. laevis. In this study the effect of environmental factors on this variability was determined. Feeding, population density, background colouring, water temperature, the availability of hiding places, water level and water care were each examined separately. Development of body weight and body length were recorded. A definite correlation between the feeding programme, population density, cover and water care on the one hand and growth on the other were seen. Of lesser importance were water temperature, water level and background colouring. The observed variability of growth is assumed to also be of ethological origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3aenvironmental factors 3aanimal feeding 3apopulation density 3awater quality 3abody weight 3abody length 3alaboratory rearing 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPopulation Density 2aXenopus laevisxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aXENOPUS LAEVIS 0aGROWTH DEVELOPMENT 0aMAINTENANCE 0aFEEDING 0aPOPULATION DENSITY 0aCOVER 0aWATER CARE 0aWATER LEVEL 0aWATER TEMPERATURE 0aBACKGROUND COLOURING1 aDimigen, J.1 aIglauer, F.0 tLaboratory animals.g1995 Apr. 01, v. 29, no. 2 p.152-162dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677957807402763Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03548naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245011300197300001600310520159300326592002801919650001601947650001301963650002001976650001301996650003702009650001402046650000802060650001302068650002402081650001002105650002702115650001902142650001502161650003602176650001002212650002702222650002102249650002002270650001002290650001102300650001102311650000902322650002602331650003102357650001602388650002302404650003902427650002402466650001602490700002202506700002102528700003902549700003002588700003902618700003202657700002402689773008302713856008102796852000902877655001202886IND4471229020221122193226.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447122902DNAL7 a225163732pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2011.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Ezequiel Moreira10aAccuracy of anthropometric measurements in estimating fat mass in individuals with 21-hydroxylase deficiency  ap. 984-990.  aOBJECTIVE: The use of anthropometric measurements to estimate the percentage of body fat (%BF) is easy and inexpensive. However, the accuracy of these methods in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) has not been explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of skinfold-based models, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) in estimations of %BF using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method in individuals with 21OHD. METHODS: Fifty-four 21OHD patients (32 women and 22 men), aged 7 to 20 y, were recruited for the study. DXA was used to determine %BF; four predictive skinfold equations, BMI, and WC were assessed for accuracy in determining %BF. RESULTS: All predictive skinfold equations were highly associated (R, range: 0.82-0.89) with DXA %BF values. In women, BMI and WC showed moderate correlations (R = 0.69 for both BMI and WC) with DXA values. In contrast, among men there was a low explanatory power for BMI (13%) and WC (4%) and high errors (BMI, 6.9%; WC, 7.4%). All predictive equations significantly underestimated %BF (range of differences, −4.1 to −8.9) compared with DXA (women, 31.3 ± 6.1; men, 24.4 ± 7.3), and large limits of agreement were observed (range, −15.3 to 1.7 and −15.5 to 4.2 for women and men, respectively). CONCLUSION: In children and adolescents with 21OHD, %BF as estimated by skinfold measurements was associated more strongly with DXA-assessed %BF than both BMI and WC. However, still, the skinfold-based assessment underestimated DXA %BF and showed moderate agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3achildren 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aequations 3amen 3apatients 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdolescent 2aAdrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital 2aAdult 2aAnthropometryxmethods 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMathematical Concepts 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSex Factors 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aSteroid 21-Hydroxylasexmetabolism 2aWaist Circumference 2aYoung Adult1 aSilva, Analiza M.1 aSantos, Diana A.1 aLemos-Marini, Sofia Helena Valente1 ade Oliveira Santos, Allan1 aMendes-dos-Santos, Carolina Taddeo1 aDe-Mello, Maricilda Palandi1 aGuerra-Júnior, Gil0 tNutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.984-990dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245014200175300001600317520097800333592002801311650002601339650001301365650001501378650001201393650003201405650002301437650002801460650001901488650002401507650001601531650002001547650002201567650001201589653001201601653003601613653001701649653003601666653002501702700001901727700003301746700002401779700001601803700002301819700002501842700002901867773010601896856008702002852000902089655001202098IND60567277320221117181213.0190409e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056727732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoukis, Athanasios10aSustainable production of a new generation biofuel by lipase-catalyzed esterification of fatty acids from liquid industrial waste biomass  ap. 122-128.  aIn this work we suggest a methodology comprising the design and use of cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly process for biofuel production compatible with the market demands. A new generation biofuel is produced using fatty acids, which were generated from acidogenesis of industrial wastes of bioethanol distilleries, and esterified with selected alcohols by immobilized Candida antarctica Lipase-B. Suitable reactors with significant parameters and conditions were studied through experimental design, and novel esterification processes were suggested; among others, the continuous removal of the produced water was provided. Finally, economically sustainable biofuel production was achieved providing high ester yield (<97%) along with augmented concentration (3.35M) in the reaction mixtures at relatively short esterification times, whereas the immobilized lipase maintained over 90% of its initial esterifying ability after reused for ten cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aalcohols 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic sustainability 3aesterification 3aexperimental design 3afatty acids 3afuel production 3aindustrial wastes 3amarkets 0aBiofuel 0aLipase-catalyzed esterification 0aAcidogenesis 0aLiquid industrial waste biomass 0aProcess optimization1 aGkini, Olga A.1 aStergiou, Panagiota-Yiolanda1 aSakkas, Vasilios A.1 aDima, Agapi1 aBoura, Konstantina1 aKoutinas, Athanasios1 aPapamichael, Emmanuel M.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Aug., v. 238 p.122-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245004100163300001600204500001900220520057800239592002800817650003400845650002900879650001800908650001600926650003200942650001600974650004800990650003701038650001401075653001801089653002701107653002601134653002601160653003701186653002501223700001901248700001701267700002301284700002001307700001901327700002401346700002101370773013601391856007401527852000901601655001201610IND60691738020221120221239.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173802DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.8902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInamori, Yoshihiko10aBiological Activity of Purpurogallin  ap. 890-892.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpurogallin showed antibacterial activity toward gram-positive bacteria.

The lack of knowledge on protein secretion mechanisms, however, still hinders rational improvement on cellulase production. The transcript levels of cellulases and components involved in post-transcriptional procedures were compared in this study between two mutants, QM9414 and Rut C30 for evaluating the effects of modification and secretion upon cellulase production. The results showed that cellulase induction by cellulose drastically up-regulated expressions of the sensor of unfolded protein, chaperone and folding-assisted enzymes in endoplasmic reticulum and resulted in unfolded protein response (UPR) and low-grade increase in secretory transporters’ expression similar to that of chemical treatment. Rut C30 demonstrated earlier and more sustainable expressions of elements involved in UPR and lower amount of cellular retained cellulase compared to QM9414, indicating that Rut C30 had hypercellulolytic property partially for its earlier and enhanced UPR to more efficiently dispose of protein. Modifying post-translational peptides and enhancing protein flux to avoid protein accumulation during cellulase production may be a feasible approach for strain improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aunfolded protein response 3atransporters 3agene expression regulation 3apeptides 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3amutants 3aprotein secretion 3aTrichoderma reesei 3achemical treatment 3aendoplasmic reticulum 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aZhang, Dongyuan1 aChen, Shulin0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Oct., v. 30, no. 10 p.2587-2595dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1682-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011000207300001200317506007600329520178000405592002802185506003702213650002402250650001502274650002102289650001802310650001602328650002002344650002202364650001302386650001202399650001802411650001502429650001102444650002902455650001402484650001502498650001802513700001702531700001902548700002502567773011602592856008202708852000902790655001202799IND60632594220221207145010.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063259422DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1648-12doi7 aPMC64032702pmcid7 a308637082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Jagdeep10aSimultaneous laccase production and transformation of bisphenol-A and triclosan using Trametes versicolor  ap. 129.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew age micro-pollutants, bisphenol-A (BPA) and triclosan (TCA), known for their carcinogenic effects in living organisms can effectively be removed from water using laccase from Trametes versicolor. Laccase was produced from T. versicolor JSRK13 in both submerged and solid-state fermentation (SmF and SSF) conditions. In SmF, T. versicolor JSRK13 gave the maximum production of laccase on the 10th day with an activity of 22 U mL⁻ ¹, whereas, in SSF 185 U g⁻ ¹ of the enzyme was produced on the 17th day. Maximum production of laccase was observed with Parthenium as substrate. Parthenium, with a particle size of 3–5 mm having 60% moisture was found to be a suitable substrate for laccase production and simultaneous transformation (LPST) of BPA in a synergistic manner. A one-step concentration using 85% ammonium sulphate followed by dialysis was sufficient to give 6.7-fold purification of laccase from the crude culture filtrate. Transformation of BPA was achieved in both SmF and SSF conditions along with the production of laccase, whereas TCA was degraded with free enzyme only. Above 90% of BPA (55–5 mg L⁻ ¹) was degraded using the LPST strategy with HBT acting as a mediator in the reaction. LPST strategy did not work for TCA as it completely inhibits the growth of T. versicolor JSRK13. TCA was degraded up to 75% (1.5–0.375 mg L⁻ ¹) by the free enzyme. Our study of simultaneous laccase production and transformation proved to be efficacious in case of BPA. The results indicate that industrial and sewage wastewater containing BPA can potentially be treated with T. versicolor JSRK13 laccase. The described strategy can further be used to develop a bioprocess which can work both on solid and liquid wastes containing BPA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aParthenium 3aammonium sulfate 3abioprocessing 3abisphenol A 3acarcinogenicity 3aculture filtrates 3adialysis 3alaccase 3aparticle size 3apollutants 3asewage 3asolid state fermentation 3atriclosan 3awastewater 3awater content1 aKumar, Punit1 aSaharan, Vicky1 aKapoor, Rajeev Kumar0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.129-129dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1648-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245010000212520160200312592002801914650001901942650001601961650002101977650002501998650001902023650001402042650002002056650001202076650001202088650001302100650001502113650002002128650001102148650001302159653003302172653001202205653000902217653001202226653002602238700002402264773011202288856008402400852000902484655001202493IND60753736820221121020238.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075373682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1535432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzadi-Darbandi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6107-645310aRole of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase 1 in nodule development of soybean  aAutoregulation of nodulation (AON) plays a central role in nodulation by inhibiting the formation of excess number of legume root nodules. In this study, the effect of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 1 (GmHMGR1) gene expression on nodulation and the AON system in Glycine max (L.) Merr was investigated. Wild-type soybean (cultivar Bragg) and its near-isogenic supernodulating mutant (nitrate tolerant symbiotic) nts1007 were selected to identify the expression pattern of this gene in rootlets after inoculation by its microsymbiont Bradyrhizobium. For further analysis, the full length of GmHMGR1 and its promoter were cloned after amplification by inverse-PCR and BAC library screening. Also, we constructed an intron hairpin RNA interference (ihpRNAi) and a GmHMGR1 promoter: β-glucuronidase fusion constructs, consequently for suppression of GmHMGR1 and histochemical analysis in transgenic soybean hairy roots induced by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K599. The GmHMGR1 gene was functional during the early stages of nodulation with the AON system having a negative effect on GmHMGR1 expression and nodule formation in wild-type rootlets. GmHMGR1 was particularly expressed in the developing phloem within the root, nodules and nodule lenticels. Expression of GmHMGR1 in transgenic hairy roots was suppressed by RNAi silencing approximately 85% as compared to empty vector controls. This suggests that the GmHMGR1 gene has an important role in triggering nodule formation as its suppression caused a reduction of nodule formation in nts mutant lines with a deficient AON system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aGlycine max 3aRNA interference 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aautoregulation 3acultivars 3agene expression 3aintrons 3amutants 3anitrates 3anodulation 3aoxidoreductases 3aphloem 3asoybeans 0aAutoregulation of nodulation 0aGmHMGR1 0aRNAi 0aSoybean 0aGlycine max (L.) merr1 aGresshoff, Peter M.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 267 p.153543-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1535433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013800177300001800315520095300333592002801286650001501314650001201329650002501341650001701366650001601383650001301399650001201412650001101424650000901435650002501444650002601469650001201495650001801507650002501525650000901550650000901559650001101568650002101579650002001600650001201620651001101632653002401643653001601667653002101683653001601704653001801720700003601738700001801774700002801792700003001820700002101850700001801871700002201889773010701911856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60547692120221119164134.0160903e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054769212DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11075552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoggatz, Christina C.10aFirst report of the nutritional profile and antioxidant potential of Holothuria arguinensis, a new resource for aquaculture in Europe  ap. 2034-2040.  aThis work reports for the first time the nutritional profile and antioxidant potential of the edible sea cucumber Holothuria arguinensis from the North-eastern Atlantic. H. arguinensis has high levels of protein, with the amino acids profile dominated by alanine, glycine and proline and low lysine/arginine ratios. Its carbohydrate and energetic contents are also low as well as the total lipid levels, although its lipid profile is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. In addition, H. arguinensis has high levels of calcium. The water and ethanol extracts show ability to scavenge free radicals and to chelate copper and iron ions. Our results indicate that H. arguinensis has a balanced nutritional quality suitable for human consumption. In addition, it contains compounds with antioxidant potential; thus its intake can contribute for a healthy and well-balanced diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria 3aalanine 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquaculture 3aarginine 3acalcium 3acopper 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aions 3airon 3alysine 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aproline 3aEurope 0aNutritional profile 0aamino acids 0afunctional foods 0afatty acids 0asea cucumbers1 aGonzález-Wangüemert, Mercedes1 aPereira, Hugo1 aRodrigues, Maria João,1 ada Silva, Manuela Moreira1 aBarreira, Luísa1 aVarela, João1 aCustódio, Luísa0 tNatural product research.g2016 Sept. 16, v. 30, no. 18 p.2034-2040dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2015.11075553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008300182300001800265500000900283520186200292592002802154650002302182650002302205650002702228650004302255650001302298650001902311650001602330650002802346650001002374650002802384650001302412650001602425650000902441650002102450650001802471650001302489650001602502700002602518700002002544773015002564856009602714852000902810655001202819IND60667968720221121062831.0191125e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066796872DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1990.03615995005400040015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartel, Peter G.10aGrowth of Genetically Altered Pseudomonas solanacearum in Soil and Rhizosphere  ap. 1021-1025.  aepub  aThe extent to which a bacterium can grow in soil and in the rhizosphere is influenced by the presence or absence of various genes. The effect of genetic alteration of the egl gene, encoding a β-1,4-endoglucanase, on the growth of Pseudomonas solanacearum E.F. Smith (the causal agent of bacterial wilt) in soil and in the rhizosphere of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) was determined. Endoglucanase production by P. solanacearum was either inactivated by transposon (Tn5) insertion mutagenesis or enhanced twofold by increasing the egl copy number with a recombinant plasmid (pHE3). In a test of the stability of the genetic alterations in two different soils, the transposon in the chromosome was detectable for >120 d, but the recombinant plasmid was apparently lost after 14 d in one soil and after 120 d in the other. In comparison to the wild-type strain, the generation times of the strains with the transposon and the recombinant plasmid increased 16 and 25%, respectively, in one soil solution and 35 and 53% in the other soil solution; this correlated well with the ability of the strains to grow in the same freshly moistened soils. Under conditions of soil inoculation, the genetically altered strains did not wilt tomato seedings significantly faster or slower than the wild-type strain. Although all of the P. solanacearum strains, including the wild type, grew in the rhizosphere of gnotobiotically grown tomato plants, none of the strains grew in the rhizosphere of tomato, common purslane, or pearl millet under nonsterile conditions. The data suggest that genetic alterations slow the growth of P. solanacearum in freshly moistened soil, and that endoglucanase is of minor importance to the growth of P. solanacearum under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aPortulaca oleracea 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abacteria 3abacterial wilt 3achromosomes 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agenes 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aplasmids 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil inoculation 3asoil solution 3atomatoes 3atransposons1 aWilliamson, Joseph W.1 aSchell, Mark A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1990 July, v. 54, no. 4 p.1021-1025dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1990.03615995005400040015x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001200188245011500200300001200315506007600327520163900403592002802042596008702070506003702157650002102194650001402215650001402229650001802243650001902261650001902280650001202299650001202311650002702323650001102350650003402361650002002395650002202415650002402437700001702461700001202478700001202490700001402502700001302516700001302529700001602542700001302558773011602571856008202687852000902769655001202778IND60632594320221207145020.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063259432DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1667-y2doi7 aPMC64057872pmcid7 a308637102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Wei10aErythropoietin protects neurons from apoptosis via activating PI3K/AKT and inhibiting Erk1/2 signaling pathway  ap. 131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanism of erythropoietin (EPO) on the cortical neuronal cells insulted with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Different concentrations of EPO were used to determine the anti-apoptosis effect of EPO. In addition, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were added to explore the underlying mechanism of EPO. Cell apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry. The protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, AKT, p-AKT, Erk1/2 and p-Erk1/2 wasmeasured by Western blot. Our results showed that EPO alleviates OGD-induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner; the neuroprotective effect of EPO was further confirmed by the fact that EPO treatment reversed the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, as well as the Bcl-2/Bax ratio as compared with the OGD treatment. In the mechanism part, our results demonstrated that OGD and EPO nearly had no influence on the protein expression of AKT and Erk1/2 but altered the phosphorylation of them. Specifically, OGD decreased the expression of p-AKT and increased the expression of p-Erk1/2; while, EPO treatment reversed the expression of p-AKT and p-Erk1/2 as compared with OGD treatment. Interestingly, LY294002 decreased the expression of p-AKT and attenuated the neuroprotective effect of EPO; while, U0126 decreased the expression of p-Erk1/2 and enhanced the neuroprotective effect of EPO. Our study demonstrated that EPO protects neurons against apoptosis induced by OGD, which is closely related with activation of PI3K/AKT and inactivation of Erk1/2 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a(Qian Ke He LH Zi [2014]7022)cthe Guizhou science and technology cooperation plan0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3adose response 3aerythropoietin 3aflow cytometry 3aglucose 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxygen 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction1 aWang, Jianyi1 aLi, Mei1 aQu, Hao1 aGu, Ran.,1 aLiu, Rui1 aWang, Lu1 aLi, Shirong1 aHu, Xiao0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.131-131dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1667-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01799naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245004800166300001600214520084200230592002801072650001501100650001401115650002301129650001401152650001601166700002501182700001901207700001801226700001701244773008401261856008401345990002301429852000901452655001201461IND60092550020221120174008.0141103e20130530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009255002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2012.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieta, I.S.10aSn-modified NOX storage/reduction catalysts  ap. 200-211.  aBa-, K-, and Ba–K-based NOX storage/reduction (NSR) catalysts were prepared, with and without Sn as a promotor. Catalysts and catalyst/soot mixtures were evaluated for NOX reduction and soot oxidation under standard NSR cycling conditions. The activity study was accompanied by dispersion measurements, TEM, XRD, and XPS characterization. It was found that modification with Sn did not significantly influence NOX adsorption, however, Sn notably enhanced soot oxidation for Ba-based systems. This was correlated to Pt oxidation state modification. Also the addition of Sn to the Pt–Ba and Pt–Ba–K catalysts lowered the onset temperature of S release. The Pt–Ba–K catalyst had higher stability against S-poisoning, likely due to the preferential adsorption of S onto K-species, partially maintaining Ba sites for NOX trapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aoxidation 3atemperature1 aGarcía-Diéguez, M.1 aLarrubia, M.A.1 aAlemany, L.J.1 aEpling, W.S.0 tCatalysis today.g2013 May 30, v. 207 p.200-211dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2012.04.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014500162520213300307592002802440650001502468650002402483650001402507650001502521650001402536650002302550650001102573650001002584650001402594650001402608650002102622650002302643650004202666650002502708650003002733650001202763650001602775650001402791650002102805650001702826650003402843650002202877700001602899700001702915700001502932700001902947773012602966856007903092852000903171655001203180IND60768260320221119105531.0220225e20220129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076826032DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110202742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yijia 10aBlue Light Alters the Composition of the Jejunal Microbiota and Promotes the Development of the Small Intestine by Reducing Oxidative Stress  aEnvironmental light has an important impact on the growth, development and oxidative stress of chicks. Thus, we investigated the effects of colored lights on microbes and explored the molecular mechanism by which external color light information alters the gut microbiota and induces the cell response in vivo. We raised 96 chicks under 400–700 nm white (WL), 660 nm red (RL), 560 nm green (GL) or 480 nm blue light (BL) for 42 days. We used 16S rRNA high-throughput pyrosequencing and gas chromatography to explore the effect of different monochromatic lights on the jejunal microbiota. We used qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and Elisa to determine the effect of different monochromatic lights on small intestine development and oxidative stress levels. With consistency in the upregulation of antioxidant enzyme ability and anti-inflammatory cytokine level, the 16S rRNA and gas chromatography results showed that BL significantly increased the diversity and richness of the jejunal microbiota and improved the relative abundances of Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium_9 and metabolite butyrate content compared with WL, RL and GL (p < 0.05). In addition, we observed that BL increased the goblet cell numbers, PCNA cell numbers, villus-length-to-crypt-depth (V/C) ratios, ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 protein expression; decreased permeability; and enhanced the digestion and absorption capacity in the jejunum (p < 0.05). In the in vitro experiment, we found that butyrate promoted chick small intestinal epithelial cell (CIEC) proliferation and inhibited apoptosis (p < 0.05). These responses were abrogated by the Gi inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor or AKT inhibitor, but were mimicked by GPR43 agonists or the GSK-3β inhibitor (p < 0.05). Overall, these findings suggested that BL increased the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium_9 and butyrate production. Butyrate may act as one of the signals to mediate blue-light-induced small intestinal development and mucosal barrier integrity enhancement and promote cell proliferation via the GPR43/Gi/PI3K/AKT/p-GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapoptosis 3ablue light 3abutyrates 3acell proliferation 3achicks 3acolor 3acytokines 3adigestion 3aepithelial cells 3agas chromatography 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3ametabolites 3aoccludins 3aoxidative stress 3apermeability 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein synthesis1 aWang, Zixu 1 aDong, Yulan 1 aCao, Jing 1 aChen, Yaoxing 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110202743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013200154520154700286592002801833650001001861650000801871650001201879650001601891650001401907650003401921650001301955650001701968650002201985650002002007650002402027650001202051650001402063650001302077650003002090650001702120650001802137650002702155700001702182700001902199700002402218700001602242773012602258856007402384852000902458655001202467IND60745498720221120070049.0210723e20210717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074549872DNAL7 a10.3390/md190703982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Man 10aCharacterization of an α 4/7-Conotoxin LvIF from Conus lividus That Selectively Blocks α3β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor  aNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a member of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel transmembrane protein composed of five subunits, is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. The nAChRs are associated with various neurological diseases, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and neuralgia. Receptors containing the α3 subunit are associated with analgesia, generating our interest in their role in pharmacological studies. In this study, α-conotoxin (α-CTx) LvIF was identified as a 16 amino acid peptide using a genomic DNA clone of Conus lividus (C. lividus). The mature LvIF with natural structure was synthesized by a two-step oxidation method. The blocking potency of α-CTx lvIF on nAChR was detected by a two-electrode voltage clamp. Our results showed that α-CTx LvIF was highly potent against rα3β2 and rα6/α3β2β3 nAChR subtypes, The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values of α-CTx LvIF against rα3β2 and rα6/α3β2β3 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes were 8.9 nM and 14.4 nM, respectively. Furthermore, α-CTx LvIF exhibited no obvious inhibition on other nAChR subtypes. Meanwhile, we also conducted a competitive binding experiment between α-CTxs MII and LvIF, which showed that α-CTxs LvIF and MII bind with rα3β2 nAChR at the partial overlapping domain. These results indicate that the α-CTx LvIF has high potential as a new candidate tool for the studying of rα3β2 nAChR related neurophysiology and pharmacology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConus 3aDNA 3aXenopus 3aamino acids 3aanalgesia 3aelectric potential difference 3aepilepsy 3aion channels 3amolecular cloning 3aneurophysiology 3anicotinic receptors 3aoocytes 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3aperipheral nervous system 3apharmacology 3aschizophrenia 3atransmembrane proteins1 aYu, Jinpeng 1 aZhu, Xiaopeng 1 aZhangsun, Dongting 1 aLuo, Sulan 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 17, v. 19, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190703983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006500180300001800245500000900263520233300272592002802605650002102633650002202654650001602676650001402692650001402706650002102720650001302741650002002754650000902774650002102783650002902804650002602833650001202859650000902871650001402880650000902894651001302903700002202916773015102938856009603089852000903185655001203194IND60667968820221121062905.0191125e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066796882DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1982.03615995004600050026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarak, Phillip14aThe Evaluation of Iron Deficiency Using a Bioassay-type Test  ap. 1019-1022.  aepub  aExperiments to establish a bioassay-type pot test for the evaluation of iron deficiency in soils were performed. Peanut plants cv. Shulamit were grown in small pots (500 g of soil) for 5 weeks in six soils varying in CaCO₃ content from 3.6 to 63.0%. Control and FeEDDHA (ethylenediamine di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) treatments were employed. Chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured at the end of the growth period. A significant linear correlation was found between the relative chlorophyll content of leaves (FeEDDHA = 100) and the total CaCO₃ or active lime content (r = 0.892 and 0.940, respectively). Chlorosis was completely remediable with the addition of FeEDDHA. A mountain rendzina soil containing 63% CaCO₃ caused the most severe chlorosis. An experiment was conducted in which the chlorophyll content of FeEDDHA-treated and untreated peanut plants grown on this soil was compared. This experiment was repeated at three different times of the year. Some variability was found in chlorophyll content of either treated or untreated plants when absolute numbers were compared. However, when chlorophyll content of the untreated plants was expressed as percent of that of FeEDDHA-treated ones, the resulting relative values for the three growth periods were as close as 46.8, 41.7, and 45.0%. The same soil was used for further experimentation with the screening test. Three genotypes of peanuts were tested for Fe-sensitivity: Congo Red, Virginia Bunch Improved, and Shulamit. Congo Red was found to be the most sensitive cultivar as known from former field studies. Iron-enriched peat was prepared in our laboratories and tested as a possible remedy for iron deficiency of Shulamit peanuts grown on the rendzina soil. A positive response curve of plant chlorophyll to iron-enriched peat dosage was obtained reaching levels comparable to FeEDDHA. The growth chamber pot test described provides a simple and efficient tool for the following purposes: (i) screening soils for potential chlorosis problems in peanuts and possibly other plants; (ii) screening peanut cultivars for iron efficiency; and (iii) screening iron-containing fertilizers, and roughly estimating their efficiency and application rates. The iron-enriched peat which was first tested in this work exhibited positive and promising effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3acalcium carbonate 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3acultivars 3aethylenediamines 3agenotype 3agrowth chambers 3airon 3airon fertilizers 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3anutrient deficiencies 3apeanuts 3apeat 3ascreening 3asoil 3aVirginia1 aChen, Y.q(Yona),0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1982 Sept., v. 46, no. 5 p.1019-1022dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1982.03615995004600050026x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165300001400258520154500272592002801817650001601845650001301861650002401874650002101898650002901919650002001948650001001968650001601978650001001994650001802004650001502022650001502037650001402052650001302066650002902079653001502108653000702123653001402130653001202144653001102156653000902167700001402176700001302190773010302203856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60556942220221119154452.0161115e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055694222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qian10aPrometryn and humic acid induce Cytochrome P450 1A expression in Danio rerio (zebrafish)  ap. 40-47.  aHumic acid (HA) is a major component of dissolved organic matter, is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and influences the biological toxicity of organic pollutants. In this study, we investigated the cytochrome P450 1A (CYP 1A) mRNA expression and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the gills and liver of zebrafish following exposure to the s-triazine herbicide prometryn with or without HA present. Prometryn induced both CYP 1A mRNA expression and EROD activity. The CYP 1A mRNA expression of zebrafish that were exposed to a combination of prometryn and HA was increased compared to those exposed to prometryn alone. A likely cause for CYP 1A induction is the impact of special components of HA, functioning as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists. In combination with HA, these increase prometryn levels in tissues. Similar results for EROD activity were evident. In our time course study, CYP 1A mRNA expression reached maximum values during 24h. This revealed CYP 1A mRNA transcription as a comparatively sensitive toxicity index. In a recovery experiment, we found a faster decrease of CYP 1A mRNA expression to control levels (CK) in gills compared to liver tissue. Following exposure to HA, CYP 1A mRNA expression in liver tissue displayed a faster decrease to CK levels. HA induced enhanced metabolic rates for prometryn. In contrast, recovery regularity of CYP 1A expression in gills was independent of the presence of HA. This result indicates different detoxification mechanisms for HA in liver and gills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aagonists 3aaquatic environment 3acytochrome P-450 3adissolved organic matter 3agene expression 3agills 3ahumic acids 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3apollutants 3aprometryn 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aHerbicides 0aHA 0aZebrafish 0aTissues 0aCYP 1A 0aEROD1 aShi, Feng1 aZhu, Lin0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Jan., v. 135 p.40-47dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245011000157300001600267520224400283592002802527650002802555650001202583650001302595650002602608650001302634650001002647650001102657650001102668650001302679650001202692773009602704856007102800852000902871655001202880IND60518919020221122042653.0160419e199401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051891902DNAL7 a10.2307/19393942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, Earl E.10aOntogenetic Scaling of Competitive Relations: Size‐Dependent Effects and Responses in Two Anuran Larvae  ap. 197-213.  aThis study examines size—dependent competitive interactions between larvae of two species of ranid frogs, the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and the green frog (R. clamitans). Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species—class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, effected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher or affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size—structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size—scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3abiomass 3abreeding 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3afrogs 3alarvae 3amodels 3aontogeny 3asurveys0 tEcology.g1994 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.197-213dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19393943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001800280520092900298592002801227650001101255650002601266650004901292650001101341650002401352650001401376650002401390650001301414650001001427650001601437650003701453700002201490700002201512700001701534700001801551700001401569700002101583773012201604856008101726852000901807655001201816IND60625333420221117220922.0181207e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062533342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5752-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanina, B.

It is shown that all studied steels are characterized by a nonhomogeneous distribution of alloying elements on the fine scale: from 3 to 5 nm in CrMnCN steels to about 30 nm in MnC Hadfield type steel. In the CN steels, their chemical homogeneity is improved by decreasing the C/N ratio. A ferromagnetic-type temperature behavior is observed in the CN steels at temperatures below 86 K, which is attributed to the blocking of magnetic moments of superparamagnetic clusters. The short-range decomposition of all studied steels results in a different splitting of dislocations, which corresponds to two different values of the stacking fault energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3aneutron diffraction 3anitrogen 3asteel 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTyshchenko, A.

This limitation thus prevents implementation of catalytic incineration in a growing number of jurisdictions which require complete CO oxidation. The aim of this study is therefore to develop a catalyst for CO oxidation which is effective in the presence of SO₂ and water over a temperature range of 573–873K, which is the typical adiabatic temperature range for Claus tail gas incineration. In this research, two Au–La₂O₃–TiO₂ nano-catalysts have been prepared using, in one case, deposition of Au and La₂O₃ on TiO₂ nano-materials and, in a second case, by deposition of Au on a co-precipitated TiO₂–La₂O₃ nano-material. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. The resulting materials showed very high CO conversion above 323K and remained active over prolonged periods in the presence of SO₂ and other sulfur compounds. The very high catalytic activity of the co-precipitated catalyst was attributed to the presence of cationic Au and a low level of sulfate formation on the nano-fiber support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron microscopy 3agold 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aSui, Ruohong1 aDowling, Norman I.1 aHuang, Minming1 aLo, John M.H.0 tCatalysis today.g2013 May 30, v. 207 p.212-219dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2012.05.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245005200202300001600254506007600270520132000346592002801666506003701694650001401731650002001745650002401765650002501789650002401814650001001838650001101848650002601859650001401885700002001899700001701919700001601936700001601952700002001968773013201988856007402120852000902194655001202203IND60480135220221207063142.0160125e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048013522DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.137982doi7 aPMC49136702pmcid7 a266477832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozorgmanesh, R.10aAtrial Fibrillation in Eight New World Camelids  ap. 335-338.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: There is limited information on the incidence of clinical signs, concurrent illness and treatment options for atrial fibrillation (AF) in New World Camelids (NWC). OBJECTIVE: Describe clinical signs and outcome of AF in NWC. ANIMALS: Eight New World Camelids admitted with AF. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of camelids diagnosed with AF based on characteristic findings on electrocardiogram (ECG). RESULTS: All animals had an irregularly irregular heart rhythm detected on physical examination and 4 cases had obtunded mentation on admission. Three camelids were diagnosed with AF secondary to oleander intoxication, 3 animals had underlying cardiovascular disease, 1 was diagnosed with lone AF and 1 had AF diagnosed on examination for a urethral obstruction. Five of eight animals survived to discharge and nonsurvivors consisted of animals which died or were euthanized as a result of cardiovascular disease (2/8) or extra‐cardiac disease unrelated to the AF (1/8). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Atrial fibrillation occurs in NWC in association with cardiovascular disease, extra‐cardiac disease or as lone AF. Amiodarone and transthoracic cardioversion were attempted in one llama with lone AF, but were unsuccessful. Atrial fibrillation was recorded in 0.1% of admissions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelidae 3aNerium oleander 3aatrial fibrillation 3aclinical examination 3aelectrocardiography 3aheart 3allamas 3aobservational studies 3apoisoning1 aMagdesian, K.G.1 aEstell, K.E.1 aStern, J.A.1 aSwain, E.A.1 aGriffiths, L.G.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2016 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.335-338dJ.B.

However, the relationship between them in plant response to stress, especially heavy stress, is largely unclear. This study demonstrated that both AsA and NO could enhance the tolerance of wheat seedlings to cadmium stress evidenced by root length change, which resulted from their roles in maintaining the balance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reducing the absorption of Cd. Furthermore, exogenous AsA led to a significant increase of NO content and endogenous AsA content in wheat roots, which could be weakened by the NO scavenger c-PTIO. In addition, c-PTIO also inhibits the NO-induced production of endogenous AsA. Although the AsA synthesis inhibitor lycorine significantly inhibited the inductive effect of exogenous AsA on endogenous AsA production, it has little effect on NO content. In addition, we found that the protective effects of NO and AsA on Cd stress were removed by c-PTIO and lycorine. These results indicated that NO accumulation could be necessary for exogenous AsA-induced cadmium tolerance and endogenous AsA production, and the exogenous AsA-induced endogenous AsA production was likely mediated by NO signaling pathways and together they induced the tolerance of wheat to cadmium stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotective effect 3anitric oxide 3aabsorption 3areactive oxygen species 3aseedlings 3astress response 3asignal transduction 3acadmium 3awheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant response 3astress tolerance 3aroots 3alycorine 3aascorbic acid 0aAscorbic acid 0aOxidative stress 0aantioxidants 0aRedox homeostasis 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aCadmium 0aWheat1 aLi, Qien1 aWu, Weiguo1 aGuo, Jie1 aYang, Yingli0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Jan., v. 135 p.75-81dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015900164300002000323520150600343592002801849650001301877650001501890650001601905650001901921650001601940650001201956650002201968650001101990650002602001650001502027650002202042650001602064650001602080650002602096653002002122653005302142653002002195653003402215653003102249700002102280700001902301700001902320700002102339700002102360700002202381773012602403856008002529852000902609655001202618IND60586384120221121170504.0171213e20171122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058638412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b117522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos, Emanuel10aBoosting Electrical Performance of High-κ Nanomultilayer Dielectrics and Electronic Devices by Combining Solution Combustion Synthesis and UV Irradiation  ap. 40428-40437.  aIn the past decade, solution-based dielectric oxides have been widely studied in electronic applications enabling the use of low-cost processing technologies and device improvement.

However, in the case of HfOₓ, a high temperature usually is needed to induce a uniform and condensed film, which limits its applications in flexible electronics. This paper describes how to obtain HfOₓ dielectric thin films and the effect of their implementation in multilayer dielectrics (MLD) at low temperatures (150 °C) to apply in thin film transistors (TFTs) using the combination of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and ultraviolet (UV) treatment. The single layers and multilayers did not show any trace of residual organics and exhibited a small surface roughness (<1.2 nm) and a high breakdown voltage (>2.7 MV·cm–¹). The resulting TFTs presented a high performance at a low operation voltage (<3 V), with high saturation mobility (43.9 ± 1.1 cm²·V–¹·s–¹), a small subthreshold slope (0.066 ± 0.010 V·dec–¹), current ratio of 1 × 10⁶ and a good idle shelf life stability after 2 months. To our knowledge, the results achieved surpass the actual state-of-the-art. Finally, we demonstrated a low-voltage diode-connected inverter using MLD/IGZO TFTs working with a maximum gain of 1 at 2 V.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acombustion 3adielectrics 3aelectric power 3aelectronics 3ahafnium 3amaterials science 3aoxides 3aprocessing technology 3ashelf life 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atransistors 3aultraviolet radiation 0alow temperature 0ananomultilayer dielectric oxides (AlOx and HfOx) 0aDUV irradiation 0asolution combustion synthesis 0alow operating voltage TFTs1 aBranquinho, Rita1 aKiazadeh, Asal1 aMartins, Jorge1 aBarquinha, Pedro1 aMartins, Rodrigo1 aFortunato, Elvira0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Nov. 22, v. 9, no. 46 p.40428-40437dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b117523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010500167300001400272520097100286592002801257650001901285650001401304650002301318650001301341650002401354650001201378650001101390650001001401650001601411700002401427700001701451773008201468856008401550990002301634852000901657655001201666IND60092550420221120173953.0141103e20130530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009255042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2012.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBej, Barnali10aProduction of hydrogen by steam reforming of methane over alumina supported nano-NiO/SiO₂ catalyst  ap. 28-35.  aSteam reforming of methane (SRM) was carried out over alumina supported nano NiO catalyst in silica synthesized using sol–gel method. The crystallite size of NiO in NiO–SiO₂ catalysts was found to vary with the calcination temperature and the extent of Ni loading in the catalyst. The NiO crystallite size was found to be 9–15nm in the Ni loading range of 5–15% and calcinations temperature range of 350–500°C studied. Catalyst containing 10% Ni was found to be the best one for steam reforming reaction in terms of methane conversion. The catalyst was found to be very active and stable in the temperature range of 500–700°C. The most favorable reaction condition was established at a temperature of 700°C, steam to methane molar ratio of 3.5 and a space–time of 11.31kgcath/kmol of inlet methane. At this optimum condition, the conversion of methane was 95.7% and the yield of hydrogen was about 3.8moles of hydrogen per mole of methane reacted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3asilica 3asteam 3atemperature1 aPradhan, Narayan C.1 aNeogi, Swati0 tCatalysis today.g2013 May 30, v. 207 p.28-35dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2012.04.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010000158300001600258520194900274592002802223650002002251650001702271650001102288650001902299650001502318650002602333650001702359650001802376650001102394650001102405650002302416650002102439650001102460650002202471650001102493700002002504700001702524700001602541700002002557700001602577773009602593856007102689852000902760655001202769IND60518919220221122042451.0160419e199401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051891922DNAL7 a10.2307/19393902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollinger, D. Y.10aCarbon Dioxide Exchange between an Undisturbed Old‐Growth Temperate Forest and the Atmosphere  ap. 134-150.  aWe used the eddy—correlation technique to investigate the exchange of CO₂ between an undisturbed old—growth forest and the atmosphere at a remote Southern Hemisphere site on 15 d between 1989 and 1990. Our goal was to determine how environmental factors regulate ecosystem CO₂ exchange, and to test whether present knowledge of leaf—level processes was sufficient to understand ecosystem—level exchange. On clear summer days the maximum rate of net ecosystem CO₂ uptake exceeded 15 μmol°m— ²°s— ¹, about an order of magnitude greater than the maximum values observed on sunny days in the winter. Mean nighttime respiration rates varied between °—2 and —7 μmol°m— ²°s— ¹. Nighttime CO₂ efflux rate roughly doubled with a 10°C increase in temperature. Daytime variation in net ecosystem CO₂ exchange rate was primarily associated with changes in total photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). Air temperature, saturation deficit, and the diffuse PPFD were of lesser, but still significant, influence. These results are in broad agreement with expectations based on the biochemistry of leaf gas exchange and penetration of radiation through a canopy. However, at night, the short—term exchange of CO₂ between the forest and the atmosphere appeared to be regulated principally by atmospheric transport processes. There was a positive linear relationship between nocturnal CO₂ exchange rate and downward sensible heat flux density. This new result has implications for the development of models for diurnal ecosystem CO₂ exchange. The daytime light—use efficiency of the ecosystem (CO₂ uptake/incident PPFD) was between 1.6 and 7.1 mmol/mol on clear days in the summer but decreased to 0.8 mmol/mol after frosts on clear winter days. Ecosystem CO₂ uptake was enhanced by diffuse PPFD, a result of potentially global significance given recent increases in Northern Hemisphere haze.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abiochemistry 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agas exchange 3aheat transfer 3aleaves 3amodels 3aold-growth forests 3arespiratory rate 3asummer 3atemperate forests 3awinter1 aKelliher, F.

Methods to correct lidar elevation data are available, but a reliable method that requires limited field work and maintains spatial resolution is lacking. We present a novel method, the Lidar Elevation Adjustment with NDVI (LEAN), to correct lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) with vegetation indices from readily available multispectral airborne imagery (NAIP) and RTK-GPS surveys. Using 17 study sites along the Pacific coast of the U.S., we achieved an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.072m, with a 40–75% improvement in accuracy from the lidar bare earth DEM. Results from our method compared favorably with results from three other methods (minimum-bin gridding, mean error correction, and vegetation correction factors), and a power analysis applying our extensive RTK-GPS dataset showed that on average 118 points were necessary to calibrate a site-specific correction model for tidal marshes along the Pacific coast. By using available imagery and with minimal field surveys, we showed that lidar-derived DEMs can be adjusted for greater accuracy while maintaining high (1m) resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3alidar 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asalt marshes 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aUnited States 0aRTK-GPS surveys 0aAccuracy 0aLEAN 0aNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 0aSea-level rise1 aDugger, Bruce D.1 aThorne, Karen M.1 aTakekawa, John Y.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 186 p.616-625dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01062naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007400158520027200232592002800504650002400532650001000556650001700566650001600583773012600599856007400725852000900799655001200808IND60745499120221120070100.0210723e20210720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074549912DNAL7 a10.3390/md190704012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠimat, Vida 10aNutraceuticals and Pharmaceuticals from Marine Fish and Invertebrates  aThe word nutraceutical is coined from two words, “nutrition” and “pharmaceutical”, describing natural sources of molecules or substances that have physiological benefit, and the ability to protect human health and well-being and prevent chronic diseases [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3ahuman health 3amarine fish0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 20, v. 19, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190704013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009300168300001400261520132400275592002801599650001501627650001501642650001501657650000901672650001301681650001801694650000701712650001901719650002001738650002301758650001701781650001601798650001501814650002001829650002301849650000901872653001501881653001801896653001301914653001301927653001801940700001801958700001701976700001901993700002202012773010302034856008402137852000902221655001202230IND60556942520221119154333.0161115e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055694252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChawla, Sneha10aZinc peroxide nanomaterial as an adsorbent for removal of Congo red dye from waste water  ap. 68-74.  aIn the past decade, various natural byproducts, advanced metal oxide composites and photocatalysts have been reported for removal of dyes from water. Although these materials are useful for select applications, they have some limitations such as use at fixed temperature, ultra violet (UV) light and the need for sophisticated experimental set up. These materials can remove dyes up to a certain extent but require long time. To overcome these limitations, a promising adsorbent zinc peroxide (ZnO2) nanomaterial has been developed for the removal of Congo red (CR) dye from contaminated water. ZnO2 is highly efficient even in the absence of sunlight to remove CR from contaminated water upto the permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States- Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA). The adsorbent has a specific property to adjust the pH of the test solution within 6.5–7.5 range irrespective of acidic or basic nature of water. The adsorption capacity of the material for CR dye was 208mgg−1 within 10min at 2–10pH range. The proposed material could be useful for the industries involved in water purification. The removal of CR has been confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The adsorption data followed a second order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abyproducts 3adyes 3aindustry 3ananomaterials 3apH 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater purification 3azinc 0aAdsorption 0aCongo red dye 0aIsotherm 0aKinetics 0aZinc peroxide1 aUppal, Himani1 aYadav, Mohit1 aBahadur, Nupur1 aNāhara Siṅgha,0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Jan., v. 135 p.68-74dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013900166300001800305520150400323592002801827650002101855650001301876650001601889650002001905650002601925650001201951650001001963650001501973650001401988650001702002650001702019650002902036700001302065700001702078700001802095700001702113700001602130700001202146700001602158700001802174773011002192856008102302852000902383655001202392IND60465946920221120040850.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046594692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-015-1034-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingyan10aMultiplicity of 3-ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenase enzymes in Gordonia neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 with preferences for different steroids  ap. 1961-1971.  aThe presence of redundant genes in a genome might enable bacteria to adapt to varying environmental conditions. The genus Gordonia comprises metabolically diverse bacteria that can degrade a wide range of persistent compounds. This paper reports the multiplicity of genes encoding 3-ketosteroid Δ¹-dehydrogenase (KstD) in Gordonia neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. KstD is one of the key enzymes in microbial steroid catabolism. Five kstD homologues (kstD1–kstD5) distributed over several phylogenetic groups were investigated in G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. Escherichia coli cells expressing kstD homologues were used to transform different steroids, including cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), progesterone, and 16α,17α-epoxyprogesterone. All five enzymes displayed KstD activity toward 3-ketosteroids, but none were able to transform 3-hydroxysteroid substrates such as cholesterol. KstD2, KstD3, and KstD5 catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction of 16α,17α-epoxyprogesterone, while KstD1, KstD3, and KstD4 transformed AD into androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression of kstD1, kstD3, and kstD4 was upregulated during culture in cholesterol or AD when compared with expression during culture in pyruvic acid. kstD2 and kstD5 were uniquely induced by cholesterol. Thus, the presence of multiple kstD genes in the G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 genome facilitates a dynamic and fine-tuned response to environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acholesterol 3adehydrogenation 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3aprogesterone 3apyruvic acid 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRen, Yao1 aHe, Junzhong1 aCheng, Shijun1 aYuan, Jiadai1 aGe, Fanglan1 aLi, Wei1 aZhang, Ying1 aXie, Gangrong0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.1961-1971dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-015-1034-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010400171300001800275520075600293592002801049650001801077650001201095650002601107650002701133650001601160650002001176650001301196650001501209651001501224651001101239651001001250653001101260653001301271653001601284653002401300700002201324700001701346700002301363773010701386856008501493852000901578655001201587IND60547692520221119164027.0160903e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054769252DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11075592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmorello, Diana10aDiscrimination of almonds (Prunus dulcis) geographical origin by minerals and fatty acids profiling  ap. 2107-2110.  aTwenty-one almond samples from three different geographical origins (Sicily, Spain and California) were investigated by determining minerals and fatty acids compositions.

Small-scale gasifiers produce a gaseous fuel, commonly referred to as producer gas, with relatively low heating value. Thus, the most common energy conversion systems that are coupled with small-scale gasifiers are internal combustion engines. In order to increase the electrical efficiency, the operators choose dual fuel engines and mix the producer gas with diesel. The Wiebe function has been a valuable tool for assessing the efficiency of dual fuel internal combustion engines. This study introduces a thermodynamic model that works in parallel with the Wiebe function and calculates the emissions of the engines. This “vis-à-vis” approach takes into consideration the actual conditions inside the cylinders—as they are returned by the Wiebe function—and calculates the final thermodynamic equilibrium of the flue gases mixture. This approach aims to enhance the operation of the dual fuel internal combustion engines by identifying the optimal operating conditions and—at the same time—advance pollution control and minimize the environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aeconomic incentives 3aemissions 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental impact 3aflue gas 3afuels 3ainternal combustion engines 3amixing 3apollution control 3aproducer gas 3asupply balance 3athermodynamic models1 aCaligiuri, Carlo1 aMoustakas, Konstantinos1 aMalamis, Dimitris1 aRenzi, Massimiliano1 aBaratieri, Marco0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 36 p.35866-35873dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1647-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245017300158300002000331520155000351592002801901650002501929650002401954650002601978650001502004650000902019650001902028650003102047650001502078650001902093650001802112650001402130650001702144653002702161653002102188653002202209653002302231653002502254653002502279700001202304700001302316700001802329700001502347700001202362700001402374700001602388700001602404700001802420700001202438773012602450856008002576852000902656655001202665IND60586384420221121170425.0171213e20171122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058638442DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b119262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Qing10aBSA–Bioinspired Gadolinium Hybrid-Functionalized Hollow Gold Nanoshells for NIRF/PA/CT/MR Quadmodal Diagnostic Imaging-Guided Photothermal/Photodynamic Cancer Therapy  ap. 40017-40030.  aMultimodal imaging-guided synergistic therapy promises a more accurate diagnosis and higher therapeutic efficiency than single imaging modality or their simple “mechanical” combination. In this research, we have constructed an innovative multifunctional drug delivery platform by gadolinium (Gd)-based bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrid-coated hollow gold nanoshells (Au@BSA–Gd). The obtained nanoparticles exhibited excellent photothermal effect and computed tomography (CT)/photoacoustic (PA) activity. Besides, the BSA–bioinspired gadolinium complex endowed the nanoparticles with an excellent T₁ contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, the near-infrared (NIR) absorbing phototherapeutic agent [indocyanine green (ICG)] was loaded into the Au@BSA–Gd nanoparticles because of their unique, hollow, and porous structures, thus possessing photodynamic/photothermal property and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/PA imaging capability. As a result, a combined cancer therapy containing the photothermal therapy of Au@BSA–Gd and the synchronous photodynamic/photothermal therapy of ICG was constructed. Furthermore, the well-designed nanocomposites with multiple integrated modalities enabled them to be an ideal nanotheranostic agent for NIRF/PA/CT/MR quadmodal imaging. Therefore, the ICG-loaded albumin–bioinspired gadolinium hybrid-functionalized hollow gold nanoshells (ICG–Au@BSA–Gd) hold great promise as a theranostic platform for simultaneous therapeutic monitoring and precise cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3acomputed tomography 3adrug delivery systems 3agadolinium 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphototherapy 0ahollow gold nanoshells 0aBSA−Gd hybrids 0aindocyanine green 0aquadmodal imagings 0aphotothermal therapy 0aphotodynamic therapy1 aSun, Qi1 aYu, Meng1 aWang, Jinping1 aWang, Siyu1 aLiu, Li1 aCheng, Yu1 aWang, Yidan1 aSong, Yilin1 aTan, Fengping1 aLi, Nan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Nov. 22, v. 9, no. 46 p.40017-40030dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b119263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245014500207520125800352592002801610650002801638650001101666650001301677650002001690650002401710653002101734653002001755653001901775653000801794653002401802653001201826653001101838653002401849653002401873653002701897700005601924700006101980700005602041773009802097856008702195852000902282655001202291IND60775530220221119185441.0220531e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077553022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yili1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7511-291010aDevelopment and comparative selection of surrogate models using artificial neural network for an integrated regenerative transcritical cycle  aSurrogate models are becoming increasingly important in replacing the computationally-expensive physics-based simulation models in many applications, such as system optimization, sensitivity analysis and design space exploration. As one of the fastest-growing field, machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) have been adapted to model various energy systems. In the present study, five ANN-based surrogate models are developed in replacing the physics-based model of a novel regenerative transcritical power cycle using methanol as the working fluid that is integrated with a small modular reactor. The input layer of the surrogate models consists of the seven design parameters of the cycle, and the output layer returns the 1st-law efficiency, levelized cost of energy and penalty. The evaluation results show that all five candidate surrogate models have demonstrated high R2 score, low relative absolute errors (RAE) and low L1 losses, with the separate multi-layer feed-forward (MLF) neural network model outperforming the others. Once coupled with global optimization, the surrogate model is expected to find the optimal design parameters in order to minimize levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and penalty value in the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aenergy 3amethanol 3aneural networks 3asystem optimization 0aMachine learning 0aSurrogate model 0aNeural network 0aMLF 0aDeep neural network 0a1-D CNN 0aResNET 0aThermodynamic model 0aTranscritical cycle 0aSmall modular reactors1 aBryan, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5735-21951 aRichards, Geordie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0753-60461 aWang, Hailei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3037-13420 tApplied energy.g2022 July 01, v. 317 p.119146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245005600180300001600236500000900252520047800261592002800739650001400767650000900781650001400790650000900804650001400813650001300827650001100840700001700851773014800868856009601016852000901112655001201121IND60667969320221120061510.0191125e196803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066796932DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200020016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunishi, H.

The optimal threshold for an urban object was determined by comparing the reference threshold with that of a target year through object-based normalization. Threshold normalization assumed the stability or limited change of NTL intensity over time for pseudo invariant pixels. An experiment was conducted in China to detect its urban areas in 2005 and 2010 from DMSP/OLS F152005 and F182010 NTL images by using the estimated object-based thresholds predicted from DMSP/OLS F152000 NTL data and reference urban data. Results showed that the proposed method can successfully relate thresholds among years. The estimated thresholds were highly correlated with the reference, with R2 of 0.96 and 0.92 and RMSE of 2.9 and 4.1pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the object level, R2 and RMSE of the estimated vs. the reference urban areas yielded 0.94 and 12.5pixels and 0.88 and 21.2pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. At the provincial level, R2 reached 0.94 and 0.91 with RMSE of 230.7 and 336.7pixels for 2005 and 2010, respectively. The assessment of derived urban maps for 141 sample cities yielded an overall accuracy of 95.19% and 94.09% and Kappa of 0.56 and 0.53 in 2005 and 2010, respectively. The proposed method shows great potentials to update urban extents in a timely and cost-effective manner and to detect global urban dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acost effectiveness 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aDMSP/OLS nighttime light 0aObject-based thresholding 0aObject-based normalization 0aPseudo invariant features 0aUrban areas1 aWeng, Qihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2498-09340 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 187 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006100160300001600221520137700237592002801614650002001642650001401662650001301676650001901689650001201708650001101720650002001731650001601751650000901767700002501776700002301801700002001824700003201844700002501876773011801901856007402019852000902093655001202102IND60408614220221121222704.0150916e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040861422DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.121772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁbel, Marietta10aUltrasonically Assisted Ultrafiltration of Whey Solution  ap. 467-473.  aThe ultrafiltration of whey solutions is a common feature of dairy processes. However, the frequent fouling of ultrafiltration membranes and the subsequent cleaning cycle significantly affects the economics of the process. In this work, we investigated the effect of ultrasonically assisted ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration of whey solution was investigated in order to determine the main parameters affecting the flux, retention and membrane fouling. The experiments were carried out with an ultrasonic combined laboratory ultrafiltration device, using regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes. The results showed that increasing resistance during filtration is predominantly caused by the concentration polarization, while the participation of membrane fouling in the total resistance is negligible. The ultrasonically assisted ultrafiltration actively reduces the concentration polarization layer resistance. The retention changed slightly with ultrasound power. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Combination of ultrasound and ultrafiltration processes in dairy industry may enhance the efficiency of whey separation processes during ultrafiltration of why solutions. The given model for describing the filtration mechanism and modified Reynolds number for ultrasonically assisted batch reactor allow the scale up of coupled ultrafiltration process for dairy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acellulose 3acleaning 3adairy industry 3afouling 3amodels 3aultrafiltration 3aultrasonics 3awhey1 aKiss, Zsolt László1 aBeszédes, Sándor1 aHodúr, Cecilia1 aKeszthelyi‐Szabó, Gábor1 aLászló, Zsuzsanna,0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.467-473dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.121773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012600173520119200299592002801491650002401519650002301543650001901566650001101585650001801596650001601614650001301630653003501643653003401678653001901712653002301731653002201754700002301776773009801799856008701897852000901984655001201993IND60775530320221119185533.0220502e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077553032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Ruby-Jean10aExperimental investigation into cascade thermochemical energy storage system using SrCl2-cement and zeolite-13X materials  aSignificant improvements can be made to thermochemical energy storage system, through heat transfer and thermodynamics analysis. A cascade thermochemical energy storage system has been theoretically shown to improve thermal and exergy energy efficiencies. In this work, an open, cascade system using zeolite 13X and SrCl₂-cement composite material is investigated in a lab-scale reactor and compared to the traditional single material systems. The two materials were chosen based on their respective hydration and dehydration requirements. The volumetric energy density ranged from 108–138 kWh m⁻³ with dehydration temperatures of 50–130 °C and hydration conditions of 12 °C, 75% RH. The thermal and exergy efficiencies were analysed for each system. It was found that the cascaded system improves power output and temperature lift. Furthermore, the cascade system improved exergy efficiency by 6–38% when compared to a traditional salt-based system. This research demonstrates how a cascade thermochemical energy storage system can be cost-effective whilst still maintaining high energy density, power output and temperature lift over a range of dehydration temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy density 3aexergy 3aheat transfer 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aCascade thermochemical storage 0aThermochemical energy storage 0aEnergy density 0aThermal efficiency 0aExergy efficiency1 aMansūrī, Ādila,0 tApplied energy.g2022 June 15, v. 316 p.119145-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1191453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015000172300001600322520131700338592002801655650000901683650001501692650001301707650001001720650001001730650001101740650001101751650001801762650001501780650001901795650000901814650001901823650001301842650002301855650001501878651003101893651001201924700002001936700002401956700002201980700002502002700002502027700001902052773009202071856008302163852000902246655001202255IND60082911720221118004635.0141101e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008291172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2011.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Kenneth L.12aA loess–paleosol record of climate and glacial history over the past two glacial–interglacial cycles (~150ka), southern Jackson Hole, Wyoming  ap. 119-141.  aLoess accumulated on a Bull Lake outwash terrace of Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6) age in southern Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The 9 m section displays eight intervals of loess deposition (Loess 1 to Loess 8, oldest), each followed by soil development. Our age-depth model is constrained by thermoluminescence, meteoric ¹⁰Be accumulation in soils, and cosmogenic ¹⁰Be surface exposure ages. We use particle size, geochemical, mineral-magnetic, and clay mineralogical data to interpret loess sources and pedogenesis. Deposition of MIS 6 loess was followed by a tripartite soil/thin loess complex (Soils 8, 7, and 6) apparently reflecting the large climatic oscillations of MIS 5. Soil 8 (MIS 5e) shows the strongest development. Loess 5 accumulated during a glacial interval (~76–69ka; MIS 4) followed by soil development under conditions wetter and probably colder than present. Deposition of thick Loess 3 (~43–51ka, MIS 3) was followed by soil development comparable with that observed in Soil 1. Loess 1 (MIS 2) accumulated during the Pinedale glaciation and was followed by development of Soil 1 under a semiarid climate. This record of alternating loess deposition and soil development is compatible with the history of Yellowstone vegetation and the glacial flour record from the Sierra Nevada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aglaciation 3aisotopes 3alakes 3aloess 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3arock flour 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil formation 3aterraces 3athermoluminescence 3avegetation 3aSierra Nevada (California) 3aWyoming1 aMuhs, Daniel R.1 aFosberg, Maynard A.1 aMahan, Shannon A.1 aRosenbaum, Joseph G.1 aLicciardi, Joseph M.1 aPavich, M.

We investigated the supportive effect of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) on ROS generation from neutrophils using promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Methods: Differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells were cocultured with TMSCs isolated from 25 independent donors, and ROS generation in dHL-60 cells was measured using luminescence. RNA sequencing and real-time PCR were performed to identify the candidate genes of TMSCs involved in augmenting the oxidative burst of dHL-60 cells. Transcriptome analysis of TMSCs derived from 25 independent donors revealed high levels of procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (PCOLCE2) in TMSCs, which were highly effective in potentiating ROS generation in dHL-60 cells. In addition, PCOLCE2 knockdown in TMSCs abrogated TMSC-induced enhancement of ROS production in dHL-60 cells, indicating that TMSCs increased the oxidative burst in dHL-60 cells via PCOLCE2. Furthermore, the direct addition of recombinant PCOLCE2 protein increased ROS production in dHL-60 cells. These results suggest that PCOLCE2 secreted by TMSCs may be used as a therapeutic candidate to enhance host defences by increasing neutrophil oxidative bursts. PCOLCE2 levels in TMSCs could be used as a marker to select TMSCs exhibiting high efficacy for enhancing neutrophil oxidative bursts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acoculture 3aluminescence 3aneutrophils 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics1 aKim, Hee-Yeon 1 aCho, Kyung-Ah 1 aKim, Yu-Hee 1 aWoo, So-Youn 1 aKim, Han-su,1 aKang, Jihee-Lee 1 aRyu, Kyung-Ha 1 aPark, Joo-Won 0 tBiology.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110202553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245013100178300002000309520127400329592002801603596008001631650001501711650002401726650001801750650001601768650001101784650001601795650000901811650001001820650001201830650001401842650001501856650001601871650001001887650001701897650002201914650000901936700002501945700002101970700004501991773016902036856008102205852000902286655001202295IND60625334020221117220519.0181207e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062533402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1726-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilani, Priscila Aparecida10aAgricultural solid waste for sorption of metal ions, part II: competitive assessment in multielemental solution and lake water  ap. 35906-35914.  aSugarcane bagasse and hydroponic lettuce roots were used as biosorbents for the removal of Cu(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), and Zn(II) from multielemental solutions and lake water, in batch processes. These biomasses were studied in natura (lettuce roots, NLR, and sugarcane bagasse, NSB) and chemically modified with HNO₃ (lettuce roots, MLR, and sugarcane bagasse, MSB). The results showed higher adsorption efficiency for MSB and either NLR or MLR. The maximum adsorption capacities (qₘₐₓ) in multielemental solution for Cu(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), and Zn(II) were 35.86, 31.42, 3.33, and 24.07 mg/g for NLR; 25.36, 27.95, 14.06, and 6.43 mg/g for MLR; 0.92, 3.94, 0.03, and 0.18 mg/g for NSB; and 54.11, 6.52, 16.7, and 1.26 mg/g for MSB, respectively. The kinetic studies with chemically modified biomasses indicated that sorption was achieved in the first 5 min and reached equilibrium around 30 min. Sorption of Cu(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), and Zn(II) in lake water by chemically modified biomasses was 24.31, 14.50, 8.03, and 8.21 mg/g by MLR, and 13.15, 10.50, 6.10, and 5.14 mg/g by MSB, respectively. These biosorbents are promising and low costs agricultural residues, and as for lettuce roots, these showed great potential even with no chemical modification.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/06271-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (BR) 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3abatch systems 3abiosorbents 3acopper 3ahydroponics 3airon 3alakes 3alettuce 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3anitric acid 3aroots 3asolid wastes 3asugarcane bagasse 3azinc1 aConsonni, João Luiz1 aLabuto, Geórgia1 aCarrilho, Elma Neide Vasconcelos Martins0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Dec., v. 25, no. 36 p.35906-35914dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1726-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009000165300001800255520086800273592002801141650002301169650002301192650001101215650003201226650001901258650004401277650001901321650002601340653002301366653002501389653002201414700001301436700001901449700001901468700001801487700001201505700001701517773010701534856008501641852000901726655001201735IND60547692920221119163953.0160903e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054769292DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11107042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chao12aA new triterpenoid saponin from Gleditsia sinensis and its antiproliferative activity  ap. 2065-2070.  aChemical investigation of the anomalous fruits of Gleditsia sinensis led to the isolation and identification of a new triterpenoid saponin, 3- O - β -D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 2)- α -L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 → 6)- β -D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28- O - β -D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 4)- α -L-rhamnopyrano--syl-(1 → 4)- β -D-xylopyranosyl-(1 → 4)- α -L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 3)- β -D-glucopyranosyl ester (1), along with other nine known compounds (2 – 10).

In one, Rh was substituted into the pyrochlore lattice (LRZ, 1.7wt%) while for the second, Rh was supported on an unsubstituted La₂Zr₂O₇ (R/LZ, 1.8wt%). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) results show that the surface reducibility depends on whether the Rh is in (or supported on) the LZ pyrochlore. The total hydrogen consumption in TPR for LRZ (0.28mg H₂/gcₐₜ) is much greater than R/LZ (0.07mg H₂/gcₐₜ), likely due to the presence of a perovskite phase in the LRZ (LaRhO₃; identified by XRD), in which rhodium is more reducible than in R/LZ. The formation of the perovskite accompanies that of the pyrochlore in the synthesis process, which includes heat treatment up to 1000°C. CO hydrogenation results show higher ethanol selectivity for R/LZ than LRZ, possibly due to the strong interaction between Rh and LZ on the R/LZ, forming atomically close Rh⁺/Rh⁰ sites, which have been suggested to favor ethanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3alanthanum 3arhodium 3atemperature1 aShekhawat, Dushyant1 aPoston, James A., Jr.cJr.1 aSpivey, James J.0 tCatalysis today.g2013 May 30, v. 207 p.65-73dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245007300179300001600252520172400268592002801992650001702020650001502037650001402052650001502066650001502081650001902096650001202115650001102127650001802138650001602156650001802172650001902190651001402209700000702223773010702230856005502337852000902392655001202401IND4470525620221118204029.0120921e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447052562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0080.2012.01621.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Patricia Y.,10aTrends in training for nutritionists and dietitians in the Caribbean  ap. 226-230.  aAim: Because of its small size, the case study of the Caribbean region could be instructive in how a diversified profession would strengthen professional growth. This paper aims to describe the historical trends and efforts at restructuring the profession of nutrition and dietetics in the Caribbean to illustrate the processes followed and the progression of training. Methods: Data were collected from members of the Caribbean Association of Nutritionists and Dietitians by two sets of emailed questionnaires. This was followed by a face‐to‐face workshop consultation one year later, and with subsequent small group discussions to achieve consensus. Results: Initial responses revealed 17 pathways to qualification depending on country where trained and the main focus of the curricula. Responses to the second questionnaire detailed post‐didactic training expressed as internship, practicum, supervised practice and/or research. These responses were rationalised in subsequent discussions and consensus reached on relevant professional titles and qualifications. Conclusion: Professional advancement in the future will come from promoting greater diversity of the nutrition and dietetics profession. Graduates with diverse backgrounds are better able in a limited job market, to create niches for themselves in various sectors in addition to health and government. Of necessity is to create a clear image of our unique identity and to minimise confusion with varied professional titles and qualifications. Developing generic training programmes allowed for more effective positioning of our capabilities to potential users of our services and to facilitate free movement of professionals throughout the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acurriculum 3adietetics 3adietitians 3aemployment 3aimage analysis 3amarkets 3aniches 3anutritionists 3aoccupations 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3aCaribbean1 a, 0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2012 Sept., v. 69, no. 3 p.226-230dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2012.01621.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245015600169520140300325592002801728650002401756650001301780650001901793650002101812650001101833650002501844650002301869650001801892700002201910700002601932700002301958700002401981700002502005700002302030700002302053700002502076700002002101700002202121700002602143773012102169856008002290852000902370655001202379IND60768261220221119105943.0220225e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076826122DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110202572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomanov, Georgii P.10aAgent-Based Modeling of Autosomal Recessive Deafness 1A (DFNB1A) Prevalence with Regard to Intensity of Selection Pressure in Isolated Human Population  aAn increase in the prevalence of autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A) in populations of European descent was shown to be promoted by assortative marriages among deaf people. Assortative marriages became possible with the widespread introduction of sign language, resulting in increased genetic fitness of deaf individuals and, thereby, relaxing selection against deafness. However, the effect of this phenomenon was not previously studied in populations with different genetic structures. We developed an agent-based computer model for the analysis of the spread of DFNB1A. Using this model, we tested the impact of different intensities of selection pressure against deafness in an isolated human population over 400 years. Modeling of the “purifying” selection pressure on deafness (“No deaf mating” scenario) resulted in a decrease in the proportion of deaf individuals and the pathogenic allele frequency. Modeling of the “relaxed” selection (“Assortative mating” scenario) resulted in an increase in the proportion of deaf individuals in the first four generations, which then quickly plateaued with a subsequent decline and a decrease in the pathogenic allele frequency. The results of neutral selection pressure modeling (“Random mating” scenario) showed no significant changes in the proportion of deaf individuals or the pathogenic allele frequency after 400 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3adeafness 3agene frequency 3ahuman population 3amodels 3areproductive fitness 3aselection pressure 3asign language1 aSmirnova, Anna A.1 aZamyatin, Vladimir I.1 aMukhin, Aleksey M.1 aKazantsev, Fedor V.1 aPshennikova, Vera G.1 aTeryutin, Fedor M.1 aSolovyev, Aisen V.1 aFedorova, Sardana A.1 aPosukh, Olga L.1 aLashin, Sergey A.1 aBarashkov, Nikolay A.0 tBiology.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110202573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245004900161300001600210520264200226592002802868650002402896650002002920650001002940650001702950650001102967650001502978650001602993650001303009650002403022650002203046773009603068856007103164852000903235655001203244IND60518919820221122042528.0160419e199403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051891982DNAL7 a10.2307/19395332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurdoch, William W.10aPopulation Regulation in Theory and Practice  ap. 271-287.  aPopulation regulation is a fundamental process related to most phenomena in ecology, including evolutionary ecology. I review the conceptual basis for defining regulation as bounded fluctuations in abundance, in contrast to the unbounded fluctuations of random—walk populations. Regulation arises as a result of potentially stabilizing density—dependent processes, even when brought about by “non—equilibrium” mechanisms. Although the phenomena is unambiguous in theory, detecting regulation by finding evidence for density dependence in a series of population estimates faces unsolved statistical problems. So, while there is growing evidence for widespread regulation, severe detection problems remain. I illustrate these with data from bird populations. Whether regulation is typically achieved by local stabilizing mechanisms or via metapopulation dynamics remains to be determined. I summarize recent studies on a particularly well—regulated system–red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) and its controlling parasitoid, Aphytis melinus. We tested and failed to find evidence for eight hypotheses that might account for the system's stability, including spatial heterogeneity in attack rates, a refuge, and metapopulation dynamics. We also failed to find evidence for density—dependent parasitism, but such density dependence might be still be present. Recent laboratory and modeling studies have uncovered a number of other potentially stabilizing mechanisms centering on the response of individual Aphytis to their size—structured host. This plethora of size— and stage—dependent interactions leads naturally to a consideration of the factors controlling Aphytis' size—dependent behavioral decisions, and consequently to the elaboration of size—structured models. The latter provide a vehicle for bringing together investigations of selection of life histories, and population dynamics. This is illustrated by a model of Aphytis and red scale dynamics that can explain a dramatic case of competitive displacement. The red scale/Aphytis system exemplifies a particularly challenging problem in population regulation, namely to account for the co—occurrence of stability and severe suppression of the prey population. A potentially generic solution is to assume stabilizing density dependence in the parasitoid or predator population; however, this has the consequence of increasing the host or prey population equilibrium. My colleagues and I have shown that observed prey densities in a plankton system are too low for such a mechanism to be operating. Further work is needed to test this and other hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAonidiella aurantii 3aAphytis melinus 3abirds 3alife history 3amodels 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aplankton 3apopulation dynamics 3aspatial variation0 tEcology.g1994 Mar., v. 75, no. 2 p.271-287dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19395333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001400286520161000300592002801910650001501938650001501953650000801968650001101976650001901987650000902006650001302015650002202028650001602050650001902066650001602085653002202101653000902123653001202132653002502144700002402169700001802193700002102211700002402232700002102256700001602277700001902293773009702312856008102409852000902490655001202499IND60556621020221122062824.0170713e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055662102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandan, Vishnu10aKu-, X- and C-band measured and modeled microwave backscatter from a highly saline snow cover on first-year sea ice  ap. 62-75.  aIn this study, we inter-compare observed and modeled Ku-, X- and C-band microwave backscatter for two snow temperature conditions for a highly saline snow cover on smooth first-year sea ice. A new surface-based multi-frequency (Ku-, X- and C-bands) microwave scatterometer system is used quasi-coincident with in situ geophysical snow measurements. A multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate the total co-polarized backscatter coefficient for two snow temperature conditions. The model provides the surface and volume scattering contributions for each snow layer, as well as the frequency-dependent penetration depth. These results aid interpretation of observed backscatter. Joint use of Ku-, X- and C-band microwaves provide an enhanced understanding of diverse variations in geophysical, thermodynamic and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. Our results indicate that the effect of dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers is the dominant factor affecting microwave penetration and backscatter from all three frequencies. The observed and modeled C-band backscatter shows good agreement, followed by X- and Ku-bands, at both snow temperature conditions. Microwave backscatter shows greater sensitivity to variations in plot-scale surface roughness, for all three frequencies. Additionally, Ku-band wavelength exhibits greater sensitivity to snow grain radius, over X-, and C-bands. Our results demonstrate the future potential of a multi-frequency approach towards the development of snow thickness and snow water equivalent algorithms on first-year sea ice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ageophysics 3aice 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awavelengths 0aActive microwaves 0aSnow 0aSea ice 0aMicrowave scattering1 aGeldsetzer, Torsten1 aIslam, Tanvir1 aYackel, John.

The transcription efflux pump genes were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine their role in drug resistance. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out using the Vitek 2 automated system (bioMérieux, France). Isolates were divided into four groups according to their resistance status: multiple-drug resistant (MDR), isolated carbapenem resistant (ICR), isolated quinolone resistant (IQR), and carbapenem and quinolone resistant (CQR). Transcript levels of mexB, mexD, mexF, and mexY were analyzed by qPCR using a LightCycler instrument (Roche, Germany). The genetic similarity between isolates was determined using arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Among the 50 isolates investigated, the frequency of genes classified as overexpressed were 88 % for mexD, 76 % for mexB, 46 % for mexF, and 40 % for mexY. Within the MDR group, mexB was overexpressed in 15 of 22 isolates, mexD in 20 of 22, mexF in 15 of 22, and mexY in 19 of 22. In the ICR group, isolates mexB and mexD were each overexpressed in five isolates. mexD overexpression was observed in all seven CQR isolates. Within the IQR group, mexB and mexD were overexpressed in all 12 isolates. mexF overexpression was detected in 7 of 12 isolates in this group. 18 distinct banding patterns were determined by AP-PCR. Increased transcription of mexB was directly correlated with meropenem resistance in the majority of isolates tested, while MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN were related to quinolone resistance; the MexCD-OprJ efflux pump was also related to multidrug resistance. Increased transcription of mexY may contribute to the gentamicin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibiotic resistance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agentamicin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atransporters1 aKulah, Canan1 aCiftci, İhsan Hakkı0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Oct., v. 30, no. 10 p.2681-2687dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1692-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012700170300001800297520166800315592002801983650002502011650001602036650002702052650002102079650001102100650002802111650001602139650001202155650001402167650001302181650001902194650001402213650001702227650001602244650001502260700002102275700002802296700002302324700002302347773011002370856008102480852000902561655001202570IND60465948120221120040747.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046594812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-015-1047-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLustrato, Giuseppe10aInactivation of Dekkera bruxellensis yeasts in wine storage in brand new oak barrels using low electric current technology  ap. 2091-2098.  aDekkera bruxellensis is one of the species of yeast, which is most damaging to wine quality, and the tools available to control its growth are limited. In previous studies, non-Saccharomyces yeasts and Dekkera bruxellensis have been significantly restricted during wine-making processes using an innovative approach based on low electric current treatment (LEC). In the present study, LEC techniques were assessed for their capacity to inhibit wine spoilage by D. bruxellensis and to prevent formation of undesirable flavours during storage in oak barrels. Although the effect of SO₂ treatment on D. bruxellensis viability and ATP content was more immediate, from the 30th day onward no significant variations between LEC and SO₂ treatments were observed. At the end of the trial, LEC treatment had had a comparable effect to that of SO₂ addition. Acetic acid content was significantly lower after LEC and SO₂ treatments than in untreated wines and volatile phenols were also found to be significantly lower in the LEC treated wine. Moreover, the results from the panel test clearly indicate that no significant differences were found between the LEC and the SO₂ treated wines. These results clearly indicate that LEC technology could represent a viable tool to limit yeast spoilage caused by D. bruxellensis. The present work represents, to our knowledge, the first attempt to control D. bruxellensis during red wine storage in oak barrels using LEC. The potential industrial applications of LEC technology include the real future possibility of producing a new, marketable range of healthier wines to satisfy the requirements of modern wine consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDekkera bruxellensis 3aacetic acid 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aelectric current 3aflavor 3aindustrial applications 3aoak barrels 3aphenols 3ared wines 3aspoilage 3asulfur dioxide 3aviability 3awine quality 3awine yeasts 3awinemaking1 aAlfano, Gabriele1 aDe Leonardis, Antonella1 aMacciola, Vincenzo1 aRanalli, Giancarlo0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.2091-2098dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-015-1047-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173520137800290592002801668650002101696650001601717650001301733650001201746650002901758650001101787650001401798650001401812650001301826650001801839650002101857650001701878651001201895700002201907700002301929700002001952700002101972700001801993700002402011700002602035773012702061856008502188852000902273655001202282IND60745499720221122094808.0210723e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074549972DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90713452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiden, Stefan E.10aNearly Identical Plasmids Encoding VIM-1 and Mercury Resistance in Enterobacteriaceae from North-Eastern Germany  aThe emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae limits therapeutic options and presents a major public health problem. Resistances to carbapenems are mostly conveyed by metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) including VIM, which are often encoded on resistance plasmids. We characterized four VIM-positive isolates that were obtained as part of a routine diagnostic screening from two laboratories in north-eastern Germany between June and August 2020. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to address (a) phylogenetic properties, (b) plasmid content, and (c) resistance gene carriage. In addition, we performed phenotypic antibiotic and mercury resistance analyses. The genomic analysis revealed three different bacterial species including C. freundii, E. coli and K. oxytoca with four different sequence types. All isolates were geno- and phenotypically multidrug-resistant (MDR) and the phenotypic profile was explained by the underlying resistance gene content. Three isolates of four carried nearly identical VIM-1-resistance plasmids, which in addition encoded a mercury resistance operon and showed some similarity to two publicly available plasmid sequences from sources other than the two laboratories above. Our results highlight the circulation of a nearly identical IncN-type VIM-1-resistance plasmid in different Enterobacteriaceae in north-eastern Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbapenems 3agenomics 3amercury 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoperon 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3aresistance genes 3atherapeutics 3aGermany1 aSydow, Katharina 1 aSchaefer, Stephan 1 aKlempien, Ingo 1 aBalau, Veronika 1 aBauer, Peter 1 aHübner, Nils-Olaf 1 aSchaufler, Katharina 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 22, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90713453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014200162520170400304592002802008650001302036650001702049650001502066650001202081650001402093650002002107650001502127650001402142650002402156650000902180650001702189650003002206700001602236700001502252700001902267700001902286700001802305700001502323700001702338700001702355700001902372700002002391773012102411856008002532852000902612655001202621IND60768261420221119105834.0220225e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076826142DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110202592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xitong 10aIdentification and Validation of an Annexin-Related Prognostic Signature and Therapeutic Targets for Bladder Cancer: Integrative Analysis  aAbnormal expression and dysfunction of Annexins (ANXA1-11, 13) have been widely found in several types of cancer.

Through Oncomine and GEPIA2 database analysis, we found that ANXA2/3/4/13 were up-regulated, whereas ANXA1/5/6 were down-regulated in BC compared with normal bladder tissues. Further LASSO analysis built an Annexin-Related Prognostic Signature (ARPS, including four members ANXA1/5/6/10) in the TCGA BC cohort and validated it in three independent GEO BC cohorts (GSE31684, GSE32548, GSE48075). Multivariate COX analysis demonstrated that ARPS is an independent prognostic signature for BC. Moreover, GSEA results showed that immune-related pathways, such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition and IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling were enriched in the high ARPS risk groups, while the low ARPS risk group mainly regulated metabolism-related processes, such as adipogenesis and bile acid metabolism. In conclusion, our study comprehensively analyzed the mRNA expression and prognosis of Annexin family members in BC, constructed an Annexin-related prognostic signature using LASSO and COX regression, and validated it in four independent BC cohorts, which might help to improve clinical outcomes of BC patients, offer insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of BC development and suggest potential therapeutic targets for BC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aadipogenesis 3abile acids 3abladder 3adatabases 3agene expression 3ametabolism 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aQi, Xinlei 1 aWang, Yao 1 aZhang, Baokun 1 aHe, Tianshuai 1 aYan, Taoning 1 aZhang, Lu 1 aWang, Yange 1 aZheng, Hong 1 aZhang, Guosen 1 aGuo, Xiangqian 0 tBiology.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110202593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245012700201300001200328506007600340520084100416592002801257596006301285596005001348596008901398596009701487506003701584650001901621650000901640650002901649650001601678650001601694650001101710650004401721650003001765650002101795700001201816700001701828700001801845700001401863700001501877700001401892700001301906773011601919856008202035852000902117655001202126IND60632595620221207140153.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063259562DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1663-22doi7 aPMC64010422pmcid7 a308637022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Lei10aCharacterization, solubility and antibacterial activity of inclusion complex of questin with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin  ap. 123.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo increase the water solubility of questin and broaden its application in preventing and treating Vibrio diseases in aquaculture, an inclusion complex of questin with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) was prepared by stirring and coevaporation strategy. The results of thin-layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum confirmed the inclusion of questin into HP-β-CD. The aqueous solubility of questin in the inclusion complex reached (62.63 ± 1.21) µg/mL, which was 110 times of questin’s original solubility. The preliminary agar diffusion method indicated that questin–HP-β-CD inclusion complex showed enhanced antibacterial activity against Vibrio harveyi compared with free questin. This finding provided a reliable basis for the further application of questin as aquatic antibacterial agent.  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20151283cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  aKKC17001c521 Talented Project of Lianyungang  aSJCX18_0942cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  aCXKT20180216cPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio harveyi 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3amixing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athin layer chromatography 3awater solubility1 aCao, Xi1 aYang, Shulin1 aWang, Xintong1 aWen, Ying1 aZhang, Fei1 aChen, Hui1 aWang, Le0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.123-123dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1663-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245004000202500001400242520084100256592002801097650002501125650002201150650001501172650002401187650001401211650001401225650001401239650001701253650001401270653001901284653002001303653001801323653001901341653001601360653001401376653001501390700005701405700002201462700002201484773010801506856008101614852000901695655001201704IND60706678820221122134142.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070667882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1138622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Dunxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6771-911410aSynthesis of α-Ketoglutaramic acid  aNAL-light  aα-Ketoglutaramic acid (KGM, α-ketoglutaramate), also known as 2-oxoglutaramic acid (OGM, 2-oxoglutaramate), is a substrate of ω-amidase, also known as Nitrilase 2 (NIT2), and is essential for studying the canonical role of ω-amidase, as well as its role in multiple diseases.

However, common in vitro bioassays underestimate the potential androgenic activity of leachate, owing to non-receptor-mediated mechanisms that modify the balance of sex hormones and promote the accumulation of endogenous androgens. This study aimed to develop an in vivo assay by using multiple biomarkers related to testosterone synthesis and conversion for assessing the potential androgenic activity of refuse leachate sampled from a municipal solid waste treatment plant in Qingdao, China. The results indicated that exposure to leachate increased the levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, but decreased those of 17β-estradiol in both male and female goldfish (Carassius auratus), suggesting a potential androgenic activity. Further, Leydig cell hyperplasia and decreased gonadal P450 aromatase mRNA levels were observed; these alterations might promote the biosynthesis of testosterone and hinder the conversion of testosterone to 17β-estradiol, which in turn enhance testosterone accumulation. Exposure to leachate also resulted in reproductive impairments, including decreased gonadosomatic index and plasma vitellogenin levels of female goldfish, as well as decreased testicular enzyme activities in male goldfish. The integrated use of biochemical, molecular, and histological markers not only improved our understanding of the androgenic effects of leachate but also verified the reliability and validity of the results. Therefore, the in vivo bioassay described in this study might allow the investigation of the androgenic effects of other complex contaminant mixtures in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aLeydig cells 3aaromatase 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3aestradiol 3afemales 3agoldfish 3agonadosomatic index 3ahyperplasia 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amunicipal solid waste 3atestosterone 3avitellogenin 3awaste treatment 3aChina 0aAR 0aT 0aTBT 0aP450arom 0aGtHs 0aLH 0aFSH 0aE2 0aVtg 0aGSI 0aγ-GTP 0aALP 0aMBR 0aDTRO 0aRIA 0aPCR 0aRefuse leachate 0aAndrogenic potency 0aTestosterone 0aP450 aromatase 0aGonadotropin 0aLeydig cell1 aTian, Hua1 aDong, Yifei1 aZhang, Xiaona1 aWang, Wei1 aRu, Shaoguo0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Jan., v. 135 p.82-89dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011600207300001600323500001900339520167400358592002802032596016902060650002202229650000802251650001202259650001302271650002302284650001602307650002002323650001702343650001702360650003802377650001002415650002002425650001902445651001002464700002002474700002002494700001902514700001702533773017502550856008202725852000902807655001202816IND60741472020221123032143.0210615e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074147202DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-021-01226-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalamurugan, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7821-742710aPrevalence of Coxiella burnetii Antibodies in Dairy Cattle Associated with Abortions and Reproductive Disorders  ap. 353-359.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the investigation on the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii antibodies in cattle dairy farms (n = 44) associated with a history of abortions /and reproductive disorders located in various geographical areas in different states of India was carried out. A total of 323 serum samples (n = 323) collected from apparently healthy cattle associated with a history of abortions, infertility, repeat breeding, anoestrus, endometritis, etc., were screened for anti-C. burnetii antibodies by employing PrioCHECK™ Ruminant Q Fever AB Plate ELISA Kit. The overall seropositivity of 44.0% (142/323, 95% confident interval: 39–49%) was observed in cattle with the presence of antibodies associated with abortions and other reproductive disorders (χ² = 18.75, p < 0.01). Further, the seropositivity of the dairy farms [84.1% (37/44)] implies at least one or two animals in each farm was found to be positive for C. burnetii antibodies. Moreover, on screening of the serum samples from seronegative and seropositive dairy farms, by Trans PCR, 84 out of 107 samples were found positive for C. burnetii genomic DNA, which indicated the ongoing active infection in all the studied farms. This study revealed that C. burnetii infection was prevalent in dairy cattle associated with abortions, infertility, and other reproductive problems and it implies the cattle have a role as a reservoir and may act as a potential zoonotic source to farm associated risk-groups personnel namely farmers, animal handlers, veterinarians, etc., that necessitates the adoption of appropriate mitigating strategies to reduce the incidence of Q fever in cattle dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data  aICAR-Network project on Outreach Programme on Zoonotic Diseases (OPZD) (F.

The surface hydrophilicity and the porous structure of the supports depended markedly on loading, type and surface chemistry of the nanostructured material, as well as on the addition or not of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). These PSf supports were used to develop polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) membranes, whose performance was evaluated in forward osmosis using distilled water and 0.6M NaCl solutions. TFC membranes prepared on PSf supports containing MWf and GO showed higher water permeation and draw solute rejection than those with hydrophobic MWCNTs or neat PSf only. An improved performance was observed when both carbon-TiO2 composites and PVP were used, due to a porous structure of more elongated and straight finger-like pores and enhanced hydrophilicity. Among them, the most permeable membrane was that containing 0.5wt% of a GO-TiO2 composite and PVP (9.6–12.5Lm–²h–¹ of water flux; ca. 43–60% higher than a TFC membrane on a commercial PSf support). However, the best performing membrane (8.4–20.3 L m–² h–¹ for 0.6–2.0 M NaCl, respectively) with the lowest specific solute flux (0.41–0.66gL–¹, respectively) was that obtained when replacing GO by MWf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aosmosis 3apolyamides 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 0aForward osmosis 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aGraphene oxide 0aPolysulfone 0aThin-film composite membranes1 aEsteves, Carla M.P.1 aFigueiredo, José L.1 aSilva, Adrián M.T.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 520 p.326-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008400165300001800249520163900267592002801906650002101934650001501955650001401970650001201984650001301996650001402009650001402023650000902037700001902046773011202065856004802177852000902225655001202234IND4476032620221121065118.0121003e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447603262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-011-1160-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Emily I.10aPredation risk makes bees reject rewarding flowers and reduce foraging activity  ap. 1505-1511.  aIn the absence of predators, pollinators can often maximize their foraging success by visiting the most rewarding flowers. However, if predators use those highly rewarding flowers to locate their prey, pollinators may benefit from changing their foraging preferences to accept less rewarding flowers. Previous studies have shown that some predators, such as crab spiders, indeed hunt preferentially on the most pollinator-attractive flowers. In order to determine whether predation risk can alter pollinator preferences, we conducted laboratory experiments on the foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) when predation risk was associated with a particular reward level (measured here as sugar concentration). Bees foraged in arenas containing a choice of a high-reward and a low-reward artificial flower. On a bee’s first foraging trip, it was either lightly squeezed with forceps, to simulate a crab spider attack, or was allowed to forage safely. The foragers’ subsequent visits were recorded for between 1 and 4 h without any further simulated attacks. Compared to bees that foraged safely, bees that experienced a simulated attack on a low-reward artificial flower had reduced foraging activity. However, bees attacked on a high-reward artificial flower were more likely to visit low-reward artificial flowers on subsequent foraging trips. Forager body size, which is thought to affect vulnerability to capture by predators, did not have an effect on response to an attack. Predation risk can thus alter pollinator foraging behavior in ways that influence the number and reward level of flowers that are visited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus impatiens 3aThomisidae 3abody size 3aflowers 3aforaging 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk1 aDornhaus, Anna0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 65, no. 8 p.1505-1511dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-011-1160-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100007800152245017000230300001600400520180300416592002802219650001802247650003502265650002002300650001302320650001302333650002502346650001702371650001602388650001402404650001502418650001102433650002102444650003102465650001402496650001802510650001902528650002802547650003102575650001402606650001602620653002802636653001802664653002002682653002902702700002502731700006502756700001802821700002102839700003302860700003202893773010602925856008703031852000903118655001203127IND60613486820221120130533.0200210e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061348682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontiel Schneider, María Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3701-726610aSelective contrast agents with potential to the earlier detection of tumors: Insights on synthetic pathways, physicochemical properties and performance in MRI assays  ap. 470-478.  aMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been prepared and stabilized with three organic acids (tartaric, malic and ascorbic) in order to obtain biocompatible and water dispersible MNPs with potential to bind specifically to tumoral cancer cells. An in deep characterization was performed aiming to verify the presence and effect of the coating and stabilizer on MNPs surface. Besides the mechanisms followed by the different acids to bind MNPs were elucidated and used to justify the differences in the physicochemical properties of each formulation. Data related to characterization revealed that MNPs coated with ascorbic acid (MNPs-AA) resulted the most suitable in terms of their size, surface charge and stability along the time. Besides, ascorbic acid may be recognized by GLUTs receptors that are overexpressed in several kinds of tumoral cells. Therefore, MNPs-AA was selected to explore its performance in both MRI and in vitro assays using human colon cancer cells HCT 116. MRI experiments were performed in clinical equipment using a series of aqueous dispersions of MNPs-AA that were evaluated as T₂ contrast agent. The T₂- weighted images obtained as well as the calculated r2, indicated that MNPs-AA could act as efficient T₂ contrast agent for MRI.Regarding in vitro assays, MNPs-AA did not alter the cellular function neither exert cytotoxicity using the three explored doses. The internalization of the nanoparticles on the cellular structure was confirmed quanti and qualitatively using atomic absorption spectroscopy and Prussian blue techniques respectively.From these results, it emerges that ascorbic acid coated-magnetite nanoparticles may be used as alternative contrast agent to avoid or minimize some toxicological issues related to the widely used gadolinium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acell structures 3acoatings 3acolloids 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adispersions 3aequipment 3agadolinium 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphysicochemical properties 3areceptors 3astabilizers 0aMagnetite nanoparticles 0aAscorbic acid 0aContrast agents 0aHuman colon cancer cells1 aMartin, María Julia1 aCoral, Diego Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7078-23681 aMuraca, Diego1 aGentili, Claudia1 aFernández van Raap, Marcela1 aLassalle, Verónica Leticia0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 170 p.470-478dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009700173300001600270520142800286592002801714650001301742650003101755650001701786650001701803650001101820650001901831650001201850650001301862650002001875650001401895650001301909650001701922650001201939650001901951653001701970653002001987653001902007653001702026653001502043700005602058700002402114700002402138773010602162856008702268852000902355655001202364IND60613486920221120130719.0200210e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061348692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuszpit, Ewelina10aPreliminary analysis of the interactions between CdTe quantum dots and human metallothionein  ap. 447-453.  aMetallothionein (MT) plays the important role in the detoxification of heavy metals, protection against oxidative compounds and as a prognostic marker in the development of tumors. It is important to find selective, stable and sensitive tools and probes to evaluate the presence of MT in biological fluids or tissues. QDs linked with ligands such as peptides or small molecules are a promising tool for selective, fast, and sensitive tagging and imaging in medicine. In previous findings, the authors proved the possibility of interaction with QDs (particularly with CdTe) and analyzed the stability of the formed complexes between CdTe and MT during incubation over time. Following that, an initial analysis of the interactions between CdTe quantum dots (QDs) and human metallothionein (MT) was performed. Complexes of mercaptosuccinic acid-covered CdTe QDs + MT were investigated using fluorescence intensity changes along a timeline, quenching analysis, stability interpretation based on zeta potential, and quenching intensity. Based on the preliminary results, it appears as though the possible interactions depend on the size of the CdTe QDs. Additionally, the formation of complexes between CdTe and human MT likely depends mostly on structural changes and conformational reorganization rather than on electrostatic interactions. Both types of interactions are responsible for complex creation and stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amedicine 3ametallothionein 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3aquantum dots 3atissues 3azeta potential 0aQuantum dots 0aMetallothionein 0aBioconjugation 0aInteractions 0aBiomarkers1 aKopel, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4216-95441 aKřížková, Soňa1 aMilnerowicz, Halina0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 170 p.447-453dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015200155300001800307500001900325520128200344592002801626650002501654650001101679650002201690650003501712650001901747650002001766650002401786650001601810650001101826650001201837650002601849650001601875650001501891650002601906650002901932650002001961650001301981700001601994700001802010700001902028700001702047700001702064700001702081700001902098700002202117700001502139773012902154856007402283852000902357655001202366IND60735401220221122215708.0210423e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073540122DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ay00200g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng10aDevelopment of a chemiluminescence immunoassay for detection of tenuazonic acid mycotoxin in fruit juices with a specific camel polyclonal antibody  ap. 1795-1802.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe natural mycotoxin tenuazonic acid (TeA) in foods is identified as the most toxic mycotoxin among the over 70 kinds of secondary toxic metabolites produced by Alternaria alternata. Some hapten–antibody-mediated immunoassays have been developed for TeA detection in food samples, but these methods show unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity. In this study, a rationally designed hapten for TeA mycotoxin generated with computer-assisted modeling was prepared to produce a highly specific camel polyclonal antibody, and an indirect competitive chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (icCLEIA) was established with a limit of detection of 0.2 ng mL⁻¹ under optimized conditions. The cross-reactivity results showed that several analogs and some common mycotoxins had negligible recognition by the anti-TeA polyclonal antibody. The average recoveries spiked in fruit juices were determined to be 92.7% with an acceptable coefficient of variation, and good correlations between icCLEIA and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results were obtained in spiked samples. This developed icCLEIA for TeA detection with significantly improved sensitivity and satisfactory specificity is a promising alternative for environmental monitoring and food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3acamels 3achemiluminescence 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afood safety 3afruits 3ahaptens 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amycotoxins 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atenuazonic acid 3atoxicity1 aWan, De-Bin1 aShen, Yu-Dong1 aTian, Yuan-Xin1 aXiao, Zhi-Li1 aXu, Zhen-Lin1 aYang, Jin-Yi1 aSun, Yuan-Ming1 aHammock, Bruce D.1 aWang, Hong0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 13, no. 15 p.1795-1802dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ay00200g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015200170300001200322520102100334592002801355650000901383650001101392650001601403650001601419650001301435650001301448650001301461650000901474650002101483650002101504651001501525700001601540700001701556700001601573773013501589856008201724852000901806655001201815IND60596727520221117093913.0180620e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059672752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7594-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, A.K.

Salinity varies at the local scale (5–10 m), but the relative roles of land use and surface geology on salinity variation in near-surface (< 5 m) groundwater are not fully understood. Surface geology, land use and salinity in near-surface (ca. 3 m) groundwater at two small sites (each 0.05 km²) were explored in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh. The sediments in the near-surface at both sites are fine and hydrometer analyses of cored samples indicate the dominance of silty clay (70%) along with very fine sand (5%), sandy clay (15%) and clay (10%) materials. Salinity variation in near-surface groundwater tends to follow land use rather than surface geology at the scale of our investigations. The study provides evidence of the influence of land use on the near-surface salinity variation and indicates the importance of land-use planning in salinity management in coastal areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3ahydrometers 3aland use 3aplanning 3asalinity 3asand 3asandy clay soils 3asilty clay soils 3aBangladesh1 aAhmed, K.M.1 aButler, A.P.1 aHoque, M.A.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 June, v. 77, no. 12 p.423-423dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7594-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520194400275592002802219650001402247650002302261650001802284650002802302650001502330650001302345650002702358650001702385650001802402650001502420650001202435650001802447650001502465653003702480653002102517653000902538653002202547653001302569653002102582700002602603700002102629700002202650700002602672773009602698856008602794852000902880655001202889IND60605674620221122113855.0180723e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060567462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeely, Haly L.10aApparent electrical conductivity response to spatially variable vertisol properties  ap. 168-175.  aThough much has been done to understand proximally-sensed bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) in agricultural soils, many of the soil properties identified to be mappable using these techniques, such as salinity and clay content, are not expected to drive ECa response in a non-saline Vertisol. In Vertisols, agrillipedoturbation creates meter-scale variability in soil moisture and chemical properties associated with gilgai features, and if developed from calcareous parent material, can exhibit meter and landscape scale variability in inorganic C content. The ability to map inorganic C may be especially useful in a Vertisol due to its strong correlation with shrink-swell potential. The overall goal of this project was to investigate the potential for mapping inorganic C using ECa surveys in a calcareous Vertisol, with the future goal of mapping shrink-swell potential on these landscapes. On a 40- by 50-m field with intact circular gilgai, ECa was mapped under both moist and dry soil conditions. Soil samples were taken for water content, clay content, inorganic C content, salinity, and depth to parent material. Under moist soil conditions, the strongest correlation to ECa was inorganic C content (r=−0.63), followed by water content (r=0.49); however, under dry conditions, only inorganic C content was significant (r=−0.60). In addition, ECa surveys and inorganic C samples were taken for two larger watersheds of 10 and 14ha. Again, inorganic C content was significantly and reliably correlated to ECa for both fields, and the resulting regression slopes and intercepts were not significantly different between watersheds, though the surveys were conducted at different times. Results suggest that ECa can be used to map inorganic C content in Vertisols weathered from calcareous parent materials, allowing for spatial inference of shrink-swell potential which may be useful in distributed hydrology modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVertisols 3aagricultural soils 3aclay fraction 3aelectrical conductivity 3alandscapes 3asalinity 3ashrink-swell potential 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asurveys 3awater content 3awatersheds 0aApparent electrical conductivity 0aProximal sensing 0aEM38 0aShrink-swell soil 0aVertisol 0aInorganic carbon1 aMorgan, Cristine L.S.1 aHallmark, C.

Investigating these processes, such as the transport of monomers across the liquid/liquid interface brings new understanding which can be used to tune polymeric morphology. Two different approaches are used to provide new insights on these processes. Microelectrochemical measurements at expanding droplets (MEMED) is used to measure the transfer of amine from an organic phase comprised of epoxide and amine into an aqueous receptor phase. The rate of amine transfer across the liquid/liquid interface is characterised using MEMED and finite element method modelling and kinetic values are reported. Time lapse microscopy of epoxide droplets held in deionised water or an aqueous amine solution heated to different temperatures is further used to characterise epoxide dissolution into the aqueous phase. Mass-transport of epoxide into the aqueous phase is shown to be temperature-dependent. Epoxide homopolymerisation at the droplet-water interface is found to influence the rate of epoxide droplet dissolution. The rate of the epoxy-amine cure reaction is shown to be faster than the rate of the epoxide homopolymerisation reaction. The combination of methods used here is not limited to emulsion polymerisation and should find application in a myriad of processes at liquid/liquid interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afinite element analysis 3aliquids 3amicroparticles 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aoil-water interface 3apolymerization 3atemperature 0aMEMED 0aPMPs 0aAI 0aFT-IR 0aIrOx 0aRDGE 0aOCP 0aFEM 0aInterfacial polymerisation 0aLiquid/liquid interface 0aMicroelectrochemical measurements at expanding droplets (MEMED) 0aFinite element method modelling (FEM) 0aEpoxide-amine 0aTime-lapse microscopy 0aInterfacial transfer 0aDissolution kinetics1 aRea, Anita1 ade Heer, Martine I.1 aFowler, Jeffrey D.1 aUnwin, Patrick R.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 490 p.703-709dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.11.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011500170300001600285520182100301592002802122650001502150650001202165650001902177650001602196650001902212650001302231650001302244650001602257650001602273650002702289650001402316650001802330650001502348650001102363650001902374650001102393650001502404650001302419650001302432650001302445650002002458653001302478653001802491653001802509653002502527653001502552653001602567700005902583700002902642700002102671700006402692773010602756856008702862852000902949655001202958IND60613487020221120130540.0200210e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061348702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, Sam Q.K.10aEmulsifying properties of ruptured microalgae cells: Barriers to lipid extraction or promising biosurfactants?  ap. 438-446.  aA systematic investigation of the emulsifying properties of ruptured algae cells was performed for the first time. The slurry of ruptured algae cells was separated into different biomass fractions, namely the cell debris, the delipidated debris, the serum, and the lipid. The interfacial interactions of these biomass fractions with a nonpolar solvent (e.g. hexane or hexadecane) were characterized using pendant drop tensiometry and interfacial shear rheology. The stability of the different emulsions (formed by the different biomass fractions) was tested using analytical centrifugation. The extracted lipid was an excellent surfactant that reduced the interfacial tension, however, it was not effective at stabilizing the emulsions. The protein-rich serum produced a strong interfacial film that stabilized the emulsions against coalescence during centrifugation. The cell debris stabilized the emulsions to a lesser extent by adsorbing to the droplet surface, presumably via interactions with hydrophobic extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). However, neither the serum nor the cell debris were very effective surfactants, and required the presence of the lipid fraction to produce small emulsion droplets. When present together, the components exhibited competitive interfacial adsorption, which influenced emulsion stability. In particular, the interruption of the protein film by the presence of lipid or cell debris reduced the stability of the emulsions. This study provides a new mechanistic understanding of emulsification during wet lipid extraction from microalgae that will be useful for determining strategies to improve solvent recovery. The results also suggest potential for developing effective bioemulsifiers or biosurfactants from fractionated microalgae biomass for commercial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3abiosurfactants 3ablood serum 3acentrifugation 3acolloids 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3afractionation 3ahexadecane 3ahexane 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3arheology 3aslurries 3asolvents 3asurface tension 0aEmulsion 0aBiosurfactant 0aBioemulsifier 0aWet lipid extraction 0aMicroalgae 0aInterfacial1 aMettu, Srinivas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8645-88181 aAshokkumar, Muthupandian1 aScales, Peter J.1 aMartin, Gregory J.O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7099-79130 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 170 p.438-446dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015100165300001600316520127900332592002801611650002201639650001601661650002501677650002301702650001101725650002101736650001601757650001601773650001601789650002701805650001401832650001701846650001801863650002301881650002301904650001801927650001201945650002101957650000701978650001801985650003102003650001202034650003902046650002102085650002202106650001002128650001502138650001302153653002202166653002302188653002202211653001202233653002402245700001402269700001602283700001302299700001702312700005402329773010102383856008602484852000902570655001202579IND60587002220221122131104.0190319e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058700222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao10aCovalent conjugation of bovine serum album and sugar beet pectin through Maillard reaction/laccase catalysis to improve the emulsifying properties  ap. 173-183.  aThe study aims at improving the emulsifying stability of sugar beet pectin (SBP) by covalent coupling of proteins to polysaccharide. Laccase and Maillard reaction in a controlled dry state condition (85 °C, 79% relative humidity for 5 h) were adopted to kinetically control the formation of hetero-covalent linkages between SBP and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The formation of BSA-SBP conjugates was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and peak position using gel permeation chromatography, multi angle laser light scattering and refractive index. The decrease rates of tyrosine and ferulic acid contents were positively correlated with the laccase dosage. The optimum condition of laccase catalysis was 500 U/g sample powder at a BSA/SBP weight ratio of 0.25. Measurements of particle size distribution and average particle size showed that emulsifying performance of BSA-SBP conjugation improved greatly compared with individual BSA and SBP. Emulsions stabilized by BSA-SBP conjugates were less susceptible to environmental stresses, such as at the present of salts, low pH, thermal and freeze-thaw treatments. Covalently conjugated SBP and proteins has greatly potential applications as novel emulsifier in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3acatalytic activity 3acattle 3achemical bonding 3acorrelation 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3aferulic acid 3afood industry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agel chromatography 3ahydrocolloids 3alaccase 3alight scattering 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apectins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arefractive index 3arelative humidity 3asalts 3asugar beet 3atyrosine 0aSugar beet pectin 0aBovine serum album 0aMaillard reaction 0aLaccase 0aCovalent conjugates1 aJi, Aiguo1 aQiu, Shuang1 aLiu, Yan1 aZhu, Qiaomei1 aYin, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6504-86330 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 Mar., v. 76 p.173-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012200167300001800289500001500307520104700322592002801369650001101397650001001408650001601418650001001434650001201444650001201456653001601468700001901484700002101503773012001524856005101644852000901695655001201704IND50088026320221119045235.0140412e20130220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008802632DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2012.7200462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Shijun10aThree-dimensional surface reconstruction of tree canopy from lidar point clouds using a region-based level set method  ap. 1373-1385.  a2019-12-05  aIn this article, a novel method is proposed for three-dimensional (3D) canopy surface reconstruction of trees using a region-based level set method. Both individual tree crowns and clusters of trees are first marked for further exploration. Multiple horizontal slices corresponding to different heights are obtained. The 3D structure of tree canopy is built using raw data from lidar point clouds. Also, new applications are proposed based on the new method for 3D forest reconstruction. The biomass parameters of the forest, including tree intersection area, tree equivalent crown radius, and canopy volume, can be calculated from stacking 2D slices of trees. Tree types are also identified and classified. The results indicate that this approach is effective for 3D surface reconstruction of forests including individual trees and clusters of trees, and that critical forest parameters (such as tree intersection area, tree position, and canopy volume) can be derived for the evaluation and measurement of biophysical parameters of forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3alidar 3amethodology 3atrees 3abiomass 3aforests 0anew methods1 aDong, Pinliang1 aBuckles, Bill P.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2013 Feb. 20, v. 34, no. 4 p.1373-1385dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.720046  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006600168300001600234520172800250592002801978650002202006650002602028650001502054650001302069650001702082650001702099650001202116650001902128650001102147650002402158650001102182650001102193650001402204651001202218700002002230700002602250773011102276856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60120900320221122065054.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012090032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-013-9664-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbons, Stephen14aThe Amenity Value of English Nature: A Hedonic Price Approach  ap. 175-196.  aUsing a hedonic property price approach, we estimate the amenity value associated with proximity to habitats, designated areas, domestic gardens and other natural amenities in England. There is a long tradition of studies looking at the effect of environmental amenities and disamenities on property prices. But, to our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study of the value of proximity to a large number of natural amenities in England. We analysed 1 million housing transactions over 1996–2008 and considered a large number of environmental characteristics. Results reveal that the effects of many of these environmental variables are highly statistically significant, and are quite large in economic magnitude. Gardens, green space and areas of water within the census ward all attract a considerable positive price premium. There is also a strong positive effect from freshwater and flood plain locations, broadleaved woodland, coniferous woodland and enclosed farmland. Increasing distance to natural amenities such as rivers, National Parks and National Trust sites is unambiguously associated with a fall in house prices. Our preferred regression specifications control for unobserved labour market and other geographical factors using Travel to Work Area fixed effects, and the estimates are fairly insensitive to changes in specification and sample. This provides some reassurance that the hedonic price results provide a useful representation of the values attached to proximity to environmental amenities in England. Overall, we conclude that the housing market in England reveals substantial amenity value attached to a number of habitats, designations, private gardens and local environmental amenities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3alabor market 3amarkets 3anational parks 3aprices 3aresidential housing 3arivers 3atravel 3awoodlands 3aEngland1 aMourato, Susana1 aResende, Guilherme M.0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2014 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.175-196dSpringer-Verlagx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-013-9664-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012700162300001600289520156800305592002801873650002501901650001301926650001601939650001701955650002601972650001201998650001302010650001202023650002002035650001802055653002802073653002602101653001902127653002002146653002702166700002502193700001802218700003202236700001702268773011202285856008502397852000902482655001202491IND60564626220221122064140.0180830e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056462622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Han10aUltrafiltration with self-generated RO concentrate pulse backwash in a novel integrated seawater desalination UF-RO system  ap. 111-119.  aUltrafiltration as a pretreatment for RO feedwater with enhanced UF backwash, which combines continuous with pulse backwash, was investigated in a novel UF-RO process integration. Direct supply of RO concentrate to the UF module served for UF backwash which was further enhanced with pulse backwash generated using bladder-type hydraulic accumulators. Model analysis of the hydraulic accumulator operation, which was validated via a series of field experiments, demonstrated a capability for accumulator charging directly from the RO concentrate stream within a period of 30–40s. Moreover, pulse backwash over a short period (~5s) which was added to the continuous UF backwash (directly from the RO brine stream), enabled peak UF backwash flux up to a factor of 4.2–4.6 higher than the normal filtration flux. The above mode of UF operation with multiple consecutive backwash pulses was more effective than with a single pulse, while inline coagulation further increased the UF performance. Relatively long-term field operation (over eight days where) of the UF-RO system with self-adaptive triggering of UF backwash, whereby the number of consecutive pulses increased when a higher membrane fouling resistance was encountered, was highly effective in enabling stable UF operation over a wider range of water quality conditions and without the need for chemical cleaning. These encouraging results suggest that direct UF-RO integration with enhanced pulse UF backwash is an effective approach for dead-end UF filtration without sacrificing water productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acleaning 3acoagulation 3adesalination 3afield experimentation 3afouling 3aseawater 3astreams 3aultrafiltration 3awater quality 0aIntegrated UF-RO system 0aSeawater desalination 0aPulse backwash 0aUltrafiltration 0aSelf-adaptive backwash1 aRahardianto, Anditya1 aGao, Larry X.1 aChristofides, Panagiotis D.1 aCohen, Yoram0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 520 p.111-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013100177300001600308520146100324592002801785650002201813650001101835650001301846650001101859650001701870650001501887650002001902650001401922650001501936650001201951650001101963650001301974650001501987650002502002650002002027650001602047650000902063650002002072650001402092651001002106653002602116653002402142653002002166653002002186653002002206700002102226700002602247700002202273700002302295700002002318700002202338700002502360700002202385773009602407856008602503852000902589655001202598IND60605674920221122113831.0180723e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060567492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Cristina,10aBelowground carbon allocation patterns as determined by the in-growth soil core 13C technique across different ecosystem types  ap. 140-150.  aBelowground carbon inputs, in particular rhizodeposition, are a key component of the global carbon cycle and yet their accurate quantification remains a major challenge. In the present paper, the in-growth soil cores-¹³C method was used to quantify net root carbon input (root-derived C). Four different ecosystem types (forest, alpine grassland, apple orchard and vineyard) in northern Italy, characterized by C3 vegetation with a broad range of aboveground net primary production (ANPP; 155–770gCm⁻²y⁻¹) were investigated. Cores, filled with soil of a known C4 isotopic signature were inserted at each site for twelve months. After extraction, root-derived C was quantified by applying a mass balance equation. Gross primary production (GPP) was determined by eddy covariance whereas ANPP was quantified using a biometric approach.NPP partitioning among sites differed, with fruit production dominating at agricultural sites. At these sites, belowground C inputs were dominated by rhizodeposits, likely due to relatively high root turnover. In natural ecosystems (forest and grassland) fine root production dominated belowground net primary production (BNPP) likely due to higher root growth determined by low phosphorus availability.

Our results underline the fact that failure to account for rhizodeposits may lead to a significant underestimation of BNPP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine grasslands 3aapples 3abiometry 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aequations 3afine roots 3aforests 3afruits 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3arhizodeposition 3aroot growth 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3avineyards 3aItaly 0aNet root carbon input 0aCarbon partitioning 0aRhizodeposition 0aIn-growth cores 0aStable isotopes1 aAlberti, Giorgio1 aCotrufo, M.

First, the nonlinear dynamic and thermodynamic equations governing a prototype FPSO are extracted. Then, a systematic approach for developing artificial neural network (ANN) is presented to predict the values of five unknown parameters considering nine measurable inputs. The critical unknown parameters include the damping coefficients of power and displacer pistons, the damping coefficient between displacer rod and power piston, and the gas temperatures within the compression and expansion spaces. Subsequently, the proposed ANN is trained and then, the regression analysis as well as the performance evaluation is carried out to validate the obtained ANN model. Furthermore, in order to verify the performance of the proposed ANN model, although limited empirical information is available, the experimental results collected from two prototype FPSOs namely SUTech-SR-1 and B10-B are compared to the ANN outcomes. Moreover, the practical P-V diagrams of the mentioned oscillators, under various realistic operating conditions, are compared to the predictions obtained from the ANN for further verification of the proposed model. Lastly, it is found that the prediction error is less than 4% which affirms the capability of the proposed technique to estimate the unmeasurable parameters of FPSOs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aneural networks 3apistons 3aprediction 3aprototypes 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aFree-piston Stirling oscillator 0aPerformance prediction 0aNeural network model1 aTavakolpour-Saleh, A.R.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 196 p.623-639dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006600172300001400238520156600252592002801818650002301846650002401869650002001893650002401913650001001937650001401947650001401961650001801975650002101993650001202014650002302026650001802049650001102067650001302078650002402091650000702115650001702122650001002139650001302149653002102162653001202183653001902195653002002214653001602234653001402250700002302264700002002287773009902307856008602406852000902492655001202501IND60587002520221122131115.0190319e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058700252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDille, Morten J.10aBioactively filled gelatin gels; challenges and opportunities  ap. 17-29.  aSoft, chewable gelatin matrices represent an excellent alternative to traditional oral administration forms (tablets, soft and hard capsules) for pharma- and nutraceuticals; especially for the pediatric and geriatric segments as well as for those suffering from dysphagia. As of today, chewable delivery units, most commonly produced using gelatin, are a very popular formulation design for vitamin and dietary supplements. Bioactive components can be present in such formulations as lipids in O/W emulsions, as dispersed particulate matter or dissolved in the aqueous phase or in the lipid phase in the case of O/W emulsions. Challenges do however exist: many of the bioactive ingredients give a distinct taste, are vulnerable to degradation or may influence the gelling properties of gelatin. This is highlighted by many of the current chewable multivitamins only containing a small fraction of the whole array of vitamins/minerals included in traditional tablets and soft gels. Pharmaceuticals have many of the same issues, coupled with stricter regulatory demands in regards to quality, stability and bioavailability compared to nutraceuticals, making formulation of pharmaceutical chewables potentially even more challenging. However, many of these challenges may be solved through innovative formulation design. By adjusting pH or using buffer systems, by adding taste masking or stability enhancing excipients or by using encapsulation techniques, even the more challenging active ingredients may potentially be incorporated into gelatin-based chewables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3adysphagia 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afunctional foods 3agelatin 3agelling properties 3ahydrocolloids 3alipids 3aminerals 3aoral administration 3apH 3aparticulates 3ataste 3avitamins 0aChewable tablets 0aGelatin 0aNutraceuticals 0aPharmaceuticals 0aFilled gels 0aEmulsions1 aHattrem, Magnus N.1 aDraget, Kurt I.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 Mar., v. 76 p.17-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167300001600283520094700299592002801246650001101274650001501285650003501300650001801335650001701353651001901370700002101389700002301410700001701433773011101450856008101561852000901642655001201651IND60120900420221122065214.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012090042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-013-9665-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerino, Grischa14aThe Value of Urban Green Space in Britain: A Methodological Framework for Spatially Referenced Benefit Transfer  ap. 251-272.  aA meta-analysis of studies valuing urban greenspace in the UK is undertaken to yield spatially sensitive marginal value functions. A geographical information system (GIS) is used to apply these functions to spatial data detailing the location of such greenspace resources in five British cities. Changes in monetary values are computed for the six future scenarios used in the UK National Ecosystem Assessment for the period 2010–2060. Different degrees of substitutability between urban greenspaces are considered. These findings are then extrapolated to all major British cities to obtain per household and aggregate valuation estimates for each scenario both with and without distributional weights. While subject to a number of shortcomings in both data availability and methodology, this represents the first systematic and comprehensive attempt to value marginal changes in urban greenspace while accounting for spatial heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aecosystems 3ageographic information systems 3ameta-analysis 3aspatial data 3aUnited Kingdom1 aAndrews, Barnaby1 aKontoleon, Andreas1 aBateman, Ian0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2014 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.251-272dSpringer-Verlagx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-013-9665-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001900171245010000190300001800290520096500308592002801273650001601301650001601317650001601333650002201349650001601371650000701387650001201394650001601406650001601422650002101438650003601459650003101495650001601526650005001542650005701592650001601649650002701665653001601692653001101708653001601719653002601735653002601761700001801787773010901805856008701914852000902001655001202010IND50068899120221118233458.0190402e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006889912DNAL7 a239935452pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.06.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Siew-Yin10aEffect of extraction conditions on the yield and chemical properties of pectin from cocoa husks  ap. 3752-3758.  aDifferent extraction conditions were applied to investigate the effect of temperature, extraction time and substrate–extractant ratio on pectin extraction from cocoa husks. Pectin was extracted from cocoa husks using water, citric acid at pH 2.5 or 4.0, or hydrochloric acid at pH 2.5 or 4.0. Temperature, extraction time and substrate–extractant ratio affected the yields, uronic acid contents, degrees of methylation (DM) and degrees of acetylation (DA) of the extracted pectins using the five extractants differently. The yields and uronic acid contents of the extracted pectins ranged from 3.38–7.62% to 31.19–65.20%, respectively. The DM and DA of the extracted pectins ranged from 7.17–57.86% to 1.01–3.48%, respectively. The highest yield of pectin (7.62%) was obtained using citric acid at pH 2.5 [1:25 (w/v)] at 95°C for 3.0h.

The DS and the distribution of carboxymethyl substituents are characterized by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy using a set of acid-hydrolyzing CMC samples. A new CMC molecular parameter of Ri indicating the individual degree of substitution at the position of either C-2 (R2) or C-6 (R6) in AGU is proposed to evaluate the influence of distribution of carboxymethyl substituents on the stability of the milk drinks. It is found that the distribution of carboxymethyl substituents also plays a key role in the stability of AMDs. The stability of the drinks increases not only with increasing the Mw and DS but also with decreasing the R2 or increasing the R6 of CMC. This fact is explained on the basis of CMC with a higher individual DS at C-2 position resulting in higher electronegativity, thus increasing the electrostatic repulsion between CMC-adsorbed casein particles in the colloidal system, thereby contributing to a better stability to AMDs. These findings provide an insight into fabricating better stability of AMDs induced by CMC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidified milk 3abeverages 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acasein 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrocolloids 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arheological properties 3astabilizers 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 0aAcidified milk drinks (AMDs) 0aMolecular parameter 0aDistribution of carboxymethyl substituents 0aStability1 aWu, Juan1 aDu, Baiqiao1 aZhang, Hongbin0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 Mar., v. 76 p.150-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245014500205300001200350520170700362592002802069650002502097650001102122650001402133650001402147650002202161650001002183650001602193650001602209650003002225650001402255650001402269650001102283650001702294650001102311650001102322650002002333650002302353650001802376650001702394650001502411650001802426650001502444700001702459773013302476856008102609852000902690655001202699IND60596728020221117094036.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059672802DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7536-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoummar, Joanna1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6146-191710aOccurrence of selected domestic and hospital emerging micropollutants on a rural surface water basin linked to a groundwater karst catchment  ap. 351.  aThe occurrence of specific micropollutants (MPs), indicators of domestic and hospital wastewater, was investigated in a river connected to a karst spring based on two sampling campaigns under varying flow conditions. The MPs characterized by a high frequency of occurrence (acesulfame-K, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, nonylphenol, and iohexol) were highly reflective of wastewater discharged in ephemeral streams and tributaries, as well as specific point sources such as farms and hospital effluents. A mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes allows the quantification of the percentage of untreated wastewater effluents in inflowing water from river tributaries, which varied between 0.7–99% and 5.0–10% in low flow and high flow, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of MPs is related to the volume of wastewater input, extent of river dilution, persistence of the MPs, and type of point source contamination on the river. Relationships were established between MPs such as ibuprofen and acesulfame-K (ACE-K), indicating their co-existence in highly consumed generic medicine and their suitability as wastewater co-tracers. Additionally, the number of consumers of gemfibrozil (GEM) and acesulfame-K were estimated based on mass loads in the river tributaries for management purposes. Groundwater contamination is mostly due to diffuse and point sources infiltration occurring on the spring catchment, including the sinking stream that could contribute up to 17% to the mass loads of some micropollutants (e.g., ACE-K and GEM) at the spring.

For acclimatization, in vitro plants placed in germination trays containing sterile substrate were used. In the establishment phase, low contamination was shown in both cultivars. During the in vitro multiplication phase, the highest average number of shoots per explant was obtained using 3 mg L⁻¹ BAP + 0.1 mg L⁻¹ IAA in the Curare cultivar and 4 mg L⁻¹ BAP + 0.1 mg L⁻¹ IAA in the Barraganete cultivar. The best treatments for in vitro rooting of both cultivars were MS + 0.3 mg/L IBA + 1 g/L CA. The two cultivars showed optimal levels of survival during acclimatization. There were, however, differences between the two cultivars for plant height and leaf emergence. The use of auxins in the rooting phase was important because of the number of physiological functions they regulate, while the use of CA induced rooting in both cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3aacclimation 3aactivated carbon 3acultivars 3acytokinins 3agermination 3aleaf emergence 3aplant establishment 3aplant height 3aIndia1 aMacías Ponce, Fátima1 aDel Valle Moreira, Marbelin1 aMoreira Mieles, Ana1 aZambrano Gavilanes, Freddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0004-91221 aArteaga Alcívar, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6211-27941 aCedeño-García, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8271-57521 aVélez-Olmedo, Jefferson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6761-76841 aEduardo Jaimez, Ramón1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8415-07750 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2021 June, v. 91, no. 2 p.431-440dSpringer IndiawJournal:20704x0369-82117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-020-01218-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007200171300001600243520080100259592002801060650002001088650001601108650001901124650001101143650003301154650002401187653002201211653002301233653002301256653000801279653003501287700002001322700001701342773007601359856008301435852000901518655001201527IND60553793320221118041719.0161023e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055379332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharitidi, Dmitri10aPseudophosphatases: Methods of analysis and physiological functions  ap. 207-218.  aProtein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are key enzymes in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Strikingly, not all PTPs bear enzymatic activity. A considerable fraction of PTPs are enzymatically inactive and are known as pseudophosphatases. Despite the lack of activity they execute pivotal roles in development, cell biology and human disease. The present review is focused on the methods used to identify pseudophosphatases, their targets, and physiological roles. We present a strategy for detailed enzymatic analysis of inactive PTPs, regulation of inactive PTP domains and identification of binding partners. Furthermore, we provide a detailed overview of human pseudophosphatases and discuss their regulation of cellular processes and functions in human pathologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3asignal transduction 0aPseudophosphatase 0aPhosphatase assays 0aSubstrate-trapping 0aPTP 0aPhosphotyrosine binding domain1 aManteghi, Sanaz1 aPause, Arnim0 tMethods.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 65 p.207-218dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100005600143245011700199300001600316520163800332592002801970596009801998596008402096596004502180596005902225596005302284596010702337596006302444650001602507650001802523650001102541650001202552650001002564650001502574650002002589650001702609650000902626650001102635650001602646650001902662650002202681650002202703650001102725650001002736653002902746653001102775653002202786653001402808653001102822700001202833700001702845700001602862700001902878700002202897700001802919773012002937856007803057852000903135655001203144IND60626084020221119171631.0191017e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062608402DNAL7 a10.1093/chemse/bjy0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7258-485912aA Multispecific Investigation of the Metal Effect in Mammalian Odorant Receptors for Sulfur-Containing Compounds  ap. 357-366.  aMetal-coordinating compounds are generally known to have strong smells, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the fact that odorant receptors for intense-smelling compounds, such as those containing sulfur, may be metalloproteins. We previously identified a mouse odorant receptor (OR), Olfr1509, that requires copper ions for sensitive detection of a series of metal-coordinating odorants, including (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT), a strong-smelling component of male mouse urine that attracts female mice. By combining mutagenesis and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) modeling, we identified candidate binding sites in Olfr1509 that may bind to the copper–MTMT complex. However, whether there are other receptors utilizing metal ions for ligand-binding and other sites important for receptor activation is still unknown. In this study, we describe a second mouse OR for MTMT with a copper effect, namely Olfr1019. In an attempt to investigate the functional changes of metal-coordinating ORs in multiple species and to decipher additional sites involved in the metal effect, we cloned various mammalian orthologs of the 2 mouse MTMT receptors, and a third mouse MTMT receptor, Olfr15, that does not have a copper effect. We found that the function of all 3 MTMT receptors varies greatly among species and that the response to MTMT always co-occurred with the copper effect. Furthermore, using ancestral reconstruction and QM/MM modeling combined with receptor functional assay, we found that the amino acid residue R260 in Olfr1509 and the respective R261 site in Olfr1019 may be important for receptor activation.  aPublisher supplied data  a31070972cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cProgram for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  aJ50201cShanghai Eastern Scholar Program  a2012CB910401cNational Basic Research Program of China  a16ZR1418300cShanghai Natural Science Foundation  aCHE-1465108aCHE-1265679aCHE-1545712cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aBXJ201303cShanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine 3aamino acids 3abinding sites 3acopper 3afemales 3amales 3ametal ions 3ametalloproteins 3amethanethiol 3amice 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3aodor compounds 3aodorant receptors 3aquantum mechanics 3asulfur 3aurine 0aancestral reconstruction 0acopper 0aodorant receptors 0aorthologs 0asulfur1 aPan, Yi1 aAhmed, Lucky1 aBlock, Eric1 aZhang, Letian,1 aBatista, Victor S1 aZhuang, Hanyi0 tChemical senses.g2018 May 23, v. 43, no. 5 p.357-366dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001303x1464-35537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjy0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011300166520125800279592002801537650001901565650002601584650001301610650001601623650002601639650001601665650001301681650001501694650001401709650001701723651001301740700001801753700001901771700002301790700002601813773012201839856008001961852000902041655001202050IND60748407720221119204533.0210827e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074840772DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110815882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalpern, Moshe 10aTef (Eragrostis tef) Responses to Phosphorus and Potassium Fertigation under Semi-Arid Mediterranean Climate  aTef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) is an annual small grain, panicle bearing, C₄ cereal crop native to Ethiopia, where it is a major staple food. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the responses of two tef genotypes to escalating phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels and to determine an optimum range for P and K at which tef performance is maximized. Two experiments were carried out in the Gilat Research Station, each testing two different genotypes of tef (405B and 406W), one experiment in pots in controlled conditions, and the other in the field. In both experiments, the highest grain yield increased until 6 mg L⁻¹ P, and declined at 12 mg L⁻¹ P. The decline was precipitous and significant in the pot experiment, and gradual and statistically insignificant in the field experiment. In the pots experiment, the grain yield increased until 40 mg L⁻¹ K, with no significant decrease thereafter. The effect of K concentration was only seen in the grain yield and not in the size of the other plant organs. In the field experiment, grain yield was highest at 80 mg L⁻¹ K, but it was not statistically different from 40 mg L⁻¹. The effect of K on growth was only apparent at maturity and not at flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3aMediterranean climate 3aagronomy 3afertigation 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3apanicles 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3astaple foods 3aEthiopia1 aGashu, Kelem 1 aZipori, Isaac 1 aSaranga, Yehoshua 1 aYermiyahu, U.q(Uri),0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110815883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245015600158300002000314520124800334592002801582650001401610650002101624650001501645650001101660650001601671650001301687650001901700650001701719650001001736650001101746650001401757653000901771653002501780653001901805653002501824653002401849700001901873700001701892700001801909700001901927700001601946700001801962700001701980773014001997856008002137852000902217655001202226IND60568410620221118160537.0170510e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056841062DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b023942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aFlexible Paper-like Free-Standing Electrodes by Anchoring Ultrafine SnS2 Nanocrystals on Graphene Nanoribbons for High-Performance Sodium Ion Batteries  ap. 15484-15491.  aUltrafine SnS₂ nanocrystals–reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon paper (SnS₂–RGONRP) has been created by a well-designed process including in situ reduction, evaporation-induced self-assembly, and sulfuration. The as-formed SnS₂ nanocrystals possess an average diameter of 2.3 nm and disperse on the surface of RGONRs uniformly. The strong capillary force formed during evaporation leads to a compact assembly of RGONRs to give a flexible paper structure with a high density of 0.94 g cm–³. The as-prepared SnS₂–RGONRP composite could be directly used as free-standing electrode for sodium ion batteries. Due to the synergistic effects between the ultrafine SnS₂ nanocrystals and the conductive, tightly connected RGONR networks, the composite paper electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. A high volumetric capacity of 508–244 mAh cm–³ was obtained at current densities in the range of 0.1–10 A g–¹. Discharge capacities of 334 and 255 mAh cm–³ were still kept, even after 1500 cycles tested at current densities of 1 and 5 A g–¹, respectively. This strategy provides insight into a new pathway for the creation of free-standing composite electrodes used in the energy storage and conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananocrystals 3apaper 3asodium 3asynergism 0aSnS2 0agraphene nanoribbons 0aenergy storage 0asodium ion batteries 0avolumetric capacity1 aYang, Yongzhen1 aWang, Xuzhen1 aDong, Yanfeng1 aTang, Yongchao1 aYu, Zhengfa1 aZhao, Zongbin1 aQiu, Jieshan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 May 10, v. 9, no. 18 p.15484-15491dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b023943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012800156300001800284520086800302592002801170650001401198650001601212650002401228650001601252700001701268700001701285773013401302856007501436852000901511655001201520IND60538252920221122152935.0160815e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053825292DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50431772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuan, Jiyang10aSelecting the Number of Principal Components on the Basis of Performance Optimization of Fault Detection and Identification  ap. 3145-3153.  aA novel method for selecting the number of principal components (PCs) is proposed in this paper. This method adopts a new fault detection performance index and a new fault identification performance index to complete the selection. The new fault detection performance index is developed to represent the fault detection ability using the concept of detectable fault coverage, and the new fault identification performance index is proposed for the purpose of judging whether the fault identification result is correct or not. Furthermore, detailed mathematical analysis is given to explain the influence of the number of PCs on the fault identification performance index.

Several PFA spatial-temporal computational molecules were developed for Cauchy and pulse loading boundary conditions. The PFA solutions were compared with solutions from the upwind method and quadratic upwind differencing (QUICK) scheme. For all boundary conditions the trapezoidal explicit PFA (EPFA) computational molecule gave the most accurate results at very high Pe number as long as the Courant number (Cr) was close to one. Stability analysis shows that the PFA molecules are always stable for high Pe number.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3aequations 3aporous media 3asolutes 0aadvection-dominated transport 0apractical finite analytic methods (PFA) 0aQUICK scheme 0ahigh-resolution QUICK solution (HRQ)1 aMontazeri, Hanif1 aArdestani, Mojtaba1 aSleep, Brent0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2015 Dec. 2, v. 60, no. 12 p.2204-2213dTaylor & Francisx2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.9594473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012800172300001800300520103100318592002801349650001301377650002901390651001501419651001301434700001701447700002301464700002101487773012001508856005101628852000901679655001201688IND50088027020221119045236.0140412e20130220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008802702DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2012.7270402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabboor, Mohammed10aComparing matrix distance measures for unsupervised POLSAR data classification of sea ice based on agglomerative clustering  ap. 1492-1505.  aClustering is a technique that can be applied for unsupervised classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data, an important analysis technique of radar polarimetry. Six matrix distance measures have been investigated and compared through an agglomerative clustering of RADARSAT-2 POLSAR data. The considered matrix distance measures were used as similarity criteria for merging clusters hierarchically into an appropriate number of classes. In this study, the considered distances are Manhattan, Euclidean, Bartlett, revised Wishart, Wishart test statistic, and Wishart Chernoff. Results show that the Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff distances all produce identical classification results. The Manhattan distance retrieved classification results close to those obtained by the Euclidean distance. The Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff distances produced the most accurate classification results. The study area is located in Hudson Bay offshore Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aicebergs 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aHudson Bay 3aManitoba1 aYackel, John1 aHossain, Mosharraf1 aBraun, Alexander0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2013 Feb. 20, v. 34, no. 4 p.1492-1505dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.727040  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008100155300001800236500001900254520078300273592002801056650002201084650001701106650001401123650001101137650001901148650001301167700001401180700002301194773013401217856007401351852000901425655001201434IND60735402120221122052517.0210423e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073540212DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc00649e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aPhoto-initiated oxidation of C–H bonds by diimine complexes of vanadium(v)  ap. 4007-4010.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe photochemical activation of carbon–hydrogen bonds by vanadium(v)–dioxo and vanadium(v)–oxo–peroxo diimine complexes is described. Reactions were carried out using a selection of organic substrates with C–H bond dissociation free energy values between 70 and 97 kcal mol⁻¹. The ability to activate C–H bonds using vanadium(v)–dioxo and vanadium(v)–oxo–peroxo diimine complexes varies with different bond dissociation free energy. Compounds with weaker C–H bonds are oxidized in minutes, rather than in days for thermal oxidations by the corresponding complexes. Dioxygen is necessary for substrate consumption, which suggests that the electronically excited V complexes are radical reaction initiators via H-atom abstraction from the organic substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adissociation 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotochemistry 3avanadium1 aZhou, Wen1 aWarren, Jeffrey J.0 tChemical communications.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 57, no. 33 p.4007-4010dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc00649e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011000166520154600276592002801822650002601850650002501876650001301901650002801914650001701942650003001959650001001989650001701999650001902016650004302035650001302078650003302091700002902124700001802153700001202171700001802183700001402201700001702215700001802232773012202250856008002372852000902452655001202461IND60748408120221119204646.0210827e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074840812DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110815922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yingchao 10aFunctional Analysis of A Soybean Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase (FNR) Gene in Response to Soybean Mosaic Virus  aThe Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) gene plays a significant role in NADPH production, carbon assimilation, antioxidation, and cross-talking between chloroplasts and mitochondria in plants. This study aims to know the functional response of the soybean FNR gene (GmFNR) during a soybean mosaic virus (SMV) infection. For this purpose, we developed the bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)-based gene construct (BPMV-GmFNR) and used it to silence the GmFNR gene in resistant and susceptible lines. The results showed that GmFNR expression decreased to 50% in the susceptible line, compared to 40% in the resistant line. The silencing of GmFNR reduces the photosynthetic capacity and CAT activity of both lines compared to their respective controls. In addition, the H₂O₂ content increased significantly in the susceptible line, whereas the resistant line did not exhibit any change. Further, an SMV infection in the silencing plants of the susceptible line resulted in serious morphological changes and increased the SMV NIa-protease transcript accumulation compared to its control plants. However, the same impact was not observed in the resistant line. The yeast two-hybrid system, BIFC assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that the GmFNR was interacting with EF1A and coincided with the increased SMV accumulation. The results obtained in this study improve the understanding of the soybean FNR gene response during SMV infection and provide a novel insight into the SMV resistance mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBean pod mottle virus 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3aagronomy 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3achloroplasts 3aferredoxin-NADP reductase 3agenes 3amitochondria 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoybeans 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aKarthikeyan, Adhimoolam 1 aYang, Yunhua 1 aMa, Na 1 aYin, Jinlong 1 aYuanyuan,1 aWang, Liqun 1 aZhi, Haijian 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 11, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110815923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011000170300001600280500001900296520111500315592002801430596009901458650001001557650001001567650001501577650001101592650002201603651002101625651001001646700002001656700001501676700002701691700001501718700001601733773017501749856008201924852000902006655001202015IND60741473320221120060155.0210615e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074147332DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-020-01217-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Baishakhi10aPollen Morphology of Some Eastern Himalayan Species of Maesa (Primulaceae) and Its Taxonomic Significance  ap. 269-275.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetailed pollen morphological account of four species of Maesa Forssk. (Primulaceae) [M. chisia, M. indica, M. macrophylla, M. rugosa] from Darjeeling Himalaya and its possible taxonomic implications have been investigated using light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pollen grains are 3-zonocolporate with reticulate exine having prominent variations in the muri and lumina dimensions (striato-reticulate, microreticulate to punctate). The shape (sub-prolate, prolate-spheroidal to spheroidal) and size classes (very small to small) show little variation. The structural details of the pollen grains are found to be useful in identifying the grains in different applied palynological studies. The present study reveals the stenopalynous nature of the genus Maesa. The UPGMA study was performed to analyse the phenetic relationship of the studied species with previously published data. The observations further suggest that considering the pollen morphological characters, Maesa is more closely related to the Myrsinaceae and Theophrastaceae (s.s.) and differs greatly from Primulaceae (s.s.).  aPublisher supplied data  a09/028(1072)/2018-EMR-I dated 22.02.2019cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aMaesa 3aexine 3apalynology 3apollen 3apollen morphology 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aBasak, Shreyasi1 aDas, A.

Soil basal respiration (SBR) is broadly used as indicator of metal(loid) stress in polluted soils, although the correlation with toxicity gives in many cases contradictory results. In this paper, we study seven different soils with contrasting properties and with different pollution levels of As, Pb, Zn, and Cu to assess the influence of soil properties and contaminant concentration in the SBR response. In general terms, the SBR showed toxic effects in soils with low organic-matter content and acidic pH values. Low respiration rates were found in soils polluted with As even at very high contamination levels. According to our results, SBR is not a good indicator of pollution by Pb, Zn and Cu in soils rich in organic carbon or in highly carbonate soils. In As-polluted soils, SBR also showed a low sensitivity in all cases. Further studies are needed to assess the role of soil properties and the type of pollutant in the SBR tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3acopper 3azinc 3alead 3aarsenic 3asoil properties 3aorganic carbon 3acell respiration 3apollutants 3apH 3asoil respiration 3atoxicity 3aecosystems 3apolluted soils 0aSoil properties 0aorganic matter 0aSoil basal respiration 0aMetal(loid)s 0aToxicity 0aSoil pollution1 aSierra Aragón, M.1 aMartínez Garzón, F.J.1 aMartín Peinado, F.J.0 tGeoderma.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 263 p.132-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170300001600278520110700294592002801401650001301429650001801442650002501460650001801485650001101503650001501514650001801529650002201547650001301569650001501582650001201597650001101609650002701620650001401647650001401661650001401675650001901689650001301708653002101721653002301742653001701765653003301782653001901815653004601834653003001880653003401910653003201944653002901976653003302005653003102038653003502069653003602104700002002140700001902160700001802179773010602197856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60408611420221121232757.0150916e20150903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040861142DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2015.10662872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopoola, A.

Cotyledon, leaf, and hypocotyl explants from a local variety of Fusarium wilt-susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Beske) were cultured on callus induction media (CIM) with kinetin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at various concentrations. Calli were transferred to shoot regeneration media containing kinetin and BAP in combination with giberellic acid at 0.5 mg/l. Regenerated plantlets and nursery-raised seedlings (control) were inoculated with Fusarium wilt pathogen. Callus induction was between 85.71% and 100.00% on all CIM except hormone-free medium. Disease incidence (70%) and severity score of 3.43 using the area under disease progress curve and taken at 14 days after inoculation were lowest in variants regenerated from leaf explants.

Herein, three-dimensional polyaniline/poly(vinyl alcohol)/montmorillonite (PANI/PVAL/MMT) hybrid aerogels with easy separation performance and highly effective reusable adsorption on both anionic and cationic dyes were fabricated by a simple in-situ polymerization method. As-prepared hybrid aerogels were characterized via infrared and Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra mapping, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry and elemental analysis. The results showed that MMT particles were successfully incorporated into aerogel matrix. Well-defined hierarchical structure, where PANI nanofibers are coated on the skeleton wall, can be observed for PANI/PVAL/MMT when the incorporation amount of MMT was around 11.1 wt%. The adsorption performance of as-prepared hybrid aerogels on both anionic and cationic dyes was systemically carried out at different solution pH, adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration. The data analysis showed that the adsorption process for PVAL/PANI/MMT aerogel for Reactive Black 5, methyl orange and safranin followed Freundlich isotherm and the maximum experimental adsorption capacities were found to be 199, 251 and 57.0 mg g⁻¹ at 25 °C, respectively. Mechanism studies indicated that the electrostatic interaction is the main driving force for the adsorption of dyes. The results demonstrated that the fabricated hybrid aerogel is an efficient adsorbent for the removal of both anionic and cationic organic dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaerogels 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3amercury 3amethyl orange 3ananofibers 3apH 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization 3aporosimetry 3askeleton 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0aPolyaniline 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) 0aMontmorillonite 0aAerogel 0aDye adsorption1 aLi, Jiaqiang1 aTrchová, Miroslava1 aWang, Guang1 aLiao, Yaozu1 aBober, Patrycja1 aStejskal, Jaroslav0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 435 p.129004-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012800169500001900297520175800316592002802074650001502102650003002117650001502147650001102162650001702173650001902190650002002209650003802229650001502267650002102282650002202303650002502325650002502350650000902375651001302384653001402397653002602411653001702437653002102454653000802475653000902483653000902492653000902501653000702510653000902517653000802526700001902534700002702553700002602580700002402606700002602630773011702656856008502773852000902858655001202867IND60697045520221118101718.0200719e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069704552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1182132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtero, Viviana10aSpatial analysis of early mangrove regeneration in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, using geomatics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSuccessful mangrove tree regeneration is required to maintain the provision of wood for silviculturally managed mangrove forest areas and to ensure mangrove rehabilitation in disturbed areas. Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophora 3aadministrative management 3aarid lands 3acanopy 3aclearcutting 3aforest ecology 3aforest reserves 3ageospatial science and technology 3alandscapes 3amangrove forests 3amangroves (trees) 3anatural regeneration 3atime series analysis 3awood 3aMalaysia 0aMangroves 0aMangrove regeneration 0aSilviculture 0aSpatial analysis 0aGLS 0aMMFR 0aNDMI 0aNDVI 0aSD 0aSPOT 0aUTM1 aLucas, Richard1 aVan De Kerchove, Ruben1 aSatyanarayana, Behara1 aMohd-Lokman, Husain1 aDahdouh-Guebas, Farid0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 472 p.118213-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1182133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013000171300001600301520131700317592002801634596004801662650002001710650001701730650001301747650000901760650001301769650001301782650001101795650001501806650001201821650001601833650002101849700002001870773015501890856008202045852000902127655001202136IND60706675320221117155643.0200809e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070667532DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-020-00393-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKinnon, Karen A.10aEstimating Changes in the Observed Relationship Between Humidity and Temperature Using Noncrossing Quantile Smoothing Splines  ap. 292-314.  aThe impacts of warm season heat extremes are dependent on both temperature and humidity, so it is critical to properly model their relationship, including how it may be changing. This presents statistical challenges because the bivariate temperature–humidity (measured here by dew point) distribution is complex and spatially variable. Here, we develop a flexible, semiparametric model based on quantile smoothing splines to summarize the distributional dependence of dew point on temperature, including how the dependence is changing with increasing global mean temperature. Noncrossing constraints enforce both the validity of the modeled distributions and the physical constraint that dew point cannot exceed temperature. The proposed method is first demonstrated with four synthetic, representative case studies. We then apply it to data from 2416 weather stations spanning the globe, with a focus on analyzing dew point trends during hot days. In general, dew point is increasing on both hot, humid and hot, dry days in the tropics and high latitudes, but decreasing in the subtropics, especially on hot, dry days. These changes appear to be mostly explained by changes in the temperature–dew point relationship, rather than by increases in temperature with a fixed temperature–dew point relationship.  aPublisher supplied data  aHewlett Mellon FellowshipcCarleton College 3aair temperature 3acase studies 3adewpoint 3aheat 3ahumidity 3alatitude 3amodels 3asubtropics 3atropics 3awarm season 3aweather stations1 aPoppick, Andrew0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2020 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.292-314dSpringer USwJournal:jnl55399x1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-020-00393-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012200168520147000290592002801760650001501788650001201803650002401815650002001839650001301859650001501872650001801887650001601905650001301921650003101934653001001965653000701975653000801982653000801990653000701998653000702005653000802012653000802020653000902028653004402037653003602081653000902117653002402126653003402150700001802184700001502202700001402217700001702231700001402248700002002262700001902282700001802301700001702319773011402336856008602450852000902536655001202545IND60775527720221122054240.0220621e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077552772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Baosheng10aControllable construction of ZnFe2O4-based micro-nano heterostructure for the rapid detection and degradation of VOCs  aMicro-nano heterogeneous oxides have received extensive attention due to their distinctive physicochemical properties. However, it is a challenge to prepare the hierarchical multicomponent metal oxide nanomaterials with abundant heterogeneous interfaces in a controllable way. In this work, the effective construction of the heterogeneous structure of the material is achieved by regulating the ratio of metal salts under thermal solvent condition. Three-dimensional spheres (ZnFe₂O₄) constructed by zero-dimensional ultra-small nanoparticles, in particular three-dimensional hollow sea urchin spheres (ZnO/ZnFe₂O₄) constructed by one-dimensional nanorods and three-dimensional hydrangeas (α-Fe₂O₃/ZnFe₂O₄) assembled by two-dimensional nanosheets were obtained. The two composite materials contain a large number of heterojunctions, which enhances the sensitivity of material to volatile organic compounds gas. Among them, the α-Fe₂O₃/ZnFe₂O₄ composite shows the best sensing performance for VOCs. For example, its response to 100 ppm acetone reaches 142 at 170 °C with the response time shortened to 3 s and the detection limit falling to 10 ppb. Meanwhile, the composite material presents a degradation rate of more than 90% for VOCs at a flow rate of 20 mL/min at 170 °C. In addition, the sensing and sensitivity mechanism of the composite material are studied in detail by combining GC-MS, XPS with UV diffuse reflectance tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aacetone 3acomposite materials 3adetection limit 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3arapid methods 3areflectance 3asolvents 3avolatile organic compounds 0aGC-MS 0aUV 0aSEM 0aTEM 0aTG 0aRH 0aXPS 0aXRD 0aVOCs 0aα-Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4 hierarchical structure 0aMicro-nano heterogeneous oxides 0aVOCs 0aLow detection limit 0aGas detection and degradation1 aZhang, Xianfa1 aHuo, Lihua1 aGao, Shan1 aGuo, Chuanyu1 aZhang, Yu1 aMajor, Zoltán,1 aZhang, Fangdou1 aCheng, Xiaoli1 aXu, Yingming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 435 p.129005-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001100300520154300311592002801854650003001882650001201912650001701924650002001941650001301961650001901974650002801993650001402021650001602035650001902051650001702070650001702087650000902104650001402113650001302127650000702140650000902147650001302156650001902169650001002188651001002198700002702208700001802235773012602253856008102379852000902460655001202469IND60632592320221118083554.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063259232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-019-0914-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkoto, Osei10aChemical characteristics and health hazards of heavy metals in shallow groundwater: case study Anloga community, Volta Region, Ghana  ap. 36.  aFive water samples each were collected from six shallow wells which serve as source of drinking water at different locations within the Anloga community of the Volta Region in Ghana. Samples were analyzed for physicochemical characteristics, and human health risk associated with the consumption of heavy metals in the samples was also assessed. The results showed that pH, EC, water hardness, fluoride and sulfate levels were below the maximum permissible levels recommended by the WHO for drinking but chloride and nitrate levels in well A₆ were above their respective WHO limits. Concentration of heavy metals showed Cd and Pd toxicities in some of the wells since their concentrations were higher than the WHO accepted limit for drinking water. Estimated non-carcinogenic health risks of the metals through ingestion were less than 1 in some of the wells, indicating small to no health hazard; however, high non-carcinogenic risk was recorded in well 2, 3 and 5 indicating a potential health hazard to the local residents. Health risk through dermal injection of the metals was found to be less than 1, indicating no health risk associated with water samples via dermal absorption. Cancer risk computed for Cd ranged from 1.82E−02 in well A₅ to 9.09E−02 in well A₁ and A₆, indicating that consumption of water from these wells could result in an excess of 2–9 cancer cases per 100 people. The risk of developing cancer from Pb as a result of consuming water from wells A₁, A₂ and A₅ was estimated to be 3.69E−06.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3acadmium 3acase studies 3adermal exposure 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahealth hazards 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alead 3aneoplasms 3anitrates 3apH 3arisk 3asulfates 3awater hardness 3awells 3aGhana1 aTeku, Justice Agbeshie1 aGasinu, Diane0 tApplied water science.g2019 Mar., v. 9, no. 2 p.36-36dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-019-0914-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011700174300001600291520130200307592002801609650001401637650001401651650001001665650001201675650001101687650001401698650001301712650001001725650001201735650001001747650002101757650001101778650000901789650001701798650001101815650001601826651001201842651001101854700002501865700002201890773009101912856008302003852000902086655001202095IND60082909320221118004616.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008290932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmgren, Camille A.10aVegetation history along the eastern, desert escarpment of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California, Mexico  ap. 647-657.  aPlant macrofossils from 38 packrat middens spanning the last ~33,000cal yr BP record vegetation between ~650 and 900m elevation along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, northern Baja California. The middens span most of the Holocene, with a gap between ~4600 and 1800cal yr BP, but coverage in the Pleistocene is uneven with a larger hiatus between 23,100 and 14,400cal yr BP. The midden flora is relatively stable from the Pleistocene to Holocene. Exceptions include Pinus californiarum, Juniperus californica and other chaparral elements that were most abundant >23,100cal yr BP and declined after 14,400cal yr BP. Despite being near the chaparral/woodland-desertscrub ecotone during glacial times, the midden assemblages reflect none of the climatic reversals evident in the glacial or marine record, and this is corroborated by a nearby semi-continuous pollen stratigraphy from lake sediments. Regular appearance of C₄ grasses and summer-flowering annuals since 13,600cal yr BP indicates occurrence of summer rainfall equivalent to modern (JAS average of ~80–90mm). This casts doubt on the claim, based on temperature proxies from marine sediments in the Guaymas Basin, that monsoonal development in the northern Gulf and Arizona was delayed until after 6200cal yr BP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aJuniperus 3aPinus 3aannuals 3abasins 3achaparral 3aecotones 3aflora 3agrasses 3alakes 3amarine sediments 3apollen 3arain 3astratigraphy 3asummer 3atemperature 3aArizona 3aMexico1 aBetancourt, Julio L.1 aRylander, Kate A.0 tQuaternary research.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.647-657dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006400164300001800228520152300246592002801769650002201797650001901819650002201838650001301860650001601873650001301889650001201902650001301914650001501927650002001942650001001962650001601972700001901988773012202007856008102129852000902210655001202219IND60625331420221117220536.0181207e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062533142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5758-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, Saduman10aStructural properties and kinetics of nitro-niobized steels  ap. 7784-7792.  aIn the present study, structural characterization and kinetics of nitro-niobized AISI 1010, AISI D2, and AISI M2 steels by thermo-reactive deposition technique in the powder mixture consisting of ferro-niobium, ammonium chloride, and alumina at the temperatures of 1173, 1273, and 1373 K for 60–240 min were investigated. The thickness of the niobium nitride layers formed on the nitro-niobized AISI 1010, AISI D2, and AISI M2 steels are ranged from 2.80 ± 0.90 to 11.89 ± 1.10 μm, 3.16 ± 0.60 to 13.16 ± 1.51 μm, and 3.85 ± 0.91 to 16.77 ± 2.10 μm, respectively. The phases formed in the coating layer deposited on the surface of the steel substrates are NbN₀.₉₅ and Nb₂CN. The hardness of the niobium nitride coating layers produced on AISI 1010, AISI D2, and AISI M2 steels are changing from 1151 ± 126 to 1446 ± 121 HV₀.₀₀₅, 1359 ± 413 to 1594 ± 761 HV₀.₀₀₅, and 1321 ± 51 to 1915 ± 134 HV₀.₀₀₅, respectively.

In addition, gliotoxin production and enzymatic ability among environmental (n = 2) and clinical (n = 5) strains were compared. Ecophysiological study of environmental strains was performed on agar silage incubated at 37°C, studying the interaction at eight aW levels (0·8, 0·85, 0·9, 0·92, 0·94, 0·96, 0·98 and 0·99) and eight pH levels (3·5, 4, 4·5, 5, 6, 7, 7·5 and 8). Considering the influence of the assumed lung conditions on growth of A. fumigatus (aW 0·98/0·99 and pH of 7/7·5), the optimal condition for the development of A. fumigatus RC031 was at aW 0·99 at pH 7. At aW 0·98/0·99 and pH of 7/7·5, the highest growth rate and the lowest lag phase was reported, whereas there were no significant differences at aW 0·98/0·99 and pH 7/7·5 interactions on growth of A. fumigatus RC032. Gliotoxin production of A. fumigatus strains was evaluated. The gliotoxin production was similar in clinical and environmental strains. Elastin activity was studied in solid medium, highest elastase activity index was found for clinical strain A. fumigatus RC0676, followed by the environmental strain A. fumigatus RC031. Opportunistic environmental strains can be considered as pathogenic in some cases when rural workers are exposed constantly to handling silage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the main opportunist pathogen agents causing invasive aspergillosis. Rural workers present a constant exposition to A. fumigatus spores caused by feed‐borne manipulation. In this study, environmental A. fumigatus strains were able to grow and produce gliotoxin onto the studied conditions including the lung ones. Environmental and clinical strains were physiologically similar and could be an important putative infection source in rural workers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aagar 3aaspergillosis 3abody temperature 3aecophysiology 3aelastase 3aelastin 3ahumans 3apH 3apathogens 3asilage 3aspores 3awater activity1 aAminahuel, C.1 aDíaz Vergara, L.1 aPereyra, C.1 aPoloni, V.1 aDalcero, A.1 aCavaglieri, L.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.160-168dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Scientific Publications [c1985-]-x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.125233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010200163300001600265520143700281592002801718650002501746650001401771650001901785650001401804650002301818650003101841650003801872650001901910650001701929650001301946653001001959653002501969653001701994700002002011700001602031700001402047700001402061700001702075700001402092700001202106700002002118700001502138700001602153700001802169700001602187700001702203700002102220773011402241856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60753735120221121063024.0211123e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075373512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yi10aEnhanced cancer therapeutic efficiency of NO combined with siRNA by caspase-3 responsive polymers  ap. 506-520.  aThe combination of nitric oxide (NO) and siRNA is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Here, the furoxans-grafted PEI polymer (FDP) with caspase-3 responsive cleavable DEVD linker was synthesized, and used to bind siRNAs via electrostatic interaction and self-assembled into FDP/siRNA nanoplexes by hydrophobic force. After cellular uptake and lysosomal escape, the FDP/siRNA nanoplexes could achieve GSH-triggered NO release, and then increase the activity of caspase-3. The activated caspase-3 could specifically cleave the DEVD peptide sequence and enhance cell apoptosis. With the cleavage of DEVD peptide sequence, the disassembly of FDP/siRNA nanoplexes was further promoted, thereby resulting in increased siRNAs of ~40% were released at 48 h compared with the caspase-3 non-responsive FDnP/siRNA nanoplexes. By this way, cell apoptosis promotion and cell proliferation inhibition was achieved by siRNA-based downregulation of EGFR protein and the upregulated activity of caspase-3, followed by the enhanced cascade release of NO from FDP/siRNA nanoplexes. Furthermore, in vivo results demonstrated the improved anti-cancer efficiency of FDP/siEGFR nanoplexes without any detectable side effects. Therefore, it is believed that the caspase-3 responsive cleavable furoxans-grafted PEI polymers could provide a potential and efficient enhancement for cancer therapeutic efficiency by the co-delivery of nitric oxide and siRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3ahydrophobicity 3anitric oxide 3apolymers 0asiRNA 0aCaspase-3 responsive 0aDEVD peptide1 aWang, Cheng-Han1 aCui, Shi-He1 aZhai, Lin1 aSun, Jing1 aLiu, Xiao-Yu1 aChen, Xin1 aSun, Yi1 aQian, Hong-Gang1 aGao, Xiang1 aTang, Yi-Da1 aZhu, Yuan-Jun1 aShi, Yu-Jie1 aZhang, Qiang1 aWang, Jian-Cheng0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 339 p.506-520dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001800292520097500310592002801285650002201313650001101335650001301346650001201359650000901371650001501380700001901395700001301414700001601427700001601443700001901459700001301478700001901491700001901510773012201529856008101651852000901732655001201741IND60625331620221117220505.0181207e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062533162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5765-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dongdong10aStructure and thermodynamics of the key precipitated phases in the Al–Mg–Si alloys from first-principles calculations  ap. 7839-7849.  aFirst-principles calculations have been carried out to investigate the structure, stability, and finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of the key precipitates in the Al–Mg–Si alloys including β″-Mg₅Si₆, U1-Al₂MgSi₂, U2-Al₄Mg₄Si₄, β′-Mg₉Si₅, and β-Mg₂Si. The calculated phonon densities of states indicate that these precipitated phases are vibrationally stable. Within the framework of the quasiharmonic approach, the finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of these precipitated phases including entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy have been calculated. The heat capacities at constant pressure for these precipitates are predicted. The finite-temperature entropies of formation, enthalpies of formation, and Gibbs free energy of formation for these precipitates are also computed.

The isolate was selected from a local winemaking region in China for its high β‐glucosidase level and was identified as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The tolerance of the glycosidase extract to the typical winemaking conditions was assessed using the activity of its β‐glucosidase. After that, the hydrolysis capacity of R. mucilaginosa glycosidase for liberation of grape aroma glycosides was characterized in comparison to commercial enzyme preparations. Results of this work revealed that glycosidase extract from R. mucilaginosa proved to be active in the presence of 0–20% (w/v) glucose, 0–20% (v/v) ethanol and at pH 3·0–5·0. In the hydrolysis of aroma precursors, enzymes obtained from different origins possessed various levels of specificity and activity, showing high origin dependence (α = 0·05). Compared to commercial enzymes, the indigenous R. mucilaginosa glycosidase extract presented better catalytic preference for the ‘fruity and floral’ glycosides of benzenic compounds and C₁₃‐norisoprenoids, but less sensitivity to the glycosides of C₆ compounds and volatile phenols. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work presents a novel extracellular glycosidase preparation from an indigenous Rhodotorula mucilaginosa strain selected from a local winemaking region in China. This enzyme extract exhibits strong tolerance towards winemaking conditions. It shows hydrolysis specificity for glycosides of benzenic compounds and C₁₃‐norisoprenoids, proving a potential candidate for improving floral and fruity aroma characteristics of wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodotorula rubra 3abeta-glucosidase 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3agrapes 3ahydrolysis 3aodors 3apH 3aphenols 3awinemaking 3awines 3aChina1 aZhu, X.L.1 aMu, H.1 aMa, Y.1 aUllah, N.1 aTao, Y.S.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.169-176dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Scientific Publications [c1985-]-x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.125273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013200164520158200296592002801878650002301906650001401929650001201943650002301955650001601978650001301994650001202007650001102019650001902030650002002049650001902069650002002088650001202108650001602120650002802136650000902164650003002173650001202203653004602215653001702261700001702278700002002295700001502315700001302330700001802343700001802361700001202379773009802391856008702489852000902576655001202585IND60753735320221121063019.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075373532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1110872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Min14aThe rice phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C3 is involved in responses to osmotic stresses via modulating ROS homeostasis  aFour members of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) are predicted in rice genome. Although the involvement of OsPLC1 and OsPLC4 in the responses of rice to salt and drought stresses has been documented, the role of OsPLC3 in which, yet, is elusive. Here, we report that OsPLC3 was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues during the development of rice. The expression of YFP-tagged OsPLC3 was observed at the plasma membrane (PM), cytoplasm and nucleus of rice protoplasts, onion epidermal cells and tobacco leaves. The catalytic activity of OsPLC3 was measured using the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method. The inhibition of OsPLC3 expression was detected in the treatments of NaCl and mannitol. Overexpression (OE) of OsPLC3 produced plants showing more sensitive to osmotic stresses when they were compared to the wild-type (HJ) and osplc3 mutants, the phenomena such as decreased plant fresh weight and increased water loss rate (WLR) were observed. Under the treatment of NaCl or mannitol, expressions of a subset osmotic stress-related genes were altered, in both OE and osplc3 mutant lines. In addition, the expressions and the enzyme activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers were significantly decreased in OE lines, leading to over-accumulation of ROS together with less osmotic adjustment substances including proline, soluble sugars and soluble proteins in OE plants which caused the growth inhibition. Thus, our results suggested that, via modulating ROS homeostasis, OsPLC3 is involved in responses to the osmotic stress in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acytoplasm 3adrought 3agrowth retardation 3ahomeostasis 3amannitol 3amutants 3aonions 3aosmotic stress 3aphospholipase C 3aphospholipases 3aplasma membrane 3aproline 3aprotoplasts 3areactive oxygen species 3arice 3athin layer chromatography 3atobacco 0aPhosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C 0aPlant growth1 aCao, Chunyan1 aYin, Xiao-Ming,1 aLiu, Xiong1 aYang, Di1 aGong, Chunyan1 aWang, Hengtao1 aWu, Yan0 tPlant science.g2021 Dec., v. 313 p.111087-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1110873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245011500158300001600273500001500289520165000304592002801954650002501982650001302007650001002020650002002030650001302050650001002063650001402073650001502087650001402102650001202116650001102128650000902139650001402148650002002162650001002182651002202192653001602214653001902230653001902249653001702268653002002285653001402305700002602319700001902345773008802364856003802452852000902490655001202499IND4475878320221118204053.0120319s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447587832DNAL7 a10.1071/WR110262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomaweera, Ruchira10aAssessing the potential impact of invasive cane toads on a commercial freshwater fishery in tropical Australia  ap. 380-385.  a2019-12-06  aContext The toxins produced by cane toads (Rhinella marina) are fatal to many Australian predators that ingest these invasive anurans. To date, the potential economic impact of the cane toad invasion has attracted little attention. Toads have recently arrived at a large impoundment (Lake Argyle) in north-eastern Western Australia, that supports a commercial fishery for silver cobbler (shovel-nosed catfish, Arius midgleyi), raising concern that the toads may inflict significant economic damage by killing fish. Aims Our research aimed to clarify the vulnerability of silver cobblers to the eggs and larvae of cane toads by determining (a) whether catfish are adversely affected if they prey on toad eggs or tadpoles, and (b) whether surviving catfish learn to avoid cane toad eggs and tadpoles in subsequent encounters. Methods We conducted laboratory feeding trials to examine feeding responses of catfish to cane toad eggs and tadpoles in early and late developmental stages. Fish that survived exposure to toad eggs and/or tadpoles were re-tested with potential prey of the same sizes and developmental stages four days later. Key results Our laboratory trials confirmed that some catfish eat toad eggs and die; but most catfish avoided the eggs. Catfish readily consumed toad tadpoles at both early and late developmental stages, but without experiencing mortality; and soon learned not to consume this toxic new prey type. Conclusions and implications Despite potential frequent episodes of mortality of small numbers of catfish during the wet season, the overall impacts of cane toads on the Lake Argyle fishery likely will be minimal.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater fisheries 3atadpoles 3alakes 3aRhinella marina 3alearning 3aArius 3apredators 3awet season 3amortality 3acatfish 3atoxins 3aeggs 3aingestion 3aeconomic impact 3atoads 3aWestern Australia 0aLake Argyle 0aArius midgleyi 0asilver cobbler 0aBufo marinus 0aRhinella marina 0aKimberley1 aCrossland, Michael R.1 aShine, Richard0 tWildlife research.g2011, v. 38, no. 5 p.380-385dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR11026  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008300170300001600253520117900269592002801448650001501476650001801491650001101509650001501520650001101535650001001546651000901556773015501565856008201720852000901802655001201811IND60706675820221117155637.0200809e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070667582DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-020-00404-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Joshua L.12aA Nonstationary Spatial Covariance Model for Processes Driven by Point Sources  ap. 415-430.  aWe introduce a new nonstationary spatial covariance model for analyzing geostatistical point-referenced data that contain point sources (i.e., known locations that impact the outcome). Our model is based on viewing the spatial domain on the polar coordinate scale, with the point source representing the reference location. As a result, we incorporate distances from the point source and angles of the separation vector with respect to the point source into the covariance model definition in order to describe complex correlation patterns that may be induced by the point source. We apply the new model and several competing options to analyze the impact of a hog lot on house sales prices in Cedar Falls, Iowa. We find that the new model offers improved model fit and predictive ability through Watanabe–Akaike information criterion and cross-validation, respectively. Additionally, we design a simulation study to determine the impact that mean misspecification has on each model’s ability to produce quality predictions. Overall, the new model is shown to consistently outperform the competitors and is useful even when the point source has no impact on the outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3ageostatistics 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprices 3asales 3aIowa0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2020 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.415-430dSpringer USwJournal:jnl55399x1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-020-00404-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008300169300001600252520136200268592002801630650001801658650001101676651001001687651001501697700002301712773009101735856008301826852000901909655001201918IND60082909720221118004628.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008290972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorley, Mike W.14aThe Campanian Ignimbrite (Y5) tephra at Crvena Stijena Rockshelter, Montenegro  ap. 683-696.  aClearly defined distal tephras are rare in rockshelter sediment records. Crvena Stijena, a Palaeolithic site in Montenegro, contains one of the longest (>20m) rockshelter sediment records in Europe with deposits ranging in age from Middle Pleistocene to mid-Holocene. A distinctive tephra is clearly exposed within the well stratified record approximately 6.5m below the present land surface. We present geochemical data to confirm that this tephra is a distal equivalent of the Campanian Ignimbrite deposits and a product of the largest Late Pleistocene eruption in Europe. Originating in the Campanian volcanic province of southwest Italy, this tephra has been independently dated to 39.3ka. It is a highly significant chronostratigraphic marker for southern Europe. Macrostratigraphic and microstratigraphic observations, allied with detailed particle size data, show that the tephra layer is in a primary depositional context and was transported into the rockshelter by aeolian processes. This site is unique because the tephra forms an abrupt boundary between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic records. Before they can be used as chronostratigraphic markers in rockshelter and cave-mouth environments, it is essential to establish the stratigraphic integrity of distal tephras and the mechanisms and pathways involved in their transport and deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparticle size 3atephra 3aItaly 3aMontenegro1 aWoodward, Jamie C.0 tQuaternary research.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.683-696dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009100160520101900251592002801270650001501298650001601313650001301329650001401342650000701356650001601363650001501379650001401394700002101408700002601429700002701455700002101482700002101503700002101524700001901545773012601564856007401690852000901764655001201773IND60745497320221121230332.0210723e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074549732DNAL7 a10.3390/md190703852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Berthold 12aA Complementary and Revised View on the N-Acylation of Chitosan with Hexanoyl Chloride  aThe modification of the biobased polymer chitosan is a broad and widely studied field. Herein, an insight into the hydrophobization of low-molecular-weight chitosan by substitution of amino functionalities with hexanoyl chloride is reported. Thereby, the influence of the pH of the reaction media was investigated. Further, methods for the determination of the degree of substitution based on ¹H-NMR, FTIR, and potentiometric titration were compared and discussed regarding their accuracy and precision. ¹H-NMR was the most accurate method, while FTIR and the potentiometric titration, though precise and reproducible, underlie the influence of complete protonation and solubility issues. Additionally, the impact of the pH variation during the synthesis on the properties of the samples was investigated by Cd²⁺ sorption experiments. The adjusted pH values during the synthesis and, therefore, the obtained degrees of substitution possessed a strong impact on the adsorption properties of the final material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3achlorides 3apH 3aprotonation 3asolubility 3atitration1 aGerlach, Niklas 1 aSteinbach, Christine 1 aHaro Carrasco, Karina 1 aOelmann, Marina 1 aSchwarz, Simona 1 aMüller, Martin,1 aSchwarz, Dana 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 July 02, v. 19, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190703853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167520113600258592002801394650001201422650001701434650001901451650001101470650001301481650001801494650001001512650001201522650004401534650000901578650001401587650001701601650001201618650001401630650001401644650002201658650001101680653003201691653001601723653001901739653001601758700001601774700002101790700001901811700001801830700001401848773010901862856008501971852000902056655001202065IND60697046120221118101539.0200607e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069704612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1064552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yutao10aLiquid oils produced from pyrolysis of plastic wastes with heat carrier in rotary kiln  aThe conversion of plastic waste to energy product is a promising solution to both energy shortage and environment pollution. In this study, plastic wastes were pyrolyzed in a rotary kiln to recover liquid oils that could be used as the source of valuable chemicals or fuels. The effects of filling ratio of heat carriers, and plastic wastes types on the product spectrum were investigated. The dynamic models of heat carrier in pyrolysis of plastic wastes showed that the suitable filling ratio of heat carrier for oil production is 15%. The liquid oils generated from a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis had the most gasoline range hydrocarbons and reached to 89.1%. The simulated distillation of liquid oils showed that the gasoline fraction was between 49% and 84.5%. The NMR analysis of liquid oils obtained from polyethylene and a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis showed that loading more heat carrier in the rotary kiln was favorable to produce olefins and paraffin. The NMR analysis and the heat carrier models revealed that the greater heat transfer enhanced the H⁺ transfer in radical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3adistillation 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3agasoline 3aheat transfer 3akilns 3aliquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3aprotons 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3awaste utilization 3awastes 0aPyrolysis with heat carrier 0aRotary kiln 0aPlastic wastes 0aLiquid oils1 aJi, Guozhao1 aChen, Chuanshuai1 aWang, Yinxiang1 aWang, Weijian1 aLi, Aimin0 tFuel processing technology.g2020 Sept., v. 206 p.106455-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1064553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245014400208300001200352506007600364520159200440592002802032596009602060506003702156650001802193650000802211650002102219650001102240650001202251650001702263650001502280650001002295650002002305650001402325650001202339650001602351650001502367650001302382650002202395650001502417650002102432650002402453650000702477650001402484650002202498650001302520651002102533700002002554700002102574700001902595700002102614773011602635856008202751852000902833655001202842IND60632592820221207145019.0190319e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063259282DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1621-z2doi7 aPMC63915132pmcid7 a308636912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Verruchi12aA hydrolase with esterase activity expressed from a fosmid gene bank prepared from DNA of a North West Himalayan glacier frozen soil sample  ap. 107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScreening of 20,000 clones of a fosmid gene bank, constructed from DNA extracted from North West Himalaya (NWH) glacier soil sample, using functional approach identified 10 esterase/lipase-producing clones. Of these, a clone designated pFG43 with an insert size of 45 kb which produced the highest concentration of enzyme (467.43 U/mg) was sequenced. Clone pFG43 contained 61 open reading frames (ORF) and of these an ORF of 1155 bp designated ME-003, was found to be closely related to a hydrolase from Acidobacteria sps (77% sequence identity and E value = 1e-164) and subsequently identified as a putative cocaine esterase. ORF ME-003 was amplified and sub-cloned using a TA vector system into E. coli (DH5α). The purified recombinant enzyme with a molecular weight of 43 kDa had optimal activity at 40 °C, pH 6 and the highest activity with shorter chain fatty acids than with higher chain length fatty acids. There is insignificant effect of inhibitors on the enzyme activity of ME-003, except PMSF which completely inhibited its activity. ME-003 activity was also inhibited in the presence of copper oxide but remained stable in presence of other metal ions. The enzyme activity was also inhibited in the presence of organic solvents; however, in the presence of 10% isopropanol, 12% of enzymatic activity was retained. Among various detergents, SDS completely inhibited enzymatic activity. The recombinant enzyme also shows enantio-specific activity against the racemic drug intermediates/precursors and exhibited 90% ee against racemic 1-phenyl ethanol and fluoxetine.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR12632/BPA/118/51/2014cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcidobacteria 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aclones 3acocaine 3acupric oxide 3adetergents 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aethanol 3afatty acids 3agene banks 3aglaciers 3aisopropyl alcohol 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asolvents 3aHimalayan region1 aSingh, Inderpal1 aKumar, Paramdeep1 aRasool, Shafaq1 aVerma, Vijeshwar0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Mar., v. 9, no. 3 p.107-107dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1621-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009100175300001600266520143600282536005701718592002801775596001201803650001401815650001501829650002101844650002001865650001401885650001001899650002201909650002001931650001501951650000901966650001601975651001301991651001302004653002602017653002102043653002202064653002502086700001902111700002102130773012002151856008602271852000902357655001202366IND60573725520221116164221.0210727e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372552DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2017.13176822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThetkathuek, Anamai10aAccess to Health Care by Migrant Farm Workers on Fruit Plantations in Eastern Thailand  ap. 189-199.  aObjectives: This study was undertaken to elucidate factors that influenced access to health care for migrant farm workers from Cambodia employed on fruit plantations in eastern Thailand. Methods: Data were collected from 861 participants via interview questions and focus group discussions. Results: The results revealed that 58.2% of immigrant workers were male, averaged 30.4 years of age, and 56.3% had no formal education. In the past year, 28% reported back pain and 25% had joint pain. Most of the workers (89.8%) received health care services at a nearby government health promotion hospital (THPH). From the analysis of factors contributing to the access to health services among immigrant farm workers, the data indicate that the Cambodian workers had few concerns with their ability to access health care services, reporting high and medium levels of satisfaction (with odds ratios [ORs] of 6.19 and 3.94, respectively) versus being unsatisfied. The differences between those who reported significant minor illnesses and serious illness were important, as workers with significant complaints were 3.17 and 4.85 times more likely, respectively, to have sought medical treatment than those not reporting illness. Conclusion: The main recommendation resulting from this study is that factors leading to higher degrees of satisfaction with health care services by migrant farm workers for preventative care could be improved.  aThis work was supported by Burapha University, 2016.  aPublisher supplied data  a36/2559 3aeducation 3afarm labor 3ahealth promotion 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3amales 3amedical treatment 3amigrant workers 3aodds ratio 3apain 3aplantations 3aCambodia 3aThailand 0aAccess to health care 0aeastern Thailand 0afruit plantations 0amigrant farm workers1 aJaidee, Wanlop1 aJaidee, Patchana0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2017 July 03, v. 22, no. 3 p.189-199dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2017.13176823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013200154300001800286520105200304592002801356650003301384650002801417650002801445650001601473650001801489650001401507650002001521650001501541650001801556650001801574650001701592650001601609650000901625650001101634650001601645650002001661650003601681650002301717700001601740700001101756700001301767700001701780700001501797700001801812700001501830773012401845856007501969852000902044655001202053IND60772603520221121030650.0220405e20220404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077260352DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03969e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhe10aPlatycodon grandiflorum root fermentation broth reduces inflammation in a mouse IBD model through the AMPK/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway  ap. 3946-3956.  aThe effect of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) on colitis and its underlying mechanism were rarely studied. In this study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 217-1 was used to ferment PG roots, and the concentrations of platycodin-D, flavonoids, and polyphenols and the DPPH free radical scavenging rate were significantly increased. Treatment with a PG root fermentation broth (PGRFB) could reduce dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Meanwhile, the PGRFB significantly reduced the content of inflammatory factors in mouse serum and the expression of inflammatory factor mRNA in the intestinal tract, regulated the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages, and increased the expression of tight junction protein mRNA in intestinal epithelial cells. In summary, it was proved that the PGRFB could inhibit the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and lowering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aPlatycodon grandiflorus 3ablood serum 3aculture media 3acytokines 3adextran sulfate 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3apolyphenols 3atight junctions 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aulcerative colitis1 aLi, Chunhai1 aHe, Xi1 aXu, Kang1 aXue, Zhipeng1 aWang, Ting1 aXu, Zhenshang1 aLiu, Xinli0 tFood & function.g2022 Apr. 4, v. 13, no. 7 p.3946-3956dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03969e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006600165300001600231520110600247592002801353650002001381650001701401650001701418650001301435650001901448650001301467650001001480650001201490650001501502651001101517700002301528700002001551700001601571700001901587700001801606700002001624773010901644856008101753852000901834655001201843IND60573995720221120141023.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1226-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemp, Andreas10aAfrica’s highest mountain harbours Africa’s tallest trees  ap. 103-113.  aWhile world records of tree heights were set by American, Australian and Asian tree species, Africa seemed to play no role here. In our study we show that Entandrophragma excelsum (Meliaceae) found in a remote valley at Kilimanjaro has to be included in the list of the world’s superlative trees. Estimating tree age from growth rates monitored by high resolution dendrometry indicates that tall individuals may reach more than 470 years of age. A unique combination of anatomical peculiarities and favorable site conditions might explain their enormous size. The late date of this discovery of Africa’s tallest trees may be due to the comparably low study efforts at Kilimanjaro compared with other biodiversity hotspots. Since only a few square kilometers of this habitat of Entandrophragma are left, Kilimanjaro (and Africa) is about to lose not only a unique biogeographical archive with highly diverse vegetation, but also its tallest trees. The inclusion of these valleys into the immediately neighboring Kilimanjaro National Park would be an excellent and urgent possibility of protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntandrophragma 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3ahabitats 3anational parks 3atree age 3atrees 3avalleys 3avegetation 3aAfrica1 aZimmermann, Reiner1 aRemmele, Sabine1 aPommer, Ulf1 aBerauer, Bernd1 aHemp, Claudia1 aFischer, Markus0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2017 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.103-113dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1226-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015000173300001600323520207200339592002802411650003402439650002202473650002502495650001302520650001602533650002802549650001802577650001202595650001802607650002902625650001402654650001402668650001102682650002002693650003702713650002802750650001802778650001002796650004102806650000902847650000902856650001102865650001402876650000702890650001002897650001602907650003402923650000902957653002502966653002402991653002503015653001803040653002003058653001903078700002403097700002403121773011203145856008603257852000903343655001203352IND60634716920221119054733.0190326e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063471692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Wafaa A.10aLemna gibba and Eichhornia crassipes extracts: Clean alternatives for deacidification, antioxidation and fungicidal treatment of historical paper  ap. 846-855.  aIn this research Lemna gibba (L) and Eichhornia crassipes (E) ethanolic extracts were added to pure cellulose substrate to produce impregnated interleaving papers (LIP) and (EIP). These products are proposed to cure historical paper undergoing acidification, oxidation and fungal infection. The extracts were analysed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and polyphenolic compounds were assessed. The products were tested on model decayed paper showing identical characteristics of historical paper, on which pH values were measured, transition metals concentrations were evaluated using Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope combined with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) respectively. Radical scavenging and antioxidation activities of the extracts were also assessed using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical DPPH·. Results demonstrated a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the DPPH· free radical scavenging with increasing concentration in the following order vitamin C > BHT ≈ (L) extract > (E) extract. Results showed also that both (LIP) and (EIP) products effectively neutralized the acidity of decayed paper after 7 day treatment and evidently chelated transition metals. Zn2+ and Fe2+ were better chelated by (LIP) treatment in the order; Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Pb2+ > Cu2+, while Pb2+ and Cu2+ were greater removed by (EIP) treatment in the order Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Fe2+. Up to 90% radical scavenging was achieved at 320.00 μg/mL concentration of (L) extract and 667.296 μg/mL concentration of (E) extracts. Aspergillus niger, Penicillium roqueforti and Eurotium chevalieri growth are inhibited at 1000 μg/mL concentration of LIP with considerable fungal spots elimination. Our findings established LIP and EIP products as novel natural origin alternative for effective synergic deacidification, antioxidation, antiradical, metal chelation and fungicidal treatment of historical paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAspergillus niger 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aEurotium 3aLemna gibba 3aPenicillium roquefortii 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aascorbic acid 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acellulose 3achelation 3acopper 3adeacidification 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3airon 3alead 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3apaper 3apolyphenols 3ascanning electron microscopes 3azinc 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAntifungal activity 0aAntiradical activity 0aInk corrosion 0aMetal chelating 0aPlant extracts1 aMansour, Maisa M.A.1 aSalem, Mohamed Z.M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 10, v. 219 p.846-855dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167300001100265500001900276520167800295592002801973650001602001650002702017650001702044650001802061650001702079650001202096650002202108650002302130650004802153650003702201650002102238650001102259650000702270650001702277700001802294700002202312700001902334700002102353700003202374700002202406700006202428773014102490856008302631852000902714655001202723IND60723085420221120135354.0210208e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072308542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-020-02989-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaggar, Ramita10aBacteriocin isolated from the natural inhabitant of Allium cepa against Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 20.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExtensive usage of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of pathogens and hence, there is an urgent need for alternative antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) of bacterial origin have shown the potential to replace some conventional antibiotics. In the present study, an AMP was isolated from Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii strain Ba49 present on the Allium cepa, the common onion and named as peptide-Ba49. The isolated AMP was purified and characterized. The purified peptide-Ba49, having a molecular weight of ~ 3.3 kDa as determined using mass spectroscopy, was stable up to 121 °C and in the pH range of 5–10. Its interaction with protein degrading enzymes confirmed the peptide nature of the molecule. The peptide exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus and its (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) MRSA strains (MIC, 2–16 µM/mL). Further, time kill kinetic assay was performed and analysis of the results of membrane depolarization and permeabilization assays (TEM, DiBAC₄ (3) and PI) suggested peptide-Ba49 to be acting through the change in membrane potential leading to disruption of S. aureus membrane. Additionally, cytotoxicity studies of peptide-Ba49, carried out using three mammalian cell lines viz. HEK 293T, RAW 264.7, and L929, showed limited cytotoxicity on these cell lines at a concentration much higher than its MIC values. All these studies suggested that the AMP isolated from strain Ba49 (peptide-Ba49) has the potential to be an alternative to antibiotics in terms of eradicating the pathogenic as well as drug-resistant microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteriocins 3abiotechnology 3acytotoxicity 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane potential 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular weight 3aonions 3apH 3apermeability1 aJangra, Manoj1 aDwivedi, Akanksha1 aBansal, Kanika1 aPatil, Prabhu B.1 aBhattacharyya, Mani Shankar1 aNandanwar, Hemraj1 aSahoo, Debendra K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7460-36380 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.20-20dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02989-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011000165300001600275500002000291520127200311592002801583650002401611650001101635650002301646650002601669650002201695650003801717650001701755650001101772650001001783650001001793650001901803650002101822650000901843650001001852650001501862651001001877700001501887700001801902700001801920700002801938700001801966700001601984700001602000700001702016700001902033700001702052773013502069856007402204852000902278655001202287IND60588290920221118233436.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058829092DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.123252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz‐Mendoza, M.10aSheep as a Potential Source of Bovine TB: Epidemiology, Pathology and Evaluation of Diagnostic Techniques  ap. 635-646.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBovine tuberculosis (TB) infection is infrequently diagnosed in sheep. Most reports are from single individual cases or flock outbreaks. However, in Spain several outbreaks have been reported recently, all of which had epidemiological links with TB‐infected cattle herds. A total of 897 sheep suspected of being infected with TB and belonging to 23 flocks cohabiting with TB‐infected cattle herds and/or goats were tested between 2009 and 2013 in Galicia (north‐western Spain), using pathological, immunological and molecular techniques. Of these, 50.44% were positive by culture, 83.23% by histopathology and 24.92%, 4.86% and 59.42% by single intradermal tuberculin test (SITT), interferon‐γ and ELISA, respectively. Results suggest that in circumstances akin to those in our study, sheep may be considered as a potential source of TB. We conclude that under similar conditions, serious consideration should be given to TB testing sheep, as they may represent a potential risk to other susceptible co‐habiting species. The SITT and ELISA are recommended as the simplest and most cost‐effective initial approaches for the diagnosis of TB in sheep under field conditions. However, when possible, interferon‐γ should be applied to increase sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3acost effectiveness 3adiagnostic techniques 3aemerging diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepidemiology 3aflocks 3agoats 3aherds 3ahistopathology 3ainterferon-gamma 3arisk 3asheep 3atuberculin 3aSpain1 aRomero, B.1 adel Cerro, A.1 aGortázar, C.1 aGarcía‐Marín, J.

PMMoV was first identified in Turkey in 1994 in commercial pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. ‘Charlee’) fields and caused an outbreak in southern Turkey by 2006, especially in greenhouses. Infected plants were confirmed by ELISA using commercial kits for the virus. The infected plants had stunted growth; and leaves and fruits became mottled, puckered, malformed, deformed, and marked by off-colored sunken areas. Fruits expressing virus symptoms were utilized for biochemical analyses. The percent ratio of TOS to TAS was calculated as the oxidative stress index (OSI). The TAS level and the vitamin C content were found to be significantly lower in infected peppers as compared to healthy peppers. However, TOS, OSI, TP, FP, and CP levels were significantly higher in infected pepper fruits than in healthy ones. In this study, it has been demonstrated that low levels of TAS and high levels of TOS, as well as high OSI status, reflects the quality of peppers. Using this method, the quality of fruits and the condition of plants can be determined in advance of stress development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3aPepper mild mottle virus 3aTurkey (country) 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aautomation 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apepper 3aphenol 3aviruses1 aGULDUR, Mehmet Ertugrul1 aDERYAOGLU, Ahmet1 aEREL, Ozcan0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.58-63dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha39258813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03784naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002700192245009100219300001600310506007600326520181500402536023302217592002802450596001602478506003702494650001402531650002202545650001902567650002402586650001002610650001702620650000802637650001502645650001302660650001102673651001102684651002302695653003002718653002402748653002602772653002702798653001502825700001702840700002202857700001902879700002202898700002202920700002102942700002802963773012002991856008603111852000903197655001203206IND60573725720221207072410.0210727e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372572DNAL7 a284187782pmid7 aPMC55335752pmcid7 a10.1080/1059924X.2017.13176842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSearles Nielsen, Susan10aParkinsonism Signs and Symptoms in Agricultural Pesticide Handlers in Washington State  ap. 215-221.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjectives: Examine associations between pesticide exposure and signs or symptoms of parkinsonism. Methods: Prior to the 2014 pesticide spray season, the authors examined 38 active pesticide handlers aged 35 to 65 (median: 43.5) who participated in the State of Washington’s cholinesterase monitoring program in the Yakima Valley, where cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides are applied in fruit orchards. A movement disorder specialist assessed the workers using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscore 3 (UPDRS3). Participants also self-reported work and medical histories, including the UPDRS activities of daily living subscore 2 (UPDRS2). The authors explored the relation between these scores and lifetime occupational pesticide exposure while accounting for age. Results: All participants were Hispanic men born in Mexico who had worked in agriculture for 4 to 43 years (median: 21 years, including 11 years applying pesticides, mostly in the United States). Ten participants (26%) reported difficulty with one or more UPDRS2 activities of daily living (maximum = 2), and nine (24%) had a UPDRS3 >0 (maximum = 10). The most common symptom and sign, respectively, were excess saliva (n = 6) and action tremor (n = 5). UPDRS2 and UPDRS3 scores were unrelated to the number of years applying pesticides, but UPDRS3, especially action tremor, was positively associated with living on or by a farm. Conclusions: Symptoms and signs of parkinsonism were absent to mild in this small sample of active workers who apply cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides in Washington State, USA. Future studies should be larger and examine older, retired workers with greater cumulative exposure to agricultural pesticides at work and home, including other types of agricultural pesticides.  aThis work was funded by a pilot grant from the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center at the University of Washington through a grant from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U54OH007544).  aPublisher supplied data  aU54OH0075440 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHispanics 3aParkinson disease 3acholinesterase 3acumulative exposure 3afarms 3ainsecticides 3amen 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3asaliva 3aMexico 3aWashington (state) 0aCholinesterase inhibitors 0aoccupational health 0aParkinson’s disease 0aparkinsonian disorders 0apesticides1 aHu, Shujing,1 aCheckoway, Harvey1 aNegrete, Maria1 aPalmández, Pablo1 aBordianu, Theresa1 aRacette, Brad A.1 aSimpson, Christopher D.0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2017 July 03, v. 22, no. 3 p.215-221dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2017.13176843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001700159245009300176300001800269500000900287520195000296592002802246650001302274650001602287650001802303650001602321650001902337650001302356650002602369650002102395650002502416650002002441650002102461700002002482773015002502852000902652856009602661655001202757IND2047491920221119092815.0191125e199507  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204749192DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900040016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, C.

Merr.] than for corn grown after corn, but the reason for the difference in N fertilizer requirement has not been clearly established. We studied immobilization and mineralization induced by various management histories and residue treatments to learn about the causes of differences in N fertilizer requirements. Soil samples were collected at five sites in the fall of 1990 from plots that had been planted to soybean and plots that had been planted to corn receiving various N rates. The soil samples were incubated for 42 wk after treatment with ¹⁵N-labeled NO⁻₃ and with crop residues. All treatments showed a period of net immobilization followed by a period of net mineralization. Net amounts of N immobilization induced by soybean residue were approximately equal to those induced by corn residue from plots with the higher rates of fertilization. However, the soybean-induced immobilization was much more rapid. Rates of mineralization of nonlabeled N were not greater from soils having soybean residue than from soils having corn residue. Because soybean produces less residue under field conditions, the results suggest that differences in N fertilizer requirement are better explained by differences in amounts of N immobilized during residue decomposition than by mineralization of biologically fixed N associated with the soybean.

We utilized an opportunity to assess the outcome of a test and cull programme aimed at limiting the spread of Mycobacterium bovis in African buffalo. Buffalo act as reservoirs of M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (BTB), which can have major economic, ecological and public health impacts through the risk of infection to other wildlife species, livestock and surrounding communities. BTB prevalence data were collected in conjunction with disease control operations in Hluhluwe–iMfolozi Park, South Africa, from 1999 to 2006. A total of 4733 buffalo (250–950 per year) were tested for BTB using the single comparative intradermal tuberculin (SCIT) test, with BTB‐positive animals culled, and negative animals released. BTB prevalence was spatially and temporally variable, ranging from 2.3% to 54.7%. Geographic area was a strong predictor of BTB transmission in HiP, owing to relatively stable herds and home ranges. Herds experiencing more intensive and frequent captures showed reduced per capita disease transmission risk and less increase in herd prevalence over time. Disease hot spots did not expand spatially over time, and BTB prevalence in all but the hot spot areas was maintained between 10% and 15% throughout the study period. Our data suggest that HiP's test and cull programme was effective at reducing BTB transmission in buffalo, with capture effort and interval found to be the crucial components of the programme. The programme was thus successful with respect to the original goals; however, there are additional factors that should be considered in future cost/benefit analyses and decision‐making. These findings may be utilized and expanded in future collaborative work between wildlife managers, veterinarians and scientists, to optimize wildlife disease control programmes and mitigate conflict at the interface of conservation, agricultural and urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aSyncerus caffer 3abovine tuberculosis 3abuffaloes 3adecision making 3adisease control programs 3adisease transmission 3aemerging diseases 3aherds 3ahome range 3amanagers 3apublic health 3arisk 3ascientists 3atuberculin 3aurban areas 3aveterinarians 3awildlife 3awildlife diseases 3aSouth Africa1 aCooper, D.1 avan Helden, P.

Orthoptera appear to be good indicators of global warming. The goal of this study was to take a census of the species overwintering at the adult stage in a xerothermic oasis in an Alpine Valley. With this purpose, in the month of February, the available, observable species were monitored for two consecutive years, focused on repeatedly monitoring the same plots. Overall, the study recorded four species, two of which (Pezotettix giornae and Chorthippus brunneus brunneus) had never before been reported overwintering as adults in the Italian Alps before. Considering the potential effect of warmer winters that are forecast for the next few decades, the ability of some species to survive in winter as adults may increase in the study area, and may even become possible in others areas of occurrence where climatic conditions currently do not allow it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChorthippus brunneus 3aadults 3anatural history 3aoases 3aoverwintering 3awinter 0aOrthoptera 0aphenology 0aPezotettix giornae0 tJournal of natural history.g2020 July 17, v. 54, no. 27-28 p.1713-1720dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2020.18200943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011700156520132400273592002801597650001901625650001401644650001401658650001901672650001601691650001601707650001501723650002101738650002301759650001801782650001701800651001001817700001701827700001901844700001601863700001501879773011901894856007302013852000902086655001202095IND60653384620221119082341.0190714e20180802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065338462DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Weiwei10aCountermeasure Analysis on Promoting Drinking Water Safety in Shanshan County, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China  aIn recent years, China has paid an increasing amount of attention to improving urban and rural drinking water safety, an important aspect of building a healthy and stable society. This study analyzed countermeasures to promote drinking water safety in Turpan City of Shanshan County, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. First, we considered the current state of drinking water safety in Shanshan, including issues such as pollution, outdated water treatment technologies, leakage in the water supply pipe network, insufficient emergency management capability in urban areas, and low water supply guarantee rates in rural areas due to poor construction standards. Second, the quantity of guaranteed water resources was estimated; on this basis, an ideal distribution of regional water plants and water supply network needs for the optimal allocation of water resources is suggested. Third, a water purification program was developed to solve untreated water quality problems, including centralized and decentralized water quality treatments alongside intelligent water flow control processes. Water resource conservation and risk control measures are also proposed in order to promote the security of drinking water; equipment updates, and the establishment of an intelligent water management platform are also suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3aequipment 3apollution 3arisk reduction 3arural areas 3aurban areas 3awater flow 3awater management 3awater purification 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aChina1 aLiu, Jiahong1 aZhang, Haixing1 aYan, Dianyi1 aLi, Weijia0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 02, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245008300206500001900289520143300308592002801741650003101769650003101800650001501831650001701846650002101863650001801884650001601902650002401918650001501942650002201957650002001979650002001999653000802019653000802027653002002035653001002055700006202065700002102127700006002148700006402208700001502272773012402287856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60712925520221117165844.0201023e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071292552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Atsuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0758-872710aPolyamines polarized Th2/Th9 cell-fate decision by regulating GATA3 expression  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyamines produced by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are bioactive substances with pleiotropic effects. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that polyamines contribute to anti-inflammatory responses by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in mononuclear cells and macrophages. However, the effects of polyamines on CD4⁺ T cell responses remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of polyamines on cell fate decisions of naïve CD4⁺ T cells in vitro. We found that endogenously generated polyamines are essential for the development of T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Treatment with DL-2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, diminished GATA3 expression in CD4⁺ T cells under Th2-skewed conditions. Supplementation of exogenous polyamines rescued GATA3 downregulation caused by DFMO treatment in CD4⁺ T cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that deprivation of endogenous polyamines resulted in upregulated Th9-related genes, such as Il9, Irf4, and Batf3, even under the Th2-skewing conditions. Depletion of intracellular polyamines reduced GATA3 expression but increased IL-9-producing CD4⁺ T cells under both Th2 and Th9-skewing conditions. Furthermore, oral administration of DFMO increased IL-9-producing CD4⁺ T cells in small intestine in mice. Thus, our data indicate that polyamines play a critical role in the regulation of the Th2/Th9 balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aGATA transcription factors 3abiophysics 3abiosynthesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3ainterleukin-9 3amacrophages 3aoral administration 3apolyamines 3aprokaryotic cells 3asmall intestine 3atranscriptomics 0aTh2 0aTh9 0aDifferentiation 0aGATA31 aTakahashi, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8624-11601 aNakamura, Yutaka1 aYamada, Takahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2613-56001 aMatsumoto, Mitsuharu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0378-30771 aHase, Koji0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 693 p.108587-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012600164300001400290506002800304520223100332592002802563506003702591650001102628650001102639650002202650650002402672650001702696650001002713650001502723650001502738650001002753650001502763650001402778650000902792651001202801653001902813653001102832653001002843653001002853653002302863653001102886700002002897700002102917773021302938856007703151852000903228655001203237IND60785226020221207083137.0200113e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078522602DNAL7 a10.32718/ujvas1-2.032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShcherbatyy, A.R.10aHypocobaltosis and hypocuprosis in pregnant mares in the western biogeochemical zone of Ukraine (distribution, diagnosis)  ap. 11-14.  aResource is Open Access  aThe article presents theoretical and experimental substantiation of relationship between the content of trace elements in the soil, water, feed and blood of mare with hypocobaltosis and hypocuprosis in biogeochemical province of Transcarpathia. The total content of Zn in soils is 50.96 mg/kg, Cu – 16.32, Co – 7.14, and Mn – 493.97 mg/kg. It was established decrease in the concentration of mobile forms of Cu and Co (0.01mg /kg), Cr (1.93), Pb (1.66), Ni (0.67), Zn (1.42). Also, in water from artesian wells of research farm it was established decreased content of Co (by 3.3 times), Cu (111), Zn (1.19), Mn (1.31), Cd (5.0 times) and on the contrary increased content of Pl by 5.6, Ni – 3.3 and Fe – 43.5 times. Providing of mares by Co is 54.7%, Cu – 88.5, Zn – 83.3, Fe – 88.4, Mn by 29%. The negative effect of Cobalt and Copper deficiency on erythrocytopoesis is shown. In particular, the number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin level, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin content in the erythrocyte indicate a development of alimentary anemia in pregnant mares. The established low level of Co and Cu that indicates the development of polymicroelementosis in mares. The Cobalt content in blood of non-pregnant mares was on the lower physiological limit and on average it was 0.48 ± 0.02 μmol/l. In the mares, at 7 month of pregnancy, the Cobalt content was lower (P < 0.01) than that of non-pegnant. In the 9–11 months of pregnancy, its level was on average 0.19 ± 0.02 μmol/l, which is lower by 2.5 and 1.9 times than in non-pregnant mares (P < 0.001) and at 4 months of pregnancy (P < 0.05). The Copper content in blood of mares at 9–11 months of pregnancy was lowest and the average was 2.09 ± 0.07 μmol/l (1.98–2.27), which is lower on 46.8 and 22.6% (P < 0.001) compared to non-pregnant and mares at 4 month of pregnancy. Hypocopperemia was established in 100% of studied mares. In non-pregnant mares, the Copper content was on average 3.93 ± 0.14 μmol/l. Taking into account the role of these microelements in metabolic transformations, changes in the composition of blood and the development of metabolism disorders in the organism of mares during the period of pregnancy can be explained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3acobalt 3acopper deficiency 3adeficiency diseases 3aerythrocytes 3afarms 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3amares 3ametabolism 3apregnancy 3asoil 3aUkraine 0atrace elements 0aration 0awater 0ablood 0aerythrocytopoiesis 0acopper1 aSlivinska, L.G.1 aLukashchuk, B.O.0 tUkrainian journal of veterinary and agricultural sciences.g2018 Nov., v. 1, no. 2 p.11-14dStepan Gzhytskyi National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnologies LvivwJournal:27911x2617-61497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32718/ujvas1-2.033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164500001900309520138100328592002801709650001501737650001901752650001201771650001501783650001101798650002001809650001701829653001701846653002801863653003801891653001401929700001701943700001501960700001201975700001701987773012402004856008102128852000902209655001202218IND60712925620221117165827.0201023e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071292562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Lijuan10aMicroRNA-885 regulates the growth and epithelial mesenchymal transition of human liver cancer cells by suppressing tropomodulin 1 expression  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroRNA-885 (miR-885) has been shown to act as vital regulator of tumorigenesis and its tumor-suppressive role has been investigated in several human cancers. However, the role of miR-885 in regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition of liver cancer cells yet unknown. This study was undertaken to investigate the tumor-suppressive role of miR-885 and investigate its effects on epithelial mesenchymal transition of human liver cancer cells. The results revealed that miR-885 to be significantly (P < 0.05) repressed in liver cancer and tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-885 resulted in significant (P < 0.05) decline in the proliferation of liver cancer cells. Additionally, migration and invasion of the liver cancer cells was also suppressed upon miR-182 overexpression which was associated with alteration of the proteins associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition. TMOD1 was identified as the target of miR-885 and the regulatory role of miR-885 was elucidated to be exerted via post-transcriptional silencing of TMOD1. The silencing of TMOD1 by miR-885 inhibited the expression of mesenchymal markers but enhanced the expression levels of epithelial markers. The results of present study revealed miR-885 proved the tumor-suppressive role of miR-885 in liver cancer and points towards its therapeutic implications in liver cancer management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3acarcinogenesis 3adecline 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3atherapeutics 0aLiver cancer 0aTropomodulin 1 microRNA 0aEpithelial-mesenchymal transition 0aMTT assay1 aZhang, Yueyi1 aYang, Qing1 aGuo, Li1 aYang, Feifei0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 693 p.108588-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014400174520185400318592002802172650004402200650001202244650002202256650001502278650001802293650001502311650001502326650001402341650002402355650001802379650001902397650001802416650000702434650002302441650001602464650002102480650003802501650003702539650001502576650001602591653002002607653001802627653001702645653002002662653001302682653001302695700002802708700001902736700002302755773009102778856009002869852000902959655001202968IND60793854620221118051351.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079385462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1365302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajamehala, M.10aSynthesis of metal-based functional nanocomposite material and its application for the elimination of paracetamol from synthetic wastewater  aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) like paracetamol and other substances released into the water system pose serious environmental issues. The current work examines the synthesis of a nanocomposite combined with Moringa olifera aqueous leaf extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the green synthesis of nanocomposites. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) were used to investigate metal based functional nanocomposites. The absorption band centered at a wavelength of 243 nm, which corresponds to the surface plasmon resonances of the produced nanocomposite, is confirmed in UV–vis spectra. The distinctive band at this particular wavelength is attributed to a particular group of nanocomposites based on the result from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra. The spherical with irregularly shaped aggregates was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and the average size of nanoparticles was found to be 1 nm. For the elimination of pharmaceutical contaminants such as paracetamol from aqueous solutions, the adsorptive characteristics of nanocomposites were examined. Temperature, pH, adsorbent dosage, and agitation speed were investigated as adsorption parameters using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). The best removal outcomes were found under the following circumstances: temperature at 303.15 K, pH = 7.5, 0.05 g of nanocomposites at 200 rpm. Based on the adsorption study, the kinetics was found to be pseudo first order (R² > 0.9481) which was validated and fitted by Langmuir isotherm (R² > 0.9973). The adsorption study confirms that it was adsorbed onto the synthesized nanocomposite and found to be present on the homogeneous surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMoringa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aexperimental design 3aleaf extracts 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 3awavelengths 0aPharmaceuticals 0aNanocomposite 0aContaminants 0aMoringa olifera 0aIsotherm 0aKinetics1 aPandian, A.

To evaluate the potential of Rapistrum rugosum and Sinapis arvensis in lead- contaminate phytoremediate, a pot culture experiment was conducted. The pots were filled by soil treated with different rates of leadoxide (PbO) including 0 (control), 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg Pb per 1 kg soil. Germinated seeds were sown. Surprisingly, with increasing concentration of Pb, dry weight of R. rugosum and S. arvensis did not decrease significantly. In both of species, the concentration of Pb was higher in roots than shoots. In general, S.arvensis was absorbed more Pb compared to R. rugosum . The results revealed high potential of R. rugosum and S. arvensis in withdrawing Pb from contaminated soil. For both species, a positive linear relation was observed between Pb concentration in soil and roots. However, linear relationship was not observed between Pb concentration in the soil and shoots. Although both species test had low ability in translocation Pb from roots to shoots but they showed high ability in uptake soil Pb by roots. Apparently, these plants are proper species for using in phytoremediation technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSinapis arvensis 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apot culture 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 0aheavy metals 0alead 0aphytoremediation technology 0aRapistrum rugosum 0aSinapis arvensis1 aRashed Mohassel, Mohammad Hassan1 aParsa, Mehdi1 aHammami, Hossein0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 18, no. 4 p.387-392dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.11096073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011400161520140000275592002801675650001901703650001101722650002001733650001101753650002601764650002101790700002401811700002401835773011901859856007301978852000902051655001202060IND60653384820221119082157.0190714e20180802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065338482DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, Heather  S.10aEvaluating Energy and Cost Requirements for Different Configurations of Off-Grid Rainwater Harvesting Systems  aThe goal of this analysis was to evaluate energy and cost requirements for different configurations of a rainwater harvesting (RWH) system in conjunction with a solar PV and energy storage system for an off-grid house. Using models in fluid mechanics, we evaluated energy and power requirements for four different system configurations: 1. An On-Demand System containing a single speed pump (OD-SS), 2. An On-Demand System containing a variable speed pump (OD-VS), 3. A Pressurized Storage System where water is pumped once during the day into a large pressurized tank for later consumption and treated on demand via UV light (PS-AOT), and 4. A Pressurized Storage System where water is treated once per day via UV light and then stored for later consumption (PS-TO). Our analysis showed that the OD-SS system model requires 2.63 kWh per day, the OD-VS system model requires a total energy of 1.65 kWh per day, and the PS-AOT requires 1.67&ndash;1.69 kWh per day depending on the pump size, and the PS-TO system requires 0.19&ndash;0.36 kWh per day depending on the pump size. When comparing estimated cost between systems, we found the OD-SS system to be the most expensive. With the OD-SS system as a base for system costs, we found the OD-VS system to be 39% less expensive, the PS-AOT system to be 21% less expensive, and the PS-TO system to be 60% less expensive than the base OD-SS system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost estimates 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater harvesting1 aUpshaw, Charles  R.1 aWebber, Michael  E.0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 02, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001600296520108200312592002801394650002801422650001501450650002001465650000901485650001501494650001701509650001501526653002701541653002101568653002601589653002501615653001901640700001801659700002001677700002001697773011201717856008501829852000901914655001201923IND60634717620221119052533.0190325e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063471762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeltokorpi, Antti10aDesigning an organizational system for economically sustainable demand-side management in district heating and cooling  ap. 433-442.  aThe sustainable implementation of demand-side management (DSM) for district heating and cooling (DHC) is often limited because of DHC’s complexity and the requirements to involved stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to define the design principles of an organizational system for implementing economically sustainable DSM innovations in DHC. A design science approach is used to qualitatively analyze a real-life DSM implementation and decontextualize the organizational design toward more widely applicable principles. Combining empirical material gathered from ten interviews, document analysis and six months of participant observations with recent theoretical development on innovation ecosystems, we formulate a conceptual process framework that can facilitate the development and operation of an economically sustainable DSM solution. The process framework features five interlinked design principles. The findings contribute to the literature on multiorganizational systems and the implementation of technological innovations in the building and energy sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3aecosystems 3aenergy industry 3aheat 3ainterviews 3astakeholders 3atechnology 0aDemand-side management 0aDistrict heating 0aOrganizational design 0aInnovation ecosystem 0aDesign science1 aTalmar, Madis1 aCastrén, Klaus1 aHolmström, Jan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 10, v. 219 p.433-442dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001400181245005300195300001400248500001100262500001500273506007600288520154900364592002801913506003701941650002101978650001001999650001302009650001102022650002402033650001602057650001102073650000902084650002202093650001402115650002502129650002002154650001302174650001302187650001702200650002202217650001102239650001402250650002402264653002202288700001502310700001402325700001702339700001302356700001402369700003102383773013302414856007402547852000902621655001202630IND60588291620221207105659.0180103e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058829162DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.123512doi7 aPMC71697092pmcid7 a259196492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiry, D.10aHepatitis E Virus and Related Viruses in Animals  ap. 37-52.  aREVIEW  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHepatitis E is an acute human liver disease in healthy individuals which may eventually become chronic. It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E‐related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV‐related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1–4. The discovery of new HEV or HEV‐related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV‐related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear. This review discusses aspects of the detection, molecular virology, zoonotic transmission and origin of HEV and HEV‐related viruses in the context of ‘One Health’ and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aliver 3ataxonomy 3ahumans 3aopen reading frames 3ahepatitis E 3agenome 3ameat 3aemerging diseases 3aserotypes 3adeveloping countries 3awater treatment 3avirology 3agenotype 3awild animals 3agenetic variation 3apeople 3aingestion 3adeveloped countries 0aHepatitis E virus1 aMauroy, A.1 aPavio, N.1 aPurdy, M.

In the current study, it was demonstrated that the latex extracted from E. fischeriana strongly respelled the growth of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Using spectroscopic methods, HPLC, and GC-MS analyses, six aliphatic tigliane diterpenoids were isolated from the latex of E. fischeriana, among which three compounds (2, 3, and 5) were new. Two major compounds (1 and 4) exhibited remarkable antifeedant activity against H. armigera, with EC₅₀ values at 2.59 and 15.32 μg/cm², respectively. In addition, the quantification analysis of diterpenoids in different organs indicated that 4 was the most abundant constituent and was highly accumulated in the latex. Collectively, the current study highlighted that the diterpenoids in latex of E. fischeriana had a considerable antifeedant function against H. armigera, which might be employed for the future development of natural insecticides for organic farming.  aThis research was financially supported by the National Key Research & Development (R&D) Program of China (2017YFD0201400, 2017YFD0201403) and the Talent Program of Shenyang Agricultural University (awarded to Shi-Hong Luo).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0201400a2017YFD0201403cNational Key Research & Development (R&D) Program of China  cTalent Program of Shenyang Agricultural University 3aEuphorbia fischeriana 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aantifeedants 3aantifeeding activity 3aditerpenoids 3afluids 3ainsecticides 3alatex 3aorganic production 3aresearch 3aspectroscopy 0atigliane diterpenoids 0aantifeedant activity 0ainsect growth inhibition1 aQu, Bo1 aZhan, Zhong-Lang1 aWang, An-Qi1 aZhou, Wei1 aJia, Ming-Yue1 aHua, Juan1 aLuo, Shi-Hong0 tNatural product research.g2021 Jan. 17, v. 35, no. 2 p.179-187dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2019.16167283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013000173300001600303520116400319592002801483650002001511650001501531650001401546650003001560650003301590650001101623650001401634650001601648650001801664651001201682700002901694700003801723700002801761700001901789700002801808700002001836773011601856856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60573996320221120181033.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-016-1011-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuesmi-Mzoughi, Ilhem10aIntegrative identification and molecular phylogeny of dagger and needle nematodes associated with cultivated olive in Tunisia  ap. 389-414.  aThe occurrence and geographic distribution of longidorid nematode species inhabiting the rhizosphere of cultivated olive (cvs. Chemlali and Chétoui) in Tunisia were investigated. Morphological and morphometrical studies identified three Longidorus and six Xiphinema species, with frequencies of prevalence as following: Longidorus africanus (23.0 %), L. euonymus (4.5 %), L. glycines (13.7 %), Xiphinema conurum (13.7 %), X. italiae (36.4 %), X. meridianum (13.7 %), X. pachtaicum (18.2 %), X. robbinsi (9.1 %), and Xiphinema sp. (4.5 %). The three Longidorus species were reported for the first time in Tunisia, in addition to two species of Xiphinema (viz. X. meridianum and X. robbinsi). Molecular characterisation using D2-D3 expansion regions of 28S rRNA and ITS1-rRNA was carried out and Bayesian inference analysis was used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among these species and with other longidorids. Twenty-five new D2-D3 of 28S rRNA gene sequences were obtained in the present study, seven for Longidorus and 18 for Xiphinema spp., as well as 14 new ITS1 rRNA gene sequences (seven for Longidorus and seven for Xiphinema spp.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aLongidorus 3aXiphinema 3ageographical distribution 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aolives 3aphylogeny 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aTunisia1 aArchidona-Yuste, Antonio1 aCantalapiedra-Navarrete, Carolina1 aPalomares-Rius, Juan E.1 aRegaieg, Hajer1 aHorrigue-Raouani, Najet1 aCastillo, Pablo0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2017 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.389-414dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-016-1011-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245004800172300001400220506002800234520134000262592002801602506003701630650001501667650001401682650001401696650001101710650001301721650001401734650001801748650001601766650002401782650001401806651001401820653002201834653002601856700001201882700001101894773015501905856008002060852000902140655001202149IND60785226420221207094642.0181013e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078522642DNAL7 a10.24845/ijfac.v3.i3.772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahadianti, Endang Sri10aBiodiesel Production from Waste Cooking Oil  ap. 77-82.  aResource is Open Access  aIncreased energy consumption and the depletion of petroleum reserves have pushed up oil prices globally. The diminishing petroleum reserves are a problem inherent in this type of fossil energy. One alternative energy source that has the potential to be developed in Indonesia is biodiesel. Used cooking oil or used cooking oil is a potential raw material for making biodiesel. In this study biodiesel was made from used cooking oil and methanol using the transesterification method with KOH catalyst. The production of biodiesel from used cooking oil begins with mixing raw materials of used cooking oil collected into one. The mixture is then precipitated for 24 hours. The transesterification process was carried out by mixing KOH (1% of oil weight) with methanol (ratio of methanol: oil 6: 1) at a temperature of 65 o C. After the temperature is reached, the methanol and KOH solution is added slowly while pumping (stirring), with a variation of time 30, 45, 60.75 and 90 minutes. Biodiesel purification is done by washing using hot water (temperature 70 C) twice as much washing. Characteristics of biodiesel based on the best conditions for density 0.886 g / mL, viscosity 5.89 cSt, FFA 0.11% , acid value 0.256 mgKOH/g and flash point 170.52 o C. The biodiesel products based on these parameters meet SNI 7182-2015 standards.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid value 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3amethanol 3apetroleum 3araw materials 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3aviscosity 3aIndonesia 0awaste cooking oil 0afree fatty acid (FFA:1 aYerizam1 aMartha0 tIJFAC (Indonesian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Chemistry).g2018 Oct., v. 3, no. 3 p.77-82dSriwijaya UniversitywJournal:27892x2540-94097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24845/ijfac.v3.i3.773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018900161300001800350520126400368592002801632650002401660650003601684650001301720650001801733650001601751650001801767650004301785650001701828650001201845650003001857650001501887650001501902650001201917650001101929650001001940650004301950650004401993650002302037650001502060650001402075650001502089650001002104700001902114700001302133700001902146700001602165700001602181700001702197700001902214773012402233856007502357852000902432655001202441IND60772604220221121082316.0220405e20220404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077260422DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04170c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shan-Shan10aGlycosides and flavonoids from the extract of Pueraria thomsonii Benth leaf alleviate type 2 diabetes in high-fat diet plus streptozotocin-induced mice by modulating the gut microbiota  ap. 3931-3945.  aTwenty glycoside derivatives and nine flavonoids from the leaves of Pueraria (P. thomsonii) were isolated by column chromatography and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of twenty glycosides and nine flavonoids from the extract of P. thomsonii leaf (PL) were 173.3 mg g⁻¹ and 134.7 mg g⁻¹, respectively. Two flavonoids with the highest content were robinin (49.28 mg g⁻¹) and puerarin (42.87 mg g⁻¹). Six flavonoids, i.e. puerarin, robinin, rutin, quercetin, quercitrin, and kaempferol showed more inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase than acarbose. PL could effectively increase the level of insulin, decrease the content of fasting blood glucose, reduce lipid accumulation in plasma, ameliorate oxidative injury and inflammation, and relieve liver and kidney damage in diabetic mice. Moreover, PL could increase intestinal probiotics to improve metabolic disorders caused by diabetes and decrease the level of Clostridium celatum to relieve inflammation. This study suggested that PL or its glycoside derivatives and flavonoids regulating glycolipid metabolism and inflammation levels might have the potential to be used to control type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium celatum 3aPueraria montana var. thomsonii 3aacarbose 3ablood glucose 3aglycolipids 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3akaempferol 3akidneys 3aleaves 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative toxicity 3aprobiotics 3aquercetin 3aquercitrin 3arutin1 aZhang, Niu-Niu1 aGuo, Sen1 aLiu, Shao-Jing1 aHou, Yu-Fei1 aLi, Shiming1 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aBai, Nai-Sheng0 tFood & function.g2022 Apr. 4, v. 13, no. 7 p.3931-3945dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04170c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013000154300001400284520179700298592002802095650001802123650001902141650002502160650003102185650002002216650002502236650001702261650001702278650001902295650001202314650001502326650002302341700001302364700001702377700001602394700001702410773012402427856007502551852000902626655001202635IND60657844920221122065126.0190823e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784492DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60326a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bojun10aHeparin-induced conformational changes of fibronectin within the extracellular matrix promote hMSC osteogenic differentiation  ap. 73-84.  aAn increasing body of evidence suggests important roles of extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulating stem cell fate. This knowledge can be exploited in tissue engineering applications for the design of ECM scaffolds appropriate to direct stem cell differentiation. By probing the conformation of fibronectin (Fn) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we show here that heparin treatment of the fibroblast-derived ECM scaffolds resulted in more extended conformations of fibrillar Fn in ECM. Since heparin is a highly negatively charged molecule while fibronectin contains segments of positively charged modules, including FnIII₁₃, electrostatic interactions between Fn and heparin might interfere with residual quaternary structure in relaxed fibronectin fibers thereby opening up buried sites. The conformation of modules FnIII₁₂–₁₄ in particular, which contain one of the heparin binding sites as well as binding sites for many growth factors, may be activated by heparin, resulting in alterations in growth factor binding to Fn. Indeed, upregulated osteogenic differentiation was observed when hMSCs were seeded on ECM scaffolds that had been treated with heparin and were subsequently chemically fixed. In contrast, either rigidifying relaxed fibers by fixation alone, or heparin treatment without fixation had no effect. We hypothesize that fibronectin's conformations within the ECM are activated by heparin such as to coordinate with other factors to upregulate hMSC osteogenic differentiation. Thus, the conformational changes of fibronectin within the ECM could serve as a ‘converter’ to tune hMSC differentiation in extracellular matrices. This knowledge could also be exploited to promote osteogenic stem cell differentiation on biomedical surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abone formation 3acell differentiation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3afluorescence 3agrowth factors 3aheparin 3astem cells 3atissue engineering1 aLin, Zhe1 aMitsi, Maria1 aZhang, Yang1 aVogel, Viola0 tBiomaterials science.g2014 Dec. 2, v. 3, no. 1 p.73-84dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60326a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002600185245009800211300001200309506007600321520167000397592002802067506003702095650001502132650001902147650000902166650002102175650002502196650001402221700002902235773010302264856007902367852000902446655001202455IND60119484620221207103907.0141214e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948462DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-2-r122doi7 aPMC1513022pmcid7 a126201222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinguillón, Carolina10aGenesis and evolution of the Evx and Mox genes and the extended Hox and ParaHox gene clusters  ap. 522.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hox and ParaHox gene clusters are thought to have resulted from the duplication of a ProtoHox gene cluster early in metazoan evolution. However, the origin and evolution of the other genes belonging to the extended Hox group of homeobox-containing genes, that is, Mox and Evx, remains obscure. We constructed phylogenetic trees with mouse, amphioxus and Drosophila extended Hox and other related Antennapedia-type homeobox gene sequences and analyzed the linkage data available for such genes. RESULTS: We claim that neither Mox nor Evx is a Hox or ParaHox gene. We propose a scenario that reconciles phylogeny with linkage data, in which an Evx/Mox ancestor gene linked to a ProtoHox cluster was involved in a segmental tandem duplication event that generated an array of all Hox-like genes, referred to as the 'coupled' cluster. A chromosomal breakage within this cluster explains the current composition of the extended Hox cluster (with Evx, Hox and Mox genes) and the ParaHox cluster. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies dealing with the origin and evolution of Hox and ParaHox clusters have not included the Hox-related genes Mox and Evx. Our phylogenetic analyses and the available linkage data in mammalian genomes support an evolutionary scenario in which an ancestor of Evx and Mox was linked to the ProtoHox cluster, and that a tandem duplication of a large genomic region early in metazoan evolution generated the Hox and ParaHox clusters, plus the cluster-neighbors Evx and Mox. The large 'coupled' Hox-like cluster EvxHox/MoxParaHox was subsequently broken, thus grouping the Mox and Evx genes to the Hox clusters, and isolating the ParaHox cluster.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3ahomeotic genes 3amice 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny1 aGarcia-Fernàndez, Jordi0 tGenome biology.g2003 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.522-522dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2003-4-2-r123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245015400159300001600313500001400329520080500343592002801148650001801176650001601194650002001210650001501230650001901245650001601264650001401280650001601294650002001310650002101330650001301351650002301364653002401387653001601411653001501427653002301442700002301465700002001488700001801508773014901526856007601675852000901751655001201760IND60710113220221122083302.0200908e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071011322DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-10002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoongyai, W.10amRNA expression of ANT genes, productive performance and nitrogen excretion of laying hen by feeding low protein diets and amino acid supplementation  ap. 222-226.  aNAL-light  aThe study investigated the effects of low protein diet and amino acid supplementation on production performance of laying hens from 49–57 weeks. A total of 135 chickens were divided into 3 groups: 17%CP, 15%CP and 15%CP supplemented with amino acid (AA). The results showed that the 15% CP group consumed less feed (P<0.01). Adding AA to 15%CP improved feed intake, Met intake, BWG, egg mass (P<0.01) and egg production (P<0.05), while FCR and egg quality were not affected. The percentage of abdominal fat and ANT gene expression were highest in the 15%CP + AA group (P<0.05). Nitrogen retention in manure of 15% CP + AA hens was lower than in 17%CP (P<0.01). These results indicated that the reduced-CP diets supplemented with AA improved production performances and decreased nitrogen excretion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aamino acids 3aanimal research 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3aexcretion 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3alow protein diet 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 0aANT gene expression 0aLaying hens 0aMethionine 0aNitrogen excretion1 aSuptavitanakit, S.1 aRakangthong, C.1 aBunchasak, C.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2019 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.222-226dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-10003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001600298520187200314592002802186650001102214650002402225650001702249650001402266650001302280650001302293650001102306650001102317650001702328650001502345650001402360650001102374650001502385650001502400650001302415650003202428650001002460650001702470651001302487700002002500700002002520700002102540700001902561700001902580773011802599856008202717852000902799655001202808IND60594636520221121134016.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-016-9997-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeyisa, Kenea10aAllometric equations for predicting above-ground biomass of selected woody species to estimate carbon in East African rangelands  ap. 599-621.  aWe developed species specific equations to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) of ten woody species in Borana rangelands of southern Ethiopia. A total of 150 plants 15 for each species were measured for biometric variables including the diameter at stump height (DSH), diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (TH) and crown diameters were destructively harvested to obtain dry biomass. Many equations that related three biomass components: total aboveground, stem and branches to single or combination of predicator variables: DSH, DBH, TH, crown area (CA) and crown volume (CV) fit the data well to predict total AGB and by components for each of the species (adj.R² > 0.80; P < 0.0001), but the form and variables comprising the best model varied among species. The total AGB of specifics (A. seyal, A. drepanolobium and A. etbaica and Lannea rivae) was significantly predicted from a combination of DSH, and CV and that of A.bussei species by the combination of DBH and CV, with a high adjusted coefficient of determination (adj.R² > 0.80; P < 0.0001), whereas the combination of DBH and TH best predicted the total AGB and component biomass (stem and branch) of A. tortilis (umbrella canopy shape), with adj.R² > 0.93; P < 0.0001. A generalized mixed-species allometric model developed from the pooled data of seven species was most accurately predicted by the combination of three predicators (DSH-TH-CA models), with adj. R² between 0.84 and 0.90 for all AGB categories. Hence, our species-specific allometric models could be adopted for the indirect biomass estimation in semi-arid savanna ecosystem of southern Ethiopia. The mixed species allometric models will give a good opportunity when species-specific equations are not available and contribute to estimate the biomass and carbon stock in woody vegetations of East African rangelands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLannea 3aaboveground biomass 3aagroforestry 3aallometry 3abiometry 3abranches 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3arangelands 3asavannas 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aEthiopia1 aSheleme Beyene,1 aMegersa, Bekele1 aSaid, MohammedY.1 aLeeuw, Jan de,1 aAngassa, Ayana0 tAgroforestry systems.g2018 June, v. 92, no. 3 p.599-621dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-016-9997-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002500185245011800210300001200328500001500340506007600355520154300431592002801974506003702002650002702039650001102066650001602077650001902093650001002112653001102122700002102133700001702154773010302171856007902274852000902353655001202362IND60119484720221207103913.0141214e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948472DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-2-r132doi7 aPMC1513032pmcid7 a126201232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramanian, Subbaya10aGenome-wide analysis of microsatellite repeats in humans: their abundance and density in specific genomic regions  ap. 523.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are found in most organisms, and occupy about 3% of the human genome. Although it is becoming clear that such repeats are important in genomic organization and function and may be associated with disease conditions, their systematic analysis has not been reported. This is the first report examining the distribution and density of simple sequence repeats (1-6 base-pairs (bp)) in the entire human genome. RESULTS: The densities of SSRs across the human chromosomes were found to be relatively uniform. However, the overall density of SSR was found to be high in chromosome 19. Triplets and hexamers were more predominant in exonic regions compared to intronic and intergenic regions, except for chromosome Y. Comparison of densities of various SSRs revealed that whereas trimers and pentamers showed a similar pattern (500-1,000 bp/Mb) across the chromosomes, di- tetra- and hexa-nucleotide repeats showed patterns of higher (2,000-3,000 bp/Mb) density. Repeats of the same nucleotide were found to be higher than other repeat types. Repeats of A, AT, AC, AAT, AAC, AAG, AGC, AAAC, AAAT, AAAG, AAGG, AGAT predominate, whereas repeats of C, CG, ACT, ACG, AACC, AACG, AACT, AAGC, AAGT, ACCC, ACCG, ACCT, CCCG and CCGG are rare. CONCLUSIONS: The overall SSR density was comparable in all chromosomes. The density of different repeats, however, showed significant variation. Tri- and hexa-nucleotide repeats are more abundant in exons, whereas other repeats are more abundant in non-coding regions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahumans 3achromosomes 3aintergenic DNA 3aexons 0agenome1 aMishra, Rakesh K1 aSingh, Lalji0 tGenome biology.g2003 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.523-523dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2003-4-2-r133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245015200167300001800319520125800337592002801595650002401623650001801647650002001665650002801685650001401713650001201727650002001739650001801759650001001777650001101787650001101798650000901809650001101818650001001829650001901839650001401858650001201872650001001884650001901894650001101913700002001924700002901944700002101973700003301994700003402027773010802061856007502169852000902244655001202253IND60532803220221119112954.0160728e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053280322DNAL7 a10.1021/bm50126182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTachaprutinun, Amornset10aAcrylate-Tethering Drug Carrier: Covalently Linking Carrier to Biological Surface and Application in the Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection  ap. 4239-4248.  aThe development of carriers to sustain drugs at stomach surface is an attractive strategy to increase drug bioavailability locally and systematically. So far, the only reported carrier that can form a covalent bond with mucus, the thiolated carrier, relies on a reversible disulfide exchange reaction between thiols on the carrier and disulfide bridges on the mucus. Here we show the design and fabrication of a cellulose carrier with tethering acrylate groups (denoted here as clickable carrier) that, under a nontoxic condition, can efficiently react with thiols on biomaterials in situ through the thermodynamically driven and kinetically probable Michael thiol–ene click reaction. Here we show the attachments of the clickable carriers to a mucin protein, a surface of human laryngeal carcinoma cells, and a surface of a fresh porcine stomach. We also show that the required thiol moieties can be generated in situ by reducing existing cystine disulfide bridges with either the edible vitamin C or the relatively nontoxic tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. Comparing to a control carrier, the clickable carrier can increase some drug concentrations in an ex vivo stomach tissue, and improve the Helicobacter pylori treatment in infected C57BL/6 mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3abiocompatible materials 3acellulose 3acystine 3adisulfide bonds 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3ahumans 3alarynx 3amice 3amucins 3amucus 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphine 3astomach 3aswine 3athermodynamics 3athiols1 aPan-In, Porntip1 aSamutprasert, Pawatsanai1 aBanlunara, Wijit1 aChaichanawongsaroj, Nuntaree1 aWanichwecharungruang, Supason0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 15, no. 11 p.4239-4248dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm50126183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245006700205300001600272520163700288592002801925650001501953650002301968650001101991650001302002653002402015653001002039653001002049653002302059653003302082773012502115856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60619590320221116144630.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061959032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7466-328310aImage segmentation for whole tomato plant recognition at night  ap. 434-442.  aA simplified pulse-coupled neural network was developed based on comentropy gradient for segmentation of tomato plant images captured at night. In this network, the connection matrix was determined using differences in the value and distance between the center and other pixels in a neighborhood. To minimize the number of iterations, the model used linear threshold attenuation function on a limited range. A new evaluation method based on comentropy gradient was also used to determine the best image segmentation result during iteration. Evaluation of 385 tomato plant images captured at night showed that the simplified pulse-coupled neural network segmented the images of tomato plants captured at night. The method improved the image segmentation performance, with best and false rates of 67.79% and 9.61%, respectively, for all segmentation results. In addition, the best and false rates are 59.22% and 13.77%, respectively, for the method based on the maximum comentropy. The proposed algorithm exhibited the optimal segmentation performance, with the best rate of 91.67%, the second best rate of 8.33%, and the false rate of 0.00% for images with 640 × 480 pixel captured at distances from 300 mm to 500 mm under various lighting conditions by using the lighting system composed of two 25 W incandescent light bulbs in the opposite layout at night. The linear threshold attenuation function improved the real-time performance of the method.

While there are only three TZF members in humans, a much higher number of TZFs has been found in many plant species. Notably, plant TZFs are over-represented by a class of proteins containing a unique TZF domain preceded by an arginine (R)-rich (RR) motif, hereafter called RR-TZF. Recently, there have been a large number of reports indicating that RR-TZF proteins can localize to processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SG), two novel cytoplasmic aggregations of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs), and play critical roles in plant growth, development and stress response, probably via RNA regulation. This review focuses on the classification and most recent development of molecular, cellular and genetic analyses of plant RR-TZF proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acytoplasmic granules 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenetic analysis 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aplant growth 3aribonucleoproteins 3astress response 3ayeasts 3azinc finger motif 0aArginine-rich motif 0aP-body and stress granules 0aRNA binding 0aRNA decay 0aRR-TZF protein 0aTandem CCCH zinc finger proteins1 aJang, Jyan-Chyun0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.1367-1375dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010800165300001800273520122600291592002801517650002301545650001401568650001201582650001101594650001101605650001501616650001001631650002201641650002201663650000901685650001201694650002401706650002501730650001601755650000901771700002401780700002201804700002401826700002501850773012801875856007402003852000902077655001202086IND60657845220221120233316.0190816e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784522DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay02313g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Helieder C.10aUltrasound-assisted digestion of biodiesel samples for determination of metals by stripping voltammetry  ap. 7170-7176.  aThe ultrasound-assisted digestion of biodiesel samples is demonstrated for the first time. The efficiency of the proposed sample preparation method was evaluated for trace metal determination by stripping voltammetric techniques, which are more susceptible to residual carbon content (RCC) in digestates. Biodiesel samples (50–75 mg) were treated in glass tubes, with a mixture of 3.0 mL of concentrated HCl and 4.5 mL of H₂O₂, placed inside an ultrasonic bath (40 kHz frequency and 120 W) exactly over the region of higher ultrasound intensity and sonicated for 40 min. These parameters were optimized using factorial design experiments for the analysis of spiked samples. Recovery values between 94 and 108% for zinc, cadmium, lead, copper and mercury were verified under optimized conditions. RCC values after US-assisted digestions were in the range of 3.05–3.75% using covered glass tubes, which are acceptable values for the accurate voltammetric determination of metals. These results indicate that the proposed sample preparation method presents comparable performance to traditional or microwave-assisted acid digestions and can be associated with on-site electroanalysis using screen-printed electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiodiesel 3acadmium 3acarbon 3acopper 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3amercury 3amicrowave treatment 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3azinc1 aAlmeida, Eduardo S.1 aTormin, Thiago F.1 aRichter, Eduardo M.1 aMunoz, Rodrigo A.

Striga hermonthica (striga) is an obligate root hemi-parasitic weed of maize and sorghum, which stunts growth and causes low grain yield. Data on physico-chemical properties of the soil, yield components of sorghum, striga infestation and spore abundance and colonization of AM fungi were collected from underneath and away from the F. albida canopy. The experiment was composed of four treatments and six replications in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 24 plots, each with 15 m² size. Soil and root samples were also collected from under and outside of the F. albida canopy and sorghum crops. Soil organic matter, total N, available P, CEC, and total K were significantly higher under the F. albida canopy than away from it (P < 0.05). Similarly, yield of sorghum was also significantly higher under the F. albida canopy than away from it (P < 0.05). The highest striga count was recorded away from the F. albida canopy. In contrast, minimal striga infestation was found under and at the periphery of the F. albida canopy. The spore density and colonization of AMF were higher under and at the periphery of the F. albida canopy than away from it (P < 0.05). There was a significant and negative correlation between AMF fungi spore density and colonization, and striga counts at the early stage of sorghum growth. Integrating F. albida into agricultural fields with sorghum crops improves productivity and maintains AM inoculum which may control striga weed infestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFaidherbia albida 3aStriga hermonthica 3aagroforestry 3abeneficial microorganisms 3acanopy 3acorn 3acropland 3acrops 3agrain yield 3agrowth retardation 3ainoculum 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3aspores 3atrees 3aweed control 3aweeds 3ayield components1 aGebremeskel, Kidu1 aTaddesse, Tewodros1 aHailemariam, Mengsteab1 aHadgu, KirosMeles1 aNorgrove, Lindsey1 aNegussie, Aklilu0 tAgroforestry systems.g2018 June, v. 92, no. 3 p.643-653dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-016-0027-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245006100164300001400225520144400239592002801683650002001711650002401731650001401755650001701769650001101786650002101797650001701818650001301835650002201848650003101870650001901901650001901920650001201939651001001951653001101961653001101972653000701983653000901990653001101999653000902010653000702019653000702026653001102033653000802044653000802052653000702060653000902067653000802076653002002084653004202104653002302146700001702169700001802186700001602204700001502220700001702235773008702252856008402339852000902423655001202432IND60544847420221120200711.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.09.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jing10aDoes ambient CO have protective effect for COPD patient?  ap. 21-26.  aExisting studies found paradoxical effects of carbon monoxide (CO) on human health. Carbon monoxide (CO), at high concentrations, is a well-known toxicant, but recent studies suggest that CO at low concentrations may have protective health effects under certain conditions.To investigate the acute effect of ambient CO on hospital admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Shanghai, China.Daily data on COPD admissions and CO concentrations between 2006 and 2008 were collected. We applied over-dispersed generalized additive Poisson models, adjusted for weather conditions, day of the week and public holidays, long-term and seasonal trends.During the study period, the average CO concentration was 1.3mg/m3, well below the international health-based standard. Negative associations were found between ambient CO concentration and daily COPD hospitalization. An interquartile range increase (0.6mg/m3) in CO concentration at lag 3day corresponded to −2.97% (95% confidence interval: −4.63%, −1.31%) change in COPD hospitalization. The negative associations were robust after adjustment for co-pollutants (PM10, NO2 and SO2). The protective effect of CO appeared to be more evident in the cool season.Short-term exposure to CO at low ambient concentration may be associated with reduced risk of COPD hospitalization. Our results may contribute to a comprehensive understanding on the health effects of ambient CO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3aconfidence interval 3ahospitals 3ahuman health 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk reduction 3asulfur dioxide 3aweather 3aChina 0aμg/m3 0a95% CI 0aCO 0aCOHb 0aCO-RMs 0aCOPD 0adf 0aHO 0aICD-10 0aIQR 0aNO2 0ans 0aPM10 0aSO2 0aCarbon monoxide 0aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease 0aTime-series models1 aChen, Renjie1 aWang, Weibing1 aXu, Xiaohui1 aHa, Sandie1 aKan, Haidong0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Jan., v. 136 p.21-26dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.09.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245013500215300001600350506007600366520155900442592002802001506003702029650001102066650002002077650001402097650001202111650000902123650001102132650001502143650001902158650001102177650001402188650001902202650000902221650003702230650001602267651001302283653001402296653001402310653001802324653001602342653002202358700002602380700003002406700002302436700002402459773008902483856008402572852000902656655001202665IND60544847520221207121634.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0422doi7 aPMC42821702pmcid7 a254606672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGronlund, Carina J.10aVulnerability to extreme heat by socio-demographic characteristics and area green space among the elderly in Michigan, 1990–2007  ap. 449-461.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe examined how individual and area socio-demographic characteristics independently modified the extreme heat (EH)-mortality association among elderly residents of 8 Michigan cities, May–September, 1990–2007.In a time-stratified case-crossover design, we regressed cause-specific mortality against EH (indicator for 4-day mean, minimum, maximum or apparent temperature above 97th or 99th percentiles). We examined effect modification with interactions between EH and personal marital status, age, race, sex and education and ZIP-code percent “non-green space” (National Land Cover Dataset), age, race, income, education, living alone, and housing age (U.S. Census).In models including multiple effect modifiers, the odds of cardiovascular mortality during EH (99th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH were higher among non-married individuals (1.21, 95% CI=1.14–1.28 vs. 0.98, 95% CI=0.90–1.07 among married individuals) and individuals in ZIP codes with high (91%) non-green space (1.17, 95% CI=1.06–1.29 vs. 0.98, 95% CI=0.89–1.07 among individuals in ZIP codes with low (39%) non-green space). Results suggested that housing age may also be an effect modifier. For the EH-respiratory mortality association, the results were inconsistent between temperature metrics and percentile thresholds of EH but largely insignificant.Green space, housing and social isolation may independently enhance elderly peoples' heat-related cardiovascular mortality vulnerability. Local adaptation efforts should target areas and populations at greater risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acities 3adata collection 3aeducation 3aelderly 3aheat 3aincome 3aland cover 3amarital status 3amodels 3amortality 3apublic housing 3arisk 3asociodemographic characteristics 3atemperature 3aMichigan 0aHeat wave 0aMortality 0aVulnerability 0aGreen space 0aSocio-demographic1 aBerrocal, Veronica J.1 aWhite-Newsome, Jalonne L.1 aConlon, Kathryn C.1 aO’Neill, Marie S.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Jan., v. 136 p.449-461dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014600159300001800305520202700323592002802350650004402378650001102422650002202433650002502455650002302480650001702503650001302520650001602533650003102549650001602580650002302596650002102619650001502640650001902655650001302674650004402687650000702731650001502738650002402753650001902777700001702796700001702813700001802830700001802848700001502866700001902881700001602900700001902916773010802935856007503043852000903118655001203127IND60532803620221119112422.0160728e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053280362DNAL7 a10.1021/bm501290t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Hongzhang10aPEG-b-PCL Copolymer Micelles with the Ability of pH-Controlled Negative-to-Positive Charge Reversal for Intracellular Delivery of Doxorubicin  ap. 4281-4292.  aThe application of PEG-b-PCL micelles was dampened by their inherent low drug-loading capability and relatively poor cell uptake efficiency. In this study, a series of novel PEG-b-PCL copolymers methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-γ-dimethyl maleamidic acid -ε-caprolactone) (mPEG-b-P(CL-co-DCL)) bearing different amounts of acid-labile β-carboxylic amides on the polyester moiety were synthesized. The chain structure and chemical composition of copolymers were characterized by ¹H NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). mPEG-b-P(CL-co-DCL) with critical micellar concentrations (CMCs) of 3.2–6.3 μg/mL could self-assemble into stable micelles in water with diameters of 100 to 150 nm. Doxorubicin (DOX), a cationic hydrophobic drug, was successfully encapsulated into the polymer micelles, achieving a very high loading content due to electrostatic interaction. Then the stability, charge-conversional behavior, loading and release profiles, cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity of free drug and drug-loaded micelles were evaluated. The β-carboxylic amides functionalized polymer micelles are negatively charged and stable in neutral solution but quickly become positively charged at pH 6.0, due to the hydrolysis of β-carboxylic amides in acidic conditions. The pH-triggered negative-to-positive charge reversal not only resulted in a very fast drug release in acidic conditions, but also effectively enhanced the cellular uptake by electrostatic absorptive endocytosis. The MTT assay demonstrated that mPEG-b-P(CL-co-DCL) micelles were biocompatible to HepG2 cells while DOX-loaded micelles showed significant cytotoxicity. In sum, the introduction of acid-labile β-carboxylic amides on the polyester block in mPEG-b-P(CL-co-DCL) exhibited great potentials for the modifications in the stability in blood circulation, drug solubilization, and release properties, as well as cell internalization and intracellular drug release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamides 3ablood circulation 3achemical composition 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adiameter 3adoxorubicin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendocytosis 3agel chromatography 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolubilization1 aLiu, Jinjian1 aZhao, Xuefei1 aZhang, Yuming1 aLiu, Jianfeng1 aXu, Shuxin1 aDeng, Liandong1 aDong, Anjie1 aZhang, Jianhua0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 15, no. 11 p.4281-4292dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm501290t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245015200212300001600364520159100380592002801971650002401999650001302023650002002036650002902056650002202085650002602107650001302133650000902146650001602155650002602171650002002197650001302217650002602230650001902256650002202275650001802297650001002315650001802325650002102343650001602364651001202380653002302392653002202415653003402437653002702471653001802498653002002516700006302536700002402599700002202623773012502645856008502770852000902855655001202864IND60619590620221116144643.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061959062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulridha, Jaafar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9961-951010aEvaluating the performance of spectral features and multivariate analysis tools to detect laurel wilt disease and nutritional deficiency in avocado  ap. 203-211.  aLaurel wilt (Lw) disease is an exotic and lethal disease that can kill laurel family trees very fast. It is vectored by the redbay ambrosia beetle that prefers to live and lay eggs inside avocado trees (among other plants). Lw disease continues to expand in Florida posing a major threat to the avocado industry. Early and accurate disease detection is very critical in this case to remove infected trees and distinguish Lw disease from other diseases or disorders with similar symptoms. Herein, we present a nondestructive remote sensing method to detect Lw-infected avocado trees (in early and late stage) and discriminate them from healthy and other factors that cause similar symptoms, such as iron and nitrogen deficiencies, by using a portable spectral data collection system (visible – near infrared; 400–970 nm). Two data sets were collected in 10 nm and 40 nm spectral resolution, and 23 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to detect Lw-affected trees by using two classification methods: decision tree (DT) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Additionally, the optimal wavelengths and VIs to discriminate healthy, Lw-infected and avocado trees with iron and nitrogen deficiencies were identified. The results showed that it was possible to detect Lw-infected trees at early stage and distinguish them from other biotic and abiotic factors with high accuracy (around 100%) using the MLP method. Poorer results were achieved with DTs. The optimum 10 nm wide bands and VIs selected for the Lw-detection were found in the red, red-edge and NIR bands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXyleborus glabratus 3aavocados 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3adisease detection 3aenvironmental factors 3aindustry 3airon 3alaurel wilt 3amultivariate analysis 3aneural networks 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aremote sensing 3aspectral analysis 3atree diseases 3atrees 3avascular wilt 3avegetation index 3awavelengths 3aFlorida 0aVegetation indices 0aDisease detection 0aSpectral reflectance analysis 0aMulti-layer perceptron 0aDecision tree 0aNeural networks1 aAmpatzidis, Yiannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3660-32981 aEhsani, R.q(Reza),1 ade Castro, Ana I.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 155 p.203-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006800171300001600239520126600255592002801521650001101549650001701560650001201577650002101589650001801610650001501628650002201643650001201665650001201677650001201689651001001701653000801711653000801719653001601727653002401743653001801767653002101785653001001806700001801816700001601834773009501850856008901945852000902034655001202043IND60585832220221118035336.0190319e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuraoka, Rie10aLand access, land rental and food security: Evidence from Kenya  ap. 611-622.  aLand scarcity is increasingly recognized as a problem impeding rural household welfare in densely populated areas of Africa. This study utilizes household- and parcel-level data from rural Kenya to explore the linkage between land access and food security. Renting land is found to be the main approach used by rural households in a given year to access additional land for cultivation. However, our econometric results show that land rental markets do not allow farmers to fully adjust their operated land size to desired levels. Furthermore, parcel-level analysis shows that indicators of land productivity and investment are lower on rented parcels than on own parcels. These findings indicate that land rental markets in Kenya do not enable land to be reallocated in ways that would fully contribute to national food security and poverty reduction goals. A 100% increase in rented land − which amounts to 1.04 acres for the median renter − would increase household food consumption per adult equivalent by 9%, cereal consumption per adult equivalent by 14%, and home-produced food consumption per adult equivalent by 11%. Even with imperfections in land rental markets, renting-in land still contributes to food security among rural households in Kenya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aeconometrics 3afarmers 3afood consumption 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aland productivity 3aleasing 3amarkets 3apoverty 3aKenya 0aO12 0aQ15 0aLand access 0aLand rental markets 0aFood security 0aFood consumption 0aKenya1 aJin, Songqing1 aJayne, T.S.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Jan., v. 70 p.611-622dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001700265520111400282592002801396650001901424650001901443650001101462650001601473650001001489650001101499650001601510650002001526650001401546700002601560773012601586856008401712852000901796655001201805IND60123436520221120083823.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343652DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9438602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawson, Zach J.12aA Morphometric Approach for Stocking Walleye Fingerlings in Lakes Invaded by Rainbow Smelt  ap. 998-1002.  aInvasive Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax have been associated with reductions in Walleye Sander vitreus recruitment, and predation by adult smelt on age-0 Walleyes has been identified as one of the potential mechanisms contributing to recruitment failure. Predation effects could be mitigated by stocking Walleye fingerlings based on smelt and Walleye morphometric relationships. By combining 0.95 quantile regression of smelt gape size on TL and 0.05 quantile regression of Walleye body depth on TL, we constructed a stocking tool to determine the appropriate size to stock Walleye fingerlings in lakes invaded by smelt such that few Walleyes are vulnerable to predation by smelt. In lakes where the largest smelt TL is known, Walleye fingerlings can be stocked according to the model: TL WYE = 0.819(TL RWS) − 23.838. In cases where the smelt population size structure is unknown, Walleyes should be stocked at sizes larger than 142 mm, which would be a sufficient size for Walleye fingerlings to avoid predation by Rainbow Smelt in all lakes in this study.

The molecular interactions controlling the organization of lipid monolayers composed of a cationic amphiphile tagged with a pyrene residue and a saturated or unsaturated phospholipid, namely, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, were investigated by Langmuir trough isotherms to understand how the molecular structure of the components and their relative amount affect the physicochemical properties of lipid monolayers. The obtained results show that the cationic headgroups and unsaturation of hydrophobic chains strongly affect the organization of the lipid monolayer as a function of the amount of components. On the other hand, the presence of the pyrene moiety does not seem to have a marked influence on the interaction within lipid assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3ahydrophobicity 3aphosphatidylcholines1 aDiociaiuti, Marco1 aGiansanti, Luisa1 aPetaccia, Manuela1 aBešker, Neva1 aMancini, Giovanna0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 120, no. 6 p.1126-1133dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b118363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245014200210300001800352520204200370592002802412650000802440650001902448650002502467650001502492650001402507650000902521650001502530650001702545650001802562650001902580650002902599650001102628650001302639650001102652650001502663650001302678650001902691700001902710700001802729773011902747856008702866852000902953655001202962IND60688732320221121221145.0200416e20200309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068873232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Duygu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-478810aExperimental and Thermodynamic Study on the Interaction of Copper Oxygen Carriers and Alkaline-Containing Salts Commonly Present in Ashes  ap. 4421-4432.  aAs CO₂ emission is one of the most critical issues that causes global warming, methods have been developed for carbon capture and storage. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) are unique and useful methods for direct separation of carbon dioxide in combustion. In CLC and CLOU, metal oxides are used as an oxygen carrier to transfer oxygen between an air and a fuel reactor. The fuel is oxidized with the released oxygen by the oxygen carrier used. When coal or any ash-containing fuels are used an interaction between ash-forming matters and oxygen carrier can occur which can cause to deactivation or agglomeration of the oxygen carriers. The composition of species in the ash and their amount can vary widely and also depend on the fuel used. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (TEC) can be used to predict the resulting compounds during in CLC and CLOU. This can help choosing the right fuel for the right oxygen carrier or vice versa. In this study, the interaction between common salt-based ash-forming matters present in ash and the widely used CuO oxygen carriers was studied both experimentally and thermodynamically. Experiments were carried out at 900 °C under both oxidizing and inert atmospheres using CuO or Cu₂O (CuO/Cu₂O) as the oxygen carrier and K- and Na-based carbonate, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate to represent salt compounds present in the ashes. To observe the interaction of the oxygen carriers with each salt compound used, equal moles of copper oxide and a salt compound were mixed. In addition to this, the effect of salt compounds used for the interaction between oxygen carrier and a model ash was also investigated. NaSO₄ showed the harshest effect among the salts used since it caused a strong agglomeration. Generally, potassium-based salts did not affect the oxygen carriers directly and the results were consistent with the TEC. However, sodium-based salts showed significant effect on the system which differed from the TEC results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbonates 3achlorides 3acoal 3acombustion 3acupric oxide 3acuprous oxide 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3asulfates 3athermodynamics1 aDarwish, Esraa1 aLeion, Henrik0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Mar. 09, v. 34, no. 4 p.4421-4432dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01513naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002000185245007800205300001200283506007600295520035500371592002800726506003700754650002500791650001800816650001300834650001700847650001400864650001300878650002500891650001400916700001800930773010300948856007901051852000901130655001201139IND60119485420221207103349.0141214e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948542DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-2092doi7 aPMC1534542pmcid7 a126200992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaven, John A.,10aGenomics and chloroplast evolution: what did cyanobacteria do for plants?  ap. 623.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complete genome sequences of cyanobacteria and of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana leave no doubt that the plant chloroplast originated, through endosymbiosis, from a cyanobacterium.

Within the field of biosensors there is a continuous emergence of new technologies or adaptations to platforms that push the limits of detection or expand dynamic ranges. TRPS is both unique and powerful in its ability to detect a wide range of biological analytes; including metabolites, proteins, cellular vesicles, viruses and whole cells. Each analyte can be analysed on the same platform without modification by changing the pore size, and is simple enough to follow to allow users from a range of backgrounds to start developing their own assays. The instrument can provide information regarding analyte concentration, size, and charge. Here we hope to give an overview of where this technology is being used and provide some guidance to new users, in the hope it will inspire and enable future experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3ametabolites 3aporosity 3aproteins 3atechnology 3aviruses1 aMayne, Laura J.1 aBillinge, Emily R.1 aPlatt, Mark0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 7, no. 17 p.7055-7066dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay03023k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012700161300001800288520176300306592002802069650002802097650003002125650001102155650001902166650002202185650002202207650000902229650001002238650003702248653003702285653002702322653001702349653000902366653003902375700002102414773012502435856007402560852000902634655001202643IND60152144620221120193518.0150529e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015214462DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcu0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobae, Yoshihiro10aEarliest Colonization Events of Rhizophagus irregularis in Rice Roots Occur Preferentially in Previously Uncolonized Cells  ap. 1497-1510.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a symbiotic association with several plant species. An arbuscule, a finely branched structure of AM fungi, is formed in root cells and plays essential roles in resource exchange. Because arbuscules are ephemeral, host cells containing collapsed arbuscules can be recolonized, and a wide region of roots can be continuously colonized by AM fungi, suggesting that repetitive recolonization in root cells is required for continuous mycorrhization. However, recolonization frequency has not been quantified because of the lack of appropriate markers for visualization of the cellular processes after arbuscule collapse; therefore, the nature of the colonization sequence remains uncertain. Here we observed that a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged secretory carrier membrane protein (SCAMP) of rice was expressed even in cells with collapsed arbuscules, allowing live imaging coupled with GFP–SCAMP to evaluate the colonization and recolonization sequences. The average lifetime of intact arbuscules was 1–2 d. Cells with collapsed arbuscules were rarely recolonized and formed a new arbuscule during the observation period of 5 d, whereas de novo colonization occurred even in close proximity to cells containing collapsed arbuscules and contributed to the expansion of the colonized region. Colonization spread into an uncolonized region of roots but sparsely into a previously colonized region having no metabolically active arbuscule but several intercellular hyphae. Therefore, we propose that a previously colonized region tends to be intolerant to new colonization in rice roots. Our observations highlight the overlooked negative impact of the degeneration stage of arbuscules in the colonization sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahyphae 3aimage analysis 3amembrane proteins 3amycorrhizal fungi 3arice 3aroots 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis 0aArbuscule degeneration 0aLive imaging 0aRice 0aSecretory carrier membrane protein1 aFujiwara, Tōru,0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.1497-1510dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012900170300001800299520162400317592002801941650001001969650002201979650001202001650000902013650001302022650001902035650001402054650001202068650002102080650001602101700001802117700001602135700001702151700002502168700002102193700005602214773011902270856008702389852000902476655001202485IND60688732520221121150331.0200416e20200318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068873252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Laipeng10aInsight into Pyrolysis Kinetics of Lignocellulosic Biomass: Isoconversional Kinetic Analysis by the Modified Friedman Method  ap. 4874-4881.  aIsoconversional methods are commonly used to process the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data and to simultaneously obtain the effective activation energies for lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. However, the widely used isoconversional methods may lead to some systematic problems, for example, numerical instability for the Friedman method and significant errors in the kinetic parameters for the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose methods. To avoid the above problems, a modified Friedman isoconversional method has been developed in this work to accurately determine effective activation energies for solid-state reactions, such as biomass pyrolysis reactions. Through processing theoretically simulated data of strongly varying activation energy, the modified method applying for narrow intervals of conversion degree was proven to be capable of calculating the conversion dependence of activation energy accurately and reducing the effect of data noise. The modified Friedman isoconversional method was employed to process the non-isothermal TGA data of wheat straw pyrolysis at heating rates of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 K min–¹ and the kinetic data of beech sawdust pyrolysis at 5, 10, and 20 K min–¹ from the literature. The results showed that the effective activation energies for the pyrolysis of wheat straw and beech sawdust varied significantly with the degree of conversion (in the conversion range from 0.05 to 0.85, the effective activation energies for wheat straw pyrolysis varied from 154 to 379 kJ mol–¹, while 155–316 kJ mol–¹ was reported for beech sawdust pyrolysis).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aactivation energy 3abiomass 3aheat 3akinetics 3alignocellulose 3apyrolysis 3asawdust 3athermogravimetry 3awheat straw1 aGuo, Xiaojuan1 aZhang, Zhen1 aChai, Meiyun1 aRahman, Md.

A single and symmetrical peak was shown by HPLC, indicating that AGP is a homogeneous polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 2.89 × 10³ KDa. Thespecific rotation of AGP was detected by a polarimeter and it was +45°. Monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that AGP was consisted of l-rhamnose: l-arabinose: d-xylose: d-mannose: d-glucose and d-galactose with a molar ratio of 1:2.33:2.85:0.69:3.05:1.54. The structure of AGP was analyzed by GC–MS, periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, FT-IR, methylation and NMR, which indicated that the AGP was composed of → 6)-β-d-Glcp-(→ backbone and the →4)-α-d-Xylp-(1→, →5)-α-l-Araf-(1→, →3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→, →6)-α-d-Galp-(1→, →3,6)-α-Manp-(1→ and →1)-β-d-Glcp as branches. The results of Congo red experiment and circular dichroism (CD) showed that there was triple helix conformation in AGP. The micro-structure of AGP were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which concluded that the shape of AGP was a “thin slice” and its structure is not regular. The crystal configuration was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), showing that there is no crystal structure. Furthermore, the AGP exhibited certain inhibition activity on α-glucosidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGlycyrrhiza inflata 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aarabinose 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3agalactose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amannose 3amethylation 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolysaccharides 3arhamnose 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3axylose 0aGlycyrrhiza inflata residue 0aAlkaline-extraction 0aPolysaccharide1 aKong, Xiangru1 aHao, Yali1 aZhang, Xiaoling1 aZhu, Zhenyuan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 147 p.1125-1135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04068naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006800192245012900260300001600389500001500405506007600420520203200496592002802528506003702556650002402593650002102617650001702638650001402655650001302669650001602682650001602698650002102714650001302735650002902748650001602777650002602793650002502819651001102844653001402855653002802869653001902897653001802916653001302934700006002947700002203007700002103029700001903050700003303069700002403102700001803126700002603144700002303170700005803193773009603251856008603347852000903433655001203442IND60531905820221207100640.0190319e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0422doi7 aPMC47296012pmcid7 a267429462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenezes, Ana Paula de O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9427-504210aNasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae among children in an urban setting in Brazil prior to PCV10 introduction  ap. 791-797.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInformation on pneumococcal carriage in the pre-vaccine period is essential to predict and assess the impact of PCV in settings where disease surveillance is particularly difficult. Therefore, we present data on pneumococcal carriage before the introduction of the 10-valent-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in Brazil. We conducted a prospective study on a cohort of 203 children aged <5 years old, randomly selected in an urban community located in the periphery of the city of Salvador, Brazil and followed them from January/2008 to January/2009. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each child at four times. In total, 721 swabs were collected, yielding a pneumococcal carriage prevalence of 55% (n=398). In multivariate analyses, the variables associated with carriage were having contact with three or more children <2 years old (OR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.33–2.89) and living in a house with an average of 3 residents per room (OR, 1.77; 95% CI 1.05–3.10). Also, white participants were more likely to be protected from colonization (OR, 0.52; 95% CI 0.29–0.93), and prevalence of carriage varied over time, with lower prevalence occurring from February to June (OR, 0.53; 95% CI 0.37–0.78) compared to July to January. Contact with children under 2 years of age and living in crowded housing also were associated with colonization by highly invasive serotypes, although this relationship was not significant. The most prevalent vaccine serotypes were 6A/B (25.4%), 19F (10.1%) and 14 (9.0%), while the most prevalent non-vaccine serotypes were 16F (4.8%), 15B/C (4.5%) and 6C/D (3.5%). Overall, 38.4% (153/398) of the isolates were non-susceptible to penicillin, and of those, 73.8% (113/153) were non-susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Colonization rate by PCV10 serotypes was 52.2%. Routine PCV10 vaccination can lead to significant changes in pneumococcal serotypes found in NP colonization, indicating a need for continued monitoring, especially in crowded settings, as occurs in Brazil's slums.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprospective studies 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3apenicillins 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3achildren 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3avaccination 3amultivariate analysis 3adisease surveillance 3aBrazil 0aSerotypes 0aNasopharyngeal carriage 0acohort studies 0aPCV10-vaccine 0aChildren1 aAzevedo, Jailton1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-86731 aLeite, Mariela C.1 aCampos, Leila C.1 aCunha, Marcelo1 aCarvalho, Maria da Gloria S.1 aReis, Mitermayer G.1 aKo, Albert I.1 aWeinberger, Daniel M.1 aRibeiro, Guilherme1 aReis, Joice N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-26580 tVaccine.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 34, no. 6 p.791-797dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007800174500002200252520125600274592002801530650000801558650000801566650002301574650001601597650001501613650002301628650001701651650002301668650001601691650001401707650002801721650001801749650002101767650001301788650001101801653001201812653001601824653001501840653001301855700001901868700001601887773009401903856005301997852000902050655001202059IND60795549320221117210608.0221004e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1094062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalita, Jon Jyoti10aRecent developments in application of nucleic acid aptamer in food safety  aPre-press version  aFood, a basic necessity of life, is often contaminated with harmful agents like pathogenic microorganisms, biotoxins, allergens, antibiotic residues, pesticides, heavy metals etc. Application of efficient, sensitive, reliable and cost-effective analytical technologies to detect the level of contaminants is one of the first steps in ensuring food safety. Oligonucleotide aptamers comprising of short sequences of DNA or RNA are emerging as an alternative to antibodies in development of novel biosensors or bioassays for analysis of various food contaminants. In the pursuit of developing a perfect analytical method, several design strategies involving nanomaterials, biological reagents, microfluidics etc. have resulted in several disruptive innovations. Currently, aptamers are utilised in affinity columns and various sorbent surfaces for selective extraction of analyte from food matrix. Taking advantages of target responsive characteristic and cross-linking ability of aptamers, hydrogel based sensing materials have been developed. In this review, we present an overview on the recent developments in application of aptamers in evaluating food safety and the influence of food matrices on the performance of aptamer based analytical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aanalytical methods 3aantibiotics 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3acrosslinking 3afood contamination 3afood matrix 3ahydrogels 3amicrofluidic technology 3ananomaterials 3aoligonucleotides 3asorbents 3atoxins 0aAptamer 0aFood safety 0aAptasensor 0aBioassay1 aSharma, Pragya1 aBora, Utpal0 tFood control.g2022 Sept. 25,  p.109406-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.109406  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001200235520151300247592002801760650001101788650001201799650000901811650001001820650002301830650001301853650001401866650000901880650002301889650001101912650001601923650001101939651001401950653001101964653001601975653001301991653001902004653001402023700001602037700001902053700002302072773008502095856008402180852000902264655001202273IND60544848020221120164945.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Cunrui10aUnusually cold and dry winters increase mortality in Australia  ap. 1-7.  aSeasonal patterns in mortality have been recognised for decades, with a marked excess of deaths in winter, yet our understanding of the causes of this phenomenon is not yet complete. Research has shown that low and high temperatures are associated with increased mortality independently of season; however, the impact of unseasonal weather on mortality has been less studied. In this study, we aimed to determine if unseasonal patterns in weather were associated with unseasonal patterns in mortality. We obtained daily temperature, humidity and mortality data from 1988 to 2009 for five major Australian cities with a range of climates. We split the seasonal patterns in temperature, humidity and mortality into their stationary and non-stationary parts. A stationary seasonal pattern is consistent from year-to-year, and a non-stationary pattern varies from year-to-year. We used Poisson regression to investigate associations between unseasonal weather and an unusual number of deaths. We found that deaths rates in Australia were 20–30% higher in winter than summer. The seasonal pattern of mortality was non-stationary, with much larger peaks in some winters. Winters that were colder or drier than a typical winter had significantly increased death risks in most cities. Conversely summers that were warmer or more humid than average showed no increase in death risks. Better understanding the occurrence and cause of seasonal variations in mortality will help with disease prevention and save lives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3acold 3adeath 3adisease prevention 3ahumidity 3amortality 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aAustralia 0aSeason 0aTemperature 0aHumidity 0aClimate change 0aMortality1 aChu, Cordia1 aWang, Xiaoming1 aBarnett, Adrian G.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Jan., v. 136 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245013000205300001800335506007600353520105700429592002801486506003701514650004901551650001801600650001601618650001301634650001501647650001201662650001901674650000901693650001201702700001701714700002301731700002401754700002001778700002101798773009901819856008101918852000901999655001202008IND60439029720221207101657.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2506-z2doi7 aPMC70867482pmcid7 a261385572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuma, Aiko10aInability of rat DPP4 to allow MERS-CoV infection revealed by using a VSV pseudotype bearing truncated MERS-CoV spike protein  ap. 2293-2300.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (Co-V) contains a single spike (S) protein, which binds to a receptor molecule, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), and serves as a neutralizing antigen. Pseudotyped viruses are useful for measuring neutralization titers against highly infectious viruses as well as for studying their mechanism of entry. In this study, we constructed a series of cytoplasmic deletion mutants of MERS-CoV S and compared the efficiency with which they formed pseudotypes with vesicular stomatitis virus. A pseudotype bearing an S protein with the C-terminal 16 amino acids deleted (MERSpv-St16) reached a maximum titer that was approximately tenfold higher than that of a pseudotype bearing a non-truncated full-length S protein. Using MERSpv-St16, we demonstrated the inability of rat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, suggesting that rats are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. This study provides novel information that enhances our understanding of the host range of MERS-CoV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aVesiculovirus 3aamino acids 3aantigens 3ahost range 3amutants 3aneutralization 3arats 3aviruses1 aTani, Hideki1 aTaniguchi, Satoshi1 aShimojima, Masayuki1 aSaijo, Masayuki1 aFukushi, Shuetsu0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Sept., v. 160, no. 9 p.2293-2300dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2506-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008800172300001600260520149100276592002801767650001701795650002301812650003301835650001201868650001601880650001201896650001501908650001501923650001501938650001901953650000901972650001501981651001001996653001902006653001502025653001402040653001902054653002302073700001402096700001602110773009502126856008902221852000902310655001202319IND60585832920221118035524.0190319e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jiehong10aCooperative membership, social capital, and chemical input use: Evidence from China  ap. 394-401.  aThe proper use of chemical input is an original and key link to ensure environmental sustainability and food safety, as it not only exerts influences in the environment such as soil and water but also people’s health directly. This paper targets at exploiting factors predicting the way that farmers use chemical input, based on first-hand data from 145 vegetable farmers with the membership of cooperatives in China. The role of social capital is investigated beyond traditional determinants. There are three indicators of social capital adopted in this paper, communication of technology and market information, trust, and members’ awareness of common goals. We identify three ways of chemical input use in field investigation. They are using chemical input according to own experience and the instruction on the package, under the guidance of the government, and under the guidance and monitoring of cooperatives. The findings of empirical analysis highlight the role of social capital in influencing the way farmers use chemical input. The awareness of common goals incentivizes farmers to use fertilizer under the guidance of the government and cooperatives, while all the three aspects of social capital are significantly associated with the way that farmers use pesticide. To be specific, farmers in a cooperative with a higher level of communication, trust, and common goals display the tendency to using chemical input based on external guidance rather than own experience.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooperatives 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afarmers 3afood safety 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3apesticides 3aprediction 3asocial capital 3asoil 3avegetables 3aChina 0aChemical input 0aFertilizer 0aPesticide 0aSocial capital 0aFarmer cooperative1 aLiu, Qing1 aLiang, Qiao0 tLand use policy.g2018 Jan., v. 70 p.394-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007700166300001800243500001900261520065900280592002800939650002500967650001700992650001001009650001601019650001101035650001401046650001401060650001601074650001101090700002101101773009901122856008301221852000901304655001201313IND60709373720221116142329.0210219e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070937372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDogra, Pranay10aStealth Killing by Uterine NK Cells for Tolerance and Tissue Homeostasis  ap. 1074-1076.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuman natural killer (NK) cells are critical for innate defense against pathogens through direct cytotoxicity of infected cells and are the predominant immune cell at the maternal-fetal interface.

Agribusiness has responded to international public opinion by introducing the Soy Moratorium, (SoyM), an agreement that aims to inhibit the destruction of forests to plant soy in the Brazilian Amazon. This pressure led to the creation of a joint working group comprised of representatives from the civil society, soy producers, and finally the Brazilian government. In this article, we analyze all the areas that were forested in 2006 and are now planted with soy in the Amazonian municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso. During the period in which we analyzed deforestation between 2009 and 2016, we identified 54 municipalities that were not in compliance with SoyM; a total of 59,972ha had been converted to soy plantation. These results can be ascribed to several reasons, one of which is, essentially, that SoyM has not been able to reach the offending producers. If we consider deforestation starting in 2006, the amount of soy grown in violation of SoyM would be equivalent to an estimated total of 350,000 tons⁻¹, or 9700 truckloads, only in the 2016/17 harvest. Nevertheless, even with these less satisfactory results, SoyM, the first voluntary zero-deforestation agreement implemented in the tropics, should be seen as a commendable initiative to engage all segments, including society, the productive sector, and the government, in this process. It merely needs to be refined, with all the groups involved in discussing new strategies in an international forum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3acompliance 3adeforestation 3aforests 3alegal agreements 3apublic opinion 3asoybeans 3atropics 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aAgriculture 0aSoybean 0aDeforestation 0aAmazon biome1 aLima, Mendelson0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.540-542dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245014300213300001600356520193100372592002802303650003702331650001602368650001402384650001102398650001902409650001302428650001102441650001502452650001002467653001502477653001702492653002002509653002802529653002002557653003102577700001702608700002002625700001702645773012302662856008802785852000902873655001202882IND60619591520221116144715.0210114e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061959152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrůček, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3137-225910aBeyond the cones: How crown shape plasticity alters aboveground competition for space and light—Evidence from terrestrial laser scanning  ap. 188-199.  aThere are many indications that for a true understanding of aboveground canopy competition, the concept of symmetric trees is oversimplified and unsatisfactory; in spite of that, this concept is still commonly used in forest ecology research. In this study we analyzed and quantified the effect of tree/crown asymmetry on crown-to-crown interactions and canopy light availability with respect to tree size and species.Geometric crown models were used to represent the concept of symmetric trees, while data from terrestrial laser scanning were employed to constitute real crown shapes, positions and mutual crown-to-crown interactions. We developed an original approach for measuring three-dimensional crown asymmetry, separating the effect of positional crown shift and local crown plasticity, and analyzed their effect in aboveground competition for space and light.In comparison with reality, the models neglecting tree asymmetry were only poor predictors of trees mutually competing for space. Geometric models taking the positional crown shift into account were good predictors of ‘space competitors’ for Norway spruce, but were still insufficient for European beech. This is because for spruce crown shifting seems to be the major neighbor avoidance strategy, while beech in addition exhibited high local crown shape plasticity. Additionally, of the two species beech showed overall greater crown plasticity, which (in contrast to spruce) decreased only slowly with increasing tree size.Importantly, the concept of symmetric trees significantly underestimates the potential canopy light availability (and thus overestimates canopy competition for light), because asymmetric and the plastic ‘puzzle-like’ arrangement of real tree crowns is more effective than assumed symmetric organization. This most likely inserts a systematic bias into stand growth simulators that are based on the concept of symmetric trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aasymmetry 3acanopy 3aforest ecology 3ageometry 3amodels 3aplasticity 3atrees 0aTree crown 0aCrown volume 0aCrown asymmetry 0aAboveground competition 0aGeometric shape 0aTerrestrial laser scanning1 aTrochta, Jan1 aCibulka, Miloš1 aKrál, Kamil0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 264 p.188-199dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012200178300001600300520116400316592002801480650002301508650001901531650001701550650001201567650001001579650003401589651001201623651001101635653000801646653000801654653000801662653000801670653002201678653002301700653004001723700002101763700001701784700002001801773009501821856008901916852000902005655001202014IND60585833120221118035327.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzhynski, Siarhei10aWhy the market value of residential premises and the costs of its purchase differ: The examples of Belarus and Poland  ap. 530-539.  aThe purpose of this study is to investigate features of transaction costs (fees and taxes) regarding real estate deals and to analyze transaction costs in the real estate market in emerging and established economies in order to research the link between the extent of market development and transaction costs. The authors’ methodological approach to estimation of transaction costs consists of qualitative and quantitative stages and is based on descriptive, normative and statistical information, which allows estimation and comparison of transaction costs as well as their structure and sources of occurrence by types. The two cases were chosen for practical implementation of the method: a transition economy of Belarus and a relatively established market economy of Poland. In order to measure transaction costs, the authors use the example of a residential property in order to provide a comparable basis for further analysis. Application of the method to the most prevalent pattern of real estate deals shows sufficient comparability of transaction costs (ca. 2.5%) and a slight difference (ca. 4%) caused by the absence of transaction tax in Belarus.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarket development 3amarket economy 3amarket value 3amarkets 3ataxes 3atransitional economic systems 3aBelarus 3aPoland 0aK34 0aO21 0aR00 0aR28 0aTransaction costs 0aResidential market 0aSecurity of real estate acquisition1 aŹróbek, Sabina1 aBatura, Olga1 aZysk, Elżbieta0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.530-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014400173300001800317520190500335592002802240650002602268650000902294650002402303650001602327650003502343650001102378650001002389650001702399651001302416700002002429700002302449773012602472856008402598852000902682655001202691IND60123437320221119080455.0150325e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343732DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9438592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFetherman, Eric R.10aRaft and Floating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Antenna Systems for Detecting and Estimating Abundance of PIT-tagged Fish in Rivers  ap. 1065-1077.  aPortable radio frequency identification (RFID) PIT tag antenna systems are increasingly being used in studies examining aquatic animal movement, survival, and habitat use, and their design flexibility permits application in a wide variety of settings. We describe the construction, use, and performance of two portable floating RFID PIT tag antenna systems designed to detect fish that were unavailable for recapture using stationary antennas or electrofishing. A raft antenna system was designed to detect and locate PIT-tagged fish in relatively long (i.e., ≥10 km) river reaches, and consisted of two antennas: (1) a horizontal antenna (4 × 1.2 m) installed on the bottom of the raft and used to detect fish in shallower river reaches (<1 m), and (2) a vertical antenna (2.7 × 1.2 m) for detecting fish in deeper pools (≥1 m). Detection distances of the horizontal antenna were between 0.7 and 1.0 m, and detection probability was 0.32 ± 0.02 (mean ± SE) in a field test using rocks marked with 32-mm PIT tags. Detection probability of PIT-tagged fish in the Cache la Poudre River, Colorado, using the raft antenna system, which covered 21% of the wetted area, was 0.14 ± 0.14. A shore-deployed floating antenna (14.6 × 0.6 m), which covered 100% of the wetted area, was designed for use by two operators for detecting and locating PIT-tagged fish in shorter (i.e., <2 km) river reaches. Detection distances of the shore-deployed floating antenna were between 0.7 and 0.8 m, and detection probabilities during field deployment in the St. Vrain River exceeded 0.52. The shore-deployed floating antenna was also used to estimate abundance of PIT-tagged fish. Results suggest that the shore-deployed floating antenna could be used as an alternative to estimating abundance using traditional sampling methods such as electrofishing.

It is becoming more common to replace some proportion of OPC with by-products from other industries that once were considered as waste and sent to the landfills. Known as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), these by-products are already being used as cement replacement materials at a growing pace in the construction sector. This results in reducing the potential environmental loads and, in some cases, improving the mechanical and durability properties of concretes. The aim of this research was to investigate the environmental, economic and functional performances of binary blended concretes containing Fly Ash (FA), Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace slag (GGBFS) and Silica Fume (SF) at different OPC substitution percentages. Using the MARS-SC method, the concretes were compared and ranked by their sustainability performances, based on a list of fifteen sustainability indicators. The results showed that concrete containing 40% of GGBFS was ranked as the most sustainable among the studied mixtures, as it presented the most suitable trade-offs to achieve the highest sustainability performance. Concrete with 15% of SF was ranked as the less sustainable, with a sustainability level lower than the conventional concrete. From a sustainability perspective, the optimum replacement ratio was found to be: 40% for GGBFS, 5% for SF, and 20% for FA, which means that exceeding that substitution ratio will probably lead to a binary blended concrete with a lower sustainability level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3aconcrete 3adurability 3afly ash 3alandfills 3asilica 3aslags 3asustainable manufacturing 3awastes 0aBinary blended concretes 0aSustainability assessment 0aSupplementary cementitious materials 0aFly ash (FA) 0aGround granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) 0aSilica fume (SF)1 aMateus, Ricardo1 aBragança, Luis,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 20, v. 220 p.445-459dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014200173300001600315520172500331536009802056592002802154596005302182650001802235650001202253650002502265650001702290650001602307650001902323650001402342650001402356650001602370650002102386650001802407650001102425650002002436650004202456650002102498650001302519650001802532650001102550650001402561650001602575650001702591650001402608650002102622650005302643650001602696650004302712650002002755651001002775653002602785653002502811653001602836653002502852653002902877700002302906700002602929700001802955700002302973700002302996700002603019773014003045856008603185852000903271655001203280IND60614829220221118101926.0191106e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061482922DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2018.14514092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmmendola, Sergio10aOlive Fruit Blends Modulate Lipid-Sensing Nuclear Receptor PPARγ, Cell Survival, and Oxidative Stress Response in Human Osteoblast Cells  ap. 589-597.  aObjective: The aim of the present study was to investigate how different extravirgin olive oils (EVOOs), obtained by blending Olea europea cultivars, could influence the cell growth, the response to inflammatory stimuli, and oxidative stress in a culture of the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. Methods: Three different extravirgin olive oils were physicochemically characterized, determining the free acidity, the oxidation status, the polyphenols content, and the antioxidative activity. Moreover, the effects on Saos-2 cell culture were determined, studying the mRNA expression level by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and the antioxidative activity using fluorescent probes. Results: The cultivars used in the south of Italy, yield extravirgin oils with different amount of fatty acids and polyphenols, which counteract induction of proinflammatory cytokines and regulate free radical production in hydrogen peroxide-stimulated cells. In vitro analysis using the human osteoblast cell line Saos-2 showed that the addition of oils to cell culture simulated a hypoxic stress followed by a reoxygenation period, during which the antioxidant activity of extravirgin olive oils protected cells from oxidative damages. On the other hand, the mRNA expression levels of factors involved in inflammatory processes, cell growth recovery, and antioxidant response, as heme oxygenase-1, were differently stimulated by EVOOs. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was differently modulated by EVOOs. Conclusion: These findings show that the blending of different extravirgin olive oil can impact an osteoblast cell line, in particular regarding cell growth recovery and oxidative stress.  aThis work was supported by the grant PSR Calabria 2007/2013—Misura 124, number 84750113494.  aPublisher supplied data  a84750113494cPSR Calabria 2007/2013—Misura 124 3aOlea europaea 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acell culture 3acell growth 3acell viability 3acultivars 3acytokines 3afatty acids 3afluorescent dyes 3afree radicals 3afruits 3agene expression 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrogen 3amessenger RNA 3amixing 3aolive oil 3aosteoblasts 3aosteosarcoma 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3aItaly 0aExtravirgin olive oil 0aantioxidant activity 0acell growth 0aosteoblast cell line 0agene expression analysis1 aCocchiola, Rossana1 aLopreiato, Mariangela1 aPoliti, Laura1 aScandurra, Roberto1 aGiusti, Anna Maria1 aScotto d'Abusco, Anna0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2018 Oct. 3, v. 37, no. 7 p.589-597dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2018.14514093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011200154300001600266500002000282500001500302520154800317592002801865650001801893650001201911650001801923650001101941650002801952650001501980650002001995650001302015650002802028650001002056650002002066650001202086651001202098653001802110700001402128700002102142700001702163700001802180700001502198700001802213700001602231700001602247700001402263700002502277700001802302773012602320856007302446852000902519655001202528IND60588288320221118233705.0180103e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058828832DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.123192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrewes, S.10aReservoir‐Driven Heterogeneous Distribution of Recorded Human Puumala virus Cases in South‐West Germany  ap. 381-390.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aEndemic regions for Puumala virus (PUUV) are located in the most affected federal state Baden‐Wuerttemberg, South‐West Germany, where high numbers of notified human hantavirus disease cases have been occurring for a long time. The distribution of human cases in Baden‐Wuerttemberg is, however, heterogeneous, with a high number of cases recorded during 2012 in four districts (H districts) but a low number or even no cases recorded in four other districts (L districts). Bank vole monitoring during 2012, following a beech (Fagus sylvatica) mast year, resulted in the trapping of 499 bank voles, the host of PUUV. Analyses indicated PUUV prevalences of 7–50% (serological) and 1.8–27.5% (molecular) in seven of eight districts, but an absence of PUUV in one L district. The PUUV prevalence differed significantly between bank voles in H and L districts. In the following year 2013, 161 bank voles were trapped, with reduced bank vole abundance in almost all investigated districts except one. In 2013, no PUUV infections were detected in voles from seven of eight districts. In conclusion, the linear modelling approach indicated that the heterogeneous distribution of human PUUV cases in South‐West Germany was caused by different factors including the abundance of PUUV RNA‐positive bank voles, as well as by the interaction of beech mast and the proportional coverage of beech and oak (Quercus spec.) forest per district. These results can aid developing local public health risk management measures and early warning models.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3aQuercus 3apublic health 3ahumans 3aPuumala orthohantavirus 3amonitoring 3arisk management 3atrapping 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3avoles 3aFagus sylvatica 3aforests 3aGermany 0aPuumala virus1 aTurni, H.1 aRosenfeld, U.

The accumulation of HMs in soil and uptake by plants leads to disrupt physiological and biochemical metabolisms. As a potential and sustainable soil amendment, biochar has attained huge attention to reduce HMs toxicity in soil and improve plant growth influenced by HMs stress. Despite an array of research studies, there is a lack of knowledge on how biochar interacts with HMs, moderate plant defence system, induce HMs stress signals pathways and promote plant growth. At first, the review highlights the possible effects of HMs on soil and plant and their consequences on plant signaling network. Secondly, the biochar's impact on soil physiochemical properties and the sorption of HMs on biochar surface through direct and indirect mechanisms are reviewed. Finally, the review shows the key roles of biochar in soil improvement to enhance plant growth and signaling response to HMs by enhancing the activities of antioxidants and reducing chlorophyll injury, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and cell membrane degradation under HMs stress. However, future studies are needed to evaluate the role of biochar in diverse climatic conditions as well as the long-term effects of biochar on HMs persistency in soil and crop productivity. This review will provide new avenues for future studies to address and quantify the advancement in biochar's role in alleviating plant's HMs stress on a sustainable basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3aplant growth 3areactive oxygen species 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asorption 3atoxicity 0aHeavy metals 0aBiochar 0aSoil 0aAntioxidants 0aROS 0aPlant growth1 aFan, Xianting1 aKhan, Mohammad Nauman1 aKhan, Muhammad Ayoub1 aZhang, Kangkang1 aFu, Youqiang1 aShen, Hong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1364663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012100162500001400283520138800297592002801685650001501713650001001728650001401738650002201752650001701774650001701791650002001808650001501828650001101843650001401854650001601868650001601884650001501900650000901915650002201924650001301946650002701959653003801986653002102024653001402045653002402059653002402083700005902107700001802166700002802184700002202212700002102234773010802255856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60712922620221117181117.0201104e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071292262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIca, Raluca10aHigh resolution mass spectrometry provides novel insights into the ganglioside pattern of brain cavernous hemangioma  aNAL-light  aIn this study we have optimized nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) high resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) performed on Orbitrap instrument in the negative ion mode for the determination of the composition and structure of gangliosides extracted from human brain cavernous hemangioma.The optimized HR MS platform, allowed the discrimination of 62 ions, corresponding to 52 different ganglioside species, which represents roughly twice the number of species existing in the current inventory of human brain hemangioma-associated gangliosides. The experiments revealed a ganglioside pattern dominated by GD-type of structures as well as an elevated incidence of species characterized by a low degree of sialylation and short glycan chains, including asialo GA1 (d18:1/18:0), which offer a new perspective upon the ganglioside composition in this benign tumor. Many of the structures are characteristic for this type of tumor only and are to be considered in further investigations for their potential use in early brain hemangioma diagnosis based on molecular markers. The detailed fragmentation analysis performed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS provided information of structural elements related to the glycan core and ceramide moiety, which confirmed the molecular configuration of GD3 (d18:1/24:1) and GD3 (d18:1/24:2) species with potential biomarker role.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3aceramides 3achemical elements 3adissociation 3agangliosides 3agenetic markers 3ahemangioma 3ahumans 3aincidence 3ainformation 3ainventories 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3amolecular conformation 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aHuman hemangioma 0aScreening 0aStructural analysis 0aBiomarker discovery1 aSimulescu, Anca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4834-44701 aSarbu, Mirela1 aMunteanu, Cristian V.A.1 aVukelić, Željka1 aZamfir, Alina D.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 609 p.113976-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001400157245016000171300001600331520159100347592002801938650001301966650002301979650001902002650001402021650002602035650001302061650001302074650001802087653002002105653000902125653001302134653002202147653001902169700001602188700001602204773011302220856009202333852000902425655001202434IND60536699720221119143608.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zheng10aTheoretical analysis of micro-vibration between a high moisture content rape stalk and a non-smooth surface of a reciprocating metal cleaning screen matrix  ap. 258-267.  aBecause rape stalk has a high water content, rape materials easily adhere to the cleaning screens of combine harvesters leading to a high screen loss. Inspired by friction-reducing research on bionic non-smooth metal surfaces, a special rape cleaning screen with non-smooth surface was developed and compared with a standard screen in field experiment. It showed good anti-adhesion performance to rape components. To understand the mechanism, a reciprocating friction test between a rape stalk and non-smooth metal surface was carried out. The result was consistent with the findings of a field experiment. In the test, a vertical micro-vibration was discovered between rape stalk and the non-smooth metal surface. This did not exist in the case of a common smooth metal surface and was considered as an important factor in the mechanism. In this paper, a theoretical analysis was proposed to explain how the vertical micro-vibrations occurred during a horizontal reciprocating translation of non-smooth units. Firstly, according to the case of friction test, a geometry contact model and a dynamic equation were established. Then computing methods of vertical impact force and its action time were respectively deduced. Finally, a simulation was produced with a time-scale factor of two. The result from the simulation was consistent with basic trend of test data. Although the theoretical analysis requires improvement for further investigation, it could still provide the basis of a theoretical model and the foundation for further friction-reducing research for non-smooth surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acombine harvesters 3adynamic models 3aequations 3afield experimentation 3afriction 3ageometry 3awater content 0aMicro-vibration 0aRape 0aFriction 0aCombine harvester 0aDynamic system1 aLi, Yaoming1 aXu, Lizhang0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Jan., v. 129 p.258-267dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012000163300001600283500001500299520135700314592002801671650001301699650001101712650001501723650001401738650002001752650001701772650001601789650001501805650001301820650001201833650002501845650001501870650002401885650001501909653003001924653002601954653002001980653001402000653002002014653001702034700001602051700001302067700001502080700001902095773012102114856008502235852000902320655001202329IND60573723520221116164422.0170724e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372352DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2016.11381762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Hu10aEnzymatic Hydrolysis of Alaska Pollock Proteins Based on Kinetics Model and Lysine Biosensor–Neural Network Model  ap. 267-278.  a2019-12-06  aControlled proteolysis is important for target hydrolysates. The hydrolysis kinetics of pollock bone protein (PBP) was obtained by mathematic deduction and experimental analysis. The equation of degree of hydrolysis was as follows: DH = 2.801 ln | 1 + (0.06044 E ₀/S ₀−0.1005) t |, which could predict the hydrolysis process of PBP when hydrolysis condition was strictly controlled. However, the hydrolysis reaction was affected by several factors, and the predicted value may be against the experimental result. Therefore, online monitoring was necessary for obtaining the target peptides. Biosensor and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed for monitoring hydrolysis process online. Free lysine level was chosen as the monitoring factor determined by immobilized lysine oxidase electrodes. Based on the lysine biosensor and ANN, the hydrolysis monitoring model LYS-ANN was built, including 3 input layer nodes (E ₀, S ₀, and LYS), 1 output layer node (DH), and 11 hidden layer nodes. R ² value between sample value and simulation value was 0.9964. Simulation error was in the range of 0–4.56%, and the average relative error was 0.94%. The verification tests of PBP hydrolysis showed that the LYS-ANN model could forecast hydrolysis process successfully with high efficiency and accuracy even if the hydrolysis conditions varied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3alysine 3amonitoring 3aequations 3aneural networks 3ahydrolysates 3aproteolysis 3aelectrodes 3apeptides 3apollock 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3abiosensors 0aartificial neural network 0aTheragra chalcogramma 0aenzyme kinetics 0abiosensor 0afree amino acid 0aHydrolysates1 aLu, Jiaohan1 aFan, Yan1 aLi, Bafang1 aZhang, Zhaohui0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2017 Mar. 16, v. 26, no. 3 p.267-278dTaylor & Francisx1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2016.11381763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012500172300001400297520179500311592002802106650001602134650001502150650001602165650002102181650002302202650001202225650001002237650002002247650001202267650001402279650001102293650001902304650002202323650003402345650001902379650001202398650001502410651001402425700002602439700001902465700002302484700002502507773011102532856008102643852000902724655001202733IND60573993720221120213410.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-016-1256-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGürtler, Ricardo E.10aCoping with wild boar in a conservation area: impacts of a 10-year management control program in north-eastern Argentina  ap. 11-24.  aWild boar (Sus scrofa) are of serious concern in numerous conservation areas such as El Palmar National Park, Argentina, where their increasing abundance affected the iconic palm tree Butia yatay. We assessed the effectiveness of an innovative management control program on wild boar population dynamics and ground rooting area over 10 years. Park personnel recruited and supervised local recreational hunters who regularly conducted controlled still shooting from widely distributed watchtowers and used trained dogs mainly during the first 2 years post-intervention (YPI). We used the detailed records of harvest and hunting effort to estimate time- and stage-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices and stochastic population growth rates (μ). Catch was linearly related to hunting effort except at large effort levels. CPUE indices declined exponentially at 5–7 % month⁻¹ over 0–1 YPI and thereafter stabilized with μ indistinguishable from 0. Relative to baseline levels, culling reduced annual pregnancy rates, the fraction of juveniles and older adults, and ground rooting area below target values (<1.3 %). Incipient population recovery followed one of two periods of marginal hunting effort. The program generated few undesirable collateral effects mainly related to dog-hunting. Mesopredator abundance (foxes) steadily increased following a large outbreak of canine distemper at baseline. The combined use of standardized CPUE indices, body-length data and simple population viability analysis models provided reliable metrics for wild boar trend analysis and management. Unlike a preceding plan, a highly structured multi-stakeholder program proved to be sustainable and brought wild boar abundance to a low-density, unstable equilibrium causing minimal damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButia yatay 3aSus scrofa 3abody length 3acanine distemper 3aconservation areas 3aelderly 3afoxes 3ahuman resources 3ahunters 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3anational parks 3apopulation growth 3apopulation viability analysis 3apregnancy rate 3arooting 3awild boars 3aArgentina1 aMartín Izquierdo, V.1 aGil, Guillermo1 aCavicchia, Marcelo1 aMaranta, Aristóbulo0 tBiological invasions.g2017 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.11-24dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1256-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245010800201500001400309520059800323592002800921650002500949650001600974650001100990650001601001650002101017650001601038650001101054650002401065650001501089653003501104653002301139653002201162653002401184653001301208700001701221700002001238700006101258700005701319773010801376856008101484852000901565655001201574IND60712922920221117181114.0201104e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071292292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Atul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0166-798810aStructural characterization with light scattering: A tool for rationally designing protein formulations  aNAL-light  aHere we explore the possibility of using light scattering technologies as an analytical tool for understanding structural features of a protein that might be responsible for initiating aggregative interactions.

The global ecosystem is necessary for every aspect of our lives; yet, we are not safeguarding it nor protecting the biodiversity of the other organisms we share the planet with. As a species, we depend on plants and agriculture for our very existence and they need to receive greater attention and focus. Plant scientists can work together to achieve a robust and sustainable future for all. SUMMARY: The future of the Earth and its inhabitants has never been more uncertain, but there is still time for us to prevent further catastrophe. Plant scientists have a crucial role to play in the preservation of plant biodiversity and crop genetic diversity, both vital goals that will have a major impact on the success or failure of humanity’s attempts to prevent ecological disaster. At the 2017 International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China, a series of suggestions for the many important ways in which plant scientists could contribute to a sustainable future were proposed, and were accepted by the Delegates of the meeting. These included: conducting research in the context of the changing world, promoting plant science and international collaboration, building platforms for big data, generating a full inventory of plant species, protecting indigenous knowledge, and engaging the power of the public. Here, I describe this Shenzhen Declaration, the threats it aims to mitigate, and the key roles that plant scientists must play for the future benefit of mankind.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainventories 3aChina0 tPlants, people, planet.g2019 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.8-13dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009000167300002000257520159800277592002801875650001301903650001401916650001201930650001201942650001101954650002501965650001201990650001202002650001002014650001502024650003402039650001202073650002502085700002302110700002402133700002302157700002102180700002402201773012702225856008102352852000902433655001202442IND60556286320221119151058.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b030452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartline, Niko L.10aMicrofiber Masses Recovered from Conventional Machine Washing of New or Aged Garments  ap. 11532-11538.  aSynthetic textiles can shed numerous microfibers during conventional washing, but evaluating environmental consequences as well as source-control strategies requires understanding mass releases. Polyester apparel accounts for a large proportion of the polyester market, and synthetic jackets represent the broadest range in apparel construction, allowing for potential changes in manufacturing as a mitigation measure to reduce microfiber release during laundering. Here, detergent-free washing experiments were conducted and replicated in both front- and top-load conventional home machines for five new and mechanically aged jackets or sweaters: four from one name-brand clothing manufacturer (three majority polyester fleece, and one nylon shell with nonwoven polyester insulation) and one off-brand (100% polyester fleece). Wash water was filtered to recover two size fractions (>333 μm and between 20 and 333 μm); filters were then imaged, and microfiber masses were calculated. Across all treatments, the recovered microfiber mass per garment ranged from approximately 0 to 2 g, or exceeding 0.3% of the unwashed garment mass. Microfiber masses from top-load machines were approximately 7 times those from front-load machines; garments mechanically aged via a 24 h continuous wash had increased mass release under the same wash protocol as new garments. When published wastewater treatment plant influent characterization and microfiber removal studies are considered, washing synthetic jackets or sweaters as per this study would account for most microfibers entering the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3aequipment 3afabrics 3afilters 3afleece 3ainsulating materials 3alaundry 3amarkets 3anylon 3apolyesters 3astandard operating procedures 3awashing 3awastewater treatment1 aBruce, Nicholas

For 86 green ODA recipient countries over the period 2003–2014, we explore the nexus between green ODA, institutions and carbon emissions. By using a two-step system generalized method of moment (GMM), we find that green ODA overall has no direct association with the mitigation of carbon emissions. However, when institutional quality indices are included, we found a significant effect of institutional quality on the effectiveness of green ODA. In general, green ODA is associated with higher carbon emissions in countries with poor institutions. In particular, green ODA is effective in mitigating carbon emissions when channeled to countries that enjoy higher economic freedom as well as more freedom from corruption. Results are mixed for the rule of law.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adevelopment aid 3aeconomics 3aemissions 3aenvironment 3apaper 0acarbon emissions 0acorruption 0aeconomic freedom 0agreen ODA 0arule of law 0aQ541 aRishi, Meenakshi1 aBae, Jeong Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2198-28430 tEnvironment and development economics.g2021 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.88-107dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X200001703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245010500184520128000289592002801569650001501597650001301612650002701625650001801652650001701670650000901687650001501696650001801711650001101729650002101740650002001761653001901781653001401800653002001814653001201834700001901846700001601865700002101881700001701902700005901919773009101978856009002069852000902159655001202168IND60793852420221118051409.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079385242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1364702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAboulella, Ahmed Mamdouh10aTiO2 ceramic membrane decorated with Fe3O4–Ag composite nanoparticles for produced water treatment  aThis study focused on the surface modification of commercial TiO₂ membranes with Fe₃O₄ decorated silver (Ag) nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄–Ag) via chemical attachment. Firstly, the Ag concentration on Fe₃O₄ was optimized, and different composites were prepared and characterized. Secondly, the optimal composite was used to prepare novel TiO₂/Fe₃O₄–Ag ceramic membranes via surface coating through tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) crosslinking. The membranes were characterized using SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD, and contact angle. Biofouling resistance of the membranes was investigated using the Coomassie Blue dye method. The coated membranes were tested for water flux, chemical oxygen demand (COD) rejection, and biofouling resistance. Results showed that all coated membranes exhibited higher water flux. For example, the membrane with a 1.25 wt% Fe₃O₄–Ag coating showed the highest filtration flux of 1445 L/m²h (LMH) compared to the pristine membrane (379 LMH) without compromising the COD rejection. The resistance of the membrane to biofouling increased with the increase of Fe₃O₄–Ag nanoparticle concentration. The obtained results demonstrate the great potential of TiO₂/Fe₃O₄–Ag ceramic membranes for the treatment of produced water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofouling 3aceramics 3achemical oxygen demand 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3adyes 3afiltration 3ananoparticles 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 3awater treatment 0aProduced water 0aMembranes 0aSurface coating 0aFouling1 aWadi, Vijay S.1 aNaddeo, V.,1 aYousef, Ahmed F.1 aBanat, Fawzi1 aHasan, Shadi W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7269-094X0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136470-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1364703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04637naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245012200186300001600308520297200324592002803296650002203324650002003346650001103366650001803377650000903395650001003404650001203414650003303426650002103459650001903480650001103499650001803510650001603528650001203544650001303556650001003569650001403579650001303593650001103606650001703617650001203634650001803646650001703664651000903681653002003690653002103710653001603731653001203747653001203759653001303771700001903784700002603803773011203829856008503941852000904026655001204035IND60634714420221119054259.0190325e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063471442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayed Shourbalal, Sayed Komeil10aShortening vernalization in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using plant growth regulators and cold stratification  ap. 443-450.  aFacing and controlling the adverse effects of global warming on crop production, especially under arid and semi arid conditions is an important question, which must be addressed by research work. This may be achieved by alternating crop phonological properties including the vernalization stage, essential for the vegetative/reproductive transition of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Shortening vernalization, during spring, can be a suitable method for the earlier production of crop plants, especially under stress conditions. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that it is possible to shorten vernalization, using priming (seeds) and spraying (plants) treatments while achieving optimum yield, in winter wheat, under the arid and semi arid conditions of Isfahan, Iran. The objective was to investigate the effects of plant growth regulators including gibberellic acid (GA, 100 mg/l), kinetin (100 and 200 mg/l), 6-benzyl adenine (BA6, 50 mg/l) and cold stratification on shortening vernalization in winter wheat. The research was a split plot experiment on the basis of a completely randomized block design, with four replicates, conducted in 2016. Different traits including number of fertile tillers (NFT), number of grains per spike (NGS), weight of 1000 grains (W1000), number of spikelet per spike (NST), grain yield (GY), protein percentage (PRO), and moist gluten percentage (MGP) were determined. The results indicated that priming and spraying winter wheat with the single or combined use of GA, kinetin and BA6 is the most suitable replacement for vernalization and increasing grain yield, under arid and semi arid conditions. However, priming winter wheat with cold stratification was not as effective, compared with the use of plant growth regulators. The highest grain yield (15.13 t/ha) was resulted by autumn planting + B8 (GA + BA6), followed by spring planting + GA and B9 (14.82 t/ha). Spraying wheat planted in spring (without priming and vernalization) with kinetin + GA3+GA7 (100 mg/l), increased PRO and MGP. The important results of this research work are: 1) planting winter wheat as spring wheat (vernalization not required) resulted in optimum yield amounts by priming and spraying techniques using gibberellins, kinetin and 6-benzyl adenine. This is of significance, with respect to the issue of global warming. 2) Shortening vernalization in winter wheat, which is especially important under arid and semi arid conditions, as the plant is subjected to different stresses including drought. 3) Improving wheat grain quality by the increased rate of protein and gluten. It is possible to plant winter wheat under arid and semi arid conditions using gibberellins, kinetin and benzyl adenine. Such a method results in alleviating the adverse effects of global warming on wheat production. It is also possible to plant winter wheat under different stresses including drought and cold by controlling the vernalization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadverse effects 3aautumn 3abenzyladenine 3acold 3acrops 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3agibberellic acid 3aglobal warming 3agluten 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3akinetin 3aplanting 3aseeds 3aspikelets 3aspraying 3aspring 3aspring wheat 3atillers 3avernalization 3awinter wheat 3aIran 0a6-Benzyladenine 0aGibberellic acid 0aGrain yield 0aKinetin 0aPriming 0aSpraying1 aSoleymani, Ali1 aJavanmard, Hamid Reza0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 10, v. 219 p.443-450dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002500159245009300184300001600277500000900293520139000302592002801692650001201720650001701732650001301749650001401762650001501776650001101791650002601802650001101828650001401839650002001853650002001873650002201893650002801915651001201943773014701955852000902102856009602111655001202207IND2046663420221119094152.0191125e199505  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204666342DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900030041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlemmedson, James O.10aNew Mexican Locust and Parent Material: Influence on Availability of Soil Macronutrients  ap. 913-917.  aepub  aThe effect of New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana Gray) on availability of soil N, P, K, and S in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests in central Arizona was studied in stands with either basalt or limestone parent material. Samples of the 0- to 15-cm layer of mineral soil were collected from seven pairs (with and without locust) of randomly located stands (sites), three on limestone and four on basalt. Availability of N, P, K, and S in these soils was determined in a greenhouse pot experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. gustoe) grown for 42 d. Supply of N and P also was measured in a similar test with ponderosa pine seedlings grown for 270 d. Dry mass yield of test plants was used as the expression of nutrient availability. Barley and pine tests yielded similar results. A significant locust × parent material interaction showed opposite responses to locust presence by soils derived from limestone (positive) and basalt (negative). A highly significant parent material × nutrient interaction reflected low availability of N in limestone soils and low availability of P in basaltic soils. Low supply of P in basaltic soils, probably the result of P fixation, largely explained the locust × parent material interaction.

Although MIPs have several advantages such as specific recognition sites, selectivity, and stability, they suffer from a series of drawbacks, including loss of conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and cost, which limit their use in various fields. Carbon-based MIPs, which utilize carbon electrodes, carbon nanoparticles, carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, and graphene substrates, have been the focus of research in recent years to enhance their properties and remove their weaknesses as much as possible. These carbon-based nanomaterials have excellent sensitivity and specificity for molecular identification. As a result, they have been widely used in various applications, such as assessing the environmental, biological, and food samples.

This study evaluates various aspects of productivity and nutrition for two half-sib seed sources in a 9-yr-old sweetgum plantation that was refertilized in 1981 with a total of 0, 100, 200, or 400 kg N ha⁻¹. Foliar and litter samples were collected in the year preceding and for 3 yr following N application, and tree diameter and height were measured annually. Aboveground net primary productivity (AGNPP) of the unfertilized controls averaged 6.7 Mg ha⁻¹ from 1981 to 1983. By contrast, maximum AGNPP for treatments receiving N were 11, 16, and 16 Mg ha⁻¹ in 1981, 1982, and 1983, respectively. Fertilization resulted in large increases in foliar biomass and leaf area index (LAI); values were highest in 1982, and then declined in 1983. Most responses peaked at the highest application rate, but differences between 200 and 400 kg N ha⁻¹ were generally small. Estimated apparent recovery of applied N in aboveground tissues was 75% for the 100 kg N ha⁻¹ rate in the first and second years; however, in the third year following fertilization only 47% was accounted for.

The adoption of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) is recommended as a best technology fix for risk adaptation. Although STRVs provide better outcomes with no yield penalty, farmers' decisions to adopt new STRVs are influenced by a multitude of factors, most importantly information exposure. We used a sequential logit model to analyze the impact of information access and information quality on adoption decisions regarding STRVs in flood-risk areas. Over the years, we found that STRVs adoption has become scale neutral, but adopters have significantly higher access to information. The estimates showed that 48 per cent of the farmers having access to information decided to adopt STRVs. When information reaches 50 per cent of the rice farmers in flood-prone areas, the estimated additional annual income is US$235 million.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate change 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironment 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afinancial economics 3aincome 3ainformation 3alivelihood 3alogit analysis 3arice 3arisk 3atechnology 3avarieties 3aweather 0aIndia 0asequential adoption 0astress-tolerant rice variety 0aQ16 0aQ54 0aD831 aRaghu, Prabhakaran T.1 aAshok, Arathi,0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2021 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.45-68dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X200002123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245007600204300001300280500001400293520107100307592002801378650001601406650002001422650001401442650001401456650001601470650001801486650001701504650002501521650001001546650001401556650001601570650001201586653001601598653000801614653000801622653000801630653000801638653000801646653000801654773013401662856008101796852000901877655001201886IND60722649120221120175539.0210107e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264912DNAL7 a10.1017/S1355770X200002242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeet, Evan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6147-347510aEarly-life environment and human capital: evidence from the Philippines  ap. 1-25.  aNAL-light  aThis study examines how human capital develops in response to early-life weather and pollution exposures in the Philippines. Both pollution and weather are examined in relation to short- and long-term human capital outcomes. We combine a three-decade longitudinal survey measuring human capital development, a database of historical weather, and multiple databases characterizing carbon monoxide and ozone in the Philippines during the 1980s. We find evidence that extreme precipitation and temperature affect short-term anthropometric outcomes, but long-term outcomes appear unaffected. For long-term cognitive outcomes, we find that early-life pollution exposures negatively affect test scores and schooling. These long-term responses to early-life pollution exposures extend to the labor market with reduced hours worked and earnings. The implication is that a 25 per cent reduction in early-life ozone exposure would increase per person discounted lifetime earnings by $1,367, which would scale to $2.05 billion at the national level (or 2 per cent of 2005 GDP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3acarbon monoxide 3acognition 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3ahuman capital 3alabor market 3alongitudinal studies 3aozone 3apollution 3atemperature 3aweather 0adevelopment 0aO13 0aO15 0aQ51 0aQ53 0aQ54 0aQ560 tEnvironment and development economics.g2021 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.1-25dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X200002243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100005800136245006500194300001600259500002000275520213800295592002802433596006302461596005602524596005602580596005602636596005602692650001202748650001202760650002502772650001802797650001202815650003002827650002302857650002002880700006202900700006402962700006403026700006103090773011803151856007103269852000903340655001203349IND60790672720221119085339.0220826e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079067272DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanavan, Susan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7972-792810aDoes origin determine environmental impacts? Not for bamboos  ap. 119-128.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSOCIETAL IMPACT STATEMENT: Non‐native species can cause considerable negative impacts in natural ecosystems. Such impacts often are directly due to the fact that these species occur in habitats where they did not evolve. We explored this for bamboos and found that, contrary to the situation in many other plant groups, biogeographic origin was not a strong predictor of the type and severity of environmental impacts caused. We argue that impacts from bamboos are a response to land transformation and disturbance of forest habitats by humans. Therefore, the threats posed by bamboos to highly disturbed forest systems should be the same wherever bamboos are present or planted, and management should adopt similar approaches. SUMMARY: Negative environmental impacts can result from the human‐mediated breakdown of biogeographic boundaries that historically shaped species distributions leading to rapid population expansions, that is, from biological invasions. However, the alteration of natural ecosystems by humans has created opportunities for both native and non‐native species to become weedy. We assessed whether origin status (native or non‐native) matters for the type and magnitude of environmental impacts caused by bamboos (Poaceae: Bambusoideae). We used a systematic global literature search and the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa (EICAT) scheme as the basis for scoring impacts of bamboo species. We found that the type and severity of recorded impacts were similar in the native and non‐native ranges of weedy bamboos, and that the habitats in which impacts are most often reported (i.e., temperate and tropical forests) were also the same. Origin was not a strong predictor of environmental impacts for bamboos. Rather, impacts are likely to be a response to human‐mediated land transformation and disturbance of forests. Further research on the mechanisms whereby bamboos impact other species is needed to guide management strategies in their native ranges and as input to risk assessments for new introductions and plantings.  aPublisher supplied data  cSouth African National Department of Environmental Affairs  a85412cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  a85417cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  a91117cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  cDST‐NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology 3aPoaceae 3abamboos 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest damage 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3aland use change1 aKumschick, Sabrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8034-58311 aLe Roux, Johannes J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7911-98101 aRichardson, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9574-82971 aWilson, John R.U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0174-32390 tPlants, people, planet.g2019 Apr., v. 1, no. 2 p.119-128dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002000157245011900177300001600296520084300312592002801155650001101183650001401194650001601208650001501224650001501239650001001254650001101264650001201275653001701287653002401304653001801328653001201346653002501358700002401383700002501407700001901432773011301451856009201564852000901656655001201665IND60536700320221119014241.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053670032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenardo, Simona10aPotential biogas and methane yield of maize stover fractions and evaluation of some possible stover harvest chains  ap. 352-359.  aWith a yearly global production of about 75 million tonnes of dry matter (DM), maize stover remains a major untapped agricultural resource. While its use as a feedstock for biogas production has been well studied, the methane potential of separate single stover fraction begs further analysis. This study evaluated the composition of maize cobs, husks, leaves, and stalks and the potential of those components to produce biogas and methane. These analyses allowed an estimate of the preferred maize stover harvest chain conditions for quantity and quality. Methane yields from the fractions ranged between 206.6 and 307.0 lN kg−1 VS, with husks being the most productive. In total, our estimates suggest that these fractions produce about 3000 m3 ha−1 of methane from the biogas conveniently collected by different harvest chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acorn cobs 3acorn stover 3acrop yield 3afeedstocks 3ahulls 3aleaves 3amethane 0aMaize stover 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aHarvest chain 0aMethane 0aStover fractionation1 aAiroldi, Gianfranco1 aCacciatore, Vincenzo1 aBalsari, Paolo0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Jan., v. 129 p.352-359dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006000171520098000231592002801211650001601239650001701255650002401272650001901296650002501315650002101340650001701361650001501378650001201393653000801405653001101413653001201424653001201436653001201448653000901460653000801469653001601477653002501493653002801518653001701546653001701563700001301580700001501593773009801608856008201706852000901788655001201797IND60734793220221121051442.0220830e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073479322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1195242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Debrup14aThe bifurcated role of adiponectin in colorectal cancer  aThe association of adiponectin with metabolism and cancer is well established. Since its discovery in 1990, adiponectin, as one of the adipose tissue-secreted adipokines, has been very widely studied in biomedical research. Low levels of circulatory adiponectin have been reported in obesity, inflammatory diseases and various types of cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC), which is highly linked with obesity and gut inflammation. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of adiponectin in CRC is not well understood. In addition, there are contradictory reports on the role of adiponectin in cancer. Therefore, further investigation is needed. In this review, we explore the information available on the relationship between adiponectin and CRC with respect to proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis and inflammation. We also highlighted the knowledge gaps, filling in which could help us better understand the function and mechanisms of adiponectin in CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aangiogenesis 3abiomedical research 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adigestive system 3ainflammation 3ametabolism 3aobesity 0aCRC 0aAcrp30 0aAdipoRs 0aAdipoR1 0aAdipoR2 0aAMPK 0aAPN 0aAdiponectin 0aAdiponectin receptor 0aColorectal cancer (CRC) 0aAngiogenesis 0aInflammation1 aJin, Wei1 aWang, Jing0 tLife sciences.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 278 p.119524-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1195243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006300168300001600231520186200247592002802109650001202137650001702149650001902166650002102185650001502206650001602221650001102237650001902248650001102267650001202278700002202290700002302312700001802335700002102353700001802374773008502392856004802477852000902525655001202534IND50065238020221120044411.0130417e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006523802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9566-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatford, Jane A.10aPredicting Novel Riparian Ecosystems in a Changing Climate  ap. 382-400.  aRapid changes in global climate are likely to alter species assemblages and environmental characteristics resulting in novel ecosystems. The ability to predict characteristics of future ecosystems is crucial for environmental planning and the development of effective climate change adaptation strategies. This paper presents an approach for envisioning novel ecosystems in future climates. Focusing on riparian ecosystems, we use qualitative process models to predict likely abiotic and biotic changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains, temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation. Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4 graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions. By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example, magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used), implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management strategies identified. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3amodels 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3astreams1 aNaiman, Robert J.1 aChambers, Lynda E.1 aRoberts, Jane1 aDouglas, Michael1 aDavies, Peter0 tEcosystems.g2013 Apr., v. 16, no. 3 p.382-400dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9566-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100002000187245015200207300001200359506007600371520130500447592002801752506003701780650001301817650001601830650002201846650002001868650001001888650001301898650001201911650002601923650002201949650002901971650002602000650003102026700002002057700002002077700002002097700001702117700001802134700001802152700002002170700002002190700002102210700002202231700002002253700001902273700002002292700001902312700002102331700002002352700002202372700002002394700001702414700002402431700002102455700001602476700002202492700002002514773010302534856008002637852000902717655001202726IND50089806620221207065730.0170725e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008980662DNAL7 aPMC40537492pmcid7 a247211772pmid7 a10.1186/gb-2014-15-4-r632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Tsuyoshi10aCross-enhancement of ANGPTL4 transcription by HIF1 alpha and PPAR beta/delta is the result of the conformational proximity of two response elements  ap.

RESULTS: We present a detailed investigation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 dependent gene expression in endothelial cells which suggests the importance of crosstalk between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ and HIF signaling axes. A migration assay shows a synergistic interaction between these two stimuli, and we identify angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a common target gene by using a combination of microarray and ChIP-seq analysis. We profile changes of histone marks at enhancers under hypoxia, PPARβ/δ agonist and dual stimulations and these suggest that the spatial proximity of two response elements is the principal cause of the synergistic transcription induction. A newly developed quantitative chromosome conformation capture assay shows the quantitative change of the frequency of proximity of the two response elements. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that two different transcription factors cooperate in transcriptional regulation in a synergistic fashion through conformational change of their common target genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3achromosomes 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahypoxia 3amicroarray technology 3aresponse elements 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aKohro, Takahide1 aTanaka, Toshiya1 aKanki, Yasuharu1 aLi, Guoliang1 aPoh, Huay-Mei1 aMimura, Imari1 aKobayashi, Mika1 aTaguchi, Akashi1 aMaejima, Takashi1 aSuehiro, Jun-ichi1 aSugiyama, Akira1 aKaneki, Kiyomi1 aAruga, Hirofumi1 aDong, Shoulian1 aStevens, Junko F1 aYamamoto, Shogo1 aTsutsumi, Shuichi1 aFujita, Toshiro1 aRuan, Xiaoan1 aAburatani, Hiroyuki1 aNangaku, Masaomi1 aRuan, Yijun1 aKodama, Tatsuhiko1 aWada, Youichiro0 tGenome biology.g2014 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.R63-R63dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2014-15-4-r633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009600169300001600265500001500281520187900296592002802175650001202203650001302215650001502228650001402243650001402257650002002271650001502291653001902306700001502325700002102340700002302361700002102384700001902405773012502424856005502549852000902604655001202613IND4473502620221120044345.0120616e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447350262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2012.01258.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOI, SATOSHI10aMolecular phylogenetic analysis of Podostemaceae: implications for taxonomy of major groups  ap. 461-492.  a2019-12-06  aThe riverâweed family Podostemaceae (c.â300 species in c.â54 genera) shows a number of morphological innovations to be adapted to its unusual aquatic habitat, and its unique or rare bauplan features have been reflected in the traditional (i.e. nonâmolecular) classification recognizing numerous monotypic or oligospecific genera. The infrasubfamilial relationships of many genera remained unclear. The present study used molecular phylogenetic analysis of matK sequences for 657 samples (c.â132 species/c.â43 genera). The family was traditionally divided into three subfamilies (Podostemoideae, Tristichoideae and Weddellinoideae). American Podostemoideae were shown to be polyphyletic and divided into four clades, i.e. Ceratolacis, Diamantina, Podostemum and all other genera. Among the podostemoid clades, Diamantina was the first branching clade and a clade comprising Mourera and the Apinagia subclade was then sister to the remainder of the New World and Old World Podostemoideae with low statistic supports. The Old World Podostemoideae comprised four monophyletic clades, i.e. two African clades, one Madagascan clade and one Asian clade, although the relationships among these clades and American Ceratolacis and Podostemum were poorly resolved. African Podostemoideae were polyphyletic, with Saxicolella pro parte being weakly supported as sister to the remaining Old World Podostemoideae plus Ceratolacis and Podostemum. In contrast to the American and African clades, monophyly of four Asian subclades was well supported. Plants of Tristicha (Tristichoideae) and of Weddellina (Weddellinoideae), which are currently treated as monospecific, had great matK differentiation equivalent to at least interspecific variation.âÂ© 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 169, 461â492.  aPublisher supplied data 3asisters 3ataxonomy 3aPodostemum 3abranching 3amonophyly 3aaquatic habitat 3atechnology 0anew technology1 aKITA, YOKO1 aHIRAYAMA, YUMIKO1 aRutishauser, Rolf,1 aHUBER, KONRAD A.1 aKATO, MASAHIRO0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2012 July, v. 169, no. 3 p.461-492dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2012.01258.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245009600159300002000255520134300275592002801618650001601646650002201662650001701684650001201701650001201713650001401725650001401739650002401753650001501777650001701792650000901809650001101818650001401829650001401843650001901857700001801876700001801894700001601912700001501928700001301943700001801956700001701974773012701991856008102118852000902199655001202208IND60556286920221119151135.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b032032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Li10aSelf-Protection Mechanism of Hexagonal WO3–Based DeNOx Catalysts against Alkali Poisoning  ap. 11951-11956.  aA good catalyst for efficiently controlling NOₓ emissions often demands strong resistance against alkali poisoning. Although the traditional ion-exchange model, based on acid–base reactions of alkalis with Brønsted acid sites, has been established over the past two decades, it is difficult to be used as a guideline to develop such an alkali-resistant catalyst. Here we establish a self-protection mechanism of deNOₓ catalysts against alkali poisoning by systematically studying the intrinsic nature of alkali resistance of V₂O₅/HWO (HWO = hexagonal WO₃) that shows excellent resistance to alkali poisoning in selective catalytic reduction of NOₓ with NH₃ (SCR). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopies demonstrate that V₂O₅/HWO has spatially separated catalytically active sites (CASs) and alkali-trapping sites (ATSs). During the SCR process, ATSs spontaneously trap alkali ions such as K⁺, even if alkali ions initially block CASs, thus releasing CASs to realize the self-protection against alkali poisoning. X-ray photoelectron spectra coupled with theoretical calculations indicate that the electronic interaction between the alkali ions and ATSs with an energy saving is the driving force of the self-protection. This work provides a strategy to design alkali-resistant deNOₓ catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aalkalis 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aguidelines 3aion exchange 3aions 3amodels 3apoisoning 3apotassium 3atungsten oxide1 aZhou, Meijuan1 aHuang, Zhiwei1 aChen, Yaxin1 aGao, Jiayi1 aMa, Zhen1 aChen, Jianmin1 aTang, Xingfu0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 50, no. 21 p.11951-11956dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b032033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012500167300001800292520116400310536029901474592002801773596005101801596003701852650001101889650001201900650001301912650001201925650001401937650001001951653002001961653001501981653002201996653001102018653002302029700002102052773011902073856008502192852000902277655001202286IND60614830320221118101800.0181002e20180902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061483032DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2018.14755882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarton, Wim10aRecognizing Carbon Forestry’s Uneven Geography: A Response to Purdon and the Structure-Agency Dichotomy That Never Was  ap. 1094-1102.  aWe here respond to the critique by Purdon of an article on carbon forestry that we published in this journal last year (Carton and Andersson). While we welcome critical engagements with our work, Purdon’s argument is wide of the mark and appears based largely on misconceptions regarding our theoretical entry point and empirical findings. Underlying this are fundamental disagreements about the nature of carbon forestry, structure-agency dynamics, and how to understand environmental interventions in the global South more broadly. We argue that we are unlikely to “find common ground” in our respective analyses of the Trees for Global Benefits project unless we share a common understanding of the unequal power relations and fundamental geographical unevenness within which carbon projects operate. Contrary to what Purdon argues, this position has nothing to do with ignoring local benefits, nor with denying the agency of the smallholder farmers who participate in the project. We see no contradiction between an analysis that does justice to the various structural conditions that frame carbon forest projects, and a recognition of local agency.  aWe acknowledge funding from the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography (SSAG) and the LUCID research school at Lund University, who both provided travel funding for our fieldwork in Uganda in 2015.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. WNV is maintained in a mosquito–bird–mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead‐end hosts. In human and horses, symptoms range from unapparent infection to mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis or death. WNV has a wide geographical range that includes portions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus), and in North, Central and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks (Fields Virology, 2001, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, 1043–1125). The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with birds and mosquitoes surveillance for WNV activity demonstrates that the virus range has dramatically expanded including North, Central and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin. WND infection in humans has been reported in Morocco in 1996 (Virologie, 1, 1997, 248), in Tunisia in 2007 (Ann. N. Y. Acad., 951, 2001, 117) (Med. Trop., 61, 2001, 487) and 2003 (Epidémiologie de la fièvre West Nile, 2012, Thèse de doctorat, Université Montpellier II, Sciences et techniques du Langueduc, Montpellier, France), and in Algeria in 1994 (Rev. Sci. Tech., 31, 2012, 829). Outbreaks of equine encephalitis have been also reported in Morocco in 1996 (Bull. OIE, 11, 1996, 867), in 2003 (Emerg. Infect. Dis., 11, 2005, 306) and in 2010 (World Animal Health Information Database. WAHID, 2010). Serological evidence of WNV has been demonstrated in the three countries in many species. The aim of this review was to assess the epidemiological situation of WND in north‐west Africa comprising Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, with an updated literature review based on of human cases and equine outbreaks reports as well as serological studies in these countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aWest Nile fever 3aWest Nile virus 3adeath 3adisease occurrence 3aemerging diseases 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ameningitis 3amigratory birds 3amonitoring 3aserological surveys 3avirology 3aAlgeria 3aMorocco 3aTunisia1 aEl Harrak, M.1 aBelkadi, B.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2016 Dec., v. 63, no. 6 p.e153-e159dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.123413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01345naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014900165506002800314520037600342592002800718506003700746650002200783650001400805650002000819651001200839773012800851856007900979852000901058655001201067IND60785223820221207082132.0190503s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078522382DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25563782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMezhenskyj, V.M.10aInvestigation of ornamental cultivars both Louiseania triloba (Lindl.)

Estuarine fish may be exposed to MeHg produced in rivers and their watersheds, benthic sediment, and the marine water column, but the relative importance of each source is poorly understood. We measured stable isotopes of mercury (δ²⁰²Hg, Δ¹⁹⁹Hg, and Δ²⁰¹Hg), carbon (δ¹³C), and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) in fish with contrasting habitats from a large subarctic coastal ecosystem to better understand MeHg exposure sources. We identify two distinct food chains exposed to predominantly freshwater and marine MeHg sources but do not find evidence for a benthic marine MeHg signature. This is consistent with our previous research showing benthic sediment is a net sink for MeHg in the estuary. Marine fish display lower and less variable Δ¹⁹⁹Hg values (0.78‰ to 1.77‰) than freshwater fish (0.72‰ to 3.14‰) and higher δ²⁰²Hg values (marine: 0.1‰ to 0.57‰; freshwater: −0.76‰ to 0.15‰). We observe a shift in the Hg isotopic composition of juvenile and adult rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) when they transition between the freshwater and marine environment as their dominant foraging territory. The Hg isotopic composition of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) indicates they receive most of their MeHg from the marine environment despite a similar or longer duration spent in freshwater regions. We conclude that stable Hg isotopes effectively track fish MeHg exposure sources across different ontogenic stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsmerus mordax 3aSalmo salar 3aadults 3abenthic zone 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3aenvironmental exposure 3aestuaries 3aestuarine fish 3afood chain 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amarine fish 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3anitrogen 3apoint source pollution 3arivers 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3awater pollution 3awatersheds1 aSchartup, Amina T.1 aValberg, Amelia P.1 aEwald, Jessica D.1 aKrabbenhoft, David P.1 aYin, Runsheng1 aBalcom, Prentiss

Here we review the existence of additional, non‐essential chromosomes, known as B chromosomes, and consider their potential usefulness for crop improvement. These enigmatic chromosomes have long fascinated scientists and although their origin and function in plants is somewhat obscure, new research is beginning to shed light on these mysterious chromosomes. This work suggests that B chromosomes may be useful for crop improvement, particularly in grasses, where they show promise as a mechanism to introduce new genes, which could potentially help us to produce more efficient crops. Summary The question of the usefulness of supernumerary B chromosomes (Bs) has long fascinated cytogeneticists. Since their discovery in 1907 thousands of species with Bs have been discovered, but their function in the genetics system remains enigmatic, from their origin, evolution, and adaptive significance, as well as their molecular structure and organization. New research is beginning to answer some of these tantalizing questions. Here, we summarize the known data and conclude that Bs are potentially useful, but only in a few known cases, especially in the grasses, and notably in terms of their engineering as plant artificial chromosomes (mini‐chromosomes) to carry whole suites of transgenes outside of, and free from interference with, the normal genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aevolution 3atransgenes1 aRuban, Alevtina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9011-67300 tPlants, people, planet.g2019 Apr., v. 1, no. 2 p.84-92dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245015700132300001600289506002800305520205800333592002802391506003702419650001302456650003002469650001202499650002202511650001902533650001902552650002302571650001802594650001902612650001802631650001902649650001702668650000802685650001302693650001202706650001202718650002302730650002202753650002602775650001402801650002002815650001902835650001002854650001302864653002702877653002002904653002302924653002302947653002902970700001702999700001903016700001903035773013703054852000903191655001203200IND60785223920221207082138.0150120e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078522392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggoun, Moufida10aIn vitro fermentation of olive oil mill wastewaters using sheep rumen liquor as inoculum: Olive mill wastewaters an alternative for ruminant's nutrition  ap. 203-210.  aResource is Open Access  aOlive oil mill wastewaters (OMWW) are the main liquid effluents generated by the olive oil production industry. This liquid, considered pollutant and toxic, is characterised by its high content of organic matter including mainly sugars and fats, and phenols compounds, which can be used in ruminants feeding. The purpose of this study is to valorise this agricultural by-product in ruminant feeding by estimation its in vitro degradability in presence of ovine ruminale microbiota comparatively to vetch-oat hay, using in vitro gas production technique coupled with NH3-N and protozoa measurements. Cumulative gas production was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of incubation. The determination of gazes produced (carbon dioxide and methane) was recorded at 6, 9, 24, 48 and 96 hours. However, Ammonia and protozoa number were recorded after 24 hours of incubation. Fermentation profile was fitted to the exponential model y = a + b (1 – e-kt). The OMWW are characterized by their high sugars content (39.91%) and their low content in ash (1.99%) and crude protein (2.70%). This by-product is also characterized by its high concentration in total phenols (7.2%) and tannins (4.5%). However, they contain a very small amount of condensed tannins (0.89%). Comparatively to vetch-oat hay, OMWW produced low amount of gas (-23.6 units). Furthermore, its in vitro fermentation generates low volume of methane (9.83%, V/V), suggesting that the OMWW nature enhanced the efficiency of ruminale microbiota towards microbial biomass production and inhibition of ruminale methanogenesis pathway. This result is reinforced by the reduction of ammonia production (-0.35 units) and protozoa proliferation (-1 unit) comparatively to vetch-oat hay. The anaerobic biodegradation of OMWW reveal their significant use by the rumen microbiota, allowing us to strongly recommend its use as a supplement in feed ruminant. In addition, it allows considering using this residue as a feed additive in diets of ruminants for the reduction of ruminal methanogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProtozoa 3aagroindustrial byproducts 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal feeding 3abiodegradation 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3acrude protein 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3ahay 3ainoculum 3aliquids 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial biomass 3aolive mill wastewater 3aolive oil 3aolive oil mills 3aorganic matter 3asheep 3atoxicity 0aolive mill wastewaters 0anutritive value 0aphenolic compounds 0aruminal microbiota 0aanaerobic biodegradation1 aArhab, Rabah1 aLeulm, Nassima1 aBarkat, Malika0 tJournal of BioScience and Biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 3, no. 3 p.203-210dPlovdiv University PresswJournal:27746x1314-62467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520232200311592002802633650002002661650002702681650001002708650001302718650001502731650001702746650001202763650001202775650001302787651001002800653002802810653003002838653002402868653002502892653002902917653002702946700001802973700002502991773011203016856008603128852000903214655001203223IND60634715520221119054437.0190326e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063471552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimeoni, Francesca10aUnderstanding the weak signals of demand in a mature tourist destination: The contribution of a sustainable approach  ap. 775-785.  aSustainable rejuvenation is often indicated as a necessary evolutionary path for mature tourism destinations. However, the process through which such sustainable rejuvenation can be planned and pursued has been largely overlooked. In addition, available research about sustainable rejuvenation usually applies the triple bottom line framework while neglecting the fourth dimension of sustainability, time.The purpose of this study was to understand the motivations and perceptions of tourists regarding the sustainability of Sirmione (a tourism destination on Lake Garda, Italy) and to discuss the results with Sirmione's stakeholders and decision planners to identify priority interventions for sustainable rejuvenation. In recent times, Sirmione has undergone significant changes (related, for example, to the type of incoming tourists) and even if it is still ‘successful’, planners have started reflecting on the need for the town's rejuvenation.This study was approached through the two-tiered sustainability equilibria framework, which suggests a dynamic view of sustainability combining economic, environmental and social aspects with short-, long- and longer-term views. The study was based on data collected through a survey of 328 visitors to Sirmione and analysed through both descriptive statistics and contents analysis. The results of the survey served as the input for the subsequent collective learning process with local tourism operators. Through this process, Sirmione's destination planners were able to intercept weak signals about the evolution of visitor demand and competition. As a result, they developed a list of five priority interventions to implement through a strategic plan for rejuvenation while the destination is still successful. Embedded in the strategic plan were the two tiers of sustainability—economic, environmental and social, and short-, long- and longer-term perspectives.The results of this study contribute to highlighting the relevance of considering time (in addition to economic, social and environmental aspects) to explain the sustainable rejuvenation of a mature tourism destination. In addition, the study provides suggestions on the role of a destination's public and private actors to adopt a combination of initiatives to pursue sustainable rejuvenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3alakes 3alearning 3amotivation 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3atourism 3atourists 3aItaly 0aSustainable development 0aSustainability dimensions 0aTourism destination 0aVisitor satisfaction 0aLongitudinal perspective 0aDestination management1 aCassia, Fabio1 aUgolini, Marta Maria0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 May 10, v. 219 p.775-785dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009400159300001600253500001900269520132600288592002801614650001701642650002001659650001101679650001401690650001301704650001901717700001801736700001601754700001801770700001701788700001501805700001301820700001801833700001401851700001801865773013801883856007402021852000902095655001202104IND60722649720221120160426.0210107e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264972DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb02049d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaohua10aTough thermoplastic hydrogels with re-processability and recyclability for strain sensors  ap. 176-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTough hydrogels with the ability to be repeatedly processed into various shapes as thermoplastics are highly desired in advanced medical devices and tissue engineering. Here, we have developed a kind of versatile supramolecular hydrogel with a network cross-linked by double hydrogen bonds from poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) (PNAGA). The resulting PNAGA-30 hydrogels (30 wt% solid content) are tough, re-processable, and recyclable similar to thermoplastics. The hydrogels in the form of fragments can be easily re-processed into various shapes including sheet, filament, cylinder and other complex shapes by using simple stamping and injection methods. The mechanical properties of the re-programed hydrogels are comparable to the properties of the original hydrogels. The re-processability and robust mechanical properties of the PNAGA hydrogels are promising for practical applications in soft materials, tissue engineering and wearable devices. Furthermore, the PNAGA-30&LiCl ionic hydrogels can be fabricated by simply compositing LiCl into thermoplastic hydrogels. The PNAGA-30&LiCl hydrogels can function as multifunctional strain sensors to monitor large human movements and tiny vibrations, thereby showing great application potential in robotics, biomedical prosthetics, personal healthcare monitoring and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3athermoplastics1 aYang, Xuefeng1 aDai, Qiyuan1 aZhang, Yichen1 aPan, Haotian1 aYu, Chenxi1 aFeng, Qi1 aZhu, Shuangli1 aDong, Hua1 aCao, Xiaodong0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Jan. 6, v. 9, no. 1 p.176-186dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb02049d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245010300166300001800269520114600287592002801433650001601461650001901477650001201496650002601508650001401534650002001548650002301568650002601591650001901617650002001636650001601656650001501672650001201687650001901699650001201718651001601730651001901746700002401765700002201789700002201811700002401833773008901857856008401946961001302030852000902043655001202052IND4458570320221116143955.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445857032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2011.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Kai-Shu10aExperimental host range and natural reservoir of sweet potato leaf curl virus in the United States  ap. 1055-1062.  aSweet potato leaf curl virus (SPLCV), a sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) transmitted begomovirus, causes serious yield losses to many sweet potato cultivars. Using experimental whitefly transmissions in a greenhouse (choice tests) and in a growth chamber (no-choice tests), we evaluated 111 plant species in 30 families to determine the host range of SPLCV. The host range was limited to plants in the genus Ipomoea within the family Convolvulaceae. In total, 38 of 45 Ipomoea species tested were susceptible to SPLCV infection. Surveys were conducted during the 2007–2009 sweet potato growing seasons in Mississippi and South Carolina to evaluate morning glory species as potential reservoir hosts for SPLCV. In the sweet potato experimental fields and surrounding areas, a large proportion of volunteer sweet potatoes, as well as a high percentage of annual and perennial morning glories tested positive for SPLCV. Understanding the host range and potential virus reservoir host plants will ultimately help in the development of an effective disease management strategy that is based on the consideration of agroecological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBegomovirus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aIpomoea 3abiological resistance 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease reservoirs 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3agrowth chambers 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3asurveys 3asweet potatoes 3aviruses 3aMississippi 3aSouth Carolina1 aHarrison, Howard F.1 aSimmons, Alvin M.1 aZhang, Shuo Cheng1 aJackson, D.

In this context, the present work discusses the results obtained by different approaches (conventional methods, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and fallout radionuclides (use of FRNs)). The use of nuclear techniques (FRNs) such as Cesium-137, Lead-210, and Beryllium-7 as tracers can provide an invaluable amount of information on rates of soil loss that is associated with sheet and rill erosion as well as on the redistribution and transfer of that sediment within the landscape. This work mainly presents the results obtained by the application of nuclear isotopes. In the Fergoug watershed study, the use of conventional and nuclear methods has led to converging results. The latter can be summarized as follows: sheet erosion from 1.5 to 10 t·ha⁻¹·year⁻¹ for bare soil and 0.1 to 4 t·ha⁻¹·year⁻¹ for cultivated soil. The use of the RUSLE method has shown that erosion is medium to very high (1 to 33 t·ha⁻¹·year⁻¹). Estimates of erosion by Cesium-137 (¹³⁷Cs) provided a good understanding of the distribution of the isotope at the slope level and therefore of erosion. The erosion rate is from 26 to 42 t·ha⁻¹·year⁻¹, depending on the models used. On the other hand, sedimentation reached 35 and 55 t·ha⁻¹·year⁻¹ downstream of the slopes. The variation of ¹³⁷Cs between transects and along the same transect is linked to erosion. The ¹³⁷Cs method has provided a great deal of information and thus constitutes, by its accuracy and speed, an effective and valuable tool for assessing erosion for medium term (50 years) and monitoring the impacts of land use. It can enable one to overcome the various constraints and limits encountered in the various conventional approaches. It thus appears to be an essential alternative or an effective tool to supplement the conventional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aagricultural soils 3acesium radioisotopes 3aisotopes 3aland use 3alandscapes 3arill erosion 3asediments 3asheet erosion 3awatersheds 3aAlgeria 3aMediterranean region1 aMohammed, Habi1 aBoutkhil, Morsli1 aAhmed, Azbouche0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.55-55dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08826-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140242013100162245011000293300001600403520087000419592002801289650001301317650002001330650002401350650001201374650001901386650001901405650001301424650001901437650001901456650001201475650001201487650001301499650001601512651001201528700001801540700002301558773014001581856007501721852000901796655001201805IND60594634820221120161005.0180619e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6059463482DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027689982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeger, Karl-Heinz10aBeeinflussung der Wasserqualität in einem bewaldeten Einzugsgebiet durch biogeochemische Stoffumsetzungen in bachnahen Böden10aWater chemistry in a forested catchment as influenced by biogeochemical transformations in riparian soils  ap. 345-354.  aTransformations of nitrate and sulfate were investigated with respect to streamwater quality in a forested headwater catchment in the Black Forest (SW Germany). Analyses of seepage collected with ceramic cups in the waterlogged riparian zone provide evidence for a distinct removal of nitrate due to reduction processes. This is in accordance with results from a laboratory experiment. Solutions enriched with nitrate were percolated through soil columns from a histic gleysol. Apparently, nitrate removal results from denitrification, whereas in the dynamics of sulfate various processes appear to be superimposed. In total, the reduction processes observed are favoured by higher temperatures as well as by longer times of contact with the solid phase. The effects on other hydrochemical parameters (notably pH-value and acid neutralizing capacity) are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGleysols 3adenitrification 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3ahydrochemistry 3aneutralization 3anitrates 3ariparian areas 3ariparian soils 3aseepage 3astreams 3asulfates 3atemperature 3aGermany1 aKöhler, Hayo1 aArmbruster, Martin0 tForstwissenschaftliches Centralblatt.g1999 Dec., v. 118, no. 1-6 p.345-354dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12394x0015-80037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027689983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014800156300001800304520125600322592002801578650001601606650004901622650002301671650002401694650001001718650002101728650001201749650001401761650001601775650001001791650001401801650002901815650001701844650002201861653002501883653007101908653003501979653001302014653001602027700001702043700001602060700001602076700001502092700001302107700001702120700001702137700001602154700001402170773012502184856007402309852000902383655001202392IND60152141420221120082646.0150529e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015214142DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcu0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Maolin10amiR396a-Mediated Basic Helix–Loop–Helix Transcription Factor bHLH74 Repression Acts as a Regulator for Root Growth in Arabidopsis Seedlings  ap. 1343-1353.  amiR396 targets seven GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) genes and the BASIC HELIX–LOOP–HELIX (bHLH) TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 74 gene (bHLH74) in Arabidopsis. Previous research revealed that the miR396 target module regulates cell proliferation and plays a critical role in leaf development. However, no additional biological functions of miR396 have been investigated in detail. In this study, T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic plants with altered levels of miR396 or its target genes were used to characterize the regulatory role of miR396 in root development. We found that AtMIR396a was the predominant source for miR396 accumulation in the roots of seedlings, and that the mir396a-1 mutant had longer roots than wild-type seedlings. Overexpression of AtMIR396a decreased the transcript levels of target genes such as GRF genes and bHLH74 , and resulted in a shorter root phenotype. Furthermore, the bhlh74-1 mutant had shorter roots, whereas overexpression of an miR396-resistant form of bHLH74 (mbHLH74) had an enhanced root growth phenotype. Moreover, MIR396a regulated root growth by affecting the elongation zone. Taken together, these data indicate that miR396a-mediated bHLH74 repression helps regulate root growth in Arabidopsis seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3acell proliferation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aleaf development 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer DNA 3atransgenic plants 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aBasic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factor 74 (bHLH74) 0aGrowth-regulating factor (GRF) 0amiRNA396 0aRoot growth1 aBian, Hongwu1 aZha, Yulong1 aLi, Fengyun1 aSun, Yuzhe1 aBai, Bin1 aChen, Zhehao1 aWang, Junhui1 aZhu, Muyuan1 aHan, Ning0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.1343-1353dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012400185300001600309520101600325592002801341650001801369650001601387650002701403650001501430650001301445650003801458650002201496650002101518650002201539650002201561650002101583650001201604650001301616650001401629650001401643650001201657650001601669653002201685653001401707653003201721653001201753653001701765653000701782653000801789653001301797653000801810653000901818700001501827700003001842700002701872700002001899700004001919700003401959773009601993856008602089852000902175655001202184IND60531903720221122055241.0190319e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinelli, Maria Isabel Saraiva10aResponse to immunization in children born to renal transplant recipients using immunosuppressive drugs during gestation  ap. 404-407.  aThe use of immunosuppressive drugs can impair vaccination responses.

There is a large variation in crop species, and a limited availability in specialized herbicides. The robot presented here utilizes systematic growing techniques to navigate and operate in the field. By the use of machine vision it separates seeded vegetable crops from weed. Each weed within the row is treated with individual herbicide droplets, without affecting the crop. This results in a significant reduction in herbicide use, and allows for the use of herbicides that would otherwise harm the crop.The robot is tailored to this purpose with cost, maintainability, efficient operation and robustness in mind. The three-wheeled design is unconventional, and the design maintains maneuverability and stability with the benefit of reduced weight, complexity and cost.Indoor pot trials with four weed species demonstrated that the Drop-on-Demand system (DoD) could control the weeds with as little as 7.6 μg glyphosate or 0.15 μg iodosulfuron per plant. The results also highlight the importance of liquid characteristics for droplet stability and leaf retention properties. The common herbicide glyphosate had no effect unless mixed with suitable additives. A field trial with the robot was performed in a carrot field, and all the weeds were effectively controlled with the DoD system applying 5.3 μg of glyphosate per droplet. The robot and DoD system represent a paradigm shift to the environmental impact and health risks of weed control, while providing a valuable tool to the producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acarrots 3acomputer vision 3adroplets 3aenvironmental impact 3afield experimentation 3aglyphosate 3aleaves 3aliquids 3amaneuverability 3arisk 3arobots 3arowcrops 3avegetable crops 3aweed control 0aPrecision agriculture 0aDrop-on-demand 0aWeed control 0aAgricultural robotics1 aUrdal, Frode1 aBrevik, Anders1 aDørum, Jarle1 aNetland, Jan1 aOverskeid, Øyvind1 aBerge, Therese W.1 aGravdahl, Jan Tommy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5663-07950 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Nov., v. 154 p.36-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010600171300001600277520278900293592002803082650001103110650000803121650001803129650001303147650002003160650002003180650001103200650002403211650002403235650002503259650001103284650001503295650001903310650001603329653002303345653001803368653001303386653002203399700002503421700001803446700001803464773008903482856008403571852000903655655001203664IND60544845620221121035814.0160901e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranco, P.T.B.S.14aThe microenvironmental modelling approach to assess children's exposure to air pollution – A review  ap. 317-332.  aExposures to a wide spectrum of air pollutants were associated to several effects on children's health. Exposure assessment can be used to establish where and how air pollutants' exposures occur. However, a realistic estimation of children's exposures to air pollution is usually a great ethics challenge, especially for young children, because they cannot intentionally be exposed to contaminants and according to Helsinki declaration, they are not old enough to make a decision on their participation. Additionally, using adult surrogates introduces bias, since time–space–activity patterns are different from those of children. From all the different available approaches for exposure assessment, the microenvironmental (ME) modelling (indirect approach, where personal exposures are estimated or predicted from microenvironment measurements combined with time–activity data) seemed to be the best to assess children's exposure to air pollution as it takes into account the varying levels of pollution to which an individual is exposed during the course of the day, it is faster and less expensive. Thus, this review aimed to explore the use of the ME modelling approach methodology to assess children's exposure to air pollution. To meet this goal, a total of 152 articles, published since 2002, were identified and titles and abstracts were scanned for relevance. After exclusions, 26 articles were fully reviewed and main characteristics were detailed, namely: (i) study design and outcomes, including location, study population, calendar time, pollutants analysed and purpose; and (ii) data collection, including time–activity patterns (methods of collection, record time and key elements) and pollution measurements (microenvironments, methods of collection and duration and time resolution). The reviewed studies were from different parts of the world, confirming the worldwide application, and mostly cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies were also found enhancing the applicability of this approach. The application of this methodology on children is different from that on adults because of data collection, namely the methods used for collecting time–activity patterns must be different and the time–activity patterns are itself different, which leads to select different microenvironments to the data collection of pollutants' concentrations. The most used methods to gather information on time–activity patterns were questionnaires and diaries, and the main microenvironments considered were home and school (indoors and outdoors). Although the ME modelling approach in studies to assess children’s exposure to air pollution is highly encouraged, a validation process is needed, due to the uncertainties associated with the application of this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair 3aair pollution 3achildren 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aethics 3aexperimental design 3aexposure assessment 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3apollutants 3aquestionnaires 3auncertainty 0aExposure modelling 0aAir pollution 0aChildren 0aMicroenvironments1 aAlvim-Ferraz, M.C.M.1 aMartins, F.G.1 aSousa, S.I.V.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Nov., v. 135 p.317-332dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245016600197300001800363520218700381592002802568650001502596650001602611650000902627650001302636650002202649650001102671650001602682650002502698650001602723650001102739653001602750653001902766653003502785653003002820653002402850653003402874700002002908700001602928700002002944700001302964700001602977700002002993700001803013700002303031700001803054700005703072773013903129856007803268852000903346655001203355IND60595016920221119234028.0180526e20180207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b168122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Zhe1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7827-297910aProbing Growth-Induced Anisotropic Thermal Transport in High-Quality CVD Diamond Membranes by Multifrequency and Multiple-Spot-Size Time-Domain Thermoreflectance  ap. 4808-4815.  aThe maximum output power of GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors is limited by high channel temperature induced by localized self-heating, which degrades device performance and reliability. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is an attractive candidate to aid in the extraction of this heat and in minimizing the peak operating temperatures of high-power electronics. Owing to its inhomogeneous structure, the thermal conductivity of CVD diamond varies along the growth direction and can differ between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, resulting in a complex three-dimensional (3D) distribution. Depending on the thickness of the diamond and size of the electronic device, this 3D distribution may impact the effectiveness of CVD diamond in device thermal management. In this work, time-domain thermoreflectance is used to measure the anisotropic thermal conductivity of an 11.8 μm-thick high-quality CVD diamond membrane from its nucleation side. Starting with a spot-size diameter larger than the thickness of the membrane, measurements are made at various modulation frequencies from 1.2 to 11.6 MHz to tune the heat penetration depth and sample the variation in thermal conductivity. We then analyze the data by creating a model with the membrane divided into ten sublayers and assume isotropic thermal conductivity in each sublayer. From this, we observe a two-dimensional gradient of the depth-dependent thermal conductivity for this membrane. The local thermal conductivity goes beyond 1000 W/(m K) when the distance from the nucleation interface only reaches 3 μm. Additionally, by measuring the same region with a smaller spot size at multiple frequencies, the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities are extracted. Through this use of multiple spot sizes and modulation frequencies, the 3D anisotropic thermal conductivity of CVD diamond membrane is experimentally obtained by fitting the experimental data to a thermal model. This work provides an improved understanding of thermal conductivity inhomogeneity in high-quality CVD polycrystalline diamond that is important for applications in the thermal management of high-power electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aelectronics 3aheat 3aisotropy 3amaterials science 3amodels 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3atransistors 3avapors 0aCVD diamond 0agrain boundary 0aanisotropic thermal conduction 0anonhomogeneous conduction 0aelectronics cooling 0atime-domain thermoreflectance1 aBougher, Thomas1 aBai, Tingyu1 aWang, Steven Y.1 aLi, Chao1 aYates, Luke1 aFoley, Brian M.1 aGoorsky, Mark1 aCola, Baratunde A.1 aFaili, Firooz1 aGraham, Samuel1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1299-16360 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 07, v. 10, no. 5 p.4808-4815dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b168123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245009200207300001800299506007600317520148000393592002801873506003701901650001501938650001001953650001401963650002501977650002802002650001602030650001202046650001302058650002002071650002902091650001802120650001402138650001802152700002302170700002002193700002302213773013402236856007702370852000902447655001202456IND60114526520221207072451.0141121e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452652DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0054962doi7 aPMC40131932pmcid7 a248294882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibney, Michael J.10aNutritional Phenotype Databases and Integrated Nutrition: From Molecules to Populations  ap. 352S-357S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn recent years, there has been a great expansion in the nature of new technologies for the study of all biologic subjects at the molecular and genomic level and these have been applied to the field of human nutrition. The latter has traditionally relied on a mix of epidemiologic studies to generate hypotheses, dietary intervention studies to test these hypotheses, and a variety of experimental approaches to understand the underlying explanatory mechanisms. Both the novel and traditional approaches have begun to carve out separate identities vís-a-vís their own journals, their own international societies, and their own national and international symposia. The present review draws on the advent of large national nutritional phenotype databases and related technological developments to argue the case that there needs to be far more integration of molecular and public health nutrition. This is required to address new joint approaches to such areas as the measurement of food intake, biomarker discovery, and the genetic determinants of nutrient-sensitive genotypes and other areas such as personalized nutrition and the use of new technologies with mass application, such as in dried blood spots to replace venipuncture or portable electronic devices to monitor food intake and phenotype. Future development requires the full integration of these 2 disciplines, which will provide a challenge to both funding agencies and to university training of nutritionists.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3adatabases 3aelectronic equipment 3aepidemiological studies 3afood intake 3afunding 3agenotype 3ahuman nutrition 3anutritional intervention 3anutritionists 3aphenotype 3apublic health1 aMcNulty, Breige A.1 aRyan, Miriam F.1 aWalsh, Marianne C.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 May, v. 5, no. 3 p.352S-357SdAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0054963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010900165300001600274520138600290592002801676650002001704650001101724650001101735650002501746650001301771650001001784650001601794650003601810650001601846650002201862650001401884650001501898650001101913650001301924650001501937650001401952650001101966650001101977653001901988653001702007653001702024653002802041653000802069653000802077653000802085653000802093653000902101653000902110653000802119653000902127653000802136653000802144653000702152653000802159653000902167653000802176653000902184653001002193653000802203653000802211653000802219700001802227700001302245700001402258700001802272700002102290773010502311856008702416852000902503655001202512IND60541248120221119052140.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zhen10aRedox homeostasis and reactive oxygen species scavengers shift during ontogenetic phase changes in apple  ap. 283-294.  aThe change from juvenile to adult phase is a universal phenomenon in perennial plants such as apple. To validate the changes in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and scavenging during ontogenesis in apple seedlings, the H2O2 contents, its scavenging capacity, and the expression of related genes, as well as miR156 levels, were measured in leaf samples from different nodes in seedlings of ‘Zisai Pearl’ (Malus asiatica)×‘Red Fuji’ (M. domestica). Then in vitro shoots were treated with redox modulating chemicals to verify the response of miR156 to redox alteration. The expression of miR156 decreased gradually during ontogenesis, indicating a progressive loss of juvenility. During the phase changes, H2O2 and ascorbate contents, the ratio of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate, the ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase activities, and the expressions of some MdGR and MdAPX gene family members increased remarkably. However, the glutathione content and glutathione to glutathione disulfide ratio declined. In chemicals treated in vitro shoots, the changes in miR156 levels were coordinated with GSH contents and GSH/GSSG ratio but not H2O2 contents. Conclusively, the relative reductive thiol redox status is critical for the maintenance of juvenility and the reductive ascorbate redox environment was elevated and sustained during the reproductive phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aadults 3aapples 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajuveniles 3ajuvenility 3aleaves 3aontogeny 3aperennials 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3athiols 0aMalus asiatica 0aM. domestica 0aPhase change 0aReduction and oxidation 0aAPX 0aASC 0aBSO 0aCAT 0aCTAB 0aDEPC 0aDHA 0aDHAR 0aDPI 0aGGT 0aGR 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aGST 0aH2O2 0aMDHAR 0aMED 0aOTC 0aROS1 aJia, Xiao Lin1 aWang, Yi1 aWu, Ding,1 aHan, Zhen Hai1 aZhang, Xin Zhong0 tPlant science.g2015 July, v. 236 p.283-294dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009600162300001800258520148500276592002801761650001501789650001301804650001301817650001201830650001501842650002101857650001701878650001601895653002701911653001901938653002301957653002201980653002802002700005502030700005302085773013902138856007802277852000902355655001202364IND60595017020221119234230.0180526e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b168182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, By Lili10aTemperature-Responsive Anisotropic Slippery Surface for Smart Control of the Droplet Motion  ap. 7442-7450.  aDevelopment of stimulus-responsive anisotropic slippery surfaces is important because of the high demand for such materials in the field of liquid directional-driven systems. However, current studies in the field of slippery surfaces are mainly conducted to prepare isotropic slippery surfaces. Although we have developed electric-responsive anisotropic slippery surfaces that enable smart control of the droplet motion, there remain challenges for designing temperature-responsive anisotropic slippery surfaces to control the liquid droplet motion on the surface and in the tube. In this work, temperature-responsive anisotropic slippery surfaces have been prepared by using paraffin, a thermo-responsive phase-transition material, as a lubricating fluid and directional porous polystyrene (PS) films as the substrate. The smart regulation of the droplet motion of several liquids on this surface was accomplished by tuning the substrate temperature. The uniqueness of this surface lies in the use of an anisotropic structure and temperature-responsive lubricating fluids to achieve temperature-driven smart control of the anisotropic motion of the droplets. Furthermore, this surface was used to design temperature-driven anisotropic microreactors and to manipulate liquid transfer in tubes. This work advances the understanding of the principles underlying anisotropic slippery surfaces and provides a promising material for applications in the biochip and microreactor system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adroplets 3aisotropy 3aliquids 3alubricants 3aphase transition 3apolystyrenes 3atemperature 0aself-cleaning material 0adroplet motion 0atemperature-driven 0alubricating fluid 0aanisotropic porous film1 aHeng, Liping1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5415-49321 aJiang, Lei1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4579-728X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7442-7450dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b168183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006000137245009900197300001800296500002000314520171600334592002802050650002002078650001502098650001402113650001502127650002702142650001702169650002402186650001102210700002202221700002602243700002002269773012602289856007102415852000902486655001202495IND60603338720221117070827.0180713e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060333872DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.48992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrevik, Kristian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8329-687910aPesticide durability and the evolution of resistance: A novel application of survival analysis  ap. 1953-1963.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Arthropod pests are widely perceived to evolve resistance to insecticides at different rates. Although widespread “successful” species are assumed to evolve quickly and minor pests slowly, few studies have utilized published data on resistance events to test for differences among species. Using 532 records from the Arthropod Pesticide Resistance Database covering 20 species, we applied a survival analysis to model the number of generations from insecticide introduction to the first report of arthropod resistance, providing one of the most comprehensive analyses of this question to date. Our approach tested: 1) whether successful pests evolve resistance faster than close relatives, 2) whether species differ significantly in the time to demonstrate resistance, and 3) whether different insecticide classes differ in durability (length of time an insecticide is used before resistance arises). RESULTS: We found that species differed significantly in the amount of time it took for resistance to be reported. Overall, the median duration between the introduction of an insecticide and the first report of resistance was 66 generations (95% c.i. 60‐78 generations), and highly‐resistant arthropods did not evolve resistance faster than their relatives. Insecticide durability did not differ by the mode of action or year of introduction. CONCLUSION: Arthropod species significantly varied in how rapidly they evolve resistance to new insecticides, regardless of their chemistry. Visualization of the history of insecticide resistance provides information to be used for understanding how pesticide resistance evolved and how it can best be managed. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropod pests 3aarthropods 3adatabases 3adurability 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3amechanism of action 3amodels1 aSchoville, Sean D1 aMota‐Sanchez, David1 aChen, Yolanda H0 tPest management science.g2018 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.1953-1963dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.48993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01622naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007200165300001600237500001500253520066000268592002800928650001500956650001600971650001600987650001001003650001701013650001801030650001001048653001901058700002101077773009601098856008101194852000901275655001201284IND60081058220221119130059.0140815e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008105822DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293140800432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorbov, S.

This work sought to characterize mean area, mean vertical force, and mean pressure of the front hooves while exercising in a straight line at the walk and trot, and small (10-m diameter) and large circles (15-m diameter) at the walk, trot, and canter. Nine mature horses wore Tekscanᵀᴹ Hoof Sensors on their forelimbs adhered with a glue-on shoe. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4 with fixed effects of leg, gait, and exercise type (PROC GLIMMIX) and p < 0.05 as significant. For all exercise types, the walk had greater mean pressure than the trot (p < 0.01). At the walk, the straight line had greater mean area loaded than the large circle (p = 0.01), and both circle sizes had lower mean vertical force than the straight line (p = 0.003). During circular exercise at the canter, the outside front limb had greater mean area loaded than at the walk and trot (p = 0.001). This study found that gait is an important factor when evaluating circular exercise and should be considered when exercising horses to prevent injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexercise 3agait 3ahooves 3alameness 3astatistical analysis1 aNielsen, Brian D.1 aRobison, Cara I.1 aHallock, David B.1 aManfredi, Jane M.1 aHiney, Kristina M.1 aBuskirk, Daniel D.1 aPopovich, John M.0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245006400201300001800265506007600283520167500359592002802034506003702062650002302099650002302122650003002145650002102175650001802196650001402214650003302228650001502261650001702276650001202293650001402305650002602319650001102345650002202356700003002378700003102408700003302439773013402472856007702606852000902683655001202692IND60114526620221207073255.0141121e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452662DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0056372doi7 aPMC40131942pmcid7 a248294892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil, Ángel,14aThe FINUT Healthy Lifestyles Guide: Beyond the Food Pyramid  ap. 358S-367S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe WHO has proposed that health be promoted and protected through the development of an environment that enables sustainable actions at individual, community, national, and global levels. Indeed, food-based dietary guidelines, i.e., food pyramids, have been developed in numerous countries to disseminate nutritional information to the general population. However, wider recommendations are needed, with information on an active healthy lifestyle, not just healthy eating. The objective of the present work is to propose a three-dimensional pyramid as a new strategy for promoting adequate nutrition and active healthy lifestyles in a sustainable way. Indeed, the Iberoamerican Nutrition Foundation (FINUT) pyramid of healthy lifestyles has been designed as a tetrahedron, with its 3 lateral faces corresponding to the facets of food and nutrition, physical activity and rest, and education and hygiene. Each lateral face is divided into 2 triangles. These faces show the following: 1) food-based guidelines and healthy eating habits as related to a sustainable environment; 2) recommendations for rest and physical activity and educational, social, and cultural issues; and 3) selected hygiene and educational guidelines that, in conjunction with the other 2 faces, would contribute to better health for people in a sustainable planet. The new FINUT pyramid is addressed to the general population of all ages and should serve as a guide for living a healthy lifestyle within a defined social and cultural context. It includes an environmental and sustainability dimension providing measures that should contribute to the prevention of noncommunicable chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Guidelines 3aFood Guide Pyramid 3aWorld Health Organization 3achronic diseases 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aguidelines 3ahealthy diet 3ahygiene 3alifestyle 3anutrition information 3apeople 3aphysical activity1 aRuiz-Lopez, Maria Dolores1 aFernández, Miguel,d1931-1 aMartinez de Victoria, Emilio0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 May, v. 5, no. 3 p.358S-367SdAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0056373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245010400168300001600272520161800288592002801906650001301934650002801947650001001975650001201985650002101997650001902018650000802037650001702045650000902062650001202071650001802083650000902101653000902110653002902119700002402148700002402172700002902196700001802225700001902243700002102262700002502283773010202308856007802410852000902488655001202497IND60752151320221119232408.0210929e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075215132DNAL7 a10.2478/acve-2021-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakovljević, Goran14aThe Influence of Zinc and Heavy Metals in Feed and Water on the Quality of Cryopreserved Bull Semen  ap. 326-343.  aThis study aimed to assess the influence of different concentrations of zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) found in the feed and water provided to bulls on the concentrations of these metals in cryopreserved bull semen, and to determine their influence onto semen quality parameters. Correlations between heavy metal concentrations in the semen and the quality parameters of semen as estimated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and flow cytometry (FC) methods were determined. A total of 40 cryopreserved semen samples originating from bulls housed in 4 different centers for artificial insemination (A, B, C and D) were examined, making a total of 160 samples. The concentrations of metals and semen quality parameters were determined in cryopreserved semen of 10 bulls from each center, namely 4 samples from each bull. Concentrations of Zn, Pb, Hg and Cd in hay and concentrated feed were within the allowed limits as proposed by the National Research Council (NRC, 2000). A strong negative correlation was detected between curvilinear velocity (VCL) and Zn concentrations in the semen (P < 0.01; r = -0.772) in group D, and a positive correlation of VCL with Pb concentrations (P < 0.05 and r = 0.718) in group B. Mercury concentrations in cryopreserved semen correlated negatively to the percent of live sperm cells with intact acrosomes (V/IA: P < 0.05; r = -0.640) and positively with the percent of dead sperm cells with damaged acrosomes (D/DA: P < 0.01; r = 0.766) in group D. This finding confirms the hypothesis that Hg, even at low concentrations, may cause acrosome damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aartificial insemination 3abulls 3acadmium 3acryopreservation 3aflow cytometry 3ahay 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3asemen quality 3azinc 0aCASA 0acryopreserved bull semen1 aLazarević, Miodrag1 aMirilović, Milorad1 aMilovanović, Aleksandar1 aApić, Jelena1 aŠefer, Dragan1 aNedić, Svetlana1 aVakanjac, Slobodanka0 tActa veterinaria.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 71, no. 3 p.326-343dSciendowJournal:22567x1820-74487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/acve-2021-00283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010000164300001800264520169100282592002801973650001902001650002502020650002202045650002002067650002202087650001402109650002402123650001002147650002202157650003002179650001302209650001902222700001802241700001402259700001802273700001802291700001402309700002302323700001502346773010902361856004802470852000902518655001202527IND4473385720221118005056.0120616e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447338572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-012-0413-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shui-ping10aTransgenic Potato Plants Expressing StoVe1 Exhibit Enhanced Resistance to Verticillium dahliae   ap. 1032-1039.  aVerticillium wilt is a persistent and serious disease in potato production mainly caused by soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae. In our previous experiment, StoVe1 gene was cloned from Solanum torvum, a wild relative of eggplant which was shown to be highly resistant to fungal wilts. In order to analyze the function of StoVe1 gene, the StoVe1 gene was sub-cloned into vector pCMBIA1304 and the recombination vector was introduced into the potato cultivar Désirée plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A total of 25 Hygromycin B-resistant plants were generated with ten independent transgenic lines identified by PCR and GUS staining analysis. The expression of StoVe1 gene in transgenic lines C9, C17, and C24 which were selected randomly was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The resistance of transgenic lines to V. dahliae was also evaluated by in vitro antifungal and in vivo plant infection assays. The result showed that StoVe1 gene revealed its expression in all analyzed lines and the level of the transcript was 5.3- to 9.0-fold of that of the control. The antifungal assay revealed that transgenic lines C9, C17, and C24 had threefold higher than control plants and had higher inhibition rates of 45.5%, 44.5%, and 39.4% respectively. This result was confirmed by plant infection assay and the selected three lines were more resistant to V. dahliae infection, with disease index of 15 to 35, about one half to one fourth of that of the control and disease incidences of 20% to 50% and about one half to one fourth of that in control plants. It revealed that the overexpression of StoVe1 gene in transgenic potato lines enhanced plant resistance to V. dahliae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum torvum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3aeggplants 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3awild relatives1 aZhu, Yan-ping1 aXie, Chao1 aJue, Deng-wei1 aHong, Yong-bo1 aChen, Min1 aHubdar, Ali Kaleri1 aYang, Qing0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2012 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.1032-1039dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0413-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011800160520140800278592002801686650001501714650002401729650003301753651001601786700001701802773012801819856007401947852000902021655001202030IND60652596820221119063929.0190713e20180905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065259682DNAL7 a10.3390/su100931742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Choonghyun14aThe Effect of Network Structure on Performance in South Korea SMEs: The Moderating Effects of Absorptive Capacity  aThis study has analyzed how the network structure (density, centrality) affects the performance (convergence, overall) in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) with the different business exchange activities. In addition, we conducted a moderating effect of absorptive capacity (ability, motivation). Based on previous literature about the network and absorptive capacity, research hypotheses were developed and tested using a sample of 226 SMEs in South Korea. The results show that network density and centrality have a positive effect on perceived convergence and overall performance. These results are consistent with previous network studies relating to structural characteristics. To raise total performances in firms with different business exchange activities, they need to enhance density and centrality. For example, firms with different business exchange activities and high levels of density and centrality are able to easily obtain various types of information from other members of 7000 firms in Korea. Through this, they can improve performance. We also conducted the moderated regression analysis. The results show that employee ability has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between centrality and the overall performance while employee motivation has a negative moderating effect. The implications and directions for future study along with limitations are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3amotivation 3aregression analysis 3asmall and medium enterprises 3aSouth Korea1 aLee, Jaekang0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100931743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245009400214300001800308506007600326520154200402592002801944506003701972650002302009650002802032650002102060650002302081650001702104650002202121650001102143650001302154650001002167650001702177650001802194650003502212650002902247650001102276700003202287700002002319773013402339856007702473961001302550852000902563655001202572IND60114526720221207073256.0141121e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452672DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0056862doi7 aPMC40131952pmcid7 a248294902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonstantinidou, Valentini10aPersonalized Nutrition and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: From Framingham to PREDIMED  ap. 368S-371S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiet is considered the cornerstone for the prevention of age-related diseases, and a low-fat diet has been considered for decades as the most suitable alternative to achieve this goal. However, mounting evidence supports the efficacy of other alternatives, such as the Mediterranean diet. Nevertheless, it is well known that people present a dramatic range of responses to similar environmental challenges, and it has been shown that some of this variability is rooted in the genome. In fact, this knowledge is driving the field of nutrigenetics. The finding of interactions between diet and genetic variants has led to intense research and debate about the effectiveness of personalized nutrition as a more suitable tool for the prevention of chronic diseases than the traditional 1-size-fits-all recommendations. Here, we provide some of our own examples that illustrate the progression of nutrigenetics through the years, from the initial studies within the Framingham Heart Study, to the most recent use of large consortia, such as the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology, and ending up with large dietary intervention studies, such as the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) study. These recent approaches are providing more robust and clinically relevant gene–diet interactions. Therefore, although the current evidence level of applying genomic information to tailoring is at its early stages, the prospect of widespread incorporation of nutrigenetics to the clinical practice is encouraging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adisease prevention 3aepidemiology 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheart 3alow fat diet 3anutrigenomics 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3anutritional intervention 3apeople1 aRuiz, Lidia Angeles Daimiel1 aOrdovas, J.

Herein, we aimed to identify the correlations among fat deposition-related phenotypes and the effect of microbiota on changes in body fat accumulation. The rumen microbiota of 141 lambs was profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and the volatile fatty acids’ (VFAs’) concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography. Subsequently, the animals were grouped according to body mass index (BMI) to compare the microbiota of the rumen among the sheep with different fat deposition levels. Results further revealed differences in terms of the species abundance, diversity, and microbial composition between sheep with different fat deposition levels. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis and Random Forest (RF) regression analysis identified changes in 29 ruminal bacteria, which may be the main driver for different fat deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3adiscriminant analysis 3agas chromatography 3amicrobial communities 3aregression analysis 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies abundance1 aZhang, Xiaoxue 1 aLi, Fadi 1 aLi, Chong,d1955 May 16-1 aZhang, Deyin 1 aLi, Xiaolong 1 aZhao, Yuan 1 aWang, Weimin 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245011200209300001600321506007600337520158400413592002801997506003702025650002002062650001402082650001402096650002102110650001302131650002302144650001802167650002002185650001002205650002302215650001302238650002002251650001702271650001202288650001102300650001402311650001902325650001202344650003602356650001402392650002602406700002002432700002302452773013302475856007702608852000902685655001202694IND60114526820221207073310.0141121e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452682DNAL7 a10.3945/an.114.0058682doi7 aPMC40851862pmcid7 a250229872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomagnolo, Donato F.10aNuclear Receptors and Epigenetic Regulation: Opportunities for Nutritional Targeting and Disease Prevention  ap. 373-385.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPosttranslational modifications of histones, alterations in the recruitment and functions of non-histone proteins, DNA methylation, and changes in expression of noncoding RNAs contribute to current models of epigenetic regulation. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a group of transcription factors that, through ligand-binding, act as sensors to changes in nutritional, environmental, developmental, pathophysiologic, and endocrine conditions and drive adaptive responses via gene regulation. One mechanism through which NRs direct gene expression is the assembly of transcription complexes with cofactors and coregulators that possess chromatin-modifying properties. Chromatin modifications can be transient or become part of the cellular “memory” and contribute to genomic imprinting. Because many food components bind to NRs, they can ultimately influence transcription of genes associated with biologic processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, and hormonal response, and alter the susceptibility to chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, obesity). The objective of this review is to highlight how NRs influence epigenetic regulation and the relevance of dietary compound–NR interactions in human nutrition and for disease prevention and treatment. Identifying gene targets of unliganded and bound NRs may assist in the development of epigenetic maps for food components and dietary patterns. Progress in these areas may lead to the formulation of disease-prevention models based on epigenetic control by individual or associations of food ligands of NRs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3aapoptosis 3achromatin 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3adisease prevention 3aeating habits 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomic imprinting 3ahistones 3ahuman nutrition 3ainflammation 3aligands 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3anon-coding RNA 3aobesity 3apost-translational modification 3areceptors 3atranscription factors1 aZempleni, Janos1 aSelmin, Ornella I.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 July, v. 5, no. 4 p.373-385dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.114.0058683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011700172500001900289520186800308592002802176650001402204650001702218650001102235650001202246650001502258650001502273650002402288650001102312650001402323650001702337650002402354650002302378650001202401650001902413650001502432651001202447653001502459653002302474653003202497653002302529700001902552700002002571773008702591856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60730511020221119100249.0210428e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073051102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1052672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTelak, Leon Josip10aManagement and seasonal impacts on vineyard soil properties and the hydrological response in continental Croatia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil degradation in vineyards is a global problem, indicating the need for the adoption of sustainable practices. Studies on the seasonal and long-term management impacts on soil properties and hydrological responses in vineyards are needed. Rainfall simulation experiments (60 mm h⁻¹ for 30 min) and soil sampling were conducted on Cambisols in eastern Croatia during the dry and wet seasons in long-term grass-covered and tilled vineyards. The results show that bulk density (BD), soil organic matter (SOM), available phosphorous (P₂O₅), soil water content (SWC), mean weight diameter (MWD), and water-stable aggregates (WSA) were significantly higher in grass-covered plots than in tilled plots. WSA was significantly lower in the wet period, whereas the opposite trend was observed for SWC and MWD. The time to ponding (PT) and time to runoff (RT) were high (p < 0.05) in the tilled plot in the dry season and low in the wet season. The sediment concentration (SC), soil loss (SL), carbon loss (C loss), and P₂O₅ loss were significantly higher in the tilled plot than in the grass-covered plot. Runoff, SC, SL, C loss, and P₂O₅ loss were significantly lower in the dry period. Although the grass-covered plots exhibited high compaction, the stable structure reduced SL by 91% and 94% in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The tilled plots increased disaggregation and the availability of sediments for transport, enhancing C loss (4.5 times higher) and P₂O₅ loss (6.4 times higher) compared with the values in the grass-covered plots. Tillage as an unsustainable practice was more pronounced in the wet season with 16.4, 10.1, and 11.1 times higher sediment, P₂O₅, and C losses, respectively, than those in the grass-covered plots. More sustainable practices are needed to decrease soil degradation and reverse these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acatenas 3adry season 3aphosphorus 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water content 3atillage 3avineyard soils 3awet season 3aCroatia 0aCompaction 0aRainfall simulator 0aSoil and water conservation 0aNutrient transport1 aPereira, Paulo1 aBogunovic, Igor0 tCatena.g2021 July, v. 202 p.105267-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1052673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245014500163300001800308520142200326592002801748650002201776650002001798650001801818650004401836650001501880650001301895650002201908650002001930650001601950653002401966653002801990653002002018700001902038773015302057856007702210852000902287655001202296IND60522161120221120174347.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052216112DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-11012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenker, Jürgen10aStructure Determination for the Crystalline Phase of Triphenyl Phosphite by Means of Multi-Dimensional Solid-State NMR and X-Ray Diffraction  ap. 1089-1099.  aThe crystalline phase of triphenyl phosphite P(OC₆H₅)₃ was investigated by means of ³¹P solid-state NMR and X-ray diffraction in a temperature range between 170 K and its melting point (Tₘ = 293 K). ID MAS NMR spectra exhibit one sharp central resonance indicating only one crystallographically unique molecule in the unit cell. A theoretical analysis concerning the shape of 2D exchange spectra for 1 = 1 /2 nuclei is presented. It is shown that if the exchange is caused by radio-frequency driven spin-diffusion, this technique allows to discriminate rotational symmetry elements in crystalline solids. Used on crystalline triphenyl phosphite, 3-fold symmetry could be revealed clearly. Structure determination based on X-ray single crystal diffraction data collected at 191 K shows that triphenyl phosphite crystallises in hexagonal metric with space group R3̅(wR₂= 8.3%, Z = 18) and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. This result is in excellent agreement with the NMR spectroscopic data. The lattice parameters at 200 K were determined to a = 37.887(1) and c = 5.7567(2) Å (V = 7156(1) Å³) by refining an X- ray powder-diffraction pattern. The structure of triphenylphosphite can be described as a close rod packing. The rods are formed by ecliptically arranged triphenylphosphite molecules. Due to the 3-fold rotoinversion axis the orientation of molecules in neighboured rods is antiparallel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3adata collection 3amelting point 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3arefining 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 0aTriphenyl Phosphite 0aStructure Determination 0aSolid-State NMR1 aLüdecke, Jens0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 56, no. 11 p.1089-1099dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2001-11013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245019500166520163600361592002801997650002002025650002502045650001602070650001602086650001902102650001002121650002402131650001102155650001202166650001802178653002502196653005102221653002702272653002202299653003502321700001502356700001702371700002002388700001702408700001402425700002002439700001802459700001202477700001202489773010002501856008402601852000902685655001202694IND60725435620221118125733.0210820e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072543562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1006102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Huiming10aUnraveling the characterization of minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2) gene and its SNPs associated with cold-tolerance trait in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)  aMinichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2) plays an important role in DNA replication induced by cold stress. In this study, MCM2 cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences were isolated from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), and the gene was designated Lv-MCM2. The full-length Lv-MCM2 cDNA was 3,138 bp in length, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,721 bp encoding 906 amino acids. The Lv-MCM2 gDNA sequence was 7,322 bp in length and consisted of 16 coding segments in the L. vannamei genome. The expression of Lv-MCM2 mRNA was detected in all selected tissues, with the highest levels being observed in the stomach and gills of the shrimp. The transcript levels of Lv-MCM2 in the stomach and gills were found to be significantly affected by low-temperature, high-pH, low-pH, poly(I:C), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli, indicating that Lv-MCM2 might play roles in coping with various stresses. Specifically, under low-temperature stress (13 °C), the knockdown of Lv-MCM2 with siRNA significantly decreased the shrimp survival rate, indicating its key roles in the response to low-temperature stress. Additionally, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Lv-MCM2 gene were identified as being significantly associated (P < 0.001) with the cold tolerance trait in a full-sib family of L. vannamei. Our study suggests that the Lv-MCM2 gene itself or closely linked genes might play important roles in the cold tolerance trait in L. vannamei, and the SNPs from the Lv-MCM2 gene provide a basis for developing molecular markers for breeding cold-tolerant Pacific white shrimp seeds in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aaquaculture 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3ashrimp 3astomach 3asurvival rate 0aPacific white shrimp 0aMinichromosome maintenance complex component 2 0aLow-temperature stress 0aMolecular cloning 0aSingle-nucleotide polymorphism1 aHuang, Wen1 aLuo, Zhizhan1 aZheng, Chuntian1 aWang, Guoxia1 aLuo, Peng1 aWang, Shengpeng1 aLiu, Jinshang1 aLi, Huo1 aShu, Hu0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Mar., v. 19 p.100610-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1006103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245012200181300001600303520114000319592002801459650001601487650002101503650001801524650001701542650002101559650001401580650001201594650004901606650001301655650001401668650002201682653001101704653001201715653001901727653001701746653001801763700005501781773010501836856008701941852000902028655001202037IND60541248620221119052207.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulekar, Jidnyasa Jayant10aArabidopsis casein kinase 2 α4 subunit regulates various developmental pathways in a functionally overlapping manner  ap. 295-303.  aCasein kinase 2 (CK2) is an essential and well-conserved Ser/Thr kinase that regulates proteins in a posttranslational manner. CK2 has been shown to affect a large number of developmental processes across eukaryotes. It is a tetrameric protein composed of a dimer of alpha (catalytic) and beta (regulatory) subunit each. In our previous study we showed that three of the four CK2 α subunits in Arabidopsis act in a functionally redundant manner to regulate various developmental pathways. In this study we constructed two independent CK2 α4 RNAi lines in the CK2 alpha triple mutant background. Through functional characterization of these RNAi lines we show that the fourth α subunit in Arabidopsis also functions redundantly in regulating ABA response, lateral root formation and flowering time. CK2 α4-GFP localizes to the chloroplast in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings, consistent with the presence of a chloroplast localization signal at the amino-terminus of CK2 α4 subunit. Taken together, our results suggest a functionally overlapping role for the CK2 α4 subunit in regulating various developmental processes in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA interference 3aabscisic acid 3achloroplasts 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflowering 3amutants 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aproteins 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants 0aKinase 0aCK2 α4 0aFlowering time 0aABA response 0aLateral roots1 aHuq, Enamul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7692-51390 tPlant science.g2015 July, v. 236 p.295-303dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245022100161300001800382520086700400592002801267650002201295650001201317650004401329650002201373650001301395653004901408653002001457700001801477700001901495700001601514700002201530700002301552700002101575700002001596700002901616773015301645856007701798852000901875655001201884IND60522161220221120174158.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052216122DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-11022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreuss, Fritz10aAmido-tert-butylimido-vanadium(V)-Verbindungen.

All compounds obtained have been characterized by ⁵¹V NMR spectroscopy. ᵗBuN=V(OMe)₃ was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis; the molecular structure has been found to be that of a binuclear vanadium(V) complex with two bridging methoxo ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3avanadium 0aAmido-terf-butylimido-vanadium( V) Compounds 0a51V NMR Spectra1 aVogel, Monika1 aFischbeck, Uwe1 aPemer, Jens1 aOverhoff, Gerhard1 aFuchslocher, Edith1 aTabellion, Frank1 aGeiger, Barbara1 aWolmershäuser, Gotthelf0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 56, no. 11 p.1100-1108dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2001-11023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011600154300001800270520132700288592002801615650001701643650002001660650002001680650004601700650001701746650001901763650001201782650001501794650000701809650002001816650001401836650001301850650002101863650002101884650001601905700001801921700001701939700002001956700001701976700001801993700001902011700001802030773014202048856007402190852000902264655001202273IND60671278920221118174054.0191002e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00943j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRu, Jiaxi10aDesign and application of a water-soluble phosphorescent Ru(ii) complex as turn-on sensing material for Hg²⁺  ap. 6205-6212.  aA novel phosphorescent chemodosimeter material Ruphen-1 based on a Ru(ii) complex has been designed and developed by introducing Hg²⁺-promoted desulfurization and intramolecular cyclic guanylation of thiourea reaction into the luminophor. Ruphen-1 not only possessed a longer excitation wavelength, large Stokes shift and good water solubility, but also exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity only toward Hg²⁺ with a rapid turn-on phosphorescence response in an aqueous system over a wide range of pH (4.0–9.0). The detection limit for Hg²⁺ could reach 5.4 nM under physiological conditions (pH 7.2). The spectral response mechanism and structure changes of the chemodosimeter have been analyzed in detail through theoretical calculations and ESI-MS. Furthermore, by investigating the change in the phosphorescence lifetime of the chemodosimeter and employing the time-resolved emission spectra method, Ruphen-1 could effectively eliminate the interference of background fluorescence and further improve Hg²⁺ detection accuracy. Finally, Ruphen-1 showed low cytotoxicity toward living cells through the MTT assay, and exhibited potential applications in the detection and monitoring of the distribution of Hg²⁺ in living cells with notable phosphorescence enhancement by confocal luminescence imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3adesulfurization 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amercury 3amonitoring 3apH 3aphosphorescence 3aruthenium 3athiourea 3atoxicity testing 3awater solubility 3awavelengths1 aMi, Xiangquan1 aGuan, Liping1 aTang, Xiaoliang1 aJu, Zhenghua1 aZhang, Guolin1 aWang, Chunming1 aLiu, Weisheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 July 22, v. 3, no. 30 p.6205-6212dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00943j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009100162520126100253592002801514650002301542650002101565650001701586650002501603650001101628650002201639650001401661650003201675650001201707650001301719650001101732651001001743700002301753773012101776856007601897852000901973655001201982IND60760559520221122223719.0211223e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076055952DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111235862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianxiong 14aThe Impact of COVID-19 on the Revenue of the Livestock Industry: A Case Study of China  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected social order and people’s health and has also caused a heavy blow to the livestock industry, affecting animal management and welfare. The livestock industry is one of the main contributors to economic growth in many regions, and it is of great significance to people’s lives and regional economic growth. COVID-19 has reduced the livestock industry’s market as well as consumers’ opportunities to purchase livestock products, resulting in no sales or low sales of livestock or their products. The main purpose of this study is to consider the impact of the pandemic on the revenue of the livestock industry, and to study the challenges arising from the pandemic to the livestock industry. Based on the perspective of financial statements, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 through the translog revenue function of listed Chinese livestock companies from 2015 to 2020, and the study results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the revenue of the livestock industry, but the decline in revenue of large livestock enterprises is lower than that of small and medium-sized livestock enterprises. In the last two parts of this study, we make policy recommendations to livestock enterprises and the authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanimal husbandry 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3alivestock and meat industry 3amarkets 3apandemic 3apeople 3aChina1 aYang, Chung-Cheng 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011300166520178100279592002802060650001602088650001102104650002502115650002702140650001502167650001602182650002702198650002402225650002102249650002002270650002402290650001502314650001702329650001802346650001502364650001002379650001302389650001402402650001202416650001302428650001502441650002102456653001402477653001402491653003002505700001802535700001602553700001702569700001802586700002102604700001602625700005502641773010402696856008602800852000902886655001202895IND60747149420221119113528.0210926e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1059382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Feng10aEffects of sublethal concentration of metamifop on hepatic lipid metabolism in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aMetamifop (MET) is an effective herbicide that has been extensively used in paddy fields. Previous research demonstrated that MET was highly toxic to zebrafish embryos, and this threat has caused great concern; moreover, 0.40 mg/L MET elevated the hepatosomatic index (HSI) in adult zebrafish without lethal effect after 21 d of exposure. In this study, we further determined the detailed impacts of MET on adult zebrafish at sublethal concentrations (0.025, 0.10 and 0.40 mg/L). We found that 0.40 mg/L MET caused liver injury by increasing the activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in plasma, the content of interleukin-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and mRNA expression level of genes associated with inflammatory response in liver of adult zebrafish. The hepatic triglyceride (TG), free fatty acid and fatty acid synthase levels were significantly elevated in 0.40 mg/L MET-treated group (1.55-, 2.20- and 2.30-fold, respectively), and the transcript of lipid accumulation-related genes (fabp10, fas, acc, chrebp, dagt2 and agpat4) were upregulated. Meanwhile, the total cholesterol content was decreased by 0.48-fold, bile acid level was increased by 2.44-fold, and levels of cholesterol metabolism-related genes (apoa-1a, hmgcra, cyp51, dhcr7 and cyp7a1) were increased, suggesting cholesterol metabolism disorder occurred in zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of lipidomics revealed that 0.40 mg/L MET significantly increased the abundance of 91 lipids, which mainly belonged to TG lipid class and were enriched in pathways of glycerolipid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, etc. These results suggested that MET exposure at sublethal concentrations would induce hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism disorders in adult zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abile acids 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3afatty-acid synthase 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression 3ahepatosomatic index 3aherbicides 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipidomics 3aliver 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apaddies 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atriacylglycerols 0aMetamifop 0aZebrafish 0aLipid metabolism disorder1 aZhang, Mengna1 aGuo, Mengyu1 aDuan, Manman1 aZheng, Junyue1 aChen, Xiangguang1 aLiu, Yinchi1 aQiu, Lihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4635-76410 tAquatic toxicology.g2021 Sept., v. 238 p.105938-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1059383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013800157300001800295520108800313592002801401650002801429650001301457650002601470650001501496650001701511650001401528650001301542650002101555650001901576650000901595700001301604700001301617700001501630700001701645700001401662700001701676700001801693773014201711856007401853852000901927655001201936IND60671279020221118173919.0191002e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127902DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00944h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoriuchi, N.10aDielectric properties of fluorine substituted hydroxyapatite: the effect of the substitution on configuration of hydroxide ion chains  ap. 6790-6797.  aHydroxyapatite (HAp) [Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH] is an extremely popular biomaterial. Moreover, HAp durability is well-known to be enhanced by fluoridation. We prepared fluoridated HAp (F-HAp; Ca₅(PO₄)₃(OH)₁₋ₓFₓ) ceramics by substituting F⁻ ions for OH⁻ ions of HAp. F-substitution dependence of dielectric properties in F-HAp was measured to detect the configuration change of OH⁻ ion chains. Dielectric relaxation of two kinds was observed. Each kind had a different relaxation time. Faster relaxation, which is associated with the reorientation motion of OH⁻ ions, was only observed at the low F-substitution range (0 ≤ x < 0.35). The relaxation strength decreased as the F-substitution increased. It became zero at x = 0.35, suggesting that F-substitution induces hydrogen bonds. One F⁻ ion substituted for an OH⁻ ion forms two hydrogen bonds with the two neighboring OH⁻ ions and inhibits the motion of OH⁻ ions, which results in some kind of ordered configuration in F-HAp. The configuration might be an origin that enhances the durability of the F-HAp.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3aceramics 3adielectric properties 3adurability 3afluoridation 3afluorides 3afluorine 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxyapatite 3aions1 aEndo, J.1 aWada, N.1 aNozaki, K.1 aNakamura, M.1 aNagai, A.1 aKatayama, K.1 aYamashita, K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 3, no. 33 p.6790-6797dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00944h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245009100182300001600273520147000289592002801759650002701787650001401814650001701828650001301845650001001858650003801868650003501906650001101941650001601952650002101968650001801989650001102007650001902018650001102037650001202048650003202060650001302092700002102105773011602126856008102242852000902323655001202332IND60081059020221119130103.0140815e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008105902DNAL7 a249167182pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-014-9742-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaming10aIn vitro isolation and cultivation of human chondrocytes for osteoarthritis renovation  ap. 623-629.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the repair effects of chondrocytes that were cultured in vitro on osteoarthritis (OA). Chondrocytes were isolated from fetal rabbits and cultured in Biosilon microcarriers. Sixty rabbits were randomly divided into three groups equally (blank group, model group, treatment group). The rabbit knee OA model was established by inducing papain. Rabbits in the treatment group were injected with the chondrocytes that were cultured in vitro. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and gross morphologic observation were conducted. Expression level of cytokines such as IL-1bβ, IL-6, and TNF-α in cartilage synovial cells was also analyzed by an ELISA assay. The cultured chondrocyte was validated by a positive stain of type II collagen and vimentin by immunofluorescence. Compared to the model group, the articular cartilage of the rabbit knee in the treatment group showed a normal color, smooth surface, and none of malacia and coloboma. HE staining indicated that the articular surface of the treatment group tended to be smooth and flat; the matrix stained tinge and the cartilage destruction and fiber hyperplasia of the synovia were lightened. The expression levels of IL-1bβ, IL-6, and TNF-α also declined in the treatment group. OA symptoms were improved by treating with chondrocytes. In summary, the animal experiment in the present study indicated that chondrocyte injection played an active effect on renovation of OA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal experimentation 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3acolor 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3ahyperplasia 3ain vitro culture 3ainterleukin-6 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3apapain 3arabbits 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avimentin1 aZhang, Changqing0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Aug., v. 50, no. 7 p.623-629dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-014-9742-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005600137245017500193300001800368500002000386520169200406592002802098650002102126650002202147650001002169650002102179650002402200650001002224650001702234650001202251650002802263650001402291650001402305650004302319650005202362650002402414650001802438700001502456700001902471700001502490700002002505700001802525773012502543856007102668852000902739655001202748IND60603339320221117071336.0180713e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060333932DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.48982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuegui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3328-109410aMolecular identification of four novel cytochrome P450 genes related to the development of resistance of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to chlorantraniliprole  ap. 1938-1952.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, is an omnivorous insect that damages a variety of crops worldwide. Chlorantraniliprole is a new diamide insecticide that acts on the ryanodine receptors in insects. The aim of this study was to explore key genes related to the development of chlorantraniliprole resistance in S. exigua. RESULTS: Transcriptomes were compared between beet armyworms from a susceptible laboratory strain (Sus‐Lab) and Sus‐Lab screened with LC₂₅ sublethal doses of chlorantraniliprole for six generations (SE‐Sel). Ten of 11 cytochrome P450 genes with upregulated expression verified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) in SE‐Sel strains were detected in SE‐PZ16 and SE‐ZY16, two extremely resistant field populations. In addition, expression of four new cytochrome P450 genes, CYP9A21v1, CYP9A21v2, CYP9A21v3 and CYP9A21v4, was shown in the two field populations and was significantly higher in the SE‐Sel strain than in the Sus‐Lab strain (P < 0.05). Their full‐length and protein tertiary structures were also cloned and predicted. The function of CYP9A21v3 was analysed by RNA interference, and the relative expression of CYP9A21v3 in the SE‐ZY16 population after feeding on dsRNA was lower than in the control group. Moreover, mortality rates in insects treated at the LC₅₀ of chlorantraniliprole after dsRNA feeding were significantly higher than in the control group 24 h after treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of CYP9A21v3 may be a primary factor in the development of chlorantraniliprole resistance in beet armyworms. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSpodoptera exigua 3acrops 3acytochrome P-450 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenes 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aomnivores 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aryanodine receptors 3atranscriptome1 aChen, Yiqu1 aGong, Changwei1 aYao, Xinge1 aJiang, Chunxian1 aYang, Qunfang0 tPest management science.g2018 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.1938-1952dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.48983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001900174245013700193300001600330520173300346592002802079650002102107650001502128650002002143650001002163650001202173650001902185650001102204650000902215650001502224650002602239650001302265650001402278650002002292650001002312650004302322650001202365650003302377650002402410650002202434650002302456650002402479650002702503650002402530653002102554653001802575653001402593653001902607653001202626700002002638700001502658700002602673700002502699700001702724773013802741856009002879852000902969655001202978IND50069068520221120114545.0190318e20130902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006906852DNAL7 a239738332pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNauta, Maarten10aPrediction of Salmonella carcass contamination by a comparative quantitative analysis of E. coli and Salmonella during pig slaughter  ap. 231-237.  aFaecal contamination of carcasses in the slaughterhouse is generally considered to be the source of Salmonella on pork. In this study the hygiene indicator Escherichia coli is used to quantify faecal contamination of carcasses and it is hypothesized that it can be used to predict the quantitative carcass contamination with Salmonella, when the distribution of Salmonella concentrations in faeces is known. Paired pig sample data (faecal samples and carcass swabs) were obtained from five slaughterhouses and analysed for prevalence and concentrations of E. coli and Salmonella. A simple model was developed to describe the faecal contamination of carcasses using the E. coli data. The E. coli results suggested different hygiene performances in different slaughterhouses, and showed that a model assuming that carcasses are predominantly contaminated by their own faeces was not appropriate. Observed Salmonella prevalences were low (on average 1.9% on carcasses) and between slaughterhouses the prevalences ranked differently than the hygiene performance based on the E. coli data suggested. Also, the Salmonella concentrations predicted using E. coli as a faecal indicator were lower than the observed Salmonella concentrations. It is concluded that the faecal carriage of Salmonella together with the faecal contamination of carcasses, as predicted from E. coli data in the animal faeces and hygiene performance of the slaughterhouse, is not sufficient to explain carcass contamination with Salmonella. Our extensive data set showed that other factors than the observed faecal carriage of Salmonella by the individual animals brought to slaughter, play a more important role in the Salmonella carcass contamination of pork.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3adata collection 3afeces 3ahygiene 3ameat carcasses 3amodels 3apork 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3asampling 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 2aAbattoirsxstatistics & numerical data 2aAnimals 2aEscherichia colixphysiology 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSalmonellaxphysiology 2aSwinexmicrobiology 0aFaecal indicator 0aCarcass swabs 0aPork meat 0aSlaughterhouse 0aHygiene1 aBarfod, Kristen1 aHald, Tine1 aSørensen, Anders Hay1 aEmborg, Hanne-Dorthe1 aAabo, Søren0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Sept. 02, v. 166, no. 2 p.231-237dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100003400187245020000221300001300421506007600434520063400510592002801144506003701172650001501209650001501224650002301239650001601262650002501278650002001303650001401323651001101337653001601348653001001364653001501374653001201389653000801401653000801409700002701417700002701444700001901471773009301490856008101583852000901664655001201673IND60693267820221207115634.0210116e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069326782DNAL7 aPMC32726192pmcid7 a223288492pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.164.22012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaldívar-Riverón, Alejandro10aFive new species of the genera Heerz Marsh, Lissopsius Marsh and Ondigus Braet, Barbalho and van Achterberg (Braconidae, Doryctinae) from the Chamela-Cuixmala biosphere reserve in Jalisco, Mexico  ap. 1-23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFive new species belonging to the poorly known Neotropical doryctine parasitoid wasps genera Heerz Marsh (Heerz ecmahla sp. n. and Heerz macrophthalma sp. n.), Lissopsius Marsh (Lissopsius pacificus sp. n. and Lissopsius jalisciensis sp. n.) and Ondigus Braet, Barbalho & van Achterberg (Ondigus cuixmalensis sp. n.) are described from the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere reserve in Jalisco, Mexico.

Honeydew derived from genetically modified (GM) crops can contain amounts of the transgene product. Thus, it is a possible route of exposure for natural enemies feeding on honeydew. In the present study, the potential effects of Nilaparvata lugens honeydew derived from Cry1C and Cry2A rice on different life‐table parameters and parasitism dynamics of the egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae were evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. Furthermore, the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) levels and the sugar and amino acid composition of honeydew were analyzed. RESULTS: Results indicated that A. nilaparvatae was exposed to Bt proteins by feeding on N. lugens honeydew produced from Bt rice. However, honeydew derived from the tested Cry1C and Cry2A rice lines did not affect the development, longevity, emergence rate and fecundity of A. nilaparvatae. Also, the parasitism dynamics in the field remained unaffected. In addition, the sugar and amino acid composition of N. lugens honeydew was not significantly altered for the tested Bt rice lines compared with the parental non‐Bt plant. CONCLUSION: The quality of honeydew derived from the tested Bt rice lines as a food resource for natural enemies was maintained. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnagrus 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aSternorrhyncha 3abacterial proteins 3acrops 3aeggs 3aexcretion 3aexposure pathways 3afecundity 3ahoneydew 3alongevity 3anatural enemies 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apest management 3arice 3arisk 3asugars 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants1 aWang, Geng‐Wei1 aHan, Hai‐Liang1 aRomeis, Jörg,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3652-83601 aZhang, Fa‐Cheng1 aYe, Gong‐Yin1 aXie, Mao‐Cheng1 aWang, Gui‐Yue1 aLu, Zhong‐Xian0 tPest management science.g2018 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.1854-1860dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.48863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013400208520143300342592002801775650001301803650002001816651001901836653002201855653001801877653002401895653002401919653001801943700002401961700002201985773010202007856008502109852000902194655001202203IND60730511720221119100643.0210608e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073051172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2021.1043732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreas, Cody A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7026-125510aTraveling through light clutter: Path integration and panorama guided navigation in the Sonoran Desert ant, Novomessor cockerelli  aForaging ants use multiple navigational strategies, including path integration and visual panorama cues, which are used simultaneously and weighted based upon context, the environment and the species’ sensory ecology. In particular, the amount of visual clutter in the habitat predicts the weighting given to the forager’s path integrator and surrounding panorama cues. Here, we characterize the individual cue use and cue weighting of the Sonoran Desert ant, Novomessor cockerelli, by testing foragers after local and distant displacement. Foragers attend to both a path-integration-based vector and the surrounding panorama to navigate, on and off foraging routes. When both cues were present, foragers initially oriented to their path integrator alone, yet weighting was dynamic, with foragers abandoning the vector and switching to panorama-based navigation after a few meters. If displaced to unfamiliar locations, experienced foragers travelled almost their full homeward vector (∼85 %) before the onset of search. Through panorama analysis, we show views acquired on-route provide sufficient information for orientation over only short distances, with rapid parallel decreases in panorama similarity and navigational performance after even small local displacements. These findings are consistent with heavy path integrator weighting over the panorama when the local habitat contains few prominent terrestrial cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitats 3asensory ecology 3aSonoran Desert 0aCelestial compass 0aCue weighting 0aPanorama similarity 0aSolitarily foraging 0aVector length1 aPlowes, Nicola J.R.1 aSpetch, Marcia L.0 tBehavioural processes.g2021 May, v. 186 p.104373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2021.1043733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245017200162300001600334520170200350592002802052650001202080650001502092650002402107650001402131650002102145650002502166650001802191650001002209650001002219650002602229650001902255650002502274650003902299650001502338650005202353650002602405650002602431650002902457650001002486650001102496651001002507653004002517653001502557653001902572653003102591653001002622653002402632700001502656700001902671700001902690700001602709700001802725773011902743856008502862852000902947655001202956IND60535228320221119221315.0190403e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053522832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aVirion-associated viral proteins of a Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) iridovirus (genus Ranavirus) and functional study of the major capsid protein (MCP)  ap. 129-139.  aChinese giant salamander iridovirus (CGSIV) is the emerging causative agent to farmed Chinese giant salamanders in nationwide China. CGSIV is a member of the common midwife toad ranavirus (CMTV) subset of the amphibian-like ranavirus (ALRV) in the genus Ranavirus of Iridoviridae family. However, viral protein information on ALRV is lacking. In this first proteomic analysis of ALRV, 40 CGSIV viral proteins were detected from purified virus particles by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The transcription products of all 40 identified virion proteins were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Temporal expression pattern analysis combined with drug inhibition assay indicated that 37 transcripts of the 40 virion protein genes could be classified into three temporal kinetic classes, namely, 5 immediate early, 12 delayed early, and 20 late genes. The presence of major capsid proteins (MCP, ORF019L) and a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (ORF025L) was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The functions of MCP were also determined by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based knockdown assay and anti-recombinant MCP serum-based neutralization testing. At low dosages of CGSIV, siRNA-based knockdown of the MCP gene effectively inhibited CGSIV replication in fathead minnow cells. The antiviral effect observed in the anti-MCP serum-based neutralization test confirms the crucial function of the MCP gene in CGSIV replication. Taken together, detailed information on the virion-associated viral proteins of ALRV is presented for the first time. Our results also provide evidence that MCP is essential for CGSIV replication in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrias 3aIridovirus 3aPimephales promelas 3aRanavirus 3aWestern blotting 3aantiviral properties 3acoat proteins 3adrugs 3agenes 3aliquid chromatography 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aproteomics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalamanders and newts 3asmall interfering RNA 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoads 3avirion 3aChina 0aChinese giant salamander iridovirus 0aProteomics 0aVirion protein 0aMajor capsid protein (MCP) 0asiRNA 0aNeutralization test1 aZhang, Xin1 aWeng, Shaoping1 aZhao, Gaoxiang1 aHe, Jianguo1 aDong, Chuanfu0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Aug. 06, v. 172, no. 1-2 p.129-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245013800194300001600332520146700348592002801815650001101843650001501854650001401869650002701883650000901910650001201919650001001931650001401941650003301955650001201988650003802000650001202038650002402050650002102074650003902095700002502134773009402159856004802253852000902301655001202310IND50066257420221121211759.0130508e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006625742DNAL7 a235680942pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-013-1041-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Cubillos, Sofía12aA mandible arresting system in neotropical social wasps (Vespidae; Polistinae): structural diversity within homogeneous functionality  ap. 429-435.  aMicrotrichia are epidermal protuberances that may serve as temporary adhesive devices. Several insects possess these structures; however, they have not previously been reported in social wasps. With scanning electron microscopy, we characterize the shape and abundance of microtrichia in ten species of social wasps (Vespidae: Polistinae) and three species of related taxa (Vespidae: Eumeninae, Pompilidae, and Scoliidae). Semi-thin sections of the head of Leipomeles spilogastra and Apoica albimacula were also studied. We found microtrichia on a thin, flexible membrane connected to the mandible in all the Vespidae specimens. The flexible membrane can be divided into three regions: the basal region that covers the mandibular mesial emargination, the medial region located around the height of the mandibular condyles, and the distal region that appears anterior to the apodeme folding. Basal and distal regions of the membrane are extensively covered by microtrichia while the medial region has either less microtrichia or is entirely devoid of them. The shape and density of the microtrichia differed between species, and these traits are unrelated with nest material construction or phylogenetic closeness. We propose that the microtrichial membrane described is a passive mechanism to keep the wasps’ mandibles retracted through a mechanical interlocking system. It is possible that this energy-saving mechanism is present in other mandibulate insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoica 3aPompilidae 3aScoliidae 3aconstruction materials 3ahead 3ainsects 3anests 3aphylogeny 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atropics 2aAnimal Structuresxultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTropical Climate 2aWaspsxphysiologyxultrastructure.1 aSarmiento, Carlos E.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2013 May, v. 100, no. 5 p.429-435dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-013-1041-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012200202300001600324506007600340520123000416592002801646506003701674650001901711650002801730650002101758650001301779650001801792650001601810650001401826650001201840650001301852650002201865650003001887650000901917650001001926700002001936773013401956856007702090852000902167655001202176IND60114527620221207072412.0141121e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452762DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0055612doi7 aPMC41882202pmcid7 a254693802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Annie W.10aComparison of Dietary Intake and Physical Activity between Women with and without Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Review  ap. 486-496.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age worldwide. In addition to deleterious effects on fertility imparted by PCOS, women with PCOS are at increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and certain cancers. Hormonal and metabolic aberrations in PCOS have the potential to influence dietary intake and physical activity levels. There are emerging global data that women with PCOS have different baseline dietary energy intakes compared with women without PCOS. These alterations in diet may exacerbate clinical symptoms and compound risk of chronic disease in patients. Few studies have compared baseline physical activity levels between women with and without PCOS. Although comparisons between studies are confounded by several factors, the data point to no differences in activity levels among PCOS and non-PCOS groups. This review provides an assessment of the current literature on baseline dietary intake and physical activity levels in women with PCOS. Future recommendations to strengthen research in this area are provided, given the implications to aid in the development of effective nutrition-focused interventions for PCOS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal ovaries 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3arisk 3awomen1 aLujan, Marla E.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 Sept., v. 5, no. 5 p.486-496dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0055613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010700187300001600294520103200310592002801342650003501370650001301405650002001418650002001438650001301458650002601471650001101497650002401508650001101532650002101543650002001564653002101584653003501605653005301640653003801693653002301731773013001754856008201884852000901966655001201975IND60517183320221120234955.0190731e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051718332DNAL7 a223406262pmid7 a10.1017/S09544224120000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamont, Linda S.12aA critical review of recommendations to increase dietary protein requirements in the habitually active  ap. 142-149.  aSome scientists and professional organisations have called for an increase in dietary protein for those who reach a threshold level of exercise, i.e. endurance athletes. But there are individual scientists who question this recommendation. Limitations in the procedures used to justify changing the recommended daily allowance (RDA) are at issue. N balance has been used to justify this increase; but it is limiting even when measured in a well-controlled clinical research centre. Experimental shortcomings are only exacerbated when performed in a sports or exercise field setting. Another laboratory method used to justify this increase, the isotope infusion procedure, has methodological problems as well. Stable isotope infusion data collected during and after exercise cannot account for fed-state gains that counterbalance those exercise losses over a 24 h dietary period. The present review concludes that an adaptive metabolic demand model may be needed to accurately study the protein health of the active individual.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aathletes 3adata collection 3adietary protein 3aexercise 3alaboratory techniques 3amodels 3anitrogen metabolism 3asports 3asports nutrition 3astable isotopes 0aNitrogen balance 0aStable isotope tracer infusion 0aProtein recommended daily allowance for athletes 0aDietary protein needs of athletes 0aEndurance athletes0 tNutrition research reviews.g2012 June, v. 25, no. 1 p.142-149dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl43438x1475-27007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09544224120000303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010800171300001200279520166800291592002801959650001401987650001302001650001302014650002002027650001502047650001602062650001202078650002102090650001602111650001002127650001302137651001102150700002102161700002402182773010502206856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60621484720221121005454.0181117e199606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148472DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826596017002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Homero,10aPromotion of Oral Rehydration Therapy Comparing a Homemade Rice-Powder Gruel and Oral Rehydration Salts  ap. 1-7.  aCharacteristics of the use of two oral rehydration solutions [rice-based gruel (RBG) or oral rehydration salts (ORS)] were assessed in 162 mothers of children under five years of age who presented a first episode of diarrhoea during the study period, in 12 rural villages of Central Mexico. Eighty-six mothers lived in six villages randomly assigned to receive the RBG promotion and 76 lived in six villages assigned to receive the ORS promotion. The intervention strategy, relying on face-to face contact by health auxiliaries who teach mothers about the dangers of dehydration, how to recognize it, and how to prepare and feed an oral rehydration solution, closely resembled that used by the National Program for the Control of Diarrheal Diseases. Before the intervention, 42% of all mothers used RBG and 58% used ORS; 8% of mothers who used RBG and 18% of those who used ORS used the beverage for rehydration purposes. After the intervention, in the villages where RBG was promoted, 57 (66%) of the mothers used RBG and 14 (16%) used ORS. In the villages where ORS was promoted, 9 (12%) of the mothers used RBG and 58 (76%) used ORS. In both groups, all mothers used at least one other beverage (usually herbal tea) during diarrhoea. but the promoted beverages were used first The use of the promoted beverage was higher when mothers had used it before the intervention. Eighty-six percent of mothers who prepared RBG used the promoted concentration of ingredients, whereas all mothers who prepared ORS correctly diluted one package in 1 L of water. After the intervention, 54% and 67% of mothers said they used RBG and ORS specifically to prevent dehydration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3adisease control 3aherbal tea 3aingredients 3amothers 3aoral rehydration 3arehydration 3asalts 3avillages 3aMexico1 aBojalil, Rossana1 aGuiscafré, Héctor0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 17, no. 2 p.1-7dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826596017002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001400285520171100299592002802010650001002038650002302048650001202071650001602083650001802099650002402117650001502141650001002156650002602166650001402192650001902206650001202225650002602237650002102263650001902284650001702303650002302320653001802343653001202361653002002373653001802393653002702411653002402438653002102462653002502483700002902508773010602537856008202643852000902725655001202734IND50064367220221118004954.0190403e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006436722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTittonell, Pablo10aWhen yield gaps are poverty traps: The paradigm of ecological intensification in African smallholder agriculture  ap. 76-90.  aYield gaps are pervasive in African smallholder agriculture, and are large for almost all crops in all regions. There is consensus that poor soil fertility and nutrient availability are the major biophysical limitations to agricultural production in the continent. We identify two major yield gaps: (1) the gap between actual yields (YA) and the water-limited yield potential (Yw), which is the maximum yield achievable under rainfed conditions without irrigation if soil water capture and storage is optimal and nutrient constraints are released, and (2) The gap between YA, and a locally attainable yield (YL) which corresponds to the water and nutrient-limited yields that can be measured in the most productive fields of resource endowed farmers in a community. Estimates of these two yield gaps are given for major crops, together with a framework for how yield gaps can be estimated in a pragmatic way for different farming systems. The paradigm of ecological intensification which focuses on yield potential, soil quality and precision agriculture is explored for the African context. Our analysis suggests that smallholder farmers are unable to benefit from the current yield gains offered by plant genetic improvement. In particular, continued cropping without sufficient inputs of nutrients and organic matter leads to localised but extensive soil degradation and renders many soils in a non-responsive state. The lack of immediate response to increased inputs of fertiliser and labour in such soils constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many smallholder farmers in Africa. This necessitates a rethink for development policy aimed to improve productivity and address problems of food insecurity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3adevelopment policy 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3airrigation 3alabor 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apoverty 3aprecision agriculture 3asoil degradation 3asoil nutrients 3asoil quality 3asoil water storage 0aCereal yields 0aCassava 0aHighland banana 0aGrain legumes 0aBoundary line analysis 0aSoil organic matter 0aSoil degradation 0aNon-responsive soils1 aGiller, K.

A possibility exists that the RyR channel-mediated insufficient increase of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level could be one of the causes for post-ovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA. To test this possibility, eggs collected after 17 h post-hCG surge were cultured with or without various concentrations of nifedipine (NF), ruthenium red (RR), and KN-93 for 3 h in vitro. Morphological changes characteristic of abortive SEA, cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level, cyclin B1 level, and meiotic status were analyzed. Data of the present study indicate that NF and RR inhibited post-ovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, RR protected against RyR channel as well as caffeine-mediated increase of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level. In addition, KN-93 inhibited post-ovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA in a concentration-dependent manner. An increase of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level was associated with a reduction of cyclin B1 level during post-ovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA. These data indirectly suggest the involvement of RyR channels in the increase of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level. The increased cytosolic free Ca²⁺ level triggers cyclin B1 degradation possibly through CaMK-II activity during post-ovulatory aging-induced abortive SEA in rat eggs cultured in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aeggs 3arats 3aruthenium1 aChaube, Shail K.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 Aug., v. 50, no. 7 p.640-647dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-014-9749-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167520124000308592002801548650001701576650001401593650002401607650001801631650001701649650002301666650001101689650002101700650002301721650001501744650004301759650001901802650001401821653002901835653002201864653002601886653001401912653001601926653001401942700001201956700001301968700001901981700001802000700001302018700005202031773009302083856008602176852000902262655001202271IND60725436720221118125906.0210812e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072543672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Meng10aCo-administration of berberine/gypenosides/bifendate ameliorates metabolic disturbance but not memory impairment in type 2 diabetic mice  aCognitive impairment is a well-known complication of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) characterized by cellular insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. Berberine, gypenosides and bifendate are traditional Chinese herbal medicines with multiple pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, metabolism improvement and memory improvement. To investigate whether they have synergistic effect on T2DM metabolic syndrome and associated memory impairment, we measured in this study the effect of a low dose of berberine/gypenosides/bifendate (BGB) co-administration on metabolism and memory performance of T2DM model mice. We found that BGB co-administration ameliorated metabolic abnormalities of both high-fat diet/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM mice and db/db mice. However, it did not alleviate memory impairment in either type of T2DM model mice. Since neither berberine, gypenosides nor bifendate alone at the low dose is effective, we presume that BGB co-administration has synergistic action on T2DM metabolic syndrome. In addition, our findings suggest that higher doses of BGB might be required to ameliorate memory impairment than metabolic disturbance associated with T2DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aberberine 3acognitive disorders 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3astreptozotocin 3asynergism 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aMemory impairment 0aMetabolic disturbance 0aBerberine 0aGypenosides 0aBifendate1 aLi, Jie1 aGuo, Xin1 aWang, Xiaoting1 aShi, Dongping1 aCui, Lin1 aZhou, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8193-75610 tHeliyon.g2021 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.e06004-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e060043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245019700157520142400354592002801778650002201806650001601828650001801844650001101862650001901873650003001892650002501922650004001947650001501987650001002002650002502012650002102037650001602058650001302074650001802087650001302105650002002118650001902138650001002157650001002167700001902177700002302196700001902219773012802238856007402366852000902440655001202449IND60652597920221119063950.0190713e20180906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065259792DNAL7 a10.3390/su100931842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxe, Henrik10aProduction of Pig Feed under Future Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations: Changes in Crop Content and Chemical Composition, Land Use, Environmental Impact, and Socio-Economic Consequences  aWith the rising atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf>, crops will assimilate more carbon. Yields will increase in terms of carbohydrates while diluting the content of protein and minerals in compound pig feed, calling for an altered formulation with more protein and less carbohydrate crops to maintain its nutritional value. Using crop response data from CO<inf>2</inf> exposures in a linear modeling of feed formulation, we apply a consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) to model all of the environmental impacts and socio-economic consequences that altered crop yields and chemical composition at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels have on feed formulation, targeting altered amino acid contents rather than overall protein. An atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> of 550 &micro;mole mole&minus;1 gives rise to a 6% smaller demand for land use for pig feed production. However, feed produced at this CO<inf>2</inf> must include 23% more soymeal and 5% less wheat than at present in order to keep its nutritional value. This counteracts the yield benefit. The monetized environmental cost of producing pig feed, where sunflower and soy contribute the most, equals the direct feed price in both scenarios. If external costs were internalized, honoring the Rio Declaration, feed prices would double. In contrast, the future composition of pig feed will increase the direct price by only 0.8%, while the external cost decreases by only 0.3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3achemical composition 3aconsequential life cycle assessment 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenvironmental impact 3afeed formulation 3afeed prices 3aland use 3alinear models 3aminerals 3anutritive value 3asocioeconomics 3aswine 3awheat1 aHamelin, Lorie1 aHinrichsen, Torben1 aWenzel, Henrik0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 06, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100931843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013600167300001600303500001500319520138600334592002801720650001701748650001701765650003701782650002201819650001701841650000901858650001901867650001901886650003301905650001501938650004401953650000701997650002302004650001202027650001502039650001502054653001602069653004102085653002202126653000902148653001502157700001802172700001702190700001502207700001902222700001502241700002502256773010602281856008702387852000902474655001202483IND60552949820221122070115.0180830e20160605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Juntao10aPVBC microspheres tethered with poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) brushes for effective removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution  ap. 218-230.  a2019-12-06  aA novel pH-sensitive polystyrene (PS)-type resin was developed by grafting of poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) (PSPMA) brushes onto a cross-linked poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) (PVBC) microsphere via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and was further utilized as a highly efficient and recyclable sorbent to remove Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The as-synthesized PSPMA-grafted PVBC microspheres were characterized by ATR-FTIR, XPS and SEM. Batch adsorption results revealed that the solution pH had an evident effect on the adsorption capacity of the PSPMA-grafted microspheres towards Pb(II) ions with an optimal sorption pH of above 5.0. The PSPMA-grafted microspheres had rapid adsorption kinetics of Pb(II) ions to reach adsorption equilibrium within 60min. The Langmuir-fitted adsorption isotherms at pH 5.0 with an initial Pb(II) concentration range of 0.12–0.97mmolL⁻¹ (i.e. 50–200mgL⁻¹) revealed a maximum capacity of Pb(II) ions of 0.82mmolg⁻¹. The calculated thermodynamic parameters demonstrated an endothermic and spontaneous adsorption process of Pb(II) ions on the PSPMA-grafted microspheres. With the inherent stability, high adsorption capacity and good regenerability, the PSPMA-grafted PVBC microsphere resin provides a novel promising PS-type adsorbent for effective removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3apolystyrenes 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3aheavy metals 3alead 3apolymerization 3athermodynamics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aadsorbents 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3abrushes 3ametal ions 3aadsorption 0aPb(II) ions 0aAtom transfer radical polymerization 0aPVBC microspheres 0aions 0aAdsorption1 aYuan, Shaojun1 aShu, Wanting1 aJiang, Wei1 aTang, Shengwei1 aLiang, Bin1 aPehkonen, Simo Olavi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 June 05, v. 498 p.218-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.03.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245006700197300001600264520063400280592002800914650002700942650002100969650001400990650001101004650001001015650001201025650002901037650001201066650007001078650002601148650004601174650003001220650002901250650002101279650002201300650003701322650002101359650005001380650002701430650002201457700002301479773010901502856004801611852000901659655001201668IND4482566820221117085002.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448256682DNAL7 a218337162pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-011-0236-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzimzadeh Jamalkandi, Sadegh10aRNAi pathway integration in Caenorhabditis elegans development  ap. 389-405.  aIn this review, the pathways involving small RNAs are provided followed by a new and updated network that illustrates their interplay with diverse cellular mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans.

RESULTS: We identify four natural mutations in GoCEN-Dₜ associated with cluster fruiting (cl) and early maturity. The situ hybridization shows that GhCEN is preferentially expressed in cotton shoot apical meristems (SAM) of the main stem and axillary buds. Constitutive GhCEN-Dt overexpression suppresses the transition of the cotton vegetative apex to a reproductive shoot. Silencing GoCEN leads to early flowering and determinate growth, and in tetraploids causes the main stem to terminate in a floral bud, a novel phenotype that exemplifies co-adaptation of polyploid subgenomes and suggests new research and/or crop improvement approaches. Natural cl variations are enriched in cottons adapted to high latitudes with short frost-free periods, indicating that mutants of GoCEN have been strongly selected for early maturity. CONCLUSION: We show that the cotton gene GoCEN-Dt, a homolog of Antirrhinum CENTRORADIALIS, is responsible for determinate growth habit and cluster fruiting. Insight into the genetic control of branch and flower differentiation offers new approaches to develop early maturing cultivars of cotton and other crops with plant architecture appropriate for mechanical harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100203-2cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31701471cNational Science Foundation of China  a31460363cNational Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAntirrhinum 3aGossypium 3aapical meristems 3abuds 3acotton 3acrops 3acultivars 3adeterminate growth 3aearly development 3aflowering 3afruiting 3agenes 3ahybridization 3alatitude 3amechanical harvesting 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3atetraploidy1 aTeng, Zhonghua1 aKong, Jie1 aLiu, Xueying1 aWang, Wenwen1 aZhang, Xiao1 aZhai, Tengfei1 aDeng, Xianping1 aWang, Jinxia1 aZeng, Jianyan1 aXiao, Yuehua1 aGuo, Kai1 aZhang, Jian1 aLiu, Dajun1 aWang, Weiran1 aZhang, Zhengsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3283-32720 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.286-286dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1518-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04164naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245013700172300001600309520239100325592002802716650002902744650002602773650002702799650003002826650001202856650001302868650002502881650001702906650001102923650002002934650001902954650002402973650001502997650001003012650001303022650002603035650001403061650002103075650002203096650001603118653001603134653001103150653001703161653001303178653001603191700001803207700002203225700006003247700002303307700006603330773010003396856008103496852000903577655001203586IND60526365720221119180514.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052636572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorari, Michelangelo10aGenomic approach to studying nutritional requirements of Clostridium tyrobutyricum and other Clostridia causing late blowing defects  ap. 213-223.  aClostridium tyrobutyricum is the main microorganism responsible for the late blowing defect in hard and semi-hard cheeses, causing considerable economic losses to the cheese industry. Deeper knowledge of the metabolic requirements of this microorganism can lead to the development of more effective control approaches. In this work, the amino acids and B vitamins essential for sustaining the growth of C. tyrobutyricum were investigated using a genomic approach. As the first step, the genomes of four C. tyrobutyricum strains were analyzed for the presence of genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and B vitamins. Metabolic pathways could be reconstructed for all amino acids and B vitamins with the exception of biotin (vitamin B7) and folate (vitamin B9). The biotin pathway was missing the enzyme amino-7-oxononanoate synthase that catalyzes the condensation of pimeloyl-ACP and l-alanine to 8-amino-7-oxononanoate. In the folate pathway, the missing genes were those coding for para-aminobenzoate synthase and aminodeoxychorismate lyase enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the conversion of chorismate into para-aminobenzoate (PABA). Two C. tyrobutyircum strains whose genome was analyzed in silico as well as other 10 strains isolated from cheese were tested in liquid media to confirm these observations. 11 strains showed growth in a defined liquid medium containing biotin and PABA after 6–8 days of incubation. No strain showed growth when only one or none of these compounds were added, confirming the observations obtained in silico. Furthermore, the genome analysis was extended to genomes of single strains of other Clostridium species potentially causing late blowing, namely Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridium butyricum. Only the biotin biosynthesis pathway was incomplete for C. butyricum and C. beijerincki. In contrast, C. sporogenes showed missing enzymes in biosynthesis pathways of several amino acids as well as biotin, folate, and cobalamin (vitamin B12). These observations agree with the results of growth experiments of these species in liquid media reported in the literature. The results of this study suggest that biotin and folate are potential targets for reducing late blowing in cheese and highlight the usefulness of genomic analysis for identifying essential nutrients in bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aClostridium butyricum 3aClostridium sporogenes 3aClostridium tyrobutyricum 3aalanine 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotin 3acheese industry 3achorismic acid 3afinancial economics 3afolic acid 3agenes 3agenomics 3anutrient requirements 3anutrients 3asemisoft cheeses 3asequence analysis 3avitamin B12 0aClostridium 0aCheese 0aLate blowing 0aVitamins 0aAmino acids1 aKulli, Sandra1 aWüthrich, Daniel1 aBruggmann, Rémy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4733-79221 aBerthoud, Hélène1 aArias-Roth, Emmanuelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4767-32670 tFood microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 59 p.213-223dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006800147245013000215300001800345520122100363592002801584650001301612650000901625650001301634650002001647650001001667650002201677650001301699700002301712700002201735773011101757856008201868852000901950655001201959IND60632494620221120180946.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-2152-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Gradowski, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3161-586310aPreparation and characterization of cellulose-based barrier coatings for producing a release-liner out of a porous base paper  ap. 1881-1894.  aA novel silicone release liner was prepared from porous base paper with a simple biogenic polymeric pre-coat. The introduced method does not require the typical complex pretreatment processes for a paper sheet, such as calendering or pre-coating with clay. Biogenic polymers, hydroxyethyl cellulose and methylcellulose, were used to close the pores of the paper sheet. In addition, we used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a commonly used barrier coating with known film-forming capabilities, as a reference to close the pores and prevent silicone penetration into the base paper. In particular, hydroxyethyl cellulose showed promising barrier properties similar to those of PVA coatings. Methyl cellulose is less appropriate for release liner production due to poor film stability and insufficient adhesion to the underlying base paper. Barrier-coatings should be applied by a blade coater rather than a roller coater to obtain homogenous coatings. When a thin silicone layer was applied to the barrier-coated papers, the measured release forces were significantly reduced from 6.5 N/25 mm, for siliconized papers without any pre-coat, to less than 1 N/25 mm after pre-coating, particularly with hydroxyethyl cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aclay 3acoatings 3amethylcellulose 3apaper 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asilicone1 aTorborg, Christian1 aBiesalski, Markus0 tCellulose.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 3 p.1881-1894dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-2152-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008300169300001600252520148900268592002801757650001501785650002101800650002601821650001301847650001701860650001801877650001101895650001701906650001301923650001701936650002101953653002901974653001602003653001202019653001402031653001102045653001802056653001002074653001702084653002202101773009602123856008202219852000902301655001202310IND60553349220221119151931.0161021e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055334922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzyka, Kateryna10aCurrent trends in the development of the electrochemiluminescent immunosensors  ap. 393-407.  aThis review presents a general picture of the current trends and developments (2008–2013) related to electrochemiluminescence-based immunosensors. It briefly covers the milestones of qualitative changes in the field of electrochemiluminescent immunosensors; the peculiarities of the electrochemiluminescent immunoassay formats; the basic mechanisms of ECL detection, main features of early and ongoing approaches in electrochemiluminescent immunoassay commercial instruments, and the recent developments in fabrication of solid-state electrochemiluminescent immunosensors. Moreover, systematized data on biomarkers, immunoassay formats, and novel types of electrochemiluminescent label and immobilization support, such as semiconductor nanocrystals, porous noble metals, graphene, TiO2 nanotube arrays, metal–organic composites, multiwall carbon nanotubes, liposomes, photolummonescent carbone nanocrystals are presented as a table. Considerable efforts have also been devoted towards the following two key points: multiplexing analysis (multi-label, and the multianalyte strategies) and integration in microfluidic lab-on-paper devices with capabilities for point-to-care diagnostics. An immuno-like electrochemiluminescent sensor (based on synthetic receptors—molecularly imprinted polymers), as a new alternative to traditional electrochemiluminescent immunoassay is highlighted. Future perspectives and possible challenges in this rapidly developing area are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acarbon nanotubes 3adiagnostic techniques 3agraphene 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ametals 3ananocrystals 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3atitanium dioxide 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aImmunoassay 0aSensors 0aBiomarker 0aLabels 0aNanomaterials 0aArray 0aLab-on-paper 0aImmuno-like assay0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 54 p.393-407dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245015500174300001400329520165600343592002801999650002002027650001502047650001902062650001702081650001102098650000902109650001702118650001102135650002502146650003702171650001702208653001202225653001702237653000802254653001602262653001802278653001102296653001502307700002002322700001702342700002102359700002102380700001702401700002302418700002202441700002002463700002002483700002302503700002002526773007502546856009002621852000902711655001202720IND60584333820221118051632.0171024e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058433382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEwan, Conor10aCombined sonodynamic and antimetabolite therapy for the improved treatment of pancreatic cancer using oxygen loaded microbubbles as a delivery vehicle  ap. 20-32.  aIn this manuscript we describe the preparation of an oxygen-loaded microbubble (O2MB) platform for the targeted treatment of pancreatic cancer using both sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and antimetabolite therapy. O2MB were prepared with either the sensitiser Rose Bengal (O2MB-RB) or the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (O2MB-5FU) attached to the microbubble (MB) surface. The MB were characterised with respect to size, physical stability and oxygen retention. A statistically significant reduction in cell viability was observed when three different pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPc-3, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1), cultured in an anaerobic cabinet, were treated with both SDT and antimetabolite therapy compared to either therapy alone. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in tumour growth was also observed when ectopic human xenograft BxPC-3 tumours in SCID mice were treated with the combined therapy compared to treatment with either therapy alone. These results illustrate not only the potential of combined SDT/antimetabolite therapy as a stand alone treatment option in pancreatic cancer, but also the capability of O2-loaded MBs to deliver O2 to the tumour microenvironment in order to enhance the efficacy of therapies that depend on O2 to mediate their therapeutic effect. Furthermore, the use of MBs to facilitate delivery of O2 as well as the sensitiser/antimetabolite, combined with the possibility to activate the sensitiser using externally applied ultrasound, provides a more targeted approach with improved efficacy and reduced side effects when compared with conventional systemic administration of antimetabolite drugs alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acell lines 3acell viability 3afluorouracil 3ahumans 3amice 3amicrobubbles 3aoxygen 3apancreatic neoplasms 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3atherapeutics 0aHypoxia 0aMicrobubbles 0aSDT 0aRose Bengal 0a5-Flurouracil 0aCancer 0aPancreatic1 aKamila, Sukanta1 aOwen, Joshua1 aNesbitt, Heather1 aCallan, Bridgeen1 aBorden, Mark1 aNomikou, Nikolitsa1 aHamoudi, Rifat A.1 aTaylor, Mark A.1 aStride, Eleanor1 aMcHale, Anthony P.1 aCallan, John F.0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 80 p.20-32dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245010400167300001600271520215700287592002802444650001902472650001602491650001202507650002002519650001002539650001202549650001602561650002002577650001502597650002602612650002502638650001502663650001202678650001002690651001202700651001602712700002202728700001802750700002002768773009402788856008402882852000902966655001202975IND4460750520221119064209.0141112e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446075052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2011.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoogaard, B.K.10aSocio-cultural sustainability of pig production: Citizen perceptions in the Netherlands and Denmark  ap. 189-200.  aMany sustainability studies of animal production consider three pillars: the economic, environmental and socio-cultural. Farmers and animal scientists tend to put most emphasis on the economic and environmental pillar and largely ignore the socio-cultural pillar. Socio-cultural sustainability refers to social perceptions of animal farming, including social appreciations and concerns of animal production systems. Integration of social demands and values in the production sector is a prerequisite to justify animal production within a society. The objective of the present study was therefore to gain further insights into socio-cultural sustainability of pig production. Many citizens may not know what contemporary pig production actually entails. To give people a real life experience with pig production, we conducted farm visits with citizen panels with 18 respondents in the Netherlands and 8 respondents in Denmark. In both countries, respondents were divided over two panels and each panel visited a conventional and an organic pig farm. During the farm visits respondents noted their sensory experiences — what do you smell, hear, see and feel? In addition, each respondent made pictures of six positive and six negative aspects on the farms for which they had to write a motivation. The qualitative analysis resulted in seven socio-cultural themes (SCT) of pig production namely: 1) meat production, 2) farm activities, 3) farm income, 4) animals, 5) housing system, 6) environment and nature, and 7) culture and landscape. Each SCT included several socio-cultural aspects (appreciations, SCA) and socio-cultural issues (concerns, SCI). We identified 31 SCAs in the Netherlands and 33 SCAs in Denmark, of which 29 were SCIs in both countries. Although many issues were associated with animal welfare, the results also showed that social concerns of pig production extended beyond animal welfare. In general it can be stated that citizens are strongly concerned about overexploitation of animals in contemporary pig production systems, but at the same time they appreciate the dynamism in a pig farm including certain modern developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ahearing 3alife events 3ameat production 3amotivation 3aproduction technology 3aqualitative analysis 3ascientists 3asociety 3aswine 3aDenmark 3aNetherlands1 aBoekhorst, L.J.S.1 aOosting, S.J.1 aSørensen, J.T.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Sept., v. 140, no. 1-3 p.189-200dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04942naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005200188245009900240300001200339506007600351520268100427592002803108596005903136596005903195596005903254596007603313506003703389650001903426650002003445650001903465650001203484650001303496650001903509650001803528650001303546650002103559650002803580650001603608650002003624650001203644650002603656650002003682650002203702650002203724650002303746650001503769650002203784650001503806650001603821650001003837650002403847650001003871650002003881650002503901650001303926650003703939700001103976700001503987700001604002700001804018773010504036856008204141852000904223655001204232IND60622043320221207070450.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062204332DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1492-12doi7 aPMC62477362pmcid7 a304635232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSui, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4339-430810aProteomic analysis of the response of Funnelifor mismosseae/Medicago sativa to atrazine stress  ap. 289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic associations with host plants can protect host plants against diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, and promote biodegradation of various contaminants. However, the molecular mechanisms of how the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and host plant association on atrazine stress were still poorly understood. To better characterize how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and host plant interactions increase atrazine stress, we performed physiological and proteomic analysis of Funneliformis mosseae (mycorrhizal fungi) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa) association under atrazine stress. RESULTS: The results showed that in the Arbuscular mycorrhizal, protective enzymes were up regulated and the malondialdehyde content increased relative to those of non-mycorrhizal M.sativa. We also examined the atrazine degradation rates within the nutrient solution, and a 44.43% reduction was observed with the mycorrhizal M.sativa, with 30.83% of the reduction attributed to F. mosseae. The accumulation content in root and stem of mycorrhizal M.sativa were obviously increased 11.89% and 16.33% than those of non- mycorrhizal M.sativa. The activity of PPO, POD, CAT and SOD in mycorrhizal M.sativa were obviously higher than non mycorrhizal M.sativa under atrazine stess. We identified differential root proteins using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantization coupled with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, with 533 proteins identified (276 unregulated and 257 downregulated). The differentially expressed proteins were further examined using GO, BLAST comparisons, and a literature inquiry and were classified into the categories of atrazine degradation (37.1%); atrazine stress response (28.6%); plant immune responses (14.3%); translation, synthesis, and processing (10%); and signal transduction and biological processes (10%). Furthermore, we identified glycosyl transferase, glutathione S-transferase, laccase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, peroxidase, and other proteins closely related to the degradation process. CONCLUSIONS: Mycorrhizal Medicago showed improved atrazine degradation within the culturing medium and increased atrazine enrichment in the roots and stems. Additionally, AMF increased the plant root response to atrazine, with relevant enzymes up regulated and toxic effects alleviated. Overall, the findings of this study show that AMF played an important role in easing atrazine stress in plants and contributed to atrazine remediation and further contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanism associated with atrazine stresses and potential mycorrhizal contributions in M.sativa.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570635cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31500431cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31270535cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aJC201306cOutstanding Youth Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlomus mosseae 3aMedicago sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aalfalfa 3aatrazine 3abiodegradation 3abiotic stress 3acatalase 3acytochrome P-450 3aglutathione transferase 3ahost plants 3aimmune response 3alaccase 3aliquid chromatography 3amalondialdehyde 3amass spectrometry 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient solutions 3aperoxidase 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aremediation 3aroots 3asignal transduction 3astems 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aWu, Qi1 aChang, Wei1 aFan, Xiaoxu1 aSong, Fuqiang0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.289-289dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1492-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245007800202300001800280520104900298592002801347650001001375650001401385650001401399650002301413650003001436650002201466650001501488650002301503650001301526650002201539700002601561700002201587773011101609856008201720852000901802655001201811IND60632494920221120181038.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-2174-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2547-007110aElectronic and optical properties of chromophores from hexeneuronic acids  ap. 1489-1501.  aWe report a systematic computational investigation on the electronic and optical properties of chromophores derived from hexeneuronic acids (HexA). In particular, we focus on five chemical structures, which account up to 90% of HexaA-derived chromophores. We performed all-electrons density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations with a localized Gaussian basis set and the hybrid exchange correlation functional B3LYP. We quantified key molecular properties relevant as electron affinities, ionization energies, fundamental gaps, optical absorption spectra, and exciton binding energies. Furthermore, we modeled the HexA chromophores in the presence of peroxide (H₂O₂) solvent and evaluated the changes in the optical properties due to the solvent. Altogether, our results provide a complete description of molecular, electronic and optical properties of HexA derived chromophores, which can be useful to understand their role in bleaching mechanisms and also their potential application as organic conductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3ableaching 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aionization 3aoptical properties 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis1 aCappellini, Giancarlo1 aDelogu, Francesco0 tCellulose.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 3 p.1489-1501dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-2174-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245015600206300001500362520153000377592002801907596007001935596008702005596016702092650001402259650001102273650001102284650002502295650002002320650001502340650001502355650001002370650002002380650001202400650001902412650001302431650002302444650001402467650001502481650001102496650001202507650001702519651002802536700006002564700002102624700002302645700001902668700006202687773012602749856008302875852000902958655001202967IND60768087920221118072016.0220225e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-022-00887-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalogh, Csilla1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5171-768010aContribution of invasive bivalves (Dreissena spp.) to element distribution: phase interaction, regional and seasonal comparison in a large shallow lake  ap. 91-111.  aAfter introduction, the invasive bivalve dreissenids became key species in the biota of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. The contribution of dreissenid soft tissue and shell, as biotic phases, in element distribution and its interaction with the water and upper sediment phases were examined in two basins with different trophic conditions in spring and autumn. Six metals (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in all investigated phases. In general, metals were abundant in the water and soft tissue in the eastern basin in spring, and in the sediment and shells in the western basin in autumn. This might be associated with the more urbanized surroundings in the eastern, and the enhanced organic matter production in the western basin. High relative shares of Ba, Cu, Mn, and Pb were associated with the water and shell samples, whereas high shares of Fe and Zn were noted in the soft mussel tissue and sediments. Results suggest that dynamics of metal uptake by dreissenids depend on the seasonal change in metabolic activity. Shell metal content is less changeable; shells might absorb metals from both the soft tissue and water phases. Metallothionein peptides, the scavengers of intracellular metals, were determined to be biomarkers of the bulk contaminants rather than only metals. The present study shows that invasive bivalves, with high abundance, filtering activity, and storing capacity can significantly contribute to element distribution in the shoreline of a shallow lake ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  aMAHOP-2.1.1.-2016-2017-00005cHungarian Fishery Operation Program  aGINOP-2.2.1-15-2017-00070cEconomic Development and Innovation Operational Program  aNKFIH-471-3/2021c“Establishment of a National Multidisciplinary Laboratory for Climate Change”, National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Hungary 3aDreissena 3aautumn 3abasins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomarkers 3aecosystems 3alakes 3ametallothionein 3amussels 3aorganic matter 3apeptides 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3ashorelines 3aspring 3atissues 3aurbanization 3aCentral European region1 aKobak, Jarosław1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7660-92401 aKovács, Zsófia1 aSerfőző, József1 aFaragó, Nóra1 aSerfőző, Zoltán1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8538-93040 tBiogeochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 158, no. 1 p.91-111dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-022-00887-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013000165300001400295520104900309592002801358650001401386650001501400650001401415650001601429650001101445650002201456650001501478650001301493650002201506650002201528650001801550651001001568653002401578653001901602653000801621653002001629653001401649653001901663700002401682773009101706856008401797852000901881655001201890IND60692669320221120110658.0200503e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hydres.2019.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunitha, V10aHydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater in and around Lakkireddipalli and Ramapuram, Y.S.R District, Andhra Pradesh, India  ap. 85-96.  aTo evaluate hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater for drinking & irrigation practices in and around Lakkireddipalli and Ramapuram, Y.S.R District, Andhra Pradesh, India, thirty groundwater samples were collected during March 2018. Most of the groundwater samples are above the safe limits of W.H.O standards. Groundwater is exceeding the permissible limits of TDS, TH, EC, chloride and sulphates. Geogenic and anthropogenic sources are the main contributing factors for fluoride and nitrate respectively. Rock dominance is the predominant hydrogeochemical factor controlling the water chemistry. Piper's diagram reveals that water is of mixed Ca Mg Cl type. Irrigational water quality indices reveal that majority of groundwater samples falls under the unsuitable category and application of this untreated irrigational water is harmful for the crops and decreases the crop yield. Hence more saline tolerant crops could be suggested to combat soil salinization and application of lime/gypsum may be suggested to bout the soil permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3acrop yield 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ahydrogeochemistry 3airrigation 3anitrates 3asoil permeability 3asoil salinization 3awater quality 3aIndia 0aGroundwater quality 0aPercent sodium 0aSAR 0aLakkireddypalii 0aRamapuram 0aY.S.R District1 aSudharshan Reddy, Y0 tHydroResearch.g2019 Dec., v. 2 p.85-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27265x2589-75787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydres.2019.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245019500167500001900362500002000381520131700401592002801718650002001746650002501766650001701791650003601808650001401844650001401858650002101872650001501893650001801908650001201926650001801938650001701956650003001973650001102003650001302014650001102027650001202038650001602050650001702066650001802083650001602101700001802117700002802135700001902163700002402182700002802206700001902234700003102253700002602284700003702310700007002347700005802417700005702475773013902532856007802671852000902749655001202758IND60726300320221119063042.0210203e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072630032DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2020008122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinisgalli, Chiara14aThe Beneficial Effects of Red Sun‐Dried Capsicum annuum L.

This study focuses on finding the peppers with the best antioxidant properties, which are evaluated on an experimental model of obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phytochemical profile and antioxidant activity are evaluated on several peppers obtained from the same cultivar at different ripening stages. Red sweet peppers show the highest content in polyphenols, β‐carotene, lycopene, and capsinoids, and demonstrate the best antioxidant activity in vitro. Mice fed a high fat diet are orally treated with an extract from these peppers (Capsicum annuum extract [CAE]) (1, 10, and 25 mg/kg/day). It promotes weight loss and improves plasma markers related to glucose and lipid metabolisms. CAE also ameliorates obesity‐associated systemic inflammation reducing the expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in adipose and hepatic tissues and improving the expression of different markers involved in the gut epithelial barrier function. These effects are associated with a modulation of the intestinal microbiome, which appears altered. CONCLUSIONS: The extract can be considered a new potential approach for the treatment of obesity, complementary to dietary restrictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical constituents of plants 3acultivars 3acytokines 3adigestive system 3aepithelium 3afood research 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipids 3alycopene 3amodels 3aobesity 3apolyphenols 3asolar drying 3asweet peppers 3aweight loss1 aVezza, Teresa1 aDiez‐Echave, Patricia1 aOstuni, Angela1 aFaraone, Immacolata1 aHidalgo‐Garcia, Laura1 aRusso, Daniela1 aArmentano, Maria Francesca1 aGarrido‐Mesa, José1 aRodriguez‐Cabezas, Maria Elena1 aRodríguez‐Nogales, Alba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1927-06281 aMilella, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5874-12371 aGalvez, Julio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6876-37820 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Feb., v. 65, no. 3 p.e2000812-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2020008123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245015100163300001800314520115400332592002801486650001701514650001601531650002001547650002201567650001301589650002501602650001401627653001701641653001401658653001601672653001501688653001401703700001901717700002901736700001201765773009801777856008401875852000901959655001201968IND60730741020221120071801.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073074102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yimin10aComparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes of Nirvanini and Evacanthini (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) reveals an explicit evolutionary relationship  ap. 1378-1385.  aMitogenomes of five leafhopper species, Chudania hellerina and Concaveplana rufolineata in Nirvanini, Carinata rufipenna, Evacanthus danmainus and E. heimianus representing Evacanthini, were sequenced. The lengths of these five mitogenomes range from 15,044 (C. hellerina) to 15,680 bp (E. heimianus). All five mitogenomes exhibit similar base composition, gene size and codon usage of protein-coding genes. All 22 tRNA genes have typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except for trnS1 (AGN) which appears to lack the dihydrouridine arm. The two included Nirvanini species employ the anticodon TCT instead of the commonly used GCT in trnS1 (AGN). Genes nad2, atp8 and nad6 were highly variable while cox1 and cob showed the lowest nucleotide diversity. Phylogenetic analyses of two concatenated nucleotide datasets, incorporating the newly sequenced taxa and other available membracoid mitogenomes, recovered each included leafhopper subfamily as monophyletic with evacanthine tribes Nirvanini and Evacanthini forming monophyletic sister clades. A relationship among Evacanthinae, Cicadellinae and Typhlocybinae received moderate branch support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicadellidae 3acodon usage 3adata collection 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 0aCicadomorpha 0aNirvanini 0aEvacanthini 0aMitogenome 0aPhylogeny1 aLiang, Zonglei1 aDietrich, Christopher H.1 aDai, Wu0 tGenomics.g2021 May, v. 113, no. 3 p.1378-1385dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245016900216300001600385520202100401592002802422650002602450650001302476650001102489650002002500650001802520650003002538651001302568653002002581653002602601653002402627653002202651653001502673653002802688653001902716700002202735700002202757700003302779700001702812700001702829700002102846700001902867700002102886700001802907773009402925856008703019852000903106655001203115IND60546695120221121224309.0170711e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054669512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoelker, Antje H.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6465-602310aMediterranean Outflow and surface water variability off southern Portugal during the early Pleistocene: A snapshot at Marine Isotope Stages 29 to 34 (1020–1135ka)  ap. 223-237.  aCentennial-to-millennial scale records from IODP Site U1387, drilled during IODP Expedition 339 into the Faro Drift at 558m water depth, now allow evaluating the climatic history of the upper core of the Mediterranean Outflow (MOW) and of the surface waters in the northern Gulf of Cadiz during the early Pleistocene. This study focuses on the period from Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 29 to 34, i.e. the interval surrounding extreme interglacial MIS 31. Conditions in the upper MOW reflect obliquity, precession and millennial-scale variations. The benthic δ18O signal follows obliquity with the exception of an additional, smaller δ18O peak that marks the MIS 32/31 transition. Insolation maxima (precession minima) led to poor ventilation and a sluggish upper MOW core, whereas insolation minima were associated with enhanced ventilation and often also increased bottom current velocity. Millennial-scale periods of colder sea-surface temperatures (SST) were associated with short-term maxima in flow velocity and better ventilation, reminiscent of conditions known from MIS 3. A prominent contourite layer, coinciding with insolation cycle 100, was formed during MIS 31 and represents one of the few contourites developing within an interglacial period. MIS 31 surface water conditions were characterized by an extended period (1065–1091ka) of warm SST, but SST were not much warmer than during MIS 33. Interglacial to glacial transitions experienced 2 to 3 stadial/interstadial cycles, just like their mid-to-late Pleistocene counterparts. Glacial MIS 30 and 32 recorded periods of extremely cold (<12°C) SST that in their climatic impact were comparable with the Heinrich events of the mid and late Pleistocene. Glacial MIS 34, on the other hand, was a relative warm glacial period off southern Portugal. Overall, surface water and MOW conditions at Site U1387 show a strong congruence with Mediterranean climate, whereas millennial-scale variations are closely linked to North Atlantic circulation changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3asurface water temperature 3aPortugal 0aIODP Site U1387 0aMediterranean Outflow 0aInterglacial MIS 31 0aContourite layers 0aInsolation 0aSea-surface temperature 0aExpedition 3391 aSalgueiro, Emilia1 aRodrigues, Teresa1 aJimenez-Espejo, Francisco J.1 aBahr, André1 aAlberto, Ana1 aLoureiro, Isabel1 aPadilha, Maria1 aRebotim, Andreia1 aRöhl, Ursula0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2015 Oct., v. 133 p.223-237dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001800270520096200288592002801250596009101278596007601369596008401445650001301529650001401542650002701556650003401583650001801617650001201635650002101647650002501668650002601693650001901719650001501738650002201753650003301775650002501808650002201833650002101855700005701876700001601933700001701949700001701966773011101983856008202094852000902176655001202185IND60632495220221120181004.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-2179-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ting10aMechanical performance and thermal stability of polyvinyl alcohol–cellulose aerogels by freeze drying  ap. 1747-1755.  aPolyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)/Gelatin hybrid organic aerogels were synthesized using a facile and environmentally friendly freeze-drying method.

The composites were characterized and analyzed by various techniques including uniaxial compression test, scanning electron microscopy, as well as thermal conductivity analysis and TGA–DTG analyses. The mechanical properties were strengthened significantly with the introduction of a small amount of gelatin. The modulus of PVA/CNF/G3 was 1.65 MPa, nearly eightfold of the PVA/CNF aerogel and 91 times higher than the neat CNF aerogel. Microstructure analyses revealed the three-dimensional network of the aerogels. The composites also possess good thermal stability, low density, and low thermal conductivity. Therefore they have broad prospects in the field of thermal insulation.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2018YFC0807603cNational Keypoint Research and Invention Program of the Thirteenth  aNo. 1604a0902175cAnhui Programs for Science and Technology Development  aGrant No. WK2320000035cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aaerogels 3acellulose 3across-linking reagents 3adifferential thermal analysis 3afreeze drying 3agelatin 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainsulating materials 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aCheng, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3334-92631 aPan, Yuelei1 aLi, Congcong1 aGong, Lunlun0 tCellulose.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 3 p.1747-1755dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-2179-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167300001600301520141000317592002801727650003401755650000901789650002901798650002501827650001201852650001701864650001101881650001601892650002001908650002101928650001101949650003201960650001601992650003702008650001502045650001402060650001302074653002002087653001002107653001802117653001602135653001902151700001902170700001802189700001702207700001502224700002202239773010302261856008602364852000902450655001202459IND60592438420221119112837.0190321e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059243842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jing10aHydromethanolic extract of Rehum emodi exhibits significant antimicrobial activity against acute gastroenteriti bacterial strains  ap. 179-182.  aRehum emodi is an important medicinal herbal and has been reported to exhibit tremendous pharmacological potential. The present study was designed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of hydromethanolic extract of rhizome of Rehum emodi against the acute gastroenteriti bacterial strains. The antimicrobial activity was determined by micro-dilution method. Antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH assay and cytotoxicity by MTT assay. Phytochemical analysis was carried out by LC/MS analysis. The results of the present study showed that hydromethanolic extract of rhizome of Rehum emodi (REE) exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the gastroenteriti bacterial strains. The MIC values ranged from 25 μg/ml to 125 μg/ml. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the REE was evaluated against the human breast cell line FR-2 and it was observed that REE exerted minimal cytotoxic effects on these cells with an IC50 of 250 μg/ml indicating that this extract is non-toxic to human cells. The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of several secondery metabolites such as anthroquinones (anthrone, emodin, aloe emodin and rhein) flavonoids (quercetin, and naringenin) and phenolics (sinapinic acid and gallic acid) which could potentially be responsible for the activity of the extract. In conclusion REE could potentially prove to be useful in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAloe 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abreasts 3acytotoxicity 3aemodin 3agallic acid 3agastroenteritis 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametabolites 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anaringenin 3aquercetin 3arhizomes 0aGastroenteritis 0aRehum 0aAntimicrobial 0aAntioxidant 0aPhytochemicals1 aWang, Ren-Ping1 aHou, Ming-Hui1 aLiu, Han-Yun1 aZhang, Han1 aJiang, Chang-Song0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Feb., v. 115 p.179-182dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245013200199300001800331500002000349506007600369520141900445592002801864506003701892650002901929650002101958650002001979650002401999650001302023650003002036650001702066650000902083650001602092650001402108650003002122650001502152650002402167650001502191650001302206650000902219650001802228650002202246650002002268650002102288650001102309700001402320700001702334700001702351700001702368700005802385773013402443856007302577852000902650655001202659IND60666303720221207054714.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630372DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.143612doi7 aPMC68526492pmcid7 a312303902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDucray, H.A.G.10aYeast fermentate prebiotic improves intestinal barrier integrity during heat stress by modulation of the gut microbiota in rats  ap. 1192-1206.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAIMS: To evaluate efficacy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentate prebiotic (EH) in protection of intestinal barrier integrity in rats during heat stress, to analyze the impact of heat stress and preventive treatment with EH on the structure of the gut microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two groups of rats were treated orally with EH or phosphate‐buffered saline for 14 days. On day 15, half of the rats in each group were exposed to heat stress conditions, while control animals were kept at room temperature. Histological and Western blot analyses of the intestine, culture‐based microbiological analysis and high‐throughput 16S rRNA sequencing for the gut microbiota were performed for each rat. Exposure of animals to heat stress conditions resulted in inhibition of tight junction (TJ) proteins expression, decrease of Paneth and goblet cells, decrease of beneficial and increase of pathogenic bacteria. Oral treatment of rats with EH before stress significantly prevents these adverse effects by elevation of the gut beneficial bacteria, particularly butyrate‐producing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Essential effect of EH in protection of intestinal barrier integrity during heat stress is connected with beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results will contribute to the development of new approaches to prevention of heat stress‐related complications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aWestern blotting 3aadverse effects 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3agoblet cells 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahistology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aoral administration 3aprebiotics 3aproteins 3arats 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atight junctions 3avirulent strains 3ayeasts1 aGloba, L.1 aPustovyy, O.1 aMorrison, E.1 aVodyanoy, V.1 aSorokulova, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5862-85250 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Oct., v. 127, no. 4 p.1192-1206dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.143613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008600170300001800256520161500274592002801889650001001917650000801927650001601935650001401951650000901965650002201974650003501996650001602031650001102047650001402058650001402072650003502086650003002121650002502151651001102176700002302187700002302210700002002233700002302253773014602276856008102422852000902503655001202512IND60520327820221119185515.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6063-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraouezec, Clélie10aCat serum contamination by phthalates, PCBs, and PBDEs versus food and indoor air  ap. 9574-9584.  aA wide variety of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with semi-volatile properties are emitted to indoor air and, thus, humans might get exposed to these compounds. Pet cats spend the major part of their lifetime at home and might integrate indoor contamination so that they could mirror the human exposure. Three classes of EDCs, polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and phthalates (PAEs), were simultaneously considered and quantified in the serum of cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in the Paris area (France). The main compound concentrations by decreasing importance order were as follows: for PAEs, di-n-butyl phthalate (79,900 ng L⁻¹) next di-iso-butyl phthalate (53,200 ng L⁻¹), di-iso-nonyl phthalate (43,800 ng L⁻¹), and di-ethylhexyl phthalate (32,830 ng L⁻¹); for PCBs, CB153 (1378 ng L⁻¹) next CB52 (509 ng L⁻¹), CB101 (355 ng L⁻¹), CB110 (264 ng L⁻¹), and CB118 (165 ng L⁻¹); and for PBDEs, BDE 153/154 (35 ng L⁻¹) next BDE47 (10.7 ng L⁻¹). Total serum concentrations as mean ± standard deviation were 107 ± 98 μg L⁻¹ for ∑9PAEs, 2799 ± 944 ng L⁻¹ for ∑19PCBs, and 56 ± 21 ng L⁻¹ for ∑9BDEs. The three chemical groups were found in cat food: 0.088 ng g⁻¹ for ∑9BDEs, 1.7 ng g⁻¹ for ∑19PCBs, and 2292 ng g⁻¹ for ∑9PAEs and in indoor air: 0.063 ng m⁻³ for ∑9BDEs, 1.5 ng m⁻³ for ∑19PCBs, and 848 ng m⁻³ for ∑9PAEs. Contaminant intake by food ingestion was approximately 100-fold higher than that by indoor air inhalation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFelis 3aair 3ablood serum 3abreathing 3acats 3adibutyl phthalate 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afood intake 3ahumans 3aingestion 3apet foods 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3astatistical analysis 3aFrance1 aEnriquez, Brigitte1 aBlanchard, Martine1 aChevreuil, Marc1 aTeil, Marie-Jeanne0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9574-9584dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6063-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010400169300001600273520131900289592002801608650000801636650001501644650002001659650002801679650000901707650001801716650001101734653001301745653001801758653004801776653004301824653003301867700001601900700002001916700002001936700002101956700002101977773009601998856008202094852000902176655001202185IND60553349820221119152106.0161021e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055334982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalczyk, Agata10aHydrogel with chains functionalized with carboxyl groups as universal 3D platform in DNA biosensors  ap. 222-228.  aApplication of hydrogel based on N-isopropylacrylamide with carboxyl groups grafted to the chains enabled the immobilization of DNA at an extent exceeding that for flat surfaces by at least one order of magnitude. The probe DNA strands in the 3D platform were fully available for the hybridization process. The examination of the gels containing different amounts of grafted carboxyl groups (1–10%) was done using quartz crystal microbalance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and ionic coupled plasma with laser ablation. The optimal carboxyl group content was determined to be 5%. A very good agreement of the data obtained with independent techniques on content of DNA in the gel was obtained. In comparison to the other methods of immobilization of DNA the new platform enabled complete removal of DNA after the measurements and analysis and, therefore, could be used many times. After a 10-fold exchange of the DNA-sensing layer the efficiency of hybridization and analytical signal did not change by more than 5%. The sensor response increased linearly with logarithm of concentration of target DNA in the range 1×10−13–1×10−6M. The obtained detection limit was circa 8×10−13M of target DNA in the sample which is a substantial improvement over the planar sensing layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3aquartz 0aHydrogel 0aDNA biosensor 0aElectrochemical quartz crystal microbalance 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aScanning electron microscopy1 aFau, Michal1 aKarbarz, Marcin1 aDonten, Mikolaj1 aStojek, Zbigniew1 aNowicka, Anna M.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 54 p.222-228dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015800175300001300333520102900346592002801375650001101403650001701414650003501431650001601466650002501482650003501507650001701542650001501559651001001574653000801584653000801592653000801600653003101608653001601639700002601655700002101681700003201702700002601734700002601760773008501786856008501871852000901956655001201965IND60692669720221120120443.0211129s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hydres.2020.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbijith, Devanantham10aGIS-based multi-criteria analysis for identification of potential groundwater recharge zones - a case study from Ponnaniyaru watershed, Tamil Nadu, India  ap. 1-14.  aGroundwater is one of the most vital natural resources; spatially varying in quality and quantity. Increased urbanisation and population creates tremendous pressure on the quality and quantity of the groundwater resources. In this study, Ponnaniyaru watershed of Cauvery basin was considered for this research. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) plays a vital role in preparing various thematic layers for targeting the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ). This study adopts the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi influence factor (MIF), multi-criteria decision-making approaches to determine the weights for the influencing factors. Weighted linear overlay analysis was carried out to determine the GWPZ. Further, the resultant GWPZ map has been reclassified into five different classes, namely Very good, Good, Moderate, Poor and Very poor. The results were validated with observed well-yield data, and the predictive precision for AHP and MIF was found to be 75%, and 71% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aIndia 0aAHP 0aMIF 0aGIS 0aGroundwater potential zone 0aPonnaniyaru1 aSaravanan, Subbarayan1 aSingh, Leelambar1 aJennifer, Jesudasan Jacinth1 aSaranya, Thiyagarajan1 aParthasarathy, K.S.S.0 tHydroResearch.g2020, v. 3 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27265x2589-75787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydres.2020.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245014300171300001600314500001500330520142600345592002801771650001301799650002401812650001501836650001701851650001901868650000901887650001601896650001901912650001201931650001801943650001501961650002601976650001302002650001302015650002502028650001102053650002402064650001402088650001502102650001002117650001302127650001302140653001502153700001802168700002002186700001702206700002402223773009002247856008502337852000902422655001202431IND4467918020221117065254.0141112e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446791802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2012.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreiman, Zohar E.10aPreharvest application of 1-methylcyclopropene inhibits ripening and improves keeping quality of ‘Brown Turkey’ figs (Ficus carica L.)  ap. 266-272.  a2019-12-06  aFresh figs are a very attractive commodity, but providing consumers with high quality fig fruit is a challenge. Fruit harvested too ripe has an extremely short postharvest life due to ethylene-induced over ripening, expressed as excessive softening, tissue maceration and exudation of syrupy liquid from the ostiole. The inhibitor of ethylene action 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) has been used successfully in various plant species to arrest the plant's response to elevated internal ethylene level. It has also been used in figs as a postharvest treatment, but it only partly slowed the ripening. We examined the effects of preharvest application of 1-MCP on ‘Brown Turkey’ fig fruit development on the tree and in storage. Right after treatment, ethylene production rate of 1-MCP-exposed fruit was six times that of the non-treated figs, but development of the treated fruit was delayed. At harvest, most of the figs in the 1-MCP-treated group were at commercial harvest maturity, while many of the control fruits had reached full ripening. During storage, senescence and spoilage of the 1-MCP-treated figs were slower and lower than in controls, as manifested by fruit color, firmness, internal texture, weight, size, shriveling, and decay. Thus 1-MCP applied on fig trees at the fig's pre-climacteric stage can delay the senescence of ‘Brown Turkey’ figs and improve their storage and transportation potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aethylene inhibitors 3ashelf life 3aFicus carica 3aplant response 3afigs 3afruit trees 3atransportation 3atexture 3afruit quality 3aharvesting 3apostharvest treatment 3aspoilage 3afirmness 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3afruits 3aethylene production 3aexudation 3amaceration 3acolor 3aripening 3afruiting 0asenescence1 aRodov, Victor1 aYablovitz, Zeev1 aHorev, Batia1 aFlaishman, Moshe A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2012 May 1, v. 138 p.266-272dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2012.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013200175300001400307520104400321592002801365650002101393650001101414650002001425650001701445650001601462650001201478650001801490651001001508653001701518653001601535653002501551653002401576700002401600700002201624700002601646700002001672700002501692700002601717700002201743700002101765700002201786773008601808856008501894852000901979655001201988IND60692669820221120110837.0211129s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hydres.2020.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaikwad, Satyajit K.10aAssessment of the groundwater geochemistry from a part of west coast of India using statistical methods and water quality index  ap. 48-60.  aThe study aims to identify the groundwater geochemistry and drinking water suitability through statistical and water quality index (WQI) approach in Kudal region of Sindhudurg district, Maharashtra, India. Twenty-two representative groundwater samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season in 2011. The analytical results depict the dominant order of cations as Ca > Na > Mg > K and for anions, HCO₃ > Cl > SO₄ > NO₃. Average concentration of Ca + Mg account for 65.51% in the pre-monsoon; while, in post-monsoon it is 63.84% demonstrating major cations sourced from olivine and pyroxene. Statistical analysis including cluster analysis, factor analysis and dendrogram were used to elucidate the association between water quality variables and the factors affecting water quality. WQI results show that 95.45% of samples represent excellent water; while, 4.55% indicate good water. Thus, it is confirmed that quality of groundwater is good to excellent and authenticate the suitability for drinking.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acoasts 3afactor analysis 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aolivine 3awater quality 3aIndia 0aGeochemistry 0aGroundwater 0aStatistical analysis 0aWater quality index1 aKadam, Ajaykumar K.1 aRamgir, Ritish R.1 aKashikar, Akanksha S.1 aWagh, Vasant M.1 aKandekar, Avinash M.1 aGaikwad, Suryakant P.1 aMadale, Ramdas B.1 aPawar, Namdev J.1 aKamble, Kishor D.0 tHydroResearch.g2020, v. 3 p.48-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27265x2589-75787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydres.2020.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245008600210300001600296520130000312592002801612596011701640650002301757650002501780650002501805650001001830650002101840650002201861700002001883773013601903856008302039852000902122655001202131IND60768088520221122052041.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-021-00642-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStetter, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2013-055310aGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Eco-Performance at Farm Level: A Parametric Approach  ap. 617-647.  aAgriculture is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus contributes considerably to global warming. However, farms can vary substantially in terms of their climatic impact. So far, most policies aiming at reducing GHG emissions from farming have largely been based on findings at the aggregate level, without taking farm heterogeneity properly into account. This study seeks to provide a better understanding of the GHG mitigation potential at the micro-level. We develop a comprehensible analytical framework for analyzing economic-ecological performance by way of stochastic frontier analysis. We introduce the concept of emission efficiency, where we distinguish between persistent and time-varying efficiency. We further analyze farms with respect to their emission-performance dynamics. Results from our (2005–2014) empirical application from Bavaria—an important region for the EU – show considerable differences in farm-level GHG emissions across different farm types. The same applies to emission efficiencies. Overall, emission performance improved over time. The results have important climate-policy implications as they help to provide better target measures for mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture, without compromising economic performance levels.  aPublisher supplied data  aBavarian Climate Research NetworkcBayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic performance 3aenvironmental policy 3afarms 3agreenhouse gases 3apollution control1 aSauer, Johannes0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2022 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.617-647dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-021-00642-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245007100202300001800273500002000291520215800311592002802469596005402497650001702551650002502568650001202593650001802605650001502623650002602638650000902664650002002673650001802693650001502711650001302726650002302739650001602762651001102778651001002789651002202799651001102821700006702832700006302899700006602962700006303028700006003091700006303151700005903214773013003273856007303403852000903476655001203485IND60666304020221120052959.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630402DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.129422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellino, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1554-332610aSeasonal patterns of biodiversity in Mediterranean coastal lagoons  ap. 1512-1526.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Understanding and quantifying the seasonal patterns in biodiversity of phytobenthos, macro‐zoobenthos and fishes in Mediterranean coastal lagoons, and the species dependence upon environmental factors. LOCATION: The study was carried out in the “Stagnone di Marsala e Saline di Trapani e Paceco,” the largest coastal lagoon system in the central Mediterranean Sea (Sicily, Italy), a Special Protection Area located along one of the central ecological corridors joining Africa and Europe. METHODS: The coastal lagoon system was selected as a model ecosystem to investigate the seasonal variations in biodiversity indices and dominance–diversity relationships in phytobenthos, macro‐zoobenthos and fishes, and how seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, depth, inorganic and organic suspended matter affect the abundance of the species constituting these communities. Models of ecosystem structure, describing the interactions among functional groups and environmental variables, were also developed using confirmatory path analysis and artificial neural networks to exemplify their application in predicting temperature‐driven alterations. RESULTS: Wide seasonal variations in biodiversity indices and dominance–diversity relationships across the communities of the coastal lagoon system were observed, driven by the dynamics in climate and resource availability. The effects of the environmental variables on taxon abundances varied in relation to the community, with the widest responses elicited in phytobenthos and fishes. Temperature was the main variable affecting taxon abundances in macro‐zoobenthos and was also the major driver of shallow water ecosystem structure. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This research shed light on the seasonal variations in biodiversity of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, elucidating also the tight dependence of phytobenthos, macro‐zoobenthos and fish diversity upon environmental factors. The findings and the methodological approach proposed may be crucial in developing models able to predict future climate‐driven alterations in communities inhabiting these important and threatened ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aC1-3.1-31cSicilian Region and Maltese Government 3abiodiversity 3abiological corridors 3aclimate 3acoastal water 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3aneural networks 3apath analysis 3aprediction 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3aAfrica 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSicily1 aMangano, Maria Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6980-98341 aBaldantoni, Daniela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-01071 aRussell, Bayden Dwight1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1282-99781 aMannino, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6419-70661 aMazzola, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8433-278X1 aVizzini, Salvatrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7127-75551 aSarà, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7658-52740 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1512-1526dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.129423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245011400186300001600300520124600316592002801562650003901590650001301629650001301642650002601655650001001681650001001691650001401701650001401715650001801729650002201747650001001769650001401779651001101793653003901804653002601843653001001869653001001879700003601889700002701925700003101952700002901983700003702012773010302049856008602152852000902238655001202247IND60592438820221119112827.0190207e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059243882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2018.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero, Jorge Antonio Varela10aIsolation and molecular characterization of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from sheep and goats in Mexico  ap. 304-309.  aThe pathogenic bacteria of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis caused a chronic contagious infectious disease of the caseous lymphadenitis or pseudotuberculosis. Globally, isolates obtained from different injuries that affect sheep and goats, have been identified by fully or partially gene sequencing. However, in Mexico there is no complete study to identify by molecular and phylogenetic techniques the circulating isolates as well as its virulence factors. Therefore, in the present study we reported the identification of 57 isolates of C. pseudotuberculosis by bacteriological tests and the amplification of 16S rRNA, rpoB and pld genes, as well as, genes involved in virulence and pathogenicity: Fag A, Fag B, Fag C, Fag D and hsp60. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the partial sequence of the rpoB gene. Genes involved in virulence and pathogenicity were identified in the 98.2% of the isolates. Regarding the phylogenetic analysis, were identified the species and subspecies to which they belong of all the tested isolates. The phenotypic and genotypic characterization will allow to establish preventive and prophylactic measures aimed to the creation of effective immunogens against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 3aantigens 3abacteria 3acaseous lymphadenitis 3agenes 3agoats 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3avirulence 3aMexico 0aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aSheep 0aGoats1 ade Oca Jiménez, Roberto Montes1 aAcosta Dibarrat, Jorge1 aLeón, Fernando Hernández1 aMorales-Erasto, Vladimir1 aSalazar, Humberto Gustavo Monroy0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Apr., v. 117 p.304-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154024002200173024001900195040001800214100006500232245008300297300001300380506007600393520125400469592002801723506003701751650002301788650000801811650001001819650001001829650001301839650002001852650001501872650001201887650002201899651001101921653002301932653001401955653001301969653001201982653001101994700003002005700003402035700004102069773011402110856008502224852000902309655001202318IND50071425120221207102544.0190403e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007142512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0022doi7 aPMC71174572pmcid7 a242164892pmid7 aPMC71174572pmcid7 a242164892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoutinho Costa, Erika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8155-339210aMolecular characterization of canine coronavirus strains circulating in Brazil  ap. 8-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo characterize canine coronavirus (CCoV) circulating in diarrheic puppies in Brazil, 250 fecal samples collected between 2006 and 2012 were tested. By using RT-PCR to partially amplify the M gene, CCoV RNA was detected in 30 samples. Sequence analysis of the M protein grouped eight strains with CCoV-I and another 19 with CCoV-II prototypes. To genotype/subtype the CCoV strains and assess the occurrence of single or multiple CCoV infections, RT-PCR of the S gene was performed, and 25/30 CCoV-positive strains amplified with one or two primer pairs. For 17/25 samples, single infections were detected as follows: six CCoV-I, nine CCoV-IIa and two CCoV-IIb. Eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype as follows: seven CCoV-I/IIa and one CCoV-I/IIb. Sequence analysis revealed that the CCoV-I and IIa strains shared high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. The Brazilian strains of CCoV-IIb displayed an aminoacid insertion that was also described in CCoV-IIb-UCD-1 and TGEV strains. Among the 25 CCoV-positive puppies, five had a fatal outcome, all but one of which were cases of mixed infection. The current study is the first reported molecular characterization of CCoV-I, IIa and IIb strains in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCanine coronavirus 3aRNA 3afeces 3agenes 3agenotype 3amixed infection 3aprototypes 3apuppies 3asequence analysis 3aBrazil 0aCanine coronavirus 0aEnteritis 0aGenotype 0aSubtype 0aBrazil1 aXavier de Castro, Tatiana1 ade Oliveira Bottino, Fernanda1 aNasser Cubel Garcia, Rita de Cássia0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 168, no. 1 p.8-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245014200206520155200348592002801900650002001928650001801948650001401966650001501980650001101995650001902006650002602025650001702051651001002068653002202078653003802100653004802138653003602186653001902222700001702241700001802258700001302276700001602289700001502305773011302320856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60753803320221121052154.0211114e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075380332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Zhimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8385-100810aEcological network analysis of the energy metabolic system under the revitalizing process: Insight from the case of Jilin province, China  aHow the Northeast Revitalization Plan is reshaping the socioeconomic and energy system of this rustbelt region in China remains unclear to date. In this study, an ecological network model based on environmentally extended input-output tables was developed to quantify the changes in the energy metabolic process of Jilin Province under the implementation of the revitalization policy from 2002 to 2012. The results showed that large investments under the revitalization policy triggered substantial increases in embodied energy consumption, from 314.25 Mtce in 2002 to 651.33 Mtce in 2012. The transportation equipment and chemical products sectors achieved evident scale expansion and strengthened their dominant influence on the energy metabolic system, indicated by the increase of both pulling and driving force indicators. However, the construction and service group sectors presented a stagnant energy consumption trend, which suggested that this revitalization process had failed to fuel urbanization and social development. In addition, the dominance of exploitation relationships among the sectors remained unchanged. The robustness index decreased from 0.32 to 0.28 due to the increase in redundancy and the decrease in efficiency in the system, which is an unfavorable trend for sustainable regional development. This research revealed the complicated effect of revitalization efforts on the energy metabolic system of a rustbelt region, which is informative for effective energy policy making as well as revitalization plan adjustment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembodied energy 3aenergy policy 3aequipment 3ametabolism 3amodels 3atransportation 3atrophic relationships 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aEnergy metabolism 0aEcological network analysis (ENA) 0aEnvironmentally extended input-output table 0aNortheast revitalization policy 0aJilin province1 aDuan, Haiyan1 aZhang, Lixiao1 aHao, Yan1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aXiong, Xin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 326 p.129356-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245004700174300001600221520077000237592002801007650001501035650002101050650001001071650001701081650001401098650001801112650003101130650001301161650002001174650001601194650001501210650002301225653001501248653002301263653002001286653001601306653001801322653001501340700001401355700001301369700001501382773007701397856009001474852000901564655001201573IND60584334620221118051513.0171024e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058433462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeztsinna, N.10aBioengineered riboflavin in nanotechnology  ap. 121-133.  aRiboflavin (RF) is an essential water-soluble vitamin with unique biological and physicochemical properties such as transporterspecific cell internalization, implication in redox reactions, fluorescence and photosensitizing.

We will point a special attention on the recent findings concerning RF applications in nanotechnologies such as RF functionalized nanoparticles, polymers, biomolecules, carbon nanotubes, hydrogels and implants for tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3ananoparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3aredox reactions 3aresearchers 3ariboflavin 3atissue engineering 0aBiosensors 0aTissue engineering 0aOptoelectronics 0aNanodevices 0aBioconjugates 0aRiboflavin1 aSolé, M.1 aTaib, N.1 aBestel, I.0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 80 p.121-133dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014700174520181000321592002802131650002002159650002002179650001302199650001202212650001102224650001502235650001902250650001602269650003702285650001902322651001902341653001702360653002802377653001502405653001902420653002502439653002502464700002202489700002402511773011902535856008702654852000902741655001202750IND60681436520221122063645.0200228e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068143652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2020.1041692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Martha E.10aWall ultrastructure of the Permian pollen grain Lueckisporites virkkiae Potonié et Klaus 1954 emend. Clarke : Evidence for botanical affinity  aPermian spore–pollen assemblages are dominated by striate bisaccate pollen grains. The botanical affinity of many of these is unknown, which limits their value in ecological reconstruction and biostratigraphy. Lueckisporites virkkiae Potonié et Klaus 1954 emend. Clarke 1965 is a bitaeniate bisaccate pollen grain of uncertain botanical affinity that dominates late Permian Euramerican assemblages, but also bridges phytogeographical provinces. It is classified into three “variants,” which capture a spectrum of morphological variability, but further complicates matters by questioning whether it comprises a natural taxon. Here we report on a TEM analysis of the gross structure and wall ultrastructure of L. virkkiae variants from the upper Permian (Lopingian) of Kimberley, Nottinghamshire, UK. The variants have the same gross structure and wall ultrastructure. The exine consists of a three-layered ektexine composed of a thin tectum, an alveolate infratectum and a thin foot layer, subtended by a solid endexine. Alveolae are either small and rounded, columellate-like, or irregularly shaped, depending on whether the exine is viewed in transverse or longitudinal section. Sacci are protosaccate, with narrow and irregular, or large and voluminous, endoreticulations. Similarities in gross structure and wall ultrastructure suggest that the current taxonomic grouping is correct with the variants representing the range of variation within a single species. We suggest that the differences in morphology are subtle and attributable to harmomegarthy. Comparisons with fossil and modern conifer pollen grains suggest an affinity with conifers. Co-occurrence with the Zechstein conifer macrofossil Pseudovoltzia liebeana (Geinitz) Florin 1880 (Majonicaceae) indicates this as a possible source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLopingian epoch 3abiostratigraphy 3aconifers 3afossils 3anexine 3apalynology 3aphytogeography 3apine pollen 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLate Permian 0aLueckisporites virkkiae 0aGymnosperm 0aSaccate pollen 0aExine ultrastructure 0aAlveolar infratectum1 aTaylor, Wilson A.1 aWellman, Charles H.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2020 Apr., v. 275 p.104169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2020.1041693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245015400174300001600328520180700344592002802151650003102179650002302210650001902233650002102252650002202273650001302295650001502308650001402323650001102337650001902348650002802367650001402395650002402409650001502433650002602448650001202474650001102486650001002497650001602507650001402523650001802537650001602555650001202571650002102583650002702604650005902631650006302690650003802753700001402791700001802805700001702823700001702840773018802857856007303045852000903118655001203127IND50073021620221117233550.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007302162DNAL7 a241381172pmid7 a10.1111/lam.121762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, P.K.10aOral administration of formalin killed Vibrio anguillarum cells improves growth and protection against challenge with Vibrio harveyi in banana shrimp  ap. 213-218.  aLarval rearing in hatcheries and highly intensive grow‐out culture practices followed in shrimp production systems favour the growth of potential pathogenic bacterial loads. This study reports the efficacy of formalin‐killed vibrio bacterin on growth, survival and protection to challenge with virulent Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio anguillarum in juveniles of banana shrimp Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. Postlarvae 15 (0·24 ± 0·01 g) were administered orally in different concentrations of bacterial preparation (0, 10⁶, 10⁸, 10¹⁰and 10¹² CFU kg⁻¹feed) for a period of 6 weeks. Physicochemical and microbial quality of water in larval rearing tanks, and growth and survival of the postlarvae were monitored at regular intervals, and body composition was estimated at the end of the experiment. Shrimps were challenged with V. harveyi and V. anguillarum, and cumulative mortality was calculated. The group receiving 10⁸ CFU kg⁻¹feed showed highest average weight gain (162·66 ± 22·94 mg) and survival (90·33 ± 4·5%) and lowest cumulative mortality following the challenge with V. anguillarum (26%) and V. harveyi (36·67%). The results of the study suggest that formalized vibrio administered orally to F. merguiensis postlarvae could induce both homologous and heterologous protection against V. anguillarum and V. harveyi. ‘Vaccination’ of shrimp postlarvae at hatcheries would help in preventing the losses due to vibriosis and the most susceptible stages of shrimp development. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study demonstrates the cross‐protection offered by the oral feeding of formalin‐killed Vibrio anguillarum against pathogenic V. harveyi challenge at the early developmental stages of banana shrimp, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFenneropenaeus merguiensis 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aVibrio harveyi 3abody composition 3aearly development 3aformalin 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3amortality 3aoral administration 3apostlarvae 3aproduction technology 3arearing 3ashrimp 3atanks 3avaccination 3avibriosis 3awater quality 3aweight gain 2aAnimals 2aCross Protection 2aFormaldehydextoxicity 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPenaeidaexgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aVibrioxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aGopal, C.1 aPanigrahi, A.1 aRajababu, D.1 aPillai, S.M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 58, no. 3 p.213-218dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Scientific Publications [c1985-]-x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.121763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010200199300001800301500002000319520212100339592002802460596005202488650001402540650002302554650002102577650001902598650001302617650001702630650001202647650001902659650001902678650003002697650001502727650002102742650002402763650001302787650001302800650001402813650001402827650001502841650001502856651001102871651002602882651001802908700005602926773013002982856007303112852000903185655001203194IND60666304220221120053029.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630422DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.129652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanahan, Alan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3001-682610aImpacts of 21st‐century climate change on montane habitat in the Madrean Sky Island Archipelago  ap. 1625-1638.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The Madrean Sky Island Archipelago is a North American biodiversity hotspot composed of ~60 isolated mountains that span the Cordilleran Gap between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Madre Occidental. Characterized by discrete patches of high‐elevation montane habitat, these “sky islands” serve as stepping stones across a “sea” of desert scrub/grassland. Over this coming century, the region is expected to shift towards a warmer and drier climate. We used species distribution modelling to predict how the spatial distribution of montane habitat will be affected by climate change. LOCATION: Madrean Sky Island Archipelago, south‐west United States and north‐west Mexico (latitude, 29–34°N; longitude, 107–112°W). METHODS: To approximate the current distribution of montane habitat, we built species distribution models for five high‐elevation species (Ceanothus fendleri, Pinus strobiformis, Quercus gambelii, Sciurus aberti, and Synuchus dubius). The resulting models were projected under multiple climate change scenarios—four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for each of three climate models (CCSM4, MPI‐ESM‐LR, and NorESM1‐M)—to generate predicted distributions for the years 2050 and 2070. We performed chi‐squared tests to detect any future changes to total montane habitat area, and Conover–Iman tests to evaluate isolation among the discrete montane habitat patches. RESULTS: While the climate models differ with respect to their predictions as to how severe the effects of future climate change will be, they all agree that by as early as year 2050, there will be significant montane habitat loss and increased montane habitat patch isolation across the Madrean Archipelago region under a worst‐case climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that under 21st‐century climate change, the Madrean Sky Islands will become increasingly isolated due to montane habitat loss. This may affect their ability to serve as stepping stones and have negative implications for the region's biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Arizona Center for Insect Science 3aCeanothus 3aPinus strobiformis 3aQuercus gambelii 3aSciurus aberti 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3ageographical distribution 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amountains 3aprediction 3ashrublands 3aMexico 3aRocky Mountain region 3aUnited States1 aMoore, Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4441-62030 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1625-1638dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.129653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006900171300001600240520173500256592002801991596006502019650002402084650002802108650001602136650001002152650001402162650001102176650003002187650001202217700002302229700002402252700006102276773013602337856008302473852000902556655001202565IND60768089020221122064728.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-021-00641-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHergueux, Jérôme10aLeveraging the Honor Code: Public Goods Contributions under Oath  ap. 591-616.  aPublic good games are at the core of many environmental challenges. In such social dilemmas, a large share of people endorse the norm of reciprocity. A growing literature complements this finding with the observation that many players exhibit a self-serving bias in reciprocation: “weak reciprocators” increase their contributions as a function of the effort level of the other players, but less than proportionally. In this paper, we build upon a growing literature on truth-telling to argue that weak reciprocity might be best conceived not as a preference, but rather as a symptom of an internal trade-off at the player level between (i) the truthful revelation of their private reciprocal preference, and (ii) the economic incentives they face (which foster free-riding). In truth-telling experiments, many players misrepresent private information when this is to their material benefit, but to a significantly lesser extent than what would be expected based on the profit-maximizing strategy. We apply this behavioral insight to strategic situations, and test whether the preference revelation properties of the classic voluntary contribution game can be improved by offering players the possibility to sign a classic truth-telling oath. Our results suggest that the honesty oath helps increase cooperation (by 33% in our experiment). Subjects under oath contribute in a way which is more consistent with (i) the contribution they expect from the other players and (ii) their normative views about the right contribution level. As a result, the distribution of social types elicited under oath differs from the one observed in the baseline: some free-riders, and many weak reciprocators, now behave as pure reciprocators.  aPublisher supplied data  aEUR grant ANR-17-EURE-0001cagence nationale de la recherche 3aeconomic incentives 3aenvironmental economics 3aexhibitions 3agames 3amaterials 3apeople 3apublic services and goods 3atesting1 aJacquemet, Nicolas1 aLuchini, Stéphane,1 aShogren, Jason F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3757-959X0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2022 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.591-616dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-021-00641-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012700162300001800289520109500307592002801402650001901430650001401449650001401463650000901477650000901486650001301495650001601508650001401524650001101538650001501549650001501564650002601579700001801605773014601623856008101769852000901850655001201859IND60520328620221119185516.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6205-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuan10aEnhanced photochemical decomposition of environmentally persistent perfluorooctanoate by coexisting ferric ion and oxalate  ap. 9660-9668.  aPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an environmentally persistent pollutant, was found to be quickly decomposed under 254 nm UV irradiation in the presence of ferric ion and oxalic acid. To understand the PFOA decomposition mechanism by this process, the effects of reaction atmosphere and concentrations of ferric ions and oxalic acids on PFOA decomposition were investigated, as well as decomposition intermediates. PFOA mainly decomposes via two pathways: (i) photochemical oxidation via Fe(III)-PFOA complexes and (ii) one-electron reduction caused by carboxylate anion radical (CO₂ •⁻), which was generated by photolysis of ferrioxalate complexes. Under excess oxalic acid, PFOA decomposition was accelerated, and its corresponding half-life was shortened from 114 to 34 min as ferric concentration increased from 7 to 80 μM. Besides fluoride ions, six shorter chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) bearing C₂-C₇ were identified as main intermediates. The presence of O₂ promoted the redox recycling of Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ and thus avoided the exhaustion of the Fe(III).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3afluorides 3ahalf life 3aions 3airon 3aoxalates 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhang, Pengyi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9660-9668dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6205-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009500175300001600270520188700286592002802173650002402201650002202225650001602247650001302263650000902276650001802285650002402303650002102327650001202348650001902360650001402379650001302393650002002406650002002426650001502446650001402461653002002475653001802495653002002513653000902533653001802542653001402560700001702574700001802591773010602609856008702715852000902802655001202811IND60552951520221120222808.0180830e20160620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055295152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRañjana, Rāhula,10aInterface versus bulk gelation and UCST in hydrophobically assembled TX-100 molecular gels  ap. 113-122.  aHerein, we report on a supramolecular TX-100-based molecular gel, which self assembles largely due to hydrophobic interactions, and we clearly distinguish between surface versus bulk gelation mechanism. The phase diagram of these salt-free solutions, and their gels were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), viscometry, rheology, and surface tension methods to map their microstructure, and thermo-viscoelastic properties. We demonstrate the spontaneous evolution of several hierarchical, but self-assembled soft matter phases starting from a homogeneous aqueous solution as it was gradually cooled from 60°C to room temperature (20°C). The Cole-Cole plot profile (loss versus storage modulus plot) indicated that this suspension produced the following three phases: (i) for [TX-100]<35% (v/v), homogeneous viscous solution; (ii) 35%<[TX-100]<60% (v/v), homogeneous gels, and (iii) [TX-100]>60% (v/v), heterogeneous melt. The system exhibited a clear UCST separating the sol and gel domains, and the proposed phase diagram embodied all the observed phases. The gelation time, and the free-energy of gelation were determined from surface tension, and viscosity measurements, they revealed that the self-assembly, and network formation at the air-liquid interface occurred at least 200s later than the bulk, a behaviour that was anomalous. The gelation phenomenon was discussed through homogeneous nucleation and growth model where the interfacial surface and volume free-energy governed the gelation kinetics. The gel state was dominated by structured water (characterized by Raman band at 3200cm⁻¹), whereas both in the solution, and in the melt phase there was propensity of partially structured water. It was concluded that aqueous TX-100 dispersions can yield a variety of soft matter phases rich in hierarchy, and dynamics, much of which is not probed hitherto.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3adispersions 3agelation 3agels 3agrowth models 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alight scattering 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3aoctoxynol 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3asurface tension 3aviscometry 3aviscosity 0aTX-100 gelation 0aSelf-assembly 0aSurfactant gels 0aUCST 0aPhase diagram 0aHydration1 aRawat, Kamla1 aBohidar, H.B.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 June 20, v. 499 p.113-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012100153300001600274520122500290592002801515650001001543650001101553650002301564650001501587650001101602650001301613650001201626650002701638651001201665700001601677700001301693700001901706773013101725856003801856852000901894655001201903IND50065026720221122192804.0130414e199908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006502672DNAL7 a10.2307/32371802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltesor, A.10aRelationship between spatial strategies and morphological attributes in a Uruguayan grassland: a functional approach  ap. 457-462.  aIn a native grassland in Uruguay subjected to continuous grazing by cattle, four permanent plots of 40 × 40 cm were established. Plots were divided into 16 × 16 cells and the presence of species was recorded seasonally during two years. The spatial dynamic of the dominant species was defined through three parameters: persistence, short‐distance spread and long‐distance spread. The association between the spatial strategies and certain morphological attributes that were presumed to be important to the spatial behaviour of the species, was examined using Correspondence Analysis. Four types of spatial strategies were observed: (1) persisting over the year in the same cell without showing any type of mobility; (2) continuously growing due to the solid advancing front of ramets, persisting or not persisting (3) in the same cells; and (4) multi‐strategy with high persistence and both high short‐ and long‐distance spread. Among the selected attributes, the erect/prostrate habit, the capacity of vegetative propagation by means of bulbs, rhizomes or stolons, the ratio length/width of leaves and the season of active growth were the characteristics most closely associated with the spatial strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulbs 3acattle 3acontinuous grazing 3agrasslands 3aleaves 3arhizomes 3astolons 3avegetative propagation 3aUruguay1 aPezzani, F.1 aGrun, S.1 aRodríguez, C.0 tJournal of vegetation science.g1999 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.457-462dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3237180  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245006000203300001600263500001500279506007600294520152600370592002801896506003701924650002301961650001901984650002302003650001402026650001902040650002002059650001202079650002002091650001702111650002102128650002102149650001402170650001302184650001702197650001402214650001902228650002002247650001402267650001602281650000902297650001702306650001902323653001602342700002502358700002302383773013302406856007702539852000902616655001202625IND60114524720221207073254.0141121e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452472DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0054472doi7 aPMC39517992pmcid7 a246187582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArts, Jennifer10aCoronary Heart Disease Risk Factors in College Students  ap. 177-187.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMore than one-half of young adults aged 18–24 y have at least 1 coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor and nearly one-quarter have advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The extent of atherosclerosis is directly correlated with the number of risk factors. Unhealthy dietary choices made by this age group contribute to weight gain and dyslipidemia. Risk factor profiles in young adulthood strongly predict long-term CHD risk. Early detection is critical to identify individuals at risk and to promote lifestyle changes before disease progression occurs. Despite the presence of risk factors and pathological changes, risk assessment and disease prevention efforts are lacking in this age group. Most young adults are not screened and are unaware of their risk. This review provides pathological evidence along with current risk factor prevalence data to demonstrate the need for early detection. Eighty percent of heart disease is preventable through diet and lifestyle, and young adults are ideal targets for prevention efforts because they are in the process of establishing lifestyle habits, which track forward into adulthood. This review aims to establish the need for increased screening, risk assessment, education, and management in young adults. These essential screening efforts should include the assessment of all CHD risk factors and lifestyle habits (diet, exercise, and smoking), blood pressure, glucose, and body mass index in addition to the traditional lipid panel for effective long-term risk reduction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aat-risk population 3ahyperlipidemia 3adisease prevention 3aadulthood 3ablood pressure 3aatherosclerosis 3aglucose 3arisk assessment 3ayoung adults 3acollege students 3acoronary disease 3ascreening 3aexercise 3arisk factors 3alifestyle 3arisk reduction 3abody mass index 3aeducation 3aweight gain 3adiet 3afood choices 3adisease course 0arisk groups1 aFernandez, Maria Luz1 aLofgren, Ingrid E.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 5, no. 2 p.177-187dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0054473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012700157300001800284520167800302592002801980650001702008650001402025650001402039650002802053650001902081650002402100650001302124650001702137650002102154650001102175650001102186650001802197650001902215650001002234650001702244650002302261650001302284700001502297700001402312700001402326700001702340700001702357700002102374700001402395773014202409856007402551852000902625655001202634IND60671276320221118180921.0191002e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127632DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00894h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Lingxin10aAutophagy in resin monomer-initiated toxicity of dental mesenchymal cells: a novel therapeutic target of N-acetyl cysteine  ap. 6820-6836.  aDental restorative biomaterials are commonly used to restore the teeth impaired by caries, erosion, or fracture. Resin monomers released from polymerized restorative composite materials could disturb cell viability and cause toxicity of oral eukaryotic cells, which remains a medical challenge. However, the intracellular processes or underlying mechanisms of resin monomer-mediated toxicity and the potential preventive/therapeutic strategy are still far from clear. The present study aimed to determine the role of autophagy in resin monomer triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA)-induced cytotoxicity and explore autophagy as a potential therapeutic target of anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in vitro and ex vivo. The results showed that TEGDMA exposure resulted in several specific features of autophagy in human dental mesenchymal cells (DMCs), including the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, appearance of autophagic vacuoles, and LC3-II accumulation. By pharmacological and genetic approaches, the inhibition of autophagy significantly prevented TEGDMA-induced apoptosis in DMCs. Moreover, the autophagy activated by TEGDMA occurred via the AMPK/mTOR pathway, which could be abrogated by NAC pretreatment. More importantly, the tooth slice organ culture model provided further evidence of autophagy involvement in TEGDMA-triggered dental mesenchymal tissue toxicity and as a therapeutic target of NAC ex vivo. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of resin monomer-mediated toxicity and highlight autophagy as a promising therapeutic target of NAC for improving dental restorative biomaterials that enable dental tissue protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abiocompatible materials 3acell viability 3acomposite materials 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3amodels 3aorgan culture 3apolymerization 3ateeth 3atherapeutics 3atriethylene glycol 3avacuoles1 aZhang, Jie1 aXiao, Lan1 aLiu, Shan1 aYu, Jingjing1 aChen, Weihai1 aZhang, Xianzheng1 aPeng, Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 3, no. 33 p.6820-6836dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00894h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012500163300001400288520042800302592002800730650001600758650001300774650001200787650001500799650001400814653001300828653001500841653001300856700002000869700002200889773014800911856007701059852000901136655001201145IND60522158920221120102603.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215892DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-01162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKühn, Norbert,10aÜber Komplexe des Typs {(PhC=C)3P}3M(CO)3 (M = Cr, Mo, W) / On Complexes of the Type {(PhC=C)3P}3M(CO)3 (M = Cr, Mo, W)  ap. 95-99.  aThe tris(alkinyl)phosphine complexes {(PhC=C)₃P}₃M(CO)₃, M = Cr (3a), Mo (3b), W (3c), are obtained from P(C=CPh)₃ and (C₆H₁₅N₃)M(CO)₃ (C₆H₁₅N₃ = 1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane) as stable yellow solids in good yields.

We successfully improved the classification of the selected Pinot noir wines by combining an untargeted 1D ¹H NMR analysis with a targeted peptide based differential sensing array. NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the chemical fingerprint of the wines, whereas the peptide-based sensing array is known to mimic the senses of taste, smell, and palate texture by characterizing the phenolic profile. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses of the combined NMR and differential sensing array dataset classified the genetically identical Pinot noir wines on the basis of distinctive metabolic signatures associated with the region of growth, vineyard, and vintage year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aclassification 3acoasts 3adata collection 3afood chemistry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apalate 3apeptides 3aphenolic compounds 3ascions 3asmell 3ataste 3atexture 3avineyards 3awines 0aNMR 0aDifferential sensing 0aChemometrics 0aWine 0aPinot noir 0aMetabolomics1 aZamora-Olivares, Diana1 aBhinderwala, Fatema1 aWoods, Jade1 aWinkler, Michelle1 aRivera, Sebastián,1 aShannon, Cassandra E.1 aWagner, Holden R.1 aZhuang, Deborah L.1 aLynch, Jessica E.1 aBerryhill, Nathan R.1 aRunnebaum, Ron C.1 aAnslyn, Eric V.1 aPowers, Robert0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129531-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1295313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011300163300001800276520114800294592002801442650001301470650001101483650001301494650002201507650001301529650001501542650002201557650001201579650001601591650001701607650001501624653001301639653002301652653001601675653001101691653002001702653002201722700002001744700001801764700001801782700005501800773013901855856007801994852000902072655001202081IND60595015320221119233539.0180526e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501532DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b167302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Dong Hee10aSemitransparent Flexible Organic Solar Cells Employing Doped-Graphene Layers as Anode and Cathode Electrodes  ap. 3596-3601.  aSemitransparent flexible photovoltaic cells are advantageous for effective use of solar energy in many areas such as building-integrated solar-power generation and portable photovoltaic chargers. We report semitransparent and flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) with high aperture, composed of doped graphene layers, ZnO, P3HT:PCBM, and PEDOT:PSS as anode/cathode transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs), electron transport layer, photoactive layer, and hole transport layer, respectively, fabricated based on simple solution processing. The FOSCs do not only harvest solar energy from ultraviolet–visible region but are also less sensitive to near-infrared photons, indicating semitransparency. For the anode/cathode TCEs, graphene is doped with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide or triethylene tetramine, respectively. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.12% is obtained from the fundamental FOSC structure, and the PCE is further enhanced to 4.23% by adding an Al reflective mirror on the top or bottom side of the FOSCs. The FOSCs also exhibit remarkable mechanical flexibilities through bending tests for various curvature radii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3aharvesting 3amaterials science 3aphotons 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3azinc oxide 0agraphene 0aorganic solar cell 0aflexibility 0adoping 0asemitransparent 0areflective mirror1 aJang, Chan Wook1 aLee, Ha Seung1 aSeo, Sang Woo1 aChoi, Suk-Ho1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7539-91060 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 10, no. 4 p.3596-3601dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b167303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012700156520102200283592002801305650001901333650002301352650002701375650002201402650002501424651001001449700001301459700001601472773012701488856007401615852000901689655001201698IND60652594920221119064026.0190713e20180821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065259492DNAL7 a10.3390/su100929772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Shiwei10aWhat Drives Policy Attention to Climate Change in China? An Empirical Analysis through the Lens of <i>People’s Daily</i>  aAddressing climate change requires sustained effort from all levels of society. Garnering and maintaining the attention of policy elites can be optimized through understanding what drives their attention to climate change. This study goes beyond the focus on democratic regimes to unravel the dynamics of attention to climate change in China. To do this, this study analyzed the content of articles published in People&rsquo;s Daily from 1985 to 2013. Drawing upon the information processing theory of policy dynamics, we used the time-series regression to examine the effects of information flows of different types on attention to climate change. We found that events such as important international conferences on climate change, domestic attention to environmental issues other than climate change, and pressure from abroad have a significant influence on attention to climate change in China. In addition, these factors were found to have different effects over time, which has received little attention to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aempirical research 3ainformation processing 3aissues and policy 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aXue, Lan1 aXu, Jianhua0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 21, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100929773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245016900196300001600365520153700381592002801918650001101946650001601957650001601973650001401989650000902003650002402012650002602036650001102062650002402073650001402097650001402111650001402125650004902139650006402188650001202252650003002264650000902294650001102303650003702314650004002351650005402391650003802445650003302483650005802516700001802574700002202592700002402614700002202638700002102660773012002681856005502801852000902856655001202865IND4470162420221118004910.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447016242DNAL7 a221035692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00670.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvillar, Brittany M10aEffect of epidural and intravenous use of the neurokinin‐1 (NK‐1) receptor antagonist maropitant on the sevoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) in dogs  ap. 201-205.  aObjective To determine the effect of maropitant, an NK‐1 receptor antagonist on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane after intravenous and epidural administration to dogs. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven, adult, spayed‐female dogs (24.8 ± 1.9 kg). Methods Each dog was anesthetized twice with sevoflurane in oxygen, with at least 10 days separating the anesthetic events. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane was determined using the tail‐clamp technique. During the first anesthetic event, the MAC of sevoflurane was determined initially and again after intravenous administration of maropitant (5 mg kg−1) and an infusion (150 μg kg−1 hour−1). During the second anesthetic event, an epidural catheter was advanced to the 4th lumbar vertebra and MAC was determined after administration of saline and maropitant (1 mg kg−1) epidurally. All MAC determinations were done in duplicate. The MAC values were adjusted to sea level and compared using student’s t‐test. Results The baseline MAC for sevoflurane was 2.08 ± 0.25%. Intravenous maropitant decreased (p < 0.05) MAC by 16% (1.74 ± 0.17%). In contrast, epidural administration of either saline or maropitant did not change (p > 0.05) the MAC (2.17 ± 0.34% and 1.92 ± 0.12%, respectively). Conclusion and clinical relevance Maropitant decreased the MAC of sevoflurane when administered intravenously to dogs but not after epidural administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanesthetics 3aantagonists 3acatheters 3adogs 3aexperimental design 3aintravenous injection 3aoxygen 3aprospective studies 3areceptors 3asea level 3avertebrae 2aAnesthesia, Inhalationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Inhalationxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aAnimals 2aAntiemeticsxpharmacology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aInjections, Epiduralxveterinary 2aInjections, Intravenousxveterinary 2aMethyl Ethersxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aNeurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists 2aPulmonary Alveolixchemistry 2aQuinuclidinesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology.1 aBoscan, Pedro1 aMama, Khursheed R1 aFerreira, Tatiana H1 aCongdon, Jonathan1 aTwedt, David C.,0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.201-205dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00670.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245004900164300001200213520061900225592002800844650003200872650001700904650001600921650001800937650001700955650001000972650001600982651001000998653002601008653001701034653001401051653001201065653001201077653001001089700001101099700001401110700001601124773011501140856008501255852000901340655001201349IND60535225820221119221326.0190403e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053522582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yuzi10aClassical swine fever in China: A minireview  ap. 1-6.  aClassical swine fever (CSF), caused by Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), is an OIE-listed, highly contagious, often fatal disease of swine worldwide.

Little is known, however, about the impacts of its spread in protected habitats of upland regions. This study was conducted to characterize the communities of plants and soil nematodes in ruderal forest habitats invaded and uninvaded by R. japonica in Tatra National Park, Slovakia. We hypothesized that invasion would reduce the diversity of native plant species, thereby affecting the nematode communities and their trophic structure. We found that invasion by R. japonica reduced the number and coverage of the native plant species and altered nematode communities and their structures. Total nematode abundance, species number and nematode biomass were significantly lower in invaded than uninvaded plots, but species diversity remained unaffected throughout the study. The overall abundance of all nematode trophic groups well represented the negative impact of R. japonica invasion on soil food webs, supported by low values of all maturity indices, a structural index and the Jaccard index of faunal similarity. A weighted faunal analysis similarly characterized the food webs of invaded plots as poorly developed or highly disturbed, with bacterial decomposition and a low C/N ratio. Our findings thus suggest that dense plots of knotweed simplify the structural complexity of the soil environment by reducing the richness of plant species, which may have contributed to the negative changes in the structures of the nematode communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aReynoutria japonica 3abiomass 3aedaphic factors 3aforests 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3anational parks 3asoil 3asoil nematodes 3aspecies diversity 3aSlovakia 0aInvasive plants 0aPlant communities 0aBiodiversity 0aForest1 aČerevková, Andrea1 aHomolová, Zuzana0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Apr., v. 26 p.e01470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e014703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245005600173300001200229520096300241592002801204650001301232650002701245650001501272650001301287650002001300650002501320650001201345650002101357700002201378700001901400773010501419856008201524852000901606655001201615IND60621482320221120234527.0181117e199512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148232DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826595016004082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBentley, Margaret E.10aChild-Feeding and Appetite: What Can Programmes Do?  ap. 1-9.  aFeeding is an ideal context in which to examine the interaction between biological development and cultural variability in international efforts to promote children's survival and health. The transition from liquid to semisolid and solid feeding is a major developmental milestone that occurs in the first year of life. Appetite is a central component in the decision making process used by caregivers to determine when and how much to feed their infants. Anecdotal, qualitative, and dietary consumption data provide evidence that both illness-related and chronic anorexia is an important problem among infants and young children in developing countries. For example, nutrition programme personnel have noted that children simply do not appear to be hungry or to eat all that is offered to them, even if they are clearly undernourished. Following the UNICEF triple-A framework, this paper describes programme strategies to improve child-feeding and appetite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia 3abiological development 3acaregivers 3achildren 3adecision making 3adeveloping countries 3ainfants 3aphase transition1 aBlack, Maureen M.1 aHurtado, Elena0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.1-9dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826595016004083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100002200187245007000209300001400279500001400293506007600307520143700383592002801820506003701848650001201885650001201897650001401909650001601923650001401939653002101953653002401974653003201998653001302030700002502043700002102068700001802089700001902107700002402126773009302150856008102243852000902324655001202333IND60693265320221207115125.0210116e20120517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069326532DNAL7 aPMC33610872pmcid7 a226793862pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.195.23422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Jeremy A.14aThe velvet spiders: an atlas of the Eresidae (Arachnida, Araneae)  ap. 1-144.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe family Eresidae C. L. Koch, 1850 is reviewed at the genus level. The family comprises nine genera including one new genus. They are: Adonea Simon, 1873, Dorceus C. L. Koch, 1846, Dresserus Simon, 1876, Eresus Walckenaer, 1805, Gandanameno Lehtinen, 1967, Loureedia gen. n., Paradonea Lawrence, 1968, Seothyra Purcell, 1903, and Stegodyphus Simon, 1873. A key to all genera and major lineages is provided along with corresponding diagnoses, as well as descriptions of selected species. These are documented with collections of photographs, scanning electron micrographs, and illustrations. A new phylogeny of Eresidae based on molecular sequence data expands on a previously published analysis. A species of the genus Paradonea Lawrence, 1968 is sequenced and placed phylogenetically for the first time. New sequences from twenty Gandanameno Lehtinen, 1967 specimens were added to investigate species limits within the genus. The genus Loureedia gen. n. is proposed to accommodate Eresus annulipes Lucas, 1857. Two species, Eresus semicanus Simon, 1908 and Eresus jerbae El-Hennawy, 2005, are synonymized with Loureedia annulipes comb. n. One new species, Paradonea presleyi sp. n. is described. Eresus algericus El-Hennawy, 2004 is transferred to Adonea Simon, 1873. The female of Dorceus fastuosus C. L. Koch, 1846 is described for the first time. The first figures depicting Paradonea splendens (Lawrence, 1936) are presented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAraneae 3afemales 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 0aladybird spiders 0amolecular phylogeny 0aspinneret spigot morphology 0ataxonomy1 aGriswold, Charles E.1 aScharff, Nikolaj1 aRezac, Milan,1 aSzűts, Tamás1 aMarhabaie, Mohammad0 tZooKeys.g2012 May 17, v. 195 p.1-144dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.195.23423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245012600161520130300287592002801590650001301618650001801631650000901649650002001658650001501678650003101693650002301724650001101747650002401758700001901782700002501801700002401826773012101850856007601971852000902047655001202056IND60760557320221122134259.0211223e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076055732DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111235662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aServa, Lorenzo 10aAssessment of the Effectiveness of a Portable NIRS Instrument in Controlling the Mixer Wagon Tuning and Ration Management  aThe adoption of the mixer wagon and total mixed ration aimed to decrease dysmetabolic diseases and improve feed efficiency in dairy cows. Differences between theoretical and eaten diets are imputable to errors in diet preparation or cow feed sorting. We proposed a method to measure the chemical composition and particle size distribution of the ration and determined its peNDF content through a portable Near Infra-Red spectrophotometer that allowed the calculation of two indexes: the homogeneity and the sorting indexes. In a cohort of 19 Italian Holstein breeding farms, we studied the correlation of these indexes with the mixer wagon settings. Determination coefficients in the validation (Rᵥ²) for dry matter, crude protein, aNDF, and starch were 0.91, 0.54, 0.86, and 0.67, respectively. The ration fractions (%, w/w of wet weight) retained by the 3.8 and 1.8 mm sieves, and the bottom showed Rᵥ² of 0.46, 0.49, and 0.53, respectively.

This fat metabolism is characterized specifically by an increase in the concentration of plasma lipids, primarily triglycerides. Increased postprandial lipemia, which is typically observed in older individuals (i.e., >65 y old), has now emerged as an important correlate of cardiovascular disease risk. An understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the increased postprandial lipemia in older individuals becomes, therefore, of particular clinical importance in any effort to explain and address the well-documented increase in cardiovascular disease risk as individuals age. Current evidence points to an increase in the accumulation of ingested lipid in lipoprotein particles of hepatic origin, together with an overall accumulation of lipid in these lipoproteins during the postprandial period, as primary contributors to the postprandial lipemia in older persons. When this evidence is considered together with the evidence suggesting large atherogenic potential of lipoproteins of hepatic origin, this can, at least in part, explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in older individuals. Understanding changes in the metabolism of ingested fat in the immediate postprandial period with advancing age, and how lifestyle interventions such as diet and physical exercise can ameliorate the increase in postprandial lipemia in older individuals, is important in order to address the increased cardiovascular disease risk in this particularly affected and growing segment of the population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3aelderly 3adiet 3ablood lipids 3aexercise 3acardiovascular diseases 3ahyperlipidemia 3aat-risk population 3alipoproteins 3alipid metabolism 3atriacylglycerols 3alifestyle 0arisk groups0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 May, v. 5, no. 3 p.226-234dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0049033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04042naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245019400160300001600354520227100370592002802641650002002669650002102689650001102710650000902721650001102730650001802741650002002759650002702779650002602806650001502832650001302847650002402860650002102884650001302905650001502918650001602933650001802949650001002967650000902977650001502986651001203001651002403013653001203037653001303049653001603062653001703078653001703095653002103112653001803133653001703151700001903168700001703187700001903204773012003223856007603343852000903419655001203428IND60517180220221123020752.0160329s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051718022DNAL7 a10.4141/cjss2011-0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, J.

Accumulation and redistribution of residual chloride, nitrate, and soil test phosphorus in soil profiles amended with fresh and composted cattle manure containing straw or wood-chip bedding. Can. J. Soil Sci. 91: 969–984. Limited research has compared the effect of fresh versus composted beef (Bos taurus) cattle feedlot manure containing straw or wood chips on accumulation and redistribution of residual chloride (Cl), NO₃-N, and soil test P (STP) in soil profiles of the Great Plains region of North America. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown (1999–2007) on an irrigated clay loam soil in southern Alberta where organic amendments and fertilizer were annually applied for 9 yr from 1998 to 2006. The field experiment was a factorial arrangement of two manure types (fresh versus composted feedlot manure), two bedding materials (straw versus wood-chips), and three application rates (13, 39, 77 Mg ha⁻¹ dry wt). There was also one inorganic (IN) fertilizer treatment and an unamended control. The soil profile (0–1.5 m) was sampled in the fall of 1999 to 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2007 and analyzed for residual soil NO₃-N, Cl, and STP. Manure type had a significant (P≤0.05) effect on the accumulation of these chemicals, but there was an interaction with application rate (NO₃-N), or with bedding and year (STP). The maximum accumulation of Cl after 9 yr was at the 0.6 to 0.9 m depth, but mean values at this depth were similar for the four organic amendments. The maximum accumulation of NO₃-N after 9 yr (2007) was at the 0.3 to 0.6 m depth, and mean values at this depth were significantly greater by four- to sixfold for FM and CM with straw than wood-chips, which suggested greater N immobilization in soils with wood. Redistribution of Cl and NO₃-N downward into the soil profile suggested a potential for leaching of these chemicals below the root zone. In contrast, soil test P did not accumulate below the 0.3 m depth, suggesting little potential for leaching. However, accumulation of soil test P at this depth was generally greater for the amendment treatments compared with inorganic fertilizer and was likely related to greater P applied in the amendments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aapplication rate 3abarley 3abeef 3acattle 3acattle manure 3aclay loam soils 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3airrigation 3aleaching 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3asoil profiles 3astraw 3awood 3awood chips 3aAlberta 3aGreat Plains region 0aNitrate 0achloride 0asoil test P 0aaccumulation 0afresh manure 0acomposted manure 0astraw bedding 0awood bedding1 aBeasley, B.

Histopathological examination revealed inclusions in the kidney of the captive Gouldian finch in the United States, and virions morphologically consistent with adenoviruses were seen by electron microscopy. Partial sequence of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene was gained by consensus PCR and sequencing in all six finches, and all proved to be identical. In one Hungarian finch, additional sequence was obtained from the DNA polymerase gene, the pre-terminal protein (pTP) gene, the 52k gene, and the hexon gene. Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and distance-based analyses showed the novel virus clusters with the siadenoviruses, and is herein referred to as Gouldian finch adenovirus 1. The genes looked at in this study had low G+C percentages, which is common in the genus Siadenovirus, and suggestive of recent host switch.

In this report, we have identified and characterized a transcription factor, D. antarctica C-repeat binding factor 7 (DaCBF7), that is a member of the monocot group V CBF homologs. The protein contains a single AP2 domain, a putative nuclear localization signal, and the typical CBF signature. DaCBF7, like other monocot group V homologs, contains a distinct polypeptide stretch composed of 43 amino acids in front of the AP2 motif. DaCBF7 was predominantly localized to nuclei and interacted with the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element (CRT/DRE) core sequence (ACCGAC) in vitro. DaCBF7 was induced by abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, and salinity. To investigate its possible cellular role in cold tolerance, a transgenic rice system was employed. DaCBF7-overexpressing transgenic rice plants (Ubi:DaCBF7) exhibited markedly increased tolerance to cold stress compared to wild-type plants without growth defects; however, overexpression of DaCBF7 exerted little effect on tolerance to drought or salt stress. Transcriptome analysis of a Ubi:DaCBF7 transgenic line revealed 13 genes that were up-regulated in DaCBF7-overexpressing plants compared to wild-type plants in the absence of cold stress and in short- or long-term cold stress. Five of these genes, dehydrin, remorin, Os03g63870, Os11g34790, and Os10g22630, contained putative CRT/DRE or low-temperature responsive elements in their promoter regions. These results suggest that overexpression of DaCBF7 directly and indirectly induces diverse genes in transgenic rice plants and confers enhanced tolerance to cold stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDeschampsia antarctica 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acids 3acoasts 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3anuclear localization signals 3apolypeptides 3apromoter regions 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3aAntarctic region 0aAP2 0aCaMV 0aCBF 0aCDPK 0aCRT 0aDEG 0aDRE 0aFDR 0aGO 0aLTRE 0aMAPK 0aNLS 0aqRT-PCR 0aRNA-seq 0aRPKM 0asGFP 0aUbi 0aC-repeat/DRE binding factor 0aCold stress tolerance 0aDeschampsia antarctica 0aRNA-seq analysis 0aTransgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plant1 aLee, Jungeun1 aCui, Li Hua1 aKang, Yoonjee1 aOh, Tae Kyung1 aPark, Hyun1 aLee, Hyoungseok1 aKim, Woo Taek0 tPlant science.g2015 July, v. 236 p.61-74dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011500165300001800280520176000298592002802058650001002086650001702096650001202113650001702125650001902142650001602161650002602177650003102203650001402234650001602248650001902264650001502283650002102298650001402319650001302333650000702346650001902353650003302372650001602405650003702421700002302458700001802481700001802499700002102517700002002538773014202558856007402700852000902774655001202783IND60671276920221118180102.0191002e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127692DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00907c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaćkiewicz, Marcin,10aStable and degradable microgels linked with cystine for storing and environmentally triggered release of drugs  ap. 7262-7270.  aEnvironmentally sensitive, degradable microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPA) cross-linked with the diacryloyl derivative of cystine (BISS) were synthesized by applying surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. pNIPA contributed the sensitivity to temperature to the microgels and the cross-linker made them degradable and sensitive to pH. The morphology of the microgels was investigated by using scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM). The gels formed spherical particles with a narrow size distribution. The influence of temperature, pH and ionic strength on the swelling behavior and the stability of new microgels with various contents of BISS (0, 1 and 3%) were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). It was found that microgels with 3% content of amino acid were highly stable over a wide range of investigated temperatures, pH values and ionic strengths, including the physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, IS = 0.15 M, and 37 °C). The reduction-induced degradation of these microgels by 0.01 M solution of dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione (GSH) was studied by means of SEM and TEM; the obtained micrographs showed the destruction of spherical microgel particles. The microgels containing 3% of BISS could be loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) by employing the electrostatic interactions between the DOX amine group and the ionized carboxyl group from BISS. A significant increase in the cumulative release of DOX was observed after changing pH from that characteristic to blood (∼7.4) to that existing in affected cells (∼5.0) and in the presence of GSH (CGSH ∼ 10 mM). The cytotoxicity tests proved that the obtained microgels are interesting as useful carriers in directed drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acrosslinking 3acystine 3acytotoxicity 3adithiothreitol 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsions 3aglutathione 3aionic strength 3aionization 3alight scattering 3amicrogels 3amoieties 3apH 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKaniewska, Klaudia1 aRomanski, Jan1 aAugustin, Ewa1 aStojek, Zbigniew1 aKarbarz, Marcin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 3, no. 36 p.7262-7270dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00907c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01475naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014600162300001600308520039300324592002800717650002300745650002300768650001200791650001400803650001200817653001200829653001400841653002100855700002300876700001400899773013800913856007701051852000901128655001201137IND60522159520221121031529.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215952DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-10032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunner, Henri10aEnantioselective Catalysis, 139 [1].

Herein, a novel immunoassay for quantitation of AK was developed using the antibody modified gold nanoparticle (AuNP) and quantum dot (QD). When the first antibody modified AuNP (AuNP-Ab1) was bridged by AK with the secondary antibody modified QD (QD-Ab2), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) would occur between the AuNP and QD, which led to a decrease in fluorescent signals. The decrease in fluorescence intensity was found to correlate linearly with the log of AK concentration in the range of 1.0 × 10⁻⁶-1.0 × 10⁻³ mg/mL (R² = 0.9909) and the detection limit was 0.11 ng/mL. The immunoassay was further proved to have encouraging specificity, precision and accuracy. Compared with existing methods, this study provided a promising approach to develop a highly sensitive and selective detection method for AK in shrimp related food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aantibodies 3aarginine kinase 3adetection limit 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afood chemistry 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3aprecision 3aquantum dots 3ashrimp 0aImmunosensor 0aArginine kinase 0aFRET 0aAntigen–antibody interaction1 aMa, Junjie1 aLi, Huan1 aZhou, Jinru1 aZhang, Hong1 aFu, Linglin0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129536-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1295363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010700207300002200314520104400336592002801380650001101408650001201419650001001431650001301441650002201454650001201476650001401488650002301502653000901525653002001534653002001554653001501574700006001589700005701649700006101706700007201767700006001839773010301899856004902002852000902051655001202060IND60756437520221116162445.0211114e20211111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075643752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGospocic, Janko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6716-852410aKr-h1 maintains distinct caste-specific neurotranscriptomes in response to socially regulated hormones  ap. 5807-5823.e14.  aBehavioral plasticity is key to animal survival. Harpegnathos saltator ants can switch between worker and queen-like status (gamergate) depending on the outcome of social conflicts, providing an opportunity to study how distinct behavioral states are achieved in adult brains. Using social and molecular manipulations in live ants and ant neuronal cultures, we show that ecdysone and juvenile hormone drive molecular and functional differences in the brains of workers and gamergates and direct the transcriptional repressor Kr-h1 to different target genes. Depletion of Kr-h1 in the brain caused de-repression of “socially inappropriate” genes: gamergate genes were upregulated in workers, whereas worker genes were upregulated in gamergates. At the phenotypic level, loss of Kr-h1 resulted in the emergence of worker-specific behaviors in gamergates and gamergate-specific traits in workers. We conclude that Kr-h1 is a transcription factor that maintains distinct brain states established in response to socially regulated hormones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimals 3abrain 3aecdysone 3ajuvenile hormones 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3arepressor proteins 0aants 0asocial behavior 0agene regulation 0aplasticity1 aGlastad, Karl M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-18211 aSheng, Lihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8227-18561 aShields, Emily J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0438-89221 aBerger, S.

The chemoselectivity was confirmed by using p-tolylethyne as a model substrate to screen a variety of iodine sources and/or the hypervalent-iodine reagents. A combination of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (PIDA) selectively generates 1-iodoalkynes, while a combination of KI and PIDA generates 1,2-diiodoalkenes. A one-pot synthesis based on both TBAI-PIDA and KI-PIDA yields the corresponding 1,1,2-triiodoalkenes. These protocols were subsequently applied to the synthesis of synthetically important aromatic and aliphatic 1-iodoalkynes, 1,2-diiodoalkenes, and 1,1,2-triiodoalkenes, which were obtained in good yield with excellent chemoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3achemoselectivity 3aiodination 3aiodine 3amodels 3asynthesis 3atetrabutylammonium compounds1 aHuang, Daya1 aHuang, Ju1 aLiu, Yan1 aMaruoka, Keiji0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Sept. 12, , no. 139 p.e58063-e58063dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580633Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58063/chemoselective-preparation-1-iodoalkynes-12-diiodoalkenes-112  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001700175245014500192300001400337520191400351592002802265650001302293650001802306650001202324650002002336650001602356650001502372650002702387650001902414650001602433650002602449650001902475650001202494650000902506650001302515650001802528650001502546650001402561650002502575650003202600650001802632650001002650650001902660650001402679653001802693653001802711653003102729700002502760700001602785700002302801700002102824700002002845773012702865856008102992852000903073655001203082IND60650539020221120120549.0190710e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065053902DNAL7 a30729900 307299002pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299190000622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicek, Piotr13aAn energy-protein feed additive containing different sources of fat improves feed intake and milk performance of dairy cows in mid-lactation  ap. 55-62.  aThis research paper addresses the hypothesis that calcium salts combined with whole linseed and heat-treated rapeseed cake in one feed additive may efficiently stimulate the productivity of dairy cows and have a positive effect on the functional (health-promoting) properties of milk fat. The article proposes the composition of such an additive (EFA) and evaluates its nutritional effect in the diet of mid-lactation dairy cows. Forty multiparous Polish Holstein-Friesian (PHF) dairy cows were allocated to one of four treatments (10 cows/treatment) and fed a TMR diet without EFA or with EFA in the amount of 1, 2 or 3 kg/d per head for a 63-d-period. Individual intake of dry matter (DMI) and nutrients was determined, as was milk yield and composition, including fatty acid profile, fat soluble vitamins, cholesterol and phospholipids (PLs). Irrespective of the treatment group, cows fed diets with EFA had higher (P < 0.05) DMI, milk yield and milk vitamin D₃ and K₂ concentration but lower (P < 0.01) milk protein, fat and cholesterol contents. The additive did not affect the milk concentrations of β-carotene or vitamin A or E. The PLs content was correlated with fat concentration in the milk and decreased as the level of EFA in the diet increased. An increase in phosphatidylcholine in total PLs was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of sphingomyelin (P < 0.05). The use of EFA increased the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the total fatty acids in the milk. The addition of EFA in the amount of 3 kg increased the proportion of PUFA by 77% (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use of an energy-protein feed additive (EFA) increases feed intake and milk yield in cows and alters milk fat composition, improving its functional properties. Higher milk production compensates for the decrease in solids concentration in the milk, which has no effect on their daily yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abeta-carotene 3acalcium 3acholecalciferol 3acholesterol 3adairy cows 3afatty acid composition 3afeed additives 3afeed intake 3afunctional properties 3aheat treatment 3alinseed 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk proteins 3amilk yield 3anutrients 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arapeseed cake 3asalts 3asphingomyelins 3avitamin A 0aCalcium salts 0afeed additive 0amilk yield and composition1 aKowalski, Zygmunt M.1 aSady, Marek1 aOprządek, Jolanta1 aDomagała, Jacek1 aWanat, Patrycja0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Feb., v. 86, no. 1 p.55-62dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299190000623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008700171500002200258520117100280592002801451650003501479650001701514650001101531650001501542650001301557650002501570650001301595653001901608653003501627653001701662653001501679653001301694653002601707700002001733700001901753700005801772773007001830856008401900852000901984655001201993IND60524619720221121072415.0160724s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052461972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2016.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariana, Melissa14aThe effects of phthalates in the cardiovascular and reproductive systems: A review  aPre-press version  aEvery year millions of tons of plastic are produced around the world and humans are increasingly exposed to them. This constant exposure to plastics has raised some concerns against human health, particularly when it comes to phthalates. These compounds have endocrine-disrupting properties, as they have the ability to bind molecular targets in the body and interfere with hormonal function and quantity. The main use of phthalates is to give flexibility to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymers. Phthalates are found in a variety of industrial and consumer products, and as they are not covalently bound to the plastic, phthalates contaminate the environment from which human exposure occurs. Studies in human and animal populations suggest a correlation between phthalate exposure and adverse health outcomes, particularly at the reproductive and cardiovascular systems, however there is much less information about the phthalate toxicity of the later. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to present the studies relating the effects already stated of phthalates on the cardiovascular and reproductive systems, and also present the link between these two systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aphthalates 3aplastics 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3atoxicity 0aCardiotoxicity 0aEndocrine-disrupting compounds 0aHuman health 0aPhthalates 0aPlastics 0aReproductive toxicity1 aFeiteiro, Joana1 aVerde, Ignacio1 aCairrao, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4823-57010 tEnvironment international.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008200157300002000239520046000259592002800719650002100747650001500768650001300783650001300796650001400809650001300823650002100836700001800857700001800875700001700893700002000910773014300930856007401073852000901147655001201156IND60671096520221118191000.0191002e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067109652DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01718a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEom, Ji-Yong10aBlack titanium oxide nanoarray electrodes for high rate Li-ion microbatteries  ap. 11183-11188.  aBlack TiO₂₋ₓ nanotube arrays, which are synthesized by an electrochemical method and subsequent thermal conversion in a hydrogen atmosphere, are employed as binder-free, free-standing electrodes for high rate Li-ion microbatteries.

Here we present an atomic model of the 48-nm repeat of a mammalian DMT, derived from a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) map of the complex isolated from bovine respiratory cilia. The structure uncovers principles of doublet microtubule organization and features specific to vertebrate cilia, including previously unknown MIPs, a luminal bundle of tektin filaments, and a pentameric dynein-docking complex. We identify a mechanism for bridging 48- to 24-nm periodicity across the microtubule wall and show that loss of the proteins involved causes defective ciliary motility and laterality abnormalities in zebrafish and mice. Our structure identifies candidate genes for diagnosis of ciliopathies and provides a framework to understand their functions in driving ciliary motility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acattle 3acryo-electron microscopy 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3aperiodicity 0acryo-EM 0adoublet microtubules 0amicrotubule inner proteins 0aciliary motility 0aaxonemal dyneins 0aciliopathies1 aFarley, Hannah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5383-13671 aAnujan, Priyanka1 aAnderson, Jacob R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1179-717X1 aMaxwell, Dale W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6630-50401 aWhitchurch, Jonathan B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1465-93111 aBotsch, J.

Both enzymes were compared with pepsin hydrolysis since its selectivity to different whey proteins is known. Analysis of the hydrolysis environment showed that the pH and temperature play a significant role in determining the best conditions for achievement of hydrolysis, irrespective of which enzyme was used. Whey protein isolate (WPI) was hydrolysed using pepsin, Acid Protease A and Protease M by randomized hydrolysis conditions. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse residual proteins. Regarding enzyme selectivity under various milieu conditions, all three enzymes showed similarities in the reaction progress and their potential for β-Lg isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3ahydrolysis 3alactalbumin 3apH 3apepsin 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atemperature 3awhey protein isolate 0aMicrobial enzymes 0aselective hydrolysis 0awhey proteins1 aCheison, Seronei Chelulei1 aKulozik, Ulrich1 aBožanić, Rajka0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Feb., v. 86, no. 1 p.114-119dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299190000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245013700201300001400338506007600352520204400428592002802472596005202500596003502552506003702587650001302624650002202637650002102659650001302680650000902693650001602702650002502718650001402743650001902757650001602776650001502792650002302807650001902830650002202849650001602871651001202887651001102899651001202910651002102922653001702943653001702960653002502977653002403002653001603026653001303042653001103055700001703066700002203083773011903105856007403224852000903298655001203307IND60624551120221207110321.0181204e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062455112DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcw2042doi7 aPMC52183752pmcid7 a279410912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Marcus A.10aUnderexplored biodiversity of Eastern Mediterranean biota: systematics and evolutionary history of the genus Aubrieta (Brassicaceae)  ap. 39-57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Aubrieta is a taxonomically difficult genus from the Brassicaceae family with approximately 20 species centred in Turkey and Greece. Species boundaries and their evolutionary history are poorly understood. Therefore, we analysed bio- and phylogeographic relationships and evaluated morphological variation to study the evolution of this genus. Methods Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence variation of nuclear-encoded loci and plastid DNA were used to unravel phylogeographic patterns. Morphometric analyses were conducted to study species delimitation. DNA sequence-based mismatch distribution and climate-niche analyses were performed to explain various radiations in space and time during the last 2·5 million years. Key Results Species groups largely show non-overlapping distribution patterns in the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor. We recognized 20 species and provide evidence for overlooked species, thereby highlighting taxonomical difficulties but also demonstrating underexplored species diversity. The centre of origin of Aubrieta is probably Turkey, from which various clades expanded independently towards Asia Minor, south to Lebanon and west to Greece and the Balkans during the Pleistocene. Conclusions Pleistocene climatic fluctuations had a pronounced effect on Aubrieta speciation and radiation during the last 1·1 million years in the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor. In contrast to many other Brassicaceae, speciation processes did not involve excessive formation of polyploids, but displayed formation of diploids with non-overlapping present-day distribution areas. Expansions from the Aubrieta centre of origin and primary centre of species diversity showed adaptation trends towards higher temperature and drier conditions. However, later expansion and diversification of taxa from within the second centre of species diversity in Greece started ∼0·19 Mya and were associated with a general transition of species adaptation towards milder temperatures and less dry conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aKO2302 11/1, 12/1 and 13/1cDFG research grants  aGB-TAF-849cEU-SYNTHESIS grant0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAubrieta 3aPleistocene epoch 3acenter of origin 3adiploidy 3aloci 3amorphometry 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aplastid DNA 3apolyploidy 3asequence diversity 3aspace and time 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aBalkans 3aGreece 3aLebanon 3aTurkey (country) 0abiodiversity 0aBrassicaceae 0aevolutionary history 0amultiple radiations 0asystematics 0ataxonomy 0aTurkey1 aKarl, Robert1 aGerman, Dmitry A.0 tAnnals of botany.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 119, no. 1 p.39-57dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw2043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002700176245013600203300001500339520130800354592002801662650001501690650001601705650002101721650002801742650001701770650001701787650001101804650004301815650001101858650002201869650001901891650002201910650002201932650001701954650001101971773015301982856006902135856010202204990002302306852000902329655001202338IND60643201220221122060135.0190510e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064320122DNAL7 a10.3791/580662doi7 aPMC62351802pmcid7 a302726432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOller-Salvia, Benjamí10aGenetic encoding of a non-canonical amino acid for the generation of antibody-drug conjugates through a fast bioorthogonal reaction  ap. e58066.  aAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) used nowadays in clinical practice are mixtures of antibody molecules linked to a varying number of toxins at different positions. Preclinical studies have shown that the therapeutic index of these traditional ADCs can be improved by the site-specific linkage of toxins. However, current approaches to produce homogeneous ADCs have several limitations, such as low protein expression and slow reaction kinetics. In this protocol we describe how to set up an expression system to incorporate a cyclopropene derivative of lysine (CypK) into antibodies using genetic code expansion. This minimal bioorthogonal handle allows rapid conjugation of tetrazine derivatives through an inverse-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The expression system here reported enables the facile production and purification of trastuzumab bearing CypK in each of the heavy chains. We explain how to link the antibody to the toxin monomethyl auristatin E and characterize the immunoconjugate by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and mass spectrometry. Finally, we describe assays to assess the stability in human serum of the dihydropyridazine linkage resulting from the conjugation and to test the selective cytotoxicity of the ADC for breast cancer cells with high levels of HER2 receptor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3acycloaddition reactions 3acytotoxicity 3agenetic code 3ahumans 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein synthesis 3areaction kinetics 3atherapeutics 3atoxins0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Sept. 14, , no. 139 p.e58066-e58066dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580663Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58066/genetic-encoding-non-canonical-amino-acid-for-generation-antibody  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009500165300001800260520138500278592002801663650001501691650001901706650001001725650002101735650001501756650003801771650002801809650000901837650002201846650001601868650001301884650001401897650000901911650002601920650001001946700001301956700001601969700005701985700005702042773012902099856008402228852000902312655001202321IND60604650720221118235145.0180717e20180622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060465072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b016422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBockaj, M.10aMethod for Electrochemical Detection of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in Plasma  ap. 8561-8566.  aCurrently, a blood test for the diagnosis of endometriosis, a common estrogen-dependent gynecological disease, does not exist. Recent studies suggest that circulating concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have potential for the diagnosis of endometriosis. However, at present, BDNF can only be measured by ELISA, which requires a clinic visit, a routine blood sample, and laboratory testing. Therefore, we developed a point-of-care device (EndoChip) for use with small blood volumes that can be collected through a finger prick. Specifically, the presented device is a polymer-based chip with a nanoporous, wrinkled gold film acting as the electrode/sensing layer, allowing for the electrochemical detection of BDNF in plasma. Increasing concentrations of BDNF (0.1–2.0 ng/mL) induced significant differences in redox current. The biosensor produces a signal readout in a matter of seconds, and is ideal for realizing multiplexing. Blood samples were collected from women (n = 20) with chronic pelvic pain undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy. Plasma BDNF concentrations measured by commercial ELISA were positively correlated (r² = 0.8033; p < 0.001) with results from the EndoChip. Our results demonstrate a quick and reliable method for point-of-care quantification of circulating concentrations of BDNF and a promising diagnostic tool for endometriosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood sampling 3abrain 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemale genital diseases 3agold 3ahematologic tests 3alaparoscopy 3ananogold 3ananopores 3apain 3apoint-of-care systems 3awomen1 aFung, B.1 aTsoulis, M.1 aFoster, W.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well-known tumor suppressor and also a negative regulator of insulin signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We investigated the hypothesis that PTEN may affect the insulin pathway-mediated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in dairy cows. Adenovirus vectors that over-express and silence PTEN were constructed, and then transfected into hepatocytes isolated from calves to investigate the effect of PTEN on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN silencing increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of PI3K but decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1, which increased the phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Increased GSK-3β phosphorylation further up-regulated expression of the key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6-Pase) involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of SREBP-1c target gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) also increased significantly. We further showed that PTEN over-expression could reverse the above results. PTEN negatively regulates the enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, which suggests that PTEN may be a therapeutic target for ketosis and fatty liver in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3acalves 3adairy cows 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3ahepatocytes 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptor substrate proteins 3ainsulin resistance 3aketosis 3alipid metabolism 3aneoplasms 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3asterols 3atau-protein kinase 3atherapeutics 0aHepatocyte 0aPI3K/AKT 0aPTEN1 aMa, Dehui1 aSun, Guoquan1 aYuan, Xue1 aWang, Zhe1 aLiu, Guowen0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Feb., v. 86, no. 1 p.73-76dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299190001283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007100158300002000229520103100249592002801280650001901308650001201327650001901339650001101358650001601369650001301385650002401398650001601422700002101438700001601459700001601475773013601491856007501627852000901702655001201711IND60537594220221120040939.0160809e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053759422DNAL7 a10.1021/ie401026f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Chunfeng10aDeposition CO2 Capture Process Using a Free Piston Stirling Cooler  ap. 14936-14943.  aAs a promising alternative to mitigate the emission of CO₂, cryogenic CO₂ capture techniques have been paid increasing attention. In our previous works, a novel deposition CO₂ capture process based on free piston Stirling coolers (FPSCs) has been developed. Compared to conventional cryogenic CO₂ capture approaches, FPSC was selected to provide cold energy for CO₂ deposition because of its significant advantages (such as high efficiency, high reliability, small size, environmental friendliness, etc.). The performance of the exploited system has been verified by numerical models. The aim of this work is to experimentally test the CO₂ capture performance of the system. In detail, the influence of the temperature of FPSC and flow rate of the gas stream was investigated. Finally, a brief comparison of the dominant technologies was undertaken. Experimental results showed that the system can capture 95% CO₂ from the simulated flue gas and consume 0.55 MJ electrical energy per kilogram of CO₂ recovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoolers 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aflue gas 3amathematical models 3atemperature1 aKitamura, Yutaka1 aLi, Shuhong1 aLu, Jingwen0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 52, no. 42 p.14936-14943dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie401026f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01446naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245005200185300001800237520025600255592002800511650002700539650001200566650002100578650001400599650003900613650003300652650003400685650005100719650002500770650004200795700002800837773009400865856008100959990002301040852000901063655001201072IND60093956120221118184017.0141104e20121023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009395612DNAL7 a230985982pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbrahimi, Hani10aClosed Mitosis: A Timely Move before Separation  ap.

Here, the taxonomy and evolution of the Malagasy grass lineage Chasechloa was investigated with the aid of NGS. Methods Full chloroplast genome data and some nuclear sequences were produced by NGS from old herbarium specimens, while some selected markers were generated from recently collected Malagasy grasses. In addition, a scanning electron microscopy analysis of the upper floret and cross-sections of the rachilla appendages followed by staining with Sudan IV were performed on Chasechloa to examine the morphology of the upper floret and the presence of oils in the appendages. Key Results Chasechloa was recovered within tribe Paniceae, sub-tribe Boivinellinae, contrary to its previous placement as a member of the New World genus Echinolaena (tribe Paspaleae). Chasechloa originated in Madagascar between the Upper Miocene and the Pliocene. It comprises two species, one of them collected only once in 1851. The genus is restricted to north-western seasonally dry deciduous forests. The appendages at the base of the upper floret of Chasechloa have been confirmed as elaiosomes, an evolutionary adaptation for myrmecochory. Conclusions Chasechloa is reinstated at the generic level and a taxonomic treatment is presented, including conservation assessments of its species. Our study also highlights the power of NGS technology to analyse relictual or probably extinct groups.  aPublisher supplied data  a562349/2010-3a563558/2010-5a552589/2011-0cCNPq  aPNX0014/2009cFAPESB  a558317/2009-0a457427/2012-4cPrograma de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade do Semi-Árido0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aSudan dyes 3aappendages 3achloroplast genome 3adeciduous forests 3aendangered species 3aevolutionary adaptation 3aflorets 3agrasses 3aherbaria 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aindigenous species 3aoils 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining 3ataxonomy 3aMadagascar 0aChasechloa 0aconvergent evolution 0aEchinolaena 0aextinct species 0aForest Shade Clade 0agenome skimming 0aherbarium 0amicroendemic 0amyrmecochory 0anext-generation sequencing 0aplastome 0aPoaceae1 aBesnard, Guillaume1 aPiot, Anthony1 aRazanatsoa, Jacqueline1 aOliveira, Reyjane P.1 aVorontsova, Maria S.0 tAnnals of botany.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 119, no. 3 p.339-351dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008000163300001600243520109300259592002801352650002501380650002301405650001101428650001301439650001701452650001301469650001101482650001501493650001001508700001501518700002301533773016201556856008001718852000901798655001201807IND60480524420221121090924.0160128e20030301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048052442DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.69.3.2492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Yongwei10aModel-Based Conifer Canopy Surface Reconstruction from Photographic Imagery  ap. 249-258.  a<p><i>Canopy surface data are desirable in forestry, but they are difficult to collect in the field. Existing surface reconstruction techniques cannot adequately extract canopy surfaces, especially for conifer stands. This paper develops an integrated model-based approach to reconstruct canopy surface for conifer stands analytically from the crown level. To deal with dense stands, critical problems are addressed in the process of model-based surface reconstruction. These include the occlusion problem in disparity (parallax) prediction from tree models, the edge effect of tree models on the disparity map, and the foreshortening effect in image matching. The model-based approach was applied to recover the canopy surface of a dense redwood stand using images scanned from 1:2,400-scale aerial photographs. Compared with field measurements, crown radius and tree height derived from the reconstructed canopy surface model have an overall accuracy of 92 percent and 94 percent, respectively. The results demonstrate the approach’s ability to reconstruct complicated stands.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aSequoia sempervirens 3aaerial photography 3acanopy 3aconifers 3aedge effects 3aforestry 3amodels 3aprediction 3atrees1 aGong, Peng1 aBiging, Gregory S.0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2003 Mar. 1, v. 69, no. 3 p.249-258dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.69.3.2493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300002000283520145500303592002801758650001501786650002301801650001601824650002001840650001401860700001701874700002301891700001401914700001901928700001301947700002001960700001701980700001601997700001202013700001502025700002002040773014302060856007402203852000902277655001202286IND60671097220221118191025.0191002e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067109722DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01735a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Huanran10aInvestigation of the effect of large aromatic fusion in the small molecule backbone on the solar cell device fill factor  ap. 16679-16687.  aThe structure and performance relationship in photovoltaic cells is still not fully understood, particularly in the case of controlling/optimizing the fill factor (FF). Here a pair of molecules DR2TDTCz and DR3TCz with similar backbone structures and varying conjugated central units were designed and synthesized, and their photovoltaic performance was studied and compared. The molecule DR2TDTCz, containing dithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole (DTCz) as the central building block, with a carbazole ring in the center and two fused thiophene rings at the two sides of carbazole, exhibits improved solar light absorption and slightly narrow band gap, compared with the analogue system DR3TCz which has carbazole and two un-fused thiophene rings in the central building block. More importantly, it is found that introducing DTCz with thiophene fused 2,7-carbazole to replace 2,7-carbazole achieves a better molecular packing and favorable orientation, thus benefiting charge transport. As a result, the DR2TDTCz based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 7.03% with an impressively high FF of 75%, while the DR3TCz based device shows a PCE of 4.08% with a much lower FF of 54%. The results indicate that the FF can be tuned directly by the molecular structures and enlarged conjugation central core units could be beneficial to achieve high FF for the devices based on the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical structure 3asolar cells 3asolar radiation 3athiophene1 aLi, Miaomiao1 aNanac(Cartoonist)1 aLiu, Feng1 aWan, Xiangjian1 aKan, Bin1 aWang, Yunchuang1 aZhang, Yamin1 aZhang, Qian1 aZuo, Yi1 aYang, Xuan1 aChen, Yongsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Aug. 4, v. 3, no. 32 p.16679-16687dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01735a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle07705naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245008400158300001600242500000900258520632900267592002806596650001306624650002506637650002706662650001506689650002206704650002806726650001306754650001506767650002006782650001506802650002006817650001206837650003606849650001606885651001106901700001706912700001906929773020206948852000907150856007707159990002307236655001207259IND2073002220221121025047.0191122e199707  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207300222DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1997.04012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, W.

Starter fertilizer applications have been effective in enhancing nutrient uptake even on soils high in available nutrients. Corn hybrids may differ in their response to starter fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate corn hybrid response to starter fertilizer in a no-tillage, dryland environment. This field experiment was conducted from 1993 to 1995 at the North Central Kansas Experiment Field, located near Belleville, on a Crete silt loam soil (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Pachic Arguistoll). Treatments consisted of five corn hybrids and two starter fertilizer treatments. Fertilizer treatments were starter fertilizer (30 lb N and 30 lb P₂O₅/acre) or no starter fertilizer. Starter fertilizer was applied 2 in. to the side of and 2 in. below the seed at planting. In all 3 yr of the experiment, grain yield, maturity, and total P uptake (grain plus stover at maturity) were affected by a hybrid × starter fertilizer interaction. Starter fertilizer consistently increased yields, reduced the number of thermal units needed from emergence to midsilk, and increased total P uptake of Pioneer 3346, Dekalb 636, and Dekalb 591, but had no effect on ICI 8599 and Pioneer 3563. When averaged over the 3 yr of the experiment, starter fertilizer increased grain yield of responding hybrids (hybrids in which the 3-yr average yield was increased by the use of starter fertilizer) by 13 bu/acre. Starter fertilizer increased V6 stage above ground dry matter production and N and P uptake of all hybrids evaluated. Ear leaf N and P concentrations also were increased by starter fertilizer, regardless of hybrid. Results of this work show that starter fertilizer can increase grain yield and be feasible for some hybrids, whereas yields of other hybrids are not affected. Research QuestionConservation tillage production systems are being used by an increasing number of farmers in the central Great Plains. A dryland corn production system that has gained popularity in Kansas over the past few years involves planting as early in spring as possible so that pollination occurs in June when temperatures are more moderate and moisture is more favorable than in July when conditions are hot and dry. When this production system is used in high-residue situations, the risk of cool soils interfering with root growth and nutrient uptake is greater. Corn hybrids differ in rooting characteristics that influence nutrient uptake and may differ in their response to starter fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate starter fertilizer effects on yield, growth, and nutrient uptake of corn hybrids grown in a no-tillage, dryland environment on a soil high in available P. Literature SummaryNo-tillage systems have proven effective in maintaining soil quality and reducing soil erosion. The amount of residue left on the soil surface can cause soils to remain cool, which limits root development and reduces nutrient uptake of corn seedlings. However, starter fertilizer can be applied close to the seedling to improve nutrient uptake. Starter fertilizer has proven to be beneficial even on soils high in available nutrients. Corn hybrids differ in morphological and physiological root characteristics that influence nutrient uptake. Studies in the southeastern USA have reported differential corn hybrid response to starter fertilizer in a high-yield, irrigated environment. This experiment evaluated starter fertilizer effects on yield, growth, and nutrient uptake of corn hybrids adapted to the western Corn Belt grown in a no-tillage, dryland environment. Study DescriptionThis research was conducted from 1993 to 1995 at the North Central Kansas Experiment Field, near Belleville, on a Crete silt loam soil. Soil test P (Bray-1) was 43 ppm (high range). Treatments consisted of five corn hybrids (IC1 8599, Pioneer 3563, Pioneer 3346, Dekalb 636 and Dekalb 591). Fertilizer treatments consisted of starter fertilizer (30 lb N and 30 lb P₂O₅/acre) or no starter fertilizer. The starter fertilizer combination was made using urea-ammonium nitrate solution (28% UAN) and ammonium polyphosphate (10-34-0). Starter fertilizer was applied 2 in. to the side of and 2 in. below the seed at planting. Immediately after planting, knife applications of anhydrous ammonia were made to all plots to bring the total amount of N applied to 180 lb/acre. Planting dates were 26 Apr. 1993, 19 Apr. 1994, and 24 Apr. 1995. Applied QuestionHow does starter fertilizer affect yield, growth, and nutrient uptake of corn hybrids? On this high soil test P soil, starter fertilizer increased early season growth and nutrient uptake of all hybrids tested in all 3 yr of the experiment. However, this early season response to starter fertilizer did not translate into increased grain yield for all hybrids (Table 1). Starter fertilizer consistently improved yields, shortened the time from emergence to midsilk, and increased total P uptake (grain plus stover at maturity) of Pioneer 3346, Dekalb 636, and Dekalb 591, but had no effect on IC1 8599 and Pioneer 3563. Average yield increase from starter fertilizer application for responding hybrids was 13 bu/acre. Results of this work suggest that responses to starter fertilizer can be very economical for some hybrids even on soils high in available P, particularly when corn is planted early in a high-residue production system.

The chips were exposed to continuous cycles of three different ammonia concentrations, followed by purging with dry air. The change in a normalized resistance was measured. All chips showed an irreversible increase in the resistance when initially exposed to ammonia indicating the chemical reaction of the target with their components. This resulted in the collapse of the MOF component. After signal stabilization/equilibration the chips were further tested for ammonia sensing and a reversible increase in the resistance was observed for all samples. Even though the crystalline porous structure of the sensing materials was no longer present, the ability of the resulting amorphous phase to weakly adsorb ammonia enabled the recording of electrical signal changes. The specific structure of the hybrid materials combined with the proximity of the graphene phase, resulted in carrier mobility. A hybrid material with the smallest content of graphene phase exhibited the largest signal change upon exposure to ammonia. This was linked to the more developed MOF units in the case of this material, and therefore to the larger involvement of the amorphous phase released by the collapse of MOF in the sensing mechanism. A linear relationship between the response of the sensors and the ammonia concentration was found. Combining the adsorption capacity of the hybrid materials with an electrical signal allows their application as components of safety devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aammonia 3achemical reactions 3agraphene 3asafety equipment1 aSingh, Kavindra1 aRodríguez-Castellón, Enrique1 aBandosz, Teresa J.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 19, v. 3, no. 21 p.11417-11429dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01738f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001600265520213400281592002802415650002502443650001802468650002102486650001002507650001602517650001802533650001102551650002302562650003702585650001702622650001302639650003302652650002302685650003502708650002302743650001302766650002502779700002202804700002502826700003202851700002402883773008602907856004802993852000903041655001203050IND50068688420221118090240.0130821e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006868842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-013-0895-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanthee, Dilip R.10aGenotype and environmental interaction for fruit quality traits in vintage tomato varieties  ap. 169-182.  aTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is the second most highly consumed vegetable in the world after potato. Traits including physicochemical (lycopene, total titratable acid (TTA), total soluble solids (TSS) and vitamin C), morphological (fruit shape and size) and colors contribute to the overall fruit quality of tomato. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate vintage tomato varieties representing a wide genetic background for fruit quality including physicochemical, morphological and color traits in multiple environments and to analyze consistency of their performances across locations. In order to achieve this objective, we acquired 44 vintage tomato varieties and evaluated them in five environments (NC, NY, OH in 2009, and NC and OH in 2010). Analysis of the data revealed that there was a significant (p< 0.01) difference among genotypes and environments for all quality traits, Genotype × Environment interaction was significant (p< 0.01) for all quality traits except for TSS. Broad-sense heritability of physicochemical traits ranged from 5.8 % (lycopene) to 35.7 % (TTA) whereas that for morphological traits ranged from 8.1 % (proximal eccentricity) to 97.3 % (fruit shape index external 1), and color from 69.0 % (a*-value) to 99.3 % (b*-value). Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that estimated lycopene content was negatively correlated with the other physicochemical traits whereas vitamin C, TSS and TTA were positively correlated with each other. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on phenotypic data identified five components explaining at least 82 % of the total variation. Cluster analysis based on phenotypic data revealed the clusters of vintage tomato varieties were not distinct whereas single nucleotide polymorphism data revealed three distinct populations. This information including heritability and correlation coefficients from the present study may be useful to tomato breeding programs to choose germplasm, improve the response to selection and simultaneously improve multiple traits for tomato fruit quality. ©Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aascorbic acid 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3acorrelation 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenetic background 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheritability 3alycopene 3aprincipal component analysis 3aselection response 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids1 aLabate, Joanne A.1 aMcGrath, Margaret T.1 aBreksa, Andrew P., IIIcIII1 aRobertson, Larry D.0 tEuphytica.g2013 Sept., v. 193, no. 2 p.169-182dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-013-0895-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012900160500001400289520132100303592002801624650001401652650001901666650002701685650001801712650001901730650001701749650003101766650001801797650001501815650001301830650001401843653000901857653001501866653001401881653001801895700001801913700001901931700001701950700001801967700001101985700001501996700001802011700001502029773009902044856008202143852000902225655001202234IND60697729820221120183340.0200819e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069772982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1178202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo10aDownregulation of PIF1, a potential new target of MYCN, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell migration in neuroblastoma cells  aNAL-light  aNeuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common malignant tumors in children. Chemotherapy resistance is one of the significant challenges in the treatment of high-risk NB patients, and it is necessary to search for new valid targets for NB treatment. This study aims to explore the possible role of PIF1 in NB by using bioinformatic analysis and downregulation of PIF1 with specific siRNA. Kyoto genome encyclopedia and R language based gene ontology was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (including PIF1) when MYCN expression was silenced in NB cells. Analysis based on the R2 database showed a lower expression of PIF1 correlated with good prognosis in NB patients. Downregulation of MYCN expression by transfecting MYCN siRNA (#1, #2) into NB cells decreased the PIF1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, while upregulation of MYCN expression by transfecting MYCN overexpressed plasmid increased the PIF1 expression. We further found that downregulation of PIF1 expression by transfecting PIF1 siRNA (#1, #2) into NB cells, increased the number of apoptotic cells, inhibited the cell survival, decreased the ability of cell migration and induced a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. These data indicated that PIF1, as a potential new target of MYCN, maybe a novel target for NB treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell movement 3acell viability 3adrug therapy 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3ainterphase 3aplasmids 3aprognosis 0aPIF1 0aCell cycle 0aMigration 0aNeuroblastoma1 aHua, Zhongyan1 aGong, Baocheng1 aTan, Xiaolin1 aZhang, Simeng1 aLi, Qi1 aChen, Yang1 aZhang, Jinhua1 aLi, Zhijie0 tLife sciences.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 256 p.117820-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1178203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002200197245012700219300001600346500000900362506002800371506003000399520125000429592002801679596007001707596006101777506003701838650001601875650001301891650001201904650003601916650000901952650001901961650002101980650002002001650003002021650001702051650002102068650001202089650001402101650001502115650001602130650001002146650001302156650001202169700002602181700002002207773012602227856008802353903002202441852000902463655001202472IND60669752520221207114706.0191126e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066975252DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2008.03.00132chorus7 a10.3835/plantgenome2008.03.00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillman, Jason D.14aThe Low Phytic Acid Phenotype in Soybean Line CX1834 Is Due to Mutations in Two Homologs of the Maize Low Phytic Acid Gene  ap. 179-190.  aepub  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aPlant seeds accumulate phosphorus in the form of myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexa-kisphosphate, commonly referred to as phytic acid. Phytic acid is found complexed with cationic mineral species in the form of phytate, which is not well digested or absorbed by monogastric species such as humans, poultry, and swine. As a result, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has an effective deficiency of phosphorus and other minerals, despite high levels of minerals and phosphorus in the seed. Excreted phytate can also contribute to phosphorus contamination of groundwater and eutrophication of freshwater lakes and streams. In maize (Zea mays L. ssp. mays), a recessive mutation in a conserved region within the low phytic acid 1 (lpa1) gene is responsible for the low phytic acid phenotype. We have identified recessive mutations in two soybean homologs of the maize lpa1 gene in soybean line CX1834, a mutagenized line with a low phytic acid phenotype. In three populations analyzed, we identified complete association between homozygosity for mutant alleles of the two lpa1 homologs and the low phytic acid phenotype in soybean. Molecular marker assays were designed that can be used to directly select for the mutant alleles that control the phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cUnited Soybean Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000120090 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3achemical constituents of plants 3acorn 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater lakes 3agenetic markers 3agroundwater contamination 3ahomozygosity 3ainduced mutation 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3aseeds 3asoybeans 3astreams1 aPantalone, Vincent R.1 aBilyeu, Kristin0 tThe plant genome.g2009 July, v. 2, no. 2 p.179-190dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2008.03.00133Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245004900179300001800228500001900246500001100265520154500276592002801821596003301849650001801882650001501900650001201915650001801927650001701945650001201962650002201974650001201996650001202008650001502020650001602035650002002051650001102071650001102082700001602093700002502109700003102134700006902165773010702234856008202341852000902423655001202432IND60712294120221120153941.0201009e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071229412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-020-02892-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChieffi Baccari, Gabriella10aD-Amino acids in mammalian endocrine tissues  ap. 1263-1273.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aD-Aspartate, D-serine and D-alanine are a regular occurrence in mammalian endocrine tissues, though in amounts varying with the type of gland. The pituitary gland, pineal gland, thyroid, adrenal glands and testis contain relatively large amounts of D-aspartate in all species examined. D-alanine is relatively abundant in the pituitary gland and pancreas. High levels of D-serine characterize the hypothalamus. D-leucine, D-proline and D-glutamate are generally low. The current knowledge of physiological roles of D-amino acids in endocrine tissues is far from exhaustive, yet the topic is attracting increasing interest because of its potential in pharmacological application. D-aspartate is known to act at all levels of the hypothalamus–pituitary–testis axis, playing a key role in reproductive biology in several vertebrate classes. An involvement of D-amino acids in the endocrine function of the pancreas is emerging. D-Aspartate has been immunolocalized in insulin-containing secretory granules in INS-1 E clonal β cells and is co-secreted with insulin by exocytosis. Specific immunolocalization of D-alanine in pituitary ACTH-secreting cells and pancreatic β-cells suggests that this amino acid participates in blood glucose regulation in mammals. By modulating insulin secretion, D-serine probably participates in the control of systemic glucose metabolism by modulating insulin secretion. We anticipate that future investigation will significantly increase the functional repertoire of D-amino acids in homeostatic control.  aPublisher supplied data  aB68D19001880005cVALERE 2019 3ablood glucose 3aexocytosis 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3ahypothalamus 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aleucine 3amammals 3ametabolism 3apineal body 3apituitary gland 3aserine 3atestes1 aFalvo, Sara1 aSantillo, Alessandra1 aDi Giacomo Russo, Federica1 aDi Fiore, Maria Maddalena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4673-67290 tAmino acids.g2020 Sept., v. 52, no. 9 p.1263-1273dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-020-02892-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009700161300002000258520152700278592002801805650001701833650001501850650002801865650001601893650001801909650001301927650001901940650001301959650001801972650001901990650002002009650001902029650001502048650000902063650001802072653000902090653001602099653001802115653002002133653001902153700001902172700001802191700001702209700005302226700006002279773014202339856007802481852000902559655001202568IND60626758620221122045130.0181226e20181203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062675862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b186262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Guozhong10aAnisotropic Biomimetic Silk Scaffolds for Improved Cell Migration and Healing of Skin Wounds  ap. 44314-44323.  aImproved and more rapid healing of full-thickness skin wounds remains a major clinical need. Silk fibroin (SF) is a natural protein biomaterial that has been used in skin repair. However, there has been little effort aimed at improving skin healing through tuning the hierarchical microstructure of SF-based matrices and introducing multiple physical cues. Recently, enhanced vascularization was achieved with SF scaffolds with nanofibrous structures and tunable secondary conformation of the matrices. We hypothesized that anisotropic features in nanofibrous SF scaffolds would promote cell migration, neovascularization, and tissue regeneration in wounds. To address this hypothesis, SF nanofibers were aligned in an electric field to form anisotropic porous scaffolds after lyophilization. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated good cytocompatibility, and improved cell migration and vascularization than nanofibrous scaffolds without these anisotropic features. These improvements resulted in more rapid wound closure, tissue ingrowth, and the formation of new epidermis, as well as higher collagen deposition with a structure similar to the surrounding native tissue. The new epidermal layers and neovascularization were achieved by day 7, with wound healing complete by day 28. It was concluded that anisotropic SF scaffolds alone, without a need for growth factors and cells, promoted significant cell migration, vascularization, and skin regeneration and may have the potential to effectively treat dermal wounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanisotropy 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomimetics 3acell movement 3acollagen 3aelectric field 3afibroins 3afreeze drying 3agrowth factors 3ain vivo studies 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3asilk 3atissue repair 0asilk 0aanisotropic 0awound healing 0avascularization 0acell migration1 aDing, ZhaoZhao1 aWei, Yuanyuan1 aLu, Xiaohong1 aLu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4889-52991 aKaplan, David L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9245-77740 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 10, no. 51 p.44314-44323dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b186263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245014700209300001800356520198100374536012202355592002802477596014002505650001902645650001102664650001202675650001302687650001202700650001102712650001702723650001002740650001202750650001102762650001102773650001102784650000902795651001702804651001002821653001602831653001502847653002302862653001702885700006302902700002102965700001702986700002003003700001703023773010703040856008003147852000903227655001203236IND60656009020221119062251.0190808e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065600902DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836198469822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercuri, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6138-416510aMiddle- to late-Holocene fire history and the impact on Mediterranean pine and oak forests according to the core RF93-30, central Adriatic Sea  ap. 1362-1376.  aThe high-resolution Adriatic RF93-30 core shows changes in its microcharcoal record, which correlate to terrestrial fires from the last 7000 years. Pollen and microcharcoals were transported by wind and fluvial transport from the sedimentary basin, including the Po River and other rivers flowing into the sea off the Italian east coast. Charcoal particles and pollen were counted in the same samples, and the maximum breadth and length of charcoal particles were measured. Microcharcoals with large dimensions were taken as fire indicators occurring along the near coast, as they probably arrived from short distances, the nearest being in Apulia, in southern Italy. The age–depth model was developed within the multidisciplinary PALICLAS project. Several potential fire activity increases (PFAIs) were visible as peaks in the diagram. The oldest PFAIs occurred at the middle Holocene (approximately dated to c. 6730, 5430, 4150 cal BP), others occurred at the late Holocene (c. 3760, 2660, 2240, 2030, 1930, 1510 cal BP) and during the last millennium (c. 900–865, 530, 120–96 cal BP). The two oldest peaks in the diagram, occurring in the 7th–6th millennia, showed the highest contribution of charcoal corresponding to the highest values of arboreal pollen (AP) in the sedimentary record. Although the CHAR peaks did not represent a single fire event, the diagram suggests a good correspondence between paleofire activity and terrestrial vegetation biomass during this early phase. Pollen containing black particles was observed, which suggested some grains were transported in suspension with winds from burned woods. The main unambiguous anthropogenic fire causation would have occurred during the last four millennia. From 4.2 ka, it became hard to disentangle climate and Bronze Age actions. Technology and human activity probably improved the pace of fire events, especially involving oak woods, with evidence of an increase of CHAR during the last millennium.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRIN 20158KBLNBcministero dell’istruzione, dell’università e della ricercadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003407 3aHolocene epoch 3abasins 3abiomass 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3acoasts 3afire history 3afires 3aforests 3amodels 3apollen 3arivers 3awind 3aAdriatic Sea 3aItaly 0aarchaeology 0aBronze Age 0adark-filled pollen 0ahuman impact1 aFlorenzano, Assunta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4759-64061 aTerenziani, Rita1 aFuria, Elisa1 aDallai, Daniele1 aTorri, Paola0 tHolocene.g2019 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.1362-1376dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836198469823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009700169300001600266500000900282520151400291592002801805650002301833650001001856650001101866650002301877650001101900650001601911650001301927650001201940650001901952650001701971650002101988650001602009650002202025651001002047700002002057773012102077856008402198852000902282655001202291IND60665584320221116174524.0191228e200003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066558432DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2000.402430x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJost, Philip H.10aGrowth and Yield Comparisons of Cotton Planted in Conventional and Ultra-Narrow Row Spacings  ap. 430-435.  aepub  aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growers are faced with rising production costs and static or declining crop prices. One strategy with potential for reducing production costs entails growing cotton in ultra-narrow rows with elevated plant populations. A 2-yr field study was conducted in the Brazos Bottoms near College Station, TX to determine the differences in vegetative growth and yield parameters of cotton grown in ultra-narrow and conventionally spaced rows. Four row spacings of 19, 38.1, 76.2, and 101.6 cm were planted with populations of 39.4 to 45.8, 18.2 to 20.7, 13.1 to 13.6, and 7.9 to 9.9 plants m⁻², respectively. At crop maturity, plant height and node counts were reduced in the cotton grown in the 19-cm row spacing. Canopy closure occurred more rapidly in the 19- and 38.1-cm row spacings than in the wider row spacings. In 1997, a relatively wet growing season, yields were not affected by the row-spacing treatments. In 1998, a dry growing season, yields in the 19- and 38.1-cm row spacings were greater than those in the wider row spacings. The 19-cm row spacing had 84.6% of the harvestable bolls at the first fruiting position and 76.1% of the bolls on Nodes 6 through 10, both percentages being significantly greater than those observed in the wider row spacings. Fiber length tended to be reduced in the 19-cm row spacing relative to the other row spacings. Ultra-narrow row cotton appears to be a viable option for producers to attempt to reduce costs while maintaining yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abolls 3acanopy 3acost effectiveness 3acotton 3acrop prices 3afruiting 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3aplant height 3aproduction costs 3arow spacing 3avegetative growth 3aTexas1 aCothren, J.

Graphene oxide (GO) is one of the most extensively studied graphene derivatives. In order to improve GO electrical properties, nanoplatelets are chemically reduced, thus increasing nanoplatelet conductivity. This reduced GO (rGO) shows different properties and behavior compared to GO. Graphene-based wastes are expected to end up in the marine environment. Here we aimed to assess the potential toxic effects of GO and rGO to marine organisms by using in vitro assays with mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) hemocytes. Cells were exposed to a wide range of concentrations (up to 100mg/L) of GO (with and without polyvinylpyrrolidone-PVP as stabilizing agent: GO and GO-PVP) and rGO with PVP (rGO-PVP) to assess cytotoxicity and cell membrane integrity. Then, cells were exposed to sublethal concentrations of GO and rGO-PVP to assess their subcellular distribution through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to evaluate their effects on ROS production. GO, GO-PVP and rGO-PVP showed low and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. rGO-PVP (LC50=29.902 and 33.94mg/L depending on the origin) was more toxic than GO (LC50=49.84 and 54.51mg/L depending on the origin) and GO-PVP (LC50=43.72mg/L). PVP was not toxic to hemocytes but increased bioavailability and toxicity of nanoplatelets. At TEM, GO and rGO-PVP nanoplatelets caused invaginations and perforations of the plasma membrane, which agrees with the observed decrease in cell membrane integrity. Nanoplatelets were internalized, at a higher extent for rGO-PVP than for GO, and found in the cytosol and in endolysosomal vesicles of hemocytes. Both GO and rGO-PVP increased ROS production at the highest sublethal concentration tested. In conclusion, GO, GO-PVP and rGO-PVP are not highly toxic to mussel cells but they cause membrane damage and their toxicity is ROS-mediated. Finally, in vitro assays with mussel hemocytes are sensitive tools to detect toxic effects of graphene-based nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aaquatic organisms 3abioavailability 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrical properties 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahemocytes 3ain vitro studies 3amarine environment 3amussels 3ananomaterials 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplasma membrane 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 0aGraphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO 0aCytotoxicity 0aMembrane damage 0aROS production 0aIntracellular localization 0aMussel hemocytes1 aTomovska, Radmila1 aCajaraville, Miren P.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2017 July, v. 188 p.138-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014100166300001600307520150000323592002801823650002601851650001401877650001301891650001601904650002001920650001401940650001101954650001101965650002401976650001802000653001602018653003102034653001102065653001502076653001902091653002602110700002302136700002302159700002402182700002202206773011302228856008602341852000902427655001202436IND60555399720221117011059.0180831e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055539972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDadak, Ali10aExergy-based sustainability assessment of continuous photobiological hydrogen production using anaerobic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum  ap. 157-166.  aThe present research work was aimed at analyzing a continuous photobioreactor for hydrogen production from syngas via Rhodospirillum rubrum from exergetic point of view. Exergy balance equation was developed for the investigated photobioreactor based on both conventional exergy and eco-exergy concepts in order to determine its exergetic performance parameters. Two new exergetic criteria called the process exergetic efficiency and normalized exergy destruction were also introduced in order to maximize biohydrogen production and minimize resources destruction. The results obtained showed that the process exergy efficiency, a decision making parameter, varied between 14.71–22.90% and 14.71–22.84% using the conventional exergy and eco-exergy approaches, respectively. The minimum normalized exergy destruction was found to be 0.97 using both approaches. In general, no noticeable changes were observed in the conventional exergetic and eco-exergetic performance parameters of the bioreactor over 540 h of continuous operation. Nevertheless, eco-exergetic analysis owing to the inclusion of the work of information embedded in the genomes of living organisms is still recommended for improving the design features of photobioreactors for hydrogen production. The outcomes of the present study could provide practical insights to engineers and researchers dealing with analysis, design, development, optimization, and improvement of large-scale photobioreactors for hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodospirillum rubrum 3aanaerobes 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3adecision making 3aequations 3aexergy 3agenome 3ahydrogen production 3asynthesis gas 0aBiohydrogen 0aContinuous photobioreactor 0aExergy 0aEco-exergy 0aSustainability 0aRhodospirillum rubrum1 aAghbashlo, Mortaza1 aTabatabaei, Meisam1 aYounesi, Habibollah1 aNajafpour, Ghasem0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 139 p.157-166dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245013200206300001600338520125300354592002801607650001101635650001001646650001201656650001101668650002201679650001601701650001301717650002401730650001401754650001301768650001501781650002201796651001201818653002401830653001901854653001401873653001301887653001301900653003101913700001801944700002501962700002001987700002102007773011902028856008802147852000902235655001202244IND60590731320221120220442.0190320e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059073132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9274-853910aAssessing sea-level rise impact on saltwater intrusion into the root zone of a geo-typical area in coastal east-central Florida  ap. 211-221.  aSaltwater intrusion (SWI) into root zone in low-lying coastal areas can affect the survival and spatial distribution of various vegetation species by altering plant communities and the wildlife habitats they support. In this study, a baseline model was developed based on FEMWATER to simulate the monthly variation of root zone salinity of a geo-typical area located at the Cape Canaveral Barrier Island Complex (CCBIC) of coastal east-central Florida (USA) in 2010. Based on the developed and calibrated baseline model, three diagnostic FEMWATER models were developed to predict the extent of SWI into root zone by modifying the boundary values representing the rising sea level based on various sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios projected for 2080. The simulation results indicated that the extent of SWI would be insignificant if SLR is either low (23.4cm) or intermediate (59.0cm), but would be significant if SLR is high (119.5cm) in that infiltration/diffusion of overtopping seawater in coastal low-lying areas can greatly increase root zone salinity level, since the sand dunes may fail to prevent the landward migration of seawater because the waves of the rising sea level can reach and pass over the crest under high (119.5cm) SLR scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adunes 3aislands 3amodels 3aplant communities 3arhizosphere 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 3avegetation 3awildlife habitats 3aFlorida 0aSaltwater intrusion 0aSea-level rise 0aRoot zone 0aSalinity 0aFEMWATER 0aEast-central Florida coast1 aWang, Dingbao1 aMedeiros, Stephen C.1 aHagen, Scott C.1 aHall, Carlton R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 15, v. 630 p.211-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009500168300001600263520129100279592002801570650002001598650003101618650002501649650001701674650002501691650001001716650001401726650001301740650001201753650001901765650002301784650001001807650001701817650001801834650002101852650001701873650000901890650002101899650001501920653001401935653001301949653002101962653001701983653001802000653001902018700001802037773011102055856008202166852000902248655001202257IND60086526220221118230859.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008652622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaseem, Mohammad10aMitochondrial dysfunction mediated cisplatin induced toxicity: Modulatory role of curcumin  ap. 334-342.  aAnticancer agents help to suppress cellular damage but subsequently can lead to side effects and toxic manifestations. Toxicity of anticancer drug cisplatin (CP) is attributed to its interference of biological enzymes in metabolic pathways. Mitochondria have been recognized as targets in various kinds of toxicity including neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity that can lead to neoplastic disease. Curcumin (CMN) is a known cytoprotectant with comprehensive anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the damage caused by CP and its abrogation by using antioxidant potential of CMN. CP caused a significant enhancement in the mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and protein carbonyl (PC) content. Pre-treatment of rat with CMN significantly restored the mitochondrial LPO levels and PC content. It also replenished the CP induced modulatory effects on altered enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in both brain and liver mitochondria. It is suggested that CMN, by attenuating mitochondrial oxidative stress, holds promise that can decline CP induced adverse effects in brain and liver. CMN should be investigated as a potential safe and remarkable approach in attenuating the adverse effects induced by CP-related toxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3abrain 3acisplatin 3acurcumin 3aenzymes 3ahepatotoxicity 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apretreatment 3arats 3atoxic substances 3atoxicology 0aCisplatin 0aCurcumin 0aOxidative stress 0aMitochondria 0aNeurotoxicity 0aHepatotoxicity1 aParvez, Suhel0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.334-342dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008000170300001800250520100300268536008501271592002801356650001401384650002801398650001301426650000801439650003601447650001201483650002101495650001901516650001401535650002801549650001301577650002801590650001301618650001601631650001301647650001301660650001301673651000901686653002801695653002801723653002601751653001201777700002001789700002401809700002001833700002701853773012601880856008602006852000902092655001202101IND60759191120221116151457.0220304e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075919112DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18033112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Zahra10aInsecticidal activity of the essential oil of Perovskia artemisioides Boiss  ap. 5929-5933.  aThis work reports the phytochemical profile and insecticidal properties of Perovskia artemisioides Boiss essential oil (PAEO) collected in Baluchestan, Iran. Totally, twenty-six substances were identified with 1,8-cineole (25.81%), geranyl acetate (13.00%) and linalool (10.21%) as dominant chemical metabolites by GC-MS analysis. PAEO possessed fumigant toxicity against various growth stages of Phthorimaea operculella. P. operculella adults showed considerable sensitivity (LC₅₀ = 0.58 µL/L air) in comparison to eggs (LC₅₀ = 5.87 µL/L air) and neonate larvae (LC₅₀ = 1.23 µL/L air). Finally, molecular docking of major components of PAEO was performed against detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase activities. Humulene, β-caryophyllene, and α-cadinol exhibited the most interactions with the P450 and GST. It can be concluded that PAEO has the potential for development into natural insecticides for the control of storage pests.  aThe Shahid Beheshti University Research Council financially supported this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerovskia 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aacetates 3aair 3achemical constituents of plants 3acineole 3acytochrome P-450 3aessential oils 3afumigants 3aglutathione transferase 3ahumulene 3ainsecticidal properties 3alinalool 3ametabolites 3aneonates 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aIran 0aPerovskia artemisioides 0aPhthorimaea operculella 0ainsecticidal activity 0adocking1 aAlizadeh, Zahra1 aKhorrami, Fereshteh1 aNorouzi, Samira1 aMoridi Farimani, Mahdi0 tNatural product research.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 35, no. 24 p.5929-5933dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.18033113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012600165300001400291520182500305592002802130650001902158650002102177650001202198650000902210650001102219650001602230650002302246650002602269650001902295650001702314650001902331650001302350650001802363650001502381650001702396650001302413650001602426650001002442650001402452650001502466650002102481650001502502650002302517650001102540650002502551650001102576653002302587653002102610653002302631700001802654700001502672773010602687856008402793852000902877655001202886IND60568020920221120164942.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056802092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Xiao-Bo10aBiodegradable film mulching improves soil temperature, moisture and seed yield of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)  ap. 42-50.  aBiodegradable film has been proven to be a good alternative to conventional polyethylene (PE) film for crops such as maize and cotton, but its suitability for winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), one of the most important oilseed crops worldwide, has not been fully investigated. We conducted a three-year field experiment to systematically analyse and compare the effects of conventional PE film mulching (PM), biodegradable film mulching (BM), and no film mulching (CK) on soil temperature, soil water storage, water use efficiency (WUE), root growth, and yield for winter oilseed rape. The effects of increasing soil temperature and soil water storage were similar for BM and PM and were significantly higher than for CK before 150days after sowing (DAS), but the increases of soil temperature and soil water storage were significantly lower for BM than PM after 150 DAS due to the degradation of the biofilm. The taproots of the rapeseed extended 1.7cm significantly deeper into the soil for BM than PM, and the mass density of lateral roots in the 20–30cm soil layer was 18–26gm−3 significantly higher for BM at maturity stage. Evapotranspiration (ET) was significantly higher in BM than PM but still significantly lower than in CK. The average ET in BM was 10.0% higher than in PM and 10.4% lower than in CK. Yield and WUE did not differ significantly between BM and PM. Average yield and WUE in BM were 5.8 and 14.3% lower than in PM and were 38.4 and 54.5% higher than in CK. The seed content of erucic acid and glucosinolate, harmful to human health, was lower in BM than PM, while seed oil, protein, and oleic acid contents did not differ significantly between BM and PM. Biodegradable film is thus recommended as a viable option to the conventional PE film for the production of winter oilseed rape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3abiodegradability 3abiofilm 3acorn 3acotton 3aerucic acid 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3aglucosinolates 3ahuman health 3amaturity stage 3amulching 3aoilseed crops 3aoleic acid 3apolyethylene 3arapeseed 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseed oils 3aseed yield 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3asowing 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 0aBiodegradable film 0aSoil temperature 0aSoil water storage1 aLi, Yuan-Nong1 aDu, Ya-Dan0 tSoil & tillage research.g2017 Aug., v. 171 p.42-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245012000178300001400298520121000312592002801522650001801550650002901568650002601597650002301623650001601646650001701662650001901679650001901698650002301717650001401740653002901754653002901783653001801812653001301830700002101843700002901864700002501893700002401918700002301942773011201965856008302077852000902160655001202169IND60603526420221117201509.0180716e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060352642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeliopoulos, Nikolaos S.13aAn in situ antimicrobial susceptibility testing method based on in vivo measurements of chlorophyll α fluorescence  ap. 49-54.  aUp to now antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods are indirect and generally involve the manual counting of bacterial colonies following the extraction of microorganisms from the surface under study and their inoculation in a separate procedure. In this work, an in situ, direct and instrumental method for the evaluation and assessment of antibacterial properties of materials and surfaces is proposed. Instead of indirectly determining antibacterial activity using the typical gram(−) test organisms with the subsequent manual colony count or inhibition zone measurement, the proposed procedure, employs photosynthetic gram(−) cyanobacteria deposited directly onto the surface under study and assesses cell proliferation and viability by a quick, accurate and reproducible instrumental chlorophyll fluorescence spectrophotometric technique. In contrast with existing methods of determination of antibacterial properties, it produces high resolution and quantitative results and is so versatile that it could be used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of any compound (organic, inorganic, natural or man-made) under any experimental conditions, depending on the targeted application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3acell proliferation 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3amicroorganisms 3aphotosynthesis 3aspectrophotometers 3aviability 0aAntibacterial properties 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aCyanobacteria 0aTextiles1 aGaleou, Angeliki1 aPapageorgiou, Sergios K.1 aFavvas, Evangelos P.1 aKatsaros, Fotios K.1 aStamatakis, Kostas0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 May, v. 112 p.49-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245010700182300001600289520202900305592002802334650001602362650002602378650001702404650001202421650002302433650001302456650001402469650001602483650001502499650001002514650001202524650001302536650001202549650001302561650002402574651001002598653002102608653002302629653002102652653001102673653002202684653002702706700001902733700006802752773011902820856008802939852000903027655001203036IND60590731420221120220250.0190320e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059073142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonázar, José Antonio,10aTourism in protected areas: Disentangling road and traffic effects on intra-guild scavenging processes  ap. 600-608.  aThe expansion of road networks and the increase in traffic have emerged in recent years as key threats to the conservation of biodiversity. This is particularly concerning in many protected areas because the increase of recreational activities requiring the use of vehicles. Effects of roads and traffic within guild scenarios and ecological processes remain however poorly known. Here we examined how road proximity and traffic intensity influence patterns of resource use in an Old-World avian scavenger guild living in a protected natural park in northern Spain. We experimentally placed 130 carcasses at different distances from a scenic road in the centre of the park. Vehicles were recorded by means of traffic counters which revealed that maximum numbers were reached during weekends and holidays and during the middle hours of the day. Avian scavenger attendance at carcasses was recorded by means of camera-traps. Obligated scavengers, Eurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) were frequently observed (59.4% and 37.7% of the consumed carcasses) together with five other facultative scavenger species. We found that the richness (number of species) and the probability of consumption of the resource were reduced the smaller the distance to the road and in days with higher traffic intensity. The same factors affected the probability of presence of all the scavenger species. Moreover, some of them, notably griffon vultures, showed hourly patterns of carcass attendance suggesting avoidance of maximum traffic levels. Our results highlight that roads and traffic would trigger consequences on the structure and functioning of scavenger food webs, which may be particularly concerning in protected areas with remarkable levels of biodiversity. Future regulations at protected areas should couple both traffic and tourist affluence with wildlife conservation. In this way important ecological processes would be preserved while maintaining a good dissemination of natural values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyps fulvus 3aNeophron percnopterus 3abiodiversity 3acameras 3aconservation areas 3acounters 3afood webs 3aprobability 3arecreation 3aroads 3atourism 3atourists 3atraffic 3avultures 3awildlife management 3aSpain 0aAvian scavengers 0aEndangered species 0aFeeding behavior 0aGuilds 0aHuman disturbance 0aNatural protected area1 aCeballos, Olga1 aCortés-Avizanda, Ainara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9674-64340 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 15, v. 630 p.600-608dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245007100201300002000272506007600292520094400368592002801312506003701340650001801377650001001395650002801405650001301433650001501446650000901461650001401470700001701484700001801501700002001519700002101539700002001560700001901580773017501599856008301774852000901857655001201866IND4481623620221207141555.0120502e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448162362DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11134441082doi7 aPMC32077092pmcid7 a220257262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSigel, Erwin14aThe major central endocannabinoid directly acts at GABAA receptors  ap. 18150-18155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGABAA receptors are the major ionotropic inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. The endocannabinoid system is a lipid signaling network that modulates different brain functions. Here we show a direct molecular interaction between the two systems. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) potentiates GABAA receptors at low concentrations of GABA. Two residues of the receptor located in the transmembrane segment M4 of β2 confer 2-AG binding. 2-AG acts in a superadditive fashion with the neurosteroid 3α, 21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (THDOC) and modulates δ-subunit–containing receptors, known to be located extrasynaptically and to respond to neurosteroids. 2-AG inhibits motility in CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptor double-KO, whereas β2-KO mice show hypermotility. The identification of a functional binding site for 2-AG in the GABAA receptor may have far-reaching consequences for the study of locomotion and sedation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3abrain 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglycerol 3alocomotion 3amice 3areceptors1 aBaur, Roland1 aRácz, Ildiko1 aMarazzi, Janine1 aSmart, Trevor G.1 aZimmer, Andreas1 aGertsch, Jürg0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 108, no. 44 p.18150-18155dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11134441083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017300164300001400337520125700351592002801608650001801636650001301654650001401667650001501681650004301696650003601739650001701775650002201792650001801814650002401832650001001856650000901866650001901875650002201894650002601916650003101942650002501973650003601998650003202034653002502066653003102091653002002122653002402142653004202166700001502208700002102223700002002244700001802264700002002282700001802302700002002320700002002340700001702360773011402377856008202491852000902573655001202582IND60564194520221123020749.0180830e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Na-Rae10aProtective effect of HwangRyunHaeDok-Tang water extract against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease induced by cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide in a mouse model  ap. 60-65.  aHwangryunhaedok-tang is an oriental herbal formula treated to cure inflammation and gastric disorders in China, Japan, and Korea. We explored the protective effects of Hwangryunhaedok-tang water extract (HRWE) against airway pathophysiological changes caused by cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a mouse.We performed quantitative analyses of five marker components, namely geniposide, baicalin, coptisine, plamatine, and berberine, using high-performance liquid chromatography. Animals were received CS exposure (1h per day) for 7 days. LPS was administered intranasally on day 4. Mice were received HRWE at dose of 100 or 200mg/kg for 1h before CS exposure.Treatment with HRWE significantly suppressed the increased inflammatory cell count induced by CS and LPS exposure. In addition, reduction in IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was observed after HRWE treatment. HRWE not only decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in lung, but also decreased the expression of iNOS, NF-κB and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 in lung tissues.This study showed that HRWE can attenuate respiratory inflammation caused by CS and LPS exposure. Therefore, HRWE has potential for treating airway inflammatory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abaicalin 3aberberine 3acigarettes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amice 3aplant extracts 3aprotective effect 3aquantitative analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aHwangRyunHaeDok-tang 0aTraditional herbal formula 0aCigarette smoke 0aAirway inflammation 0aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease1 aKo, Je-Won1 aPark, Sung-Hyeuk1 aCho, Young-Kwon1 aOh, Sei-Ryang1 aAhn, Kyung-Seob1 aRyu, Jung-Min1 aKim, Jong-Choon1 aSeo, Chang-Seob1 aShin, In-Sik0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 200 p.60-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012100176300001800297520102100315592002801336650001701364650002401381650001001405650001801415650001501433650001601448650002301464650004301487650001901530650001701549650002201566650001301588650001401601650001301615650001001628653001701638653003101655653002401686653002101710653002001731700002001751700001801771700002301789700001901812773012601831856008601957852000902043655001202052IND60759191220221116151515.0220304e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075919122DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18033142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoustafa, Sherifa F.14aThe anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer activities and phytochemical investigation of Cucumis melo L. cv.

However, synthetic biology and engineering efforts can raise natural metabolites' levels or introduce unnatural ones, so that previously innocuous or nonexistent spontaneous reactions become an issue. Problems arise when spontaneous reaction rates exceed the capacity of a platform organism to dispose of toxic or chemically active reaction products. While various reliable sources list competing or toxic enzymatic pathways’ side-reactions, no corresponding compilation of spontaneous side-reactions exists, nor is it possible to predict their occurrence. We addressed this deficiency by creating the Chemical Damage (CD)-MINE resource. First, we used literature data to construct a comprehensive database of metabolite reactions that occur spontaneously in physiological conditions. We then leveraged this data to construct 148 reaction rules describing the known spontaneous chemistry in a substrate-generic way. We applied these rules to all compounds in the ModelSEED database, predicting 180,891 spontaneous reactions. The resulting (CD)-MINE is available at https://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov/cdmine/#/home and through developer tools. We also demonstrate how damage-prone intermediates and end products are widely distributed among metabolic pathways, and how predicting spontaneous chemical damage helps rationalize toxicity and carbon loss using examples from published pathways to commercial products. We explain how analyzing damage-prone areas in metabolism helps design effective engineering strategies. Finally, we use the CD-MINE toolset to predict the formation of the novel damage product N-carbamoyl proline, and present mass spectrometric evidence for its presence in Escherichia coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbon 3adatabases 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aproline 3asynthetic biology 3atoxicity 0aComputational biochemistry 0aMetabolite damage 0aMetabolic engineering 0aSide-product 0aSpontaneous reaction1 aLerma-Ortiz, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6412-89301 aLiu, Filipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8701-29841 aGolubev, Alexey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2129-62051 aNiehaus, Thomas D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3575-80011 aElbadawi-Sidhu, Mona1 aFiehn, Oliver1 aHanson, Andrew D.1 aTyo, Keith EJ.1 aHenry, Christopher S.0 tMetabolic engineering.g2022 Jan., v. 69 p.302-312dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245012400220300001600344520196400360592002802324650001102352650002602363650001502389650001902404650001802423650001102441650000902452650001402461650001202475650001502487650000902502651001202511651002902523653003002552653001402582653001302596653001202609653001002621653001602631700002402647773011902671856008802790852000902878655001202887IND60590731520221119185025.0190320e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059073152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuisado-Pintado, Emilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1115-405910aMulti-scale variability of storm Ophelia 2017: The importance of synchronised environmental variables in coastal impact  ap. 287-301.  aLow frequency, high magnitude storm events can dramatically alter coastlines, helping to relocate large volumes of sediments and changing the configuration of landforms. Increases in the number of intense cyclones occurring in the Northern Hemisphere since the 1970s is evident with more northward tracking patterns developing. This brings added potential risk to coastal environments and infrastructure in northwest Europe and therefore understanding how these high-energy storms impact sandy coasts in particular is important for future management.This study highlights the evolution of Storm (formally Hurricane) Ophelia in October 2017 as it passed up and along the western seaboard of Ireland. The largest ever recorded Hurricane to form in the eastern Atlantic, we describe, using a range of environmental measurements and wave modelling, its track and intensity over its duration whilst over Ireland. The impact on a stretch of sandy coast in NW Ireland during Storm Ophelia, when the winds were at their peak, is examined using terrestrial laser scanning surveys pre- and post-storm to describe local changes of intertidal and dune edge dynamics. During maximum wind conditions (>35 knots) waves no >2m were recorded with an oblique to parallel orientation and coincident with medium to low tide (around 0.8m). Therefore, we demonstrate that anticipated widespread coastal erosion and damage may not always unfold as predicted. In fact, around 6000m3 of net erosion occurred along the 420m stretch of coastline with maximum differences in beach topographic changes of 0.8m. The majority of the sediment redistribution occurred within the intertidal and lower beach zone with some limited dune trimming in the southern section (10% of the total erosion). Asynchronous high water (tide levels), localised offshore winds as well as coastline orientation relative to the storm winds and waves plays a significant role in reducing coastal erosional impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3ahurricanes 3ainfrastructure 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3arisk 3asediments 3asurveys 3atopography 3awind 3aIreland 3aNorthern European region 0aTerrestrial laser scanner 0aHurricane 0aDune toe 0aErosion 0aBeach 0aWave run-up1 aJackson, Derek W.T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 15, v. 630 p.287-301dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.1883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245008900207300001600296506007600312520160400388592002801992596008702020596008202107506003702189650000802226650002502234650001702259650001802276650001002294650001502304650002602319700001502345700001702360700001902377700001202396700005402408773012202462856008202584852000902666655001202675IND60675897420221207082149.0191110e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-019-00820-22doi7 aPMC68423622pmcid7 a317625072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shanshan10aInsight into the Effect of Small RNA srn225147 on Mutacin IV in Streptococcus mutans  ap. 445-450.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is a serious microbe causing dental caries. Mutacin IV is an effective bacteriocin produced by S. mutans to antagonize numerous non-mutans streptococcal species. However, the posttranscriptional regulation of mutacin IV remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the effect of small RNA srn225147 on mutacin IV. The functional prediction suggested that srn225147 is involved in the production of mutacin IV, an important secondary metabolite. According to RNAhybrid and RNAPredator prediction, the mutacin IV formation-associated gene comD is a target of srn225147. We further analyzed the roles of srn225147 and comD in 20 S. mutans clinical strains with high production of mutacin IV (High-IV group) and lacking mutacin IV (None-IV group). Levels of comD expression were significantly higher in the High-IV group, whereas the Non-IV group showed relatively higher expression of srn225147, with a negative correlation observed between srn225147 and comD. Moreover, compared to the mimic negative control (NC) group, comD expression was decreased at 400-fold srn225147 overexpression but increased at approximately 1400-fold overexpression. Although the production of mutacin IV in the 1400-fold change srn225147 mimic group was larger than that in the 400-fold change mimic group, there was no significant difference in the production of mutacin IV between the srn225147 mimic group and mimic NC group. These results indicate that srn225147 has a two-way regulation effect on the expression of comD but that its regulation in the production of mutacin IV is weak.  aPublisher supplied data  aKJ2018A0223cNatural Science Fund of Education Department of Anhui province, China  a2016–40cFoundation for Innovative Research Groups of Anhui province, China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aStreptococcus mutans 3abacteriocins 3adental caries 3agenes 3aprediction 3asecondary metabolites1 aLi, Huihui1 aGuo, Zhenfei1 aGuan, Junchang1 aSun, Yu1 aZhang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7850-76430 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2019 Dec., v. 59, no. 4 p.445-450dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-019-00820-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245014600208300001400354520171500368592002802083650001002111650001302121650002202134650001602156650001402172650001902186650001502205650001602220650001302236650001302249650001302262650002502275651001302300653001802313653001602331653002702347653002702374700001602401700001702417700001502434700001602449700001802465700001602483700001302499773010902512856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60564194720221123020900.0180830e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Liliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1933-134X10aDemographic, clinical and pathological features of sudden deaths due to myocarditis: Results from a state-wide population-based autopsy study  ap. 81-86.  aCauses of sudden cardiac deaths have been widely reported with limited data focused specifically on myocarditis. A retrospective review of cases from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), State of Maryland yielded a total of 103 sudden unexpected deaths (SUDs) due to myocarditis (0.17% of all SUDs and 0.70% of autopsied SUDs) from 2005 through 2014. Most deaths occurred in patients <30 years of age with a male:female ratio 1.3:1. Of the 103 cases, 45 (43.7%) patients were witnessed collapsed. Four deaths occurred during exertion, such as exercising at the gym or performing heavy physical work, and 2 deaths were associated with emotional stress. The common cardiac macroscopic findings included ventricular dilatation (39.8%), mild coronary stenosis (17.5%), mottled myocardial appearance (15.5%), and myocardial fibrosis (10.7%). The histological classification of myocarditis was based on the predominant type of inflammatory cell infiltration. In our study group, lymphocytic myocarditis was most common, accounting for 56 cases (54.4%), followed by neutrophilic (32 cases, 31.7%), eosinophilic (13 cases, 12.6%) and giant cell type (2 cases, 1.9%). Microscopic examination revealed myocyte necrosis in 69 cases (67.0%) and interstitial or perivascular fibrosis in 48 cases (46.6%). The percentage of myocyte necrosis was 75.0% (42/58 cases) in lymphocytic, 65.6% (21/31 cases) in neutrophilic, 30.8% (4/13 cases) in eosinophilic, and 100% (2/2 cases) in giant cell myocarditis. Determination of myocarditis as cause of death continues to present a major challenge to forensic pathologists, because histopathologic findings can be subtle and the diagnosis of myocarditis remains difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3afibrosis 3aforensic sciences 3agiant cells 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3amicroscopy 3amyocarditis 3anecropsy 3anecrosis 3apatients 3apsychological stress 3aMaryland 0aSudden deaths 0aMyocarditis 0aDilated cardiomyopathy 0aCertainty of diagnosis1 aZhang, Yang1 aBurke, Allen1 aXue, Aimin1 aZhao, Ziqin1 aFowler, David1 aShen, Yiwen1 aLi, Ling0 tForensic science international.g2017 Mar., v. 272 p.81-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011700178300001800295520103500313592002801348650002401376650001801400650001501418650001801433650001301451650004301464650001301507650002201520653001801542653001901560653001801579653002401597653002001621700002201641700002101663700002101684700002101705700002501726773012601751856008601877852000901963655001201972IND60759191420221116151444.0220304e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075919142DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18056052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkoduwa, Stanley I.

All the components C1 to C9 were purified and screened for hypoglycaemic activities in type-2 diabetic rats. The most potent hypoglycaemic component was elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic (1D-, 2D-NMR, GC-MS, FTIR) data analysis. The Component C5 was found to be the most potent hypoglycaemic in reducing blood glucose by 12.55 ± 3.55% at 4 h post-oral administration, when compared to the positive (18.07 ± 1.20%) and negative (−1.99 ± 0.43%) controls. The spectroscopic data analysis reveals that the isolated compound has a structure consistent with 11β,13-dihydrovernolide. The isolated compound is part of the hypoglycaemic components present in V. amygdalina leaves that is responsible for the anti-diabetic activities. Further research is needed in the development of this compound or its derivatives for pharmaceutical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVernonia amygdalina 3ablood glucose 3achloroform 3afractionation 3amethanol 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aresearch 3aspectral analysis 0aAnti-diabetic 0ahyperglycaemia 0ahypoglycaemic 0aVernonia amygdalina 0aType-2 diabetes1 aUmar, Isma'ila A.1 aJames, Dorcas B.1 aInuwa, Hajiya M.1 aHabila, James D.1 aVenditti, Alessandro0 tNatural product research.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 35, no. 24 p.5943-5947dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.18056053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245009600203506007600299520123900375592002801614506003701642650001901679650002501698650001301723650001501736650002701751650001001778650001301788650001501801650002001816650001301836650000901849650002801858650001601886650002501902700002001927700002501947700002901972700002002001700002202021700002302043773012002066856007402186852000902260655001202269IND60670019820221207134035.0190925e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067001982DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90906932doi7 aPMC67700872pmcid7 a315332572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerzberg, Daniel 10aSpinal Reactive Oxygen Species and Oxidative Damage Mediate Chronic Pain in Lame Dairy Cows  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLameness in dairy cows is a worldwide prevalent disease with a negative impact on animal welfare and herd economy. Oxidative damage and antioxidant system dysfunction are common features of many CNS diseases, including chronic pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage markers in the spinal cord of dairy cows with chronic inflammatory lameness. Locomotion score was performed in order to select cows with chronic lameness. Dorsal horn spinal cord samples were obtained post mortem from lumbar segments (L2&ndash;L5), and ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), and carbonyl groups were measured along with the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total antioxidant response (TAR). Lame cows had increased levels of ROS, MDA, and carbonyl groups, while no differences were observed between lame and non-lame cows in SOD, GPx, CAT, and TAR activity. We conclude that painful chronic inflammatory lameness in dairy cows is associated with an increase in ROS, MDA, and carbonyl groups. Nonetheless, an association between ROS generation and dysfunction of the antioxidant system, as previously proposed, could not be established.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3adairy cows 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aherds 3alameness 3alocomotion 3amalondialdehyde 3amoieties 3apain 3areactive oxygen species 3aspinal cord 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aStrobel, Pablo 1 aChihuailaf, Ricardo 1 aRamirez-Reveco, Alfredo 1 aMüller, Heine 1 aWerner, Marianne 1 aBustamante, Hedie 0 tAnimals.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90906933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008300173300001500256520158800271592002801859650000801887650001601895650001601911650001101927650001101938653000901949653000801958653002301966653001101989653002302000700001902023700001902042700001902061773011002080856008802190852000902278655001202287IND60564194920221121112133.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesmyter, Stijn10aOrganic extraction of bone lysates improves DNA purification with silica beads  ap. 96-101.  aIn our standard protocol for DNA extraction from skeletal remains of unidentified bodies, bone lysates resulting from decalcification and Proteinase K treatment were purified with the DNA IQ™ Casework Pro Kit for Maxwell®16 automate (Promega, WI). Despite its success in the majority of cases, the DNA purification with paramagnetic silica beads failed in some challenging samples. This failure in DNA recovery was often associated with filter clogging during the required volume reduction of the lysate to enable loading on the automate. Two modifications to the standard method were tested for a more efficient filtering and purification. Adding collagenase to the lysate reduced the filter lead time but did not enhance DNA yield, while organic extraction of the crude lysate solved the filter clogging and resulted in successful DNA purification.The modified method in which a phenol treated lysate was loaded on the automate resulted in successful STR-profiling of the skeletal remains of all 13 unidentified bodies tested, which showed a wide variety in post mortem interval and preservation conditions. The variation in DNA yield between the 28 samples tested showed the importance of bone type selection and multiple sampling in successful STR-profiling of skeletal remains.Despite the disadvantages inherent to phenol, the organic extraction of crude bone lysates enhanced the efficiency of DNA purification with paramagnetic silica beads. The combined method of organic extraction and purification with silica beads resulted in STR-profiling of challenging bone samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acollagenase 3apeptidase K 3aphenol 3asilica 0aBone 0aDNA 0aOrganic extraction 0aSilica 0aParamagnetic beads1 aDe Cock, Greet1 aMoulin, Sabine1 aNoël, Fabrice0 tForensic science international.g2017 Apr., v. 273 p.96-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245009500213300001600308506007600324520164800400592002802048506003702076650002502113650001302138650001502151650002202166650001502188650003102203650001902234650001502253650002202268650002502290650002202315650001102337650002102348650001502369650002502384650001402409650003302423650001302456650002202469650001402491651001002505700002602515700002302541700003402564700002802598700002802626773012202654856008202776852000902858655001202867IND60675897720221207082218.0191110e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-019-00823-z2doi7 aPMC68423922pmcid7 a317625082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSujitha, Srinivasan10aGenome Investigation of a Cariogenic Pathogen with Implications in Cardiovascular Diseases  ap. 451-459.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe proportion of people suffering from cardiovascular diseases has risen by 34% in the last 15 years in India. Cardiomyopathy is among the many forms of CVD s present. Infection of heart muscles is the suspected etiological agent for the same. Oral pathogens gaining entry into the bloodstream are responsible for such infections. Streptococcus mutans is an oral pathogen with implications in cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have shown certain strains of S. mutans are found predominantly within atherosclerotic plaques and extirpated valves. To decipher the genetic differences responsible for endothelial cell invasion, we have sequenced the genome of Streptococcus mutans B14. Pan-genome analysis, search for adhesion proteins through a special algorithm, and protein–protein interactions search through HPIDB have been done. Pan-genome analysis of 187 whole genomes, assemblies revealed 6965 genes in total and 918 genes forming the core gene cluster. Adhesion to the endothelial cell is a critical virulence factor distinguishing virulent and non-virulent strains. Overall, 4% of the total proteins in S. mutans B14 were categorized as adhesion proteins. Protein–protein interaction between putative adhesion proteins and Human extracellular matrix components was predicted, revealing novel interactions. A conserved gene catalyzing the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids in S. mutans B14 shows possible interaction with isoforms of cathepsin protein of the ECM. This genome sequence analysis indicates towards other proteins in the S. mutans genome, which might have a specific role to play in host cell interaction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aadhesion 3aalgorithms 3aavirulent strains 3ablood flow 3abranched chain amino acids 3acardiomyopathy 3acathepsins 3aendothelial cells 3aextracellular matrix 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amultigene family 3amyocardium 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3avirulence 3aIndia1 aVishnu, Udayakumar S.1 aKarthikeyan, Raman1 aSankarasubramanian, Jagadesan1 aGunasekaran, Paramasamy1 aRajendhran, Jeyaprakash0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2019 Dec., v. 59, no. 4 p.451-459dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-019-00823-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005700137245022000194300001600414520138600430592002801816650001201844650001501856650001901871650003001890650001801920650002201938650001401960650002001974650001301994650001202007651000902019651001402028653001802042653002002060653001202080653001202092700002002104700005902124773012202183856007202305852000902377655001202386IND60656009720221119062017.0190812e20190802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065600972DNAL7 a10.1071/IS180782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuey, Joel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7108-055210aPhylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history of the Australian trapdoor spider genus Conothele (Araneae: Mygalomorphae: Halonoproctidae): diversification into arid habitats in an otherwise tropical radiation  ap. 628-643.  aIn Australia, climate change and continental drift have given rise to a complex biota comprising mesic specialists, arid-adapted lineages, and taxa that have arrived on the continent from Asia. We explore the phylogenetic diversity and biogeographic history of the Australian trapdoor spider genus Conothele Thorell, 1878 that is widespread in Australia’s monsoonal tropics and arid zone. We sequenced three mtDNA and five nuDNA markers from 224 specimens. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among specimens and estimated the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using species delimitation methods. The timing of divergences was estimated and ancestral area reconstructions were conducted. We recovered 61 OTUs, grouped into four major clades; a single clade represented by an arboreal ecomorph, and three fossorial clades. The Australian Conothele had a crown age of ∼19 million years, and ancestral area reconstructions showed a complex history with multiple transitions among the monsoonal tropics, central arid zone, south-west and Pilbara bioregion. Conothele arrived on the continent during periods of biotic exchange with Asia. Since then, Conothele has colonised much of the Australian arid and monsoonal zones, during a period of climatic instability. The Pilbara bioregion harbours high lineage diversity, emphasising the role of climate refugia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3ageographical distribution 3ainvertebrates 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3arefuge habitats 3ataxonomy 3atropics 3aAsia 3aAustralia 0aaridification 0aclimate refugia 0aMiocene 0aPilbara1 aHillyer, Mia J.1 aHarvey, Mark S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1482-01090 tInvertebrate systematics.g2019 Aug. 2, v. 33, no. 4 p.628-643dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957319x1447-26007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS180783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245044400160300001600604520177800620592002802398650002302426650001702449650003002466650002002496650001702516650001902533650001502552650002102567650001302588650002202601650002202623650002302645650001402668650001902682650001502701650000902716650001102725650001202736651001802748651001102766700001402777700001502791700001702806700003502823773012302858856007102981852000903052655001203061IND60517328520221121221255.0160329e20110427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051732852DNAL7 a10.1139/z11-0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFesta-Bianchet, M.10aConservation of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Canada: an uncertain future11This review is part of the virtual symposium “Flagship Species – Flagship Problems” that deals with ecology, biodiversity and management issues, and climate impacts on species at risk and of Canadian importance, including the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), and caribou (Rangifer tarandus).  ap. 419-434.  aCaribou (Rangifer tarandus (L., 1758)) play a central role in the ecology and culture of much of Canada, where they were once the most abundant cervid. Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of “Mountain” caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of “Migratory Tundra” caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada’s High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of “Boreal”, Mountain, and Peary caribou. Scientific knowledge, however, has neither effectively influenced policies nor galvanized public opinion sufficiently to push governments into effective actions. The persistence of many caribou populations appears incompatible with the ongoing pace of industrial development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadrius melodus 3aGadus morhua 3aRangifer tarandus caribou 3aUrsus maritimus 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acod (fish) 3aflagship species 3ahabitats 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amigratory behavior 3apredation 3apublic opinion 3arecreation 3arisk 3atundra 3aweather 3aArctic region 3aCanada1 aRay, J.C.1 aBoutin, S.1 aCôté, S.D.1 aGunn, Annec(Wildlife manager)0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 89, no. 5 p.419-434dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z11-0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245013100168300001800299520086800317592002801185650001601213650001201229650002401241650002001265650001101285650001901296650001601315650001501331650000901346650001801355650001201373650001701385653001801402653002401420653001901444653001501463653002501478653001001503700001301513700001201526700001701538700001701555700001401572700001901586700001301605773010201618856009001720852000901810655001201819IND60599730920221120144105.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059973092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Da10aX-ray CT guided fault-free photothermal ablation of metastatic lymph nodes with ultrafine HER-2 targeting W18O49 nanoparticles  ap. 9155-9166.  aDesigning high accuracy in the diagnosing and fault-freely eliminating lymphatic metastasis of breast malignancy, to avoid the invasiveness and complications caused by traditional assays, is of great therapeutic importance.

In the present study, antioxidant peptides were isolated and purified from hydrolysates by digestion of the pea protein with alcalase. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy utilizing the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to optimize the preparative protocol. The obtained peptides were identified by nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS and their biological activity was evaluated by the Peptide Ranker method. Our results showed that the second fraction (F1-2) purified from <1 kDa hydrolysate by Sephadex G-25 gel had good antioxidant activity, along with a DPPH radical scavenging rate of 37.94 ± 1.24% and a hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging rate of 28.43 ± 1.54% (P < 0.05). In addition, the biological activity of the identified peptide sequences was estimated, and three peptides with scores higher than 0.5 were obtained, corresponding to the sequences YSSPIHIW (0.74), ADLYNPR (0.65), and HYDSEAILF (0.53).  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acomputer simulation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agels 3ahydrolysates 3apea protein 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asubtilisin 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPea peptide 0aIsolation 0aPurification1 aLiang, Rong1 aYang, Yiying1 aSun, Na1 aLin, Songyi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Apr., v. 123 p.109126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001600283520132300299592002801622650002401650650001901674650001901693650003101712650001301743650001701756650002101773650001101794650001401805650001701819650002201836650001801858650001801876650001501894650002701909650002801936650001501964650003601979650001502015653000902030653000902039653001002048653001102058653000902069653001302078653000702091653001102098653001302109653000902122653001002131653000902141653000802150653000802158653001002166653000902176653001102185653000802196653000802204653000902212653000802221653000902229653000902238653000902247653001302256653002002269653002402289653001702313653001902330700002002349773011102369856008202480852000902562655001202571IND60086526920221118230819.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008652692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuan-Chuen10aIn vitro anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin in the Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric adenocarcinoma cells  ap. 376-383.  aInfection with Helicobacter pylori causes extensive gastric epithelial cell inflammation which may progress to atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and even gastric adenocarcinoma. Apigenin (4′,5,7-Trihydroxyflavone) is widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and is a well-known antiinflammatory supplement with low cytotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of apigenin in H. pylori-infected MKN45 cells, for which IκBα, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-1β, and mucin-2 (MUC-2) expressions were examined. Apigenin treatments (9.3–74μM) significantly increased the IκBα expression, and thus inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, and the inflammatory factor (COX-2, ICAM-1, ROS, IL-6, and IL-8) expressions decreased. The ROS levels decreased partially based on the intrinsic scavenging property of apigenin. In summary, apigenin treatments effectively inhibited NF-κB activation and the related inflammatory factor expressions, as well as increased MUC-2 expression in the H. pylori-infected MKN45 cells. The compound shows great potential as a candidate agent for the inhibition of H. pylori-induced extensive gastric epithelial cell inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aIKappaB kinase 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapigenin 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelial cells 3afruits 3agastritis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3ametaplasia 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicology 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avegetables 0aAP-1 0aCagA 0aCOX-2 0aERK1/2 0aEtBr 0aH2DCF-DA 0aHE 0aICAM-1 0aIKKα/β 0aIL-8 0aMUC-2 0aiNOS 0aJNK 0aLPS 0a5-LOH 0aMAPK 0aNF-κB 0aNIK 0aNox 0aPGE2 0aROS 0aTRL4 0aT4SS 0aVacA 0aApigenin 0aOxidative burst 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aInflammation 0aGastric cancer1 aHuang, Kai-Ming0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.376-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245007800131300001600209520142400225592002801649650002301677650001401700650001301714650002301727650002301750650001501773650001101788650001901799650001701818650001301835650001101848650001201859650000901871650002801880650000901908651001001917653002301927653003501950653001801985700001202003700001902015700001502034773018302049852000902232655001202241IND60128394320221119054316.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhiyun, Ouyang10aEcosystem Regulating Services and their Valuation of Hainan Island, China  ap. 132-140.  aEcosystem services were defined as the conditions and processes through which natural ecosystems, and the species that make them up, sustain and fulfill human life. They include provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. These form the basis on which regional environmental reserves and development are assessed and for the valuation of ecosystem services. In this paper Hainan Island is used as an example to explore methods of regulating services based on the structure and processes of a natural ecosystem. Ecosystems were classified into 13 types: valley rain forest, mountainous rain forest, tropical monsoon forest, mountainous coppice forest, mountainous evergreen forest, tropical coniferous forest, shrubs, plantation, timber forest, windbreak forest, mangrove, savanna, and crop land. Regulating services and their economic values for Hainan Island ecosystems were assessed and evaluated in terms of water—holding, soil conservancy, nutrient cycle, C fixation and windbreak functions. The economic value of the regulating services in 2002 were estimated at 2035.88×10⁸ to 2153.39×10⁸ Chinese Yuan (CNY), which was eight times the value of provisioning services (wood and agricultural products), estimated at just 254.06×10⁸ CNY. Our analyses imply that ecosystem regulating services play a very important role in the sustainable development of Hainan Island's society and economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconiferous forests 3acoppicing 3acropland 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3amonsoon season 3arain forests 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3asociety 3asoil 3asustainable development 3awood 3aChina 0aecosystem services 0aecological regulating services 0aHainan Island1 aYu, Jin1 aTongqian, Zhao1 aHua, Zheng0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.132-140dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007600168300001100244500001100255520201500266592002802281650001402309650001002323650002902333650001202362650002002374650001502394650001302409650001302422650001102435650002602446650001502472650003202487650001602519650001702535650001202552650001502564650001702579650001002596651001102606700002202617773012602639856008202765852000902847655001202856IND60485940720221122051437.0180619e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594072DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0345-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanzlik, Kristin10aMethods to conduct and analyse weed surveys in arable farming: a review  ap. 11.  aReview  aArable weeds always accompany arable farming; however, species and abundances vary in space and change in time. Surveys assess weeds on a large spatial scale. The regional and national importance, the abundances in which weeds occur, is derived from surveys. Environmental and management background data assist to explain the weed vegetation. Arable weed surveys can have an agronomic, a botanical or an ecological purpose—we approach the agronomic viewpoint. Scientific value results from spatial data about the arable weed vegetation for modelling the dependencies and predicting future changes on a large scale. Researchers, botanists, farmers, advisors, herbicide manufacturers and other industry players engaged in weed control can get rationale spatial impressions of trends in the weed vegetation. This review focuses on methodical aspects of weed surveys. Forty-three surveys on farmed fields, mainly but not exclusively undertaken in Europe, done in up to nine crops per survey covering periods of 1 to 67 years and including 59 to 4423 fields were excerpted for suitable methods to conduct and analyse surveys. The methods reflect agronomic and other targets, e.g. from vegetation science. When accessing existing data, the interdependencies of the layout and all targets should be handled with care. When setting up surveys for agronomic purpose, it is worthwhile to include 3 years and apply stratified sampling. We recommend assessing abundances rather than presence only. Weed survey data is most suitable for applying multivariate statistics. We recommend using proven methods, without discouraging to explore others. To collect sound explanatory data demands for robust contacts with land managers. Explanatory variables are important in survey analyses to extract knowledge about the drivers of the weed vegetation. We conclude that extra value can be obtained from existing weed survey data. We propose to setup public–private partnerships as a way to carry on with arable weed surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanists 3acrops 3aenvironmental management 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3aherbicides 3aindustry 3amanagers 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aprediction 3apublic-private partnerships 3aresearchers 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aEurope1 aGerowitt, Bärbel0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2016 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.11-11dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0345-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245014100176300001600317520129600333592002801629650001001657650001001667650001801677650001701695650001101712650002501723650001701748650001301765653001801778653002401796653001701820653001701837653002901854653002301883700001601906700002001922700005901942700001802001700001902019700005402038773012602092856008802218852000902306655001202315IND60564195320221121145250.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelot, Harmonie10aEffect of drug precursors and chemicals relevant to clandestine laboratory investigation on plastic bags used for collection and storage  ap. 106-112.  aIn the area of clandestine laboratory investigations, plastic bags are used to collect and store evidence, such as solvents, precursors, and other compounds usually employed for the manufacturing of drugs (although liquids may be stored in glass containers within the bags first). In this study, three different types of plastic bags were provided by the NSW Police Force and investigated for their suitability for evidence collection: two different types of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and one type of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bag. Three different experiments were carried out: (1) storing relevant chemicals in the bags for up to three months; (2) exposing the bags including their content to accelerated conditions using a weatherometer, and (3) simulating an expected real case scenario. This study indicates that drugs and related chemicals stored in plastic bags may lead to a change in the composition of the chemical and an alteration or degradation of the plastic bag. All experiments led to the same conclusion: the polyvinyl chloride bags appeared to be the most affected. LDPE bags seem to be more appropriate for routine use, although it has been established they are not suitable for the collection of liquids (unless pre-packaged in, for instance, a glass container).  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aglass 3amanufacturing 3aplastic bags 3apolice 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3asolvents 0aIllicit drugs 0aPrecursor chemicals 0aDrug seizure 0aPlastic bags 0aLow density polyethylene 0aPolyvinyl chloride1 aFu, Shanlin1 aStuart, Barbara1 aShimmon, Ronald1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8763-991X1 aRaymond, Tony1 aCrandell, Tony1 aRoux, Cl.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3610-420X0 tForensic science international.g2017 Apr., v. 273 p.106-112dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245005300216300001200269500001400281506007600295520195000371592002802321506003702349650001702386650001502403650001202418650002202430650001402452650001302466650001102479650000902490650001102499650001002510650001302520650001202533650001302545650001302558700002302571700002502594700002002619700002502639773012402664856008202788852000902870655001202879IND60675898120221207091248.0191110e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589812DNAL7 a10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-3372doi7 aPMC27054112pmcid7 a115594822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Soledad A.10aSampling genotypes in large pedigrees with loops  ap. 337.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been proposed to overcome computational problems in linkage and segregation analyses. This approach involves sampling genotypes at the marker and trait loci. Scalar-Gibbs is easy to implement, and it is widely used in genetics. However, the Markov chain that corresponds to scalar-Gibbs may not be irreducible when the marker locus has more than two alleles, and even when the chain is irreducible, mixing has been observed to be slow. These problems do not arise if the genotypes are sampled jointly from the entire pedigree. This paper proposes a method to jointly sample genotypes. The method combines the Elston-Stewart algorithm and iterative peeling, and is called the ESIP sampler. For a hypothetical pedigree, genotype probabilities are estimated from samples obtained using ESIP and also scalar-Gibbs. Approximate probabilities were also obtained by iterative peeling. Comparisons of these with exact genotypic probabilities obtained by the Elston-Stewart algorithm showed that ESIP and iterative peeling yielded genotypic probabilities that were very close to the exact values. Nevertheless, estimated probabilities from scalar-Gibbs with a chain of length 235 000, including a burn-in of 200 000 steps, were less accurate than probabilities estimated using ESIP with a chain of length 10 000, with a burn-in of 5 000 steps. The effective chain size (ECS) was estimated from the last 25 000 elements of the chain of length 125 000. For one of the ESIP samplers, the ECS ranged from 21 579 to 22 741, while for the scalar-Gibbs sampler, the ECS ranged from 64 to 671. Genotype probabilities were also estimated for a large real pedigree consisting of 3 223 individuals. For this pedigree, it is not feasible to obtain exact genotype probabilities by the Elston-Stewart algorithm. ESIP and iterative peeling yielded very similar results. However, results from scalar-Gibbs were less accurate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3achemical elements 3aevolution 3agenotype 3alength 3aloci 3amixing 3apaper 3apedigree 3apeeling 3asamplers 3asampling1 aFernando, Rohan L.1 aGuldbrandtsen, Bernt1 aTotir, Liviu R.1 aCarriquiry, Alicia L0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2001 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.337-337dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-3373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009000166300001400256520069700270592002800967650001300995650002801008650001301036650001501049650001201064650002201076650001001098650002001108653001501128653001401143653001301157653001301170653001301183653001501196700001501211700001801226700005501244773010901299856008801408852000901496655001201505IND60564195420221121145326.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, H.A.10aFundamental studies of the adhesion of explosives to textile and non-textile surfaces  ap. 88-95.  aThis paper describes the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the interactions between explosives crystals and different surfaces.

The adhesion force during each contact was measured, and the results are presented in this work. The results suggest that explosives crystals display a higher adhesion to smoother, non-textile surfaces, particularly glass. This finding may be of use for forensic explosives investigators when deciding the best types of debris to target for explosives recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3acrystals 3aexplosives 3afabrics 3aforensic sciences 3aglass 3atrinitrotoluene 0aExplosives 0aDetection 0aAdhesion 0aAnalysis 0aForensic 0aExplosions1 aBecker, T.1 aNic Daeid, N.1 aLewis, S.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2049-15860 tForensic science international.g2017 Apr., v. 273 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012000171300001400291506011700305506007600422520183400498592002802332506003702360650001202397650001602409650002102425650000902446650002202455650001802477650001702495650001102512650002602523650001502549650001402564650000902578650002002587650001702607650000902624650001302633651001002646653002002656653001702676653001602693653000902709653002402718653002502742653001902767700002702786773020602813856008303019852000903102655001203111IND60761212320221207141128.0220328e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076121232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrs.2021.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Zeiny, Ahmed M.10aEnvironmental and human risk assessment of heavy metals at northern Nile Delta region using geostatistical analyses  ap. 21-35.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPresent study aims to assess the possible toxic metal hazard of Pb, Cd and Fe in street dust and soil on environment and human health at the northern Deltaic region of Egypt using spatial and statistical analyses. To achieve this aim, 13 different sites were sampled for street dust and soil to represent various residential, industrial and agricultural activities. Unsupervised classification of multispectral Landsat OLI image (March 2021) helped to identify the sampling sites. Heavy metals were evaluated using environmental and human health risk indices incorporated in a GIS environment through geostatistical techniques. Multivariate analyses were demonstrated for further interpretation including principle components analysis (PCA), Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and cluster analysis (CA). The average metal concentrations in street dust for Pb, Cd and Fe were 0.57, 0.07 and 435.92 mg/kg, however in soil were 0.61, 0.08 and 1098.30 mg/kg, respectively. The mean value of Cd and Pb in soil was higher than street dust while the reverse was reported for Fe. Spatial distribution maps showed that the high levels of metals in street dust were observed in the southern parts of the study area due to industrial activities and automobile emissions. The risk assessment exhibited that the area suffers from serious metals pollution particularly Cd. Human risk assessment indicated that derma is the main exposure route that harmfully affects the human health. Exposure to the pollutant through the three pathways is higher for Pb than Cd. The values of hazard quotient (HQ) followed the next trend; Fe > Pb > Cd. The measured cancer risk was negligible in the investigated area. Statistical analysis of PCA and CCA showed that industrial and agricultural activities contribute to the occurrence of heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3aautomobiles 3acluster analysis 3adust 3aexposure pathways 3ageostatistics 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amultivariate analysis 3apollutants 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ariver deltas 3asoil 3atoxicity 3aEgypt 0aMetal pollution 0aHazard index 0aStreet dust 0aSoil 0aGeospatial analyses 0aStatistical analyses 0aRemote sensing1 aAbd El-Hamid, Hazem T.0 tThe Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (Online).g2022 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.21-35dElsevier B.V.aNational Authority of Remote Sensing & Space SciencewJournal:21570x1110-98237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrs.2021.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174300001600259520138700275592002801662650001801690650002101708650001701729650002201746650001201768650001801780650001101798650001901809650001501828650001901843650002901862650001601891650000901907650002001916650002401936650001901960650002201979650001302001650001802014650002002032650001102052651001002063653001902073653003002092653002002122653002102142653000802163700001802171700001902189700001702208773011302225856008602338852000902424655001202433IND60555400820221116162442.0180831e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055540082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasilaki, Vasileia10aWater and carbon footprint of selected dairy products: A case study in Catalonia  ap. 504-516.  aThis study assesses the LCA-based Water Footprint (WF) and Carbon Footprint (CF) of various types of yoghurts in the Spanish dairy plant of La Fageda. Primary data have been used to allocate impacts to the core processing stages. . The total amount of water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the production of 1 kg of yoghurt in La Fageda plant are 204 L H2O and 1.94 kg CO2eq respectively. The results indicated that raw milk and milk-based ingredients are the main contributors to all impact categories examined; their contribution to CO2eq ranged from 80 to 96%. Energy consumption and packaging materials have significant contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity, acidification and global warming potential (GWP) impact categories ranging from 30 to 99% when raw milk is excluded from the analysis. In terms of the direct impacts of the plant, Cleaning in Place (CIP) and cleaning operations are responsible for 70% of the water requirements, while refrigerators, pasteurisation and packaging account for 70% of the energy consumption in the facility. The water and carbon footprint varies depending on the production process and the region. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that high precipitation and application of different techniques for raw milk production increases the contribution of the direct impacts of the plant from 2% to 15% in terms of water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3acleaning in place 3adairies 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy 3afood packaging 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aingredients 3amilk 3amilk production 3apackaging materials 3apasteurization 3aprocessing stages 3araw milk 3arefrigerators 3awater footprint 3ayogurt 3aSpain 0aDairy industry 0aYogurt production process 0aWater footprint 0aCarbon footprint 0aLCA1 aKatsou, Evina1 aPonsá, Sergio1 aColón, Joan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 139 p.504-516dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245010800125300001600233520132100249592002801570650001201598650002201610650001901632650002001651650001501671650002901686650001201715650001201727650001501739650001101754650001501765650001101780650003001791651001001821653002101831653002401852653002801876700001601904700001601920700001401936700001501950773018301965852000902148655001202157IND60128394620221119054833.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Guo10aAnalysis of Spatial-Temporal Changes in the Landscape Structure of Yushu Prefecture in Qinghai Province  ap. 158-161.  aYushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, an area located in the Qinghai—Tibet Plateau, is an area very sensitive to global climate change. Due to impacts from climate change and human disturbances, grassland vegetation in the area has been degraded and desertification has been expanding. Ecosystems in the area are very sensitive and fragile and ecological problems have become increasingly serious in the area, resulting in an adverse effect on the local socio—economic development and environment of Qinghai province. Using data gathered from Landsat TM/ETM images for 1987, 1997 and 2007, we analyzed landscape patterns across Yushu Prefecture. Spatial structure indices indicated that: (i) the area of grassland has significantly decreased in the form of degradation and conversion from grassland into bare land and farmland; (ii) grassy vegetation patches changed into fragmented and isolated patches; (iii) the main landscapes in Yushu Prefecture are grasslands, forests and rivers; (iv) patches of grass have relatively high connectivity; and (v) landscape change is significantly correlated with human activities and climate change. This study provides a strong theoretical and technical basis for policy—making regarding environmental protection of and management in Yushu Prefecture of Qinghai Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3adesertification 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental protection 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3arivers 3asocioeconomic development 3aChina 0aYushu Prefecture 0alandscape structure 0aspatial-temporal change1 aDayuan, Xue1 aShihong, Du1 aQi, Huang1 aLiang, Cai0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.158-161dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010800176520161500284592002801899650002701927650002101954650001601975650002101991650001702012650001702029650002102046650002402067650000902091650001602100650001602116650000902132651001102141653002502152653001902177653001802196653002002214653002802234700002902262700002502291700002502316700002902341700002202370773010102392856008502493852000902578655001202587IND60761212420221118191235.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076121242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2021.1259172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcon, Amanda Köche10aGrowth ring response of two Atlantic Forest tree species pre- and post-dam operation in Southern Brazil  aHydropower plants are important sources of renewable energy, but the climatic impacts of their constructions remain poorly explored. Considering that tree growth analysis is a useful tool to identify environmental impacts, this study aimed at using climate records and tree-ring chronologies to understand possible local climate changes caused by the construction of a hydropower plant in the 1980s in the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil. Historical climatic data were obtained from the local meteorological station and surrounding municipalities and analyzed using ANOVA and means tests. The Pettitt test was additionally used to identify change-points in the meteorological data. Wood samples from a total of 60 trees from Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze (Araucariaceae) and Cedrela fissilis Vell. (Meliaceae) were collected, and tree-ring chronologies were built using dendrochronological standard procedures. Chronologies for A. angustifolia and C. fissilis represented time periods from 1800 to 2016 and 1899–2015, respectively. Tree-ring growth responses to climatic variables were evaluated by adjusting generalized mixed linear models and the Spearman correlations. Our results evidenced that the hydropower plant altered the local climate, mostly influencing the hydrological cycle by increasing local rainfall, with monthly rain volumes being statistically higher than in other meteorological stations. Significant responses in the growth of A. angustifolia were found to be associated with the water level increase caused by the dam and of C. fissilis due to the increase in cloud cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aCedrela fissilis 3acloud cover 3adendrochronology 3aforest trees 3agrowth rings 3ahydrologic cycle 3ameteorological data 3arain 3atree growth 3awater power 3awood 3aBrazil 0aAraucaria rainforest 0aClimate change 0aDendroecology 0aGrowth modeling 0aHydropower plant impact1 aMartins, Kelly Geronazzo1 aBotosso, Paulo Cesar1 aLonghi-Santos, Tomaz1 aBlum, Christopher Thomas1 aGalvão, Franklin0 tDendrochronologia.g2022 Feb., v. 71 p.125917-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2021.1259173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245012100207300001400328520206500342592002802407650002502435650002202460650001302482650001102495650001302506650001002519650001002529653001502539653002002554653001002574653002602584653002402610700001602634700001802650700001702668700001502685700001802700773010902718856008802827852000902915655001202924IND60564195620221121143225.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1417-278110aThree-dimensional analysis of the uniqueness of the anterior dentition in orthodontically treated patients and twins  ap. 80-87.  aDental uniqueness can be proven if no perfect match in pair-wise morphological comparisons of human dentitions is detected. Establishing these comparisons in a worldwide random population is practically unfeasible due to the need for a large and representative sample size. Sample stratification is an option to reduce sample size. The present study investigated the uniqueness of the human dentition in randomly selected subjects (Group 1), orthodontically treated patients (Group 2), twins (Group 3), and orthodontically treated twins (Group 4) in comparison with a threshold control sample of identical dentitions (Group 5). The samples consisted of digital cast files (DCF) obtained through extraoral 3D scanning. A total of 2.013 pair-wise morphological comparisons were performed (Group 1 n=110, Group 2 n=1.711, Group 3 n=172, Group 4 n=10, Group 5 n=10) with Geomagic Studio® (3D Systems®, Rock Hill, SC, USA) software package. Comparisons within groups were performed quantifying the morphological differences between DCF in Euclidean distances. Comparisons between groups were established applying One-way ANOVA. To ensure fair comparisons a post-hoc Power Analysis was performed. ROC analysis was applied to distinguish unique from non-unique dentures. Identical DCF were not detected within the experimental groups (from 1 to 4). The most similar DCF had Euclidian distance of 5.19mm in Group 1, 2.06mm in Group 2, 2.03mm in Group 3, and 1.88mm in Group 4. Groups 2 and 3 were statistically different from Group 5 (p<0.05). Statistically significant difference between Group 4 and 5 revealed to be possible including more pair-wise comparisons in both groups. The ROC analysis revealed sensitivity rate of 80% and specificity between 66.7% and 81.6%. Evidence to sustain the uniqueness of the human dentition in random and stratified populations was observed in the present study. Further studies testing the influence of the quantity of tooth material on morphological difference between dentitions and its impact on uniqueness remain necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acomputer software 3adentures 3ahumans 3apatients 3ateeth 3atwins 0aUniqueness 0aHuman dentition 0aTwins 0aOrthodontic treatment 0aForensic odontology1 aWillems, G.1 aSouza, P.H.C.1 aTanaka, O.M.1 aCoucke, W.1 aThevissen, P.0 tForensic science international.g2017 Apr., v. 273 p.80-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001800260520123400278592002801512650003401540650002101574650001501595650000901610650001601619650001801635650001401653650001901667650001301686650003301699650001101732650002001743650002201763700001701785700002001802700002301822700001901845700001701864700001801881700003101899700002301930773009801953856008602051852000902137655001202146IND60577698020221116151531.0170810e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057769802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b034992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyachi, Mariko10aPhotocurrent Generation of Reconstituted Photosystem II on a Self-Assembled Gold Film  ap. 1351-1358.  aPhotosystem II (PSII)-modified gold electrodes were prepared by the deposition of PSII reconstituted with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on Au electrodes. PtNPs modified with 1-[15-(3,5,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone-2-yl)]pentadecyl disulfide ((TMQ(CH₂)₁₅S)₂) were incorporated into the QB site of PSII isolated from thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The reconstitution was confirmed by QA-reoxidation measurements. PSII reconstituted with PtNPs was deposited and integrated on a Au(111) surface modified with 4,4′-biphenyldithiol. The cross section of the reconstituted PSII film on the Au electrode was investigated by SEM. Absorption spectra showed that the surface coverage of the electrode was about 18 pmol PSII cm–². A photocurrent density of 15 nAcm–² at E = +0.10 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was observed under 680 nm irradiation. The photoresponse showed good reversibility under alternating light and dark conditions. Clear photoresponses were not observed in the absence of PSII and molecular wire. These results supported the photocurrent originated from PSII and moved to a gold electrode by light irradiation, which also confirmed conjugation with orientation through the molecular wire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermosynechococcus elongatus 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3agold 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3ananowires 3aphotosystem II 3aplatinum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3aspectral analysis1 aIkehira, Shu1 aNishiori, Daiki1 aYamanoi, Yoshinori1 aYamada, Masato1 aIwai, Masako1 aTomo, Tatsuya1 aAllakhverdiev, Suleyman I.1 aNishihara, Hiroshi0 tLangmuir.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 33, no. 6 p.1351-1358dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b034993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245016700205300001800372520153300390592002801923650002901951650002701980650001502007650002002022650002102042650002502063650001302088650002102101650001502122650001502137650002202152650002402174650001602198650001102214650001102225650002502236650002002261650001802281650001502299651001002314653002102324653002402345653002202369653004202391653002002433653002502453700001902478700001602497773010902513856008502622852000902707655001202716IND60625165820221119120306.0190326e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062516582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Hongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4190-215310aUsing multivariate statistical analyses to identify and evaluate the main sources of contamination in a polluted river near to the Liaodong Bay in Northeast China  ap. 1058-1070.  aUsing multivariate statistical analysis, the study evaluated anthropogenic sources of river water contamination and their relationships with river water quality in the Haicheng River basin near to the Liaodong Bay in Northeast China. The results showed that nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) were identified as the main pollutants in the river water by factor analysis. Human population and elevational gradient were all significantly correlated with N, P, and other water quality variables in correlation analysis and explained chemical oxygen demand (COD), N, and P variables from 23.9% (TN) to 53.1% (NH3+-N) of the total variances in regression analysis, indicating that population and its distribution were all responsible for river contaminations, especially for COD, N, and P contaminations. The excessive applications of fertilizers and pesticides were all positively correlated with nitrogen variables and nitrogen pollution factor in correlation analysis, suggesting that agricultural activities were contributed to the river nitrogen pollution. Due to inadequate or lack wastewater treatment facilities, huge amounts of domestic sewage and industrial effluents were released into the river, becoming the predominant anthropogenic sources for the river water deterioration of COD, N, and P. Multivariate statistical analysis provided useful tools to correlate sources of contamination with water quality data. This approach will provide a better management for river pollution control in a human-driven river ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achemical oxygen demand 3aecosystems 3afactor analysis 3ahuman population 3aindustrial effluents 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apesticides 3aphosphorus 3apollution control 3aregression analysis 3ariver water 3arivers 3asewage 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aHuman activities 0aRiver water quality 0aPopulation growth 0aFertilizer and pesticide applications 0aDomestic sewage 0aIndustrial effluents1 aSong, Xianfang1 aZhang, Yuan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Feb., v. 245 p.1058-1070dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04174naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006300137245010000200300001600300520243700316592002802753650001202781650001702793650000902810650001802819650001102837650002302848650001202871650001102883650001402894650001402908650001502922650001702937650001002954650001902964650001202983650001302995651001603008651002003024653001103044653001603055653001203071653002203083653002103105653002103126700006403147700002303211700006103234700002103295700001803316700002603334700002803360773011503388856007203503852000903575655001203584IND60656010320221119060157.0190812e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065601032DNAL7 a10.1071/WR181182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaggart, Patrick L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9523-046310aEvidence of significantly higher island feral cat abundance compared with the adjacent mainland  ap. 378-385.  aContext. Feral cats (Felis catus) impact the health and welfare of wildlife, livestock and humans worldwide. They are particularly damaging where they have been introduced into island countries such as Australia and New Zealand, where native prey species evolved without feline predators. Kangaroo Island, in South Australia, is Australia’s third largest island and supports several threatened and endemic species. Cat densities on Kangaroo Island are thought to be greater than those on the adjacent South Australian mainland, based on one cat density estimate on the island that is higher than most estimates from the mainland. The prevalence of cat-borne disease in cats and sheep is also higher on Kangaroo Island than the mainland, suggesting higher cat densities. A recent continental-scale spatial model of cat density predicted that cat density on Kangaroo Island should be about double that of the adjacent mainland. However, although cats are believed to have severe impacts on some native species on the island, other species that are generally considered vulnerable to cat predation have relatively secure populations on the island compared with the mainland. Aims. The present study aimed to compare feral cat abundance between Kangaroo Island and the adjacent South Australian mainland using simultaneous standardised methods. Based on previous findings, we predicted that the relative abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island would be approximately double that on the South Australian mainland. Methods. Standardised camera trap surveys were used to simultaneously estimate the relative abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island and the adjacent South Australian mainland. Survey data were analysed using the Royle–Nichols abundance-induced heterogeneity model to estimate feral cat relative abundance at each site. Key results. Cat abundance on the island was estimated to be over 10 times greater than that on the adjacent mainland. Conclusions. Consistent with predictions, cat abundance on the island was greater than on the adjacent mainland. However, the magnitude of this difference was much greater than expected. Implications. The findings show that the actual densities of cats at local sites can vary substantially from predictions generated by continental-scale models. The study also demonstrates the value of estimating abundance or density simultaneously across sites using standardised methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acat diseases 3acats 3aferal animals 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3amodels 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3aprey species 3asheep 3asheep diseases 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Australia 0afeline 0aFelis catus 0ainsular 0ainvasive predator 0ainvasive species 0apest management.1 aFancourt, Bronwyn A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2969-15301 aBengsen, Andrew J.1 aPeacock, David E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2891-82381 aHodgens, Patrick1 aRead, John L.1 aMcAllister, Milton M.1 aCaraguel, Charles G.

The results revealed that the aqueous fraction with the latest onset of myoclonic convulsions (1095 ± 45**** s) was the most biologically active one. This was followed by LC-HR-MS-coupled metabolic profiling which led to dereplication of 8 compounds from that fraction. A molecular docking study was performed on the dereplicated compounds to discover the main responsible ones for the activity.

In this view, urban pedestrians assume a key role in determining city livability in dense built environments, typically much more polluted than suburban or rural areas. Despite that, urban heat island experimental studies are pretty focused on data collected by means of permanent microclimate stations for environmental monitoring, also coupled with satellite measurements or mobile stations equipped over transportation media. This work deals with the development, experimental startup with field test and critical data analysis of a brand new wearable system for microclimate and air quality investigation, just developed with the purpose to characterize livability environmental conditions which affect urban population wellbeing. To this aim, the experimental tool definition and the first field test are carried out in a historical city centre in Italy, where cluster analysis is performed in order to also identify the role of urban design in affecting key microclimate parameters such as air temperature, solar radiation, daylight, air pollution and pedestrian thermal comfort in general. The analysis showed that very site-specific environmental conditions may be detected while several environmental spheres are investigated by the novel wearable system in summer conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aheat island 3amicroclimate 3arural areas 3asatellites 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3aurban population 3aItaly 0aUrban heat island 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aWearable system 0aThermal comfort 0aMicroclimate 0aAir quality 0aUrban resilience1 aPisello, Anna Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4527-64440 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 15, v. 630 p.690-706dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245015800207300001400365506007600379520054000455592002800995506003701023650001301060650001801073650001001091650004401101700001301145700002601158700001601184773010601200856008101306852000901387655001201396IND60485941220221207114410.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-015-0084-02doi7 aPMC47495232pmcid7 a267917522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liang-Yan14aThe Use of a Combination of RDC and Chiroptical Spectroscopy for Determination of the Absolute Configuration of Fusariumin A from the Fungus Fusarium sp.  ap. 41-48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new alkylpyrrole derivative, fusariumin A (1), was isolated from the culture broth of the fungus Fusarium sp.

It is worth to note that in this study without the aid of the RDC analysis, an unambiguous determination of configuration and conformation was not feasible due to the excessive conformational possibilities of this open-chain compound.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium 3aculture media 3afungi 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aSun, Han1 aGriesinger, Christian1 aLiu, Ji-Kai0 tNat.

CSBF previously extracted using alkali and peroxide at atmospheric pressure were coarse (>45 dtex) or contained high lignin content (>11.8%), which limited their industrial applications in textiles. We found that alkali removed lignin more thoroughly at 130 °C, especially with the assistance of bacteria pretreatment. Fibers after bacteria and alkali treatments had fineness reduced to 24.0 dtex and lignin content decreased to 3%. CSBF/cotton blended yarns from our CSBF had better evenness and breaking strength than jute/cotton blends. Fabrics from CSBF/cotton blended yarns had higher bursting strength, softer and smoother handle compared to the fabrics of jute/cotton blends. Dye sorption of Reactive Red 120 on CSBF was 15.7% higher than that on cotton. Dyed fabric of CSBF/cotton blends had the same laundering and light colorfastness, but slightly lower staining and wet crocking colorfastness than 100% cotton fabric. Overall, CSBF in our study could be used as a good alternative to traditional bast fibers for highly valuable textile applications. The research results will not only enhance the sustainability of fiber industry but also alleviate the environmental pressure.  aPublisher supplied data  cJiangnan Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004028  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUniversity of Nebraska-Lincolndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000081140 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkali treatment 3aatmospheric pressure 3abacteria 3abark 3acotton fabric 3afineness 3aindustrial applications 3ajute 3alaundry 3alignin 3alint cotton 3areactive dyes 3asorption 3astaining 3atextile industry 3ayarns 0aBark of cotton stalks 0aLignin 0aAlkali treatment 0aNatural fibers 0aAgricultural byproduct 0aSustainability1 aHou, Xiuliang1 aHaigler, Ian1 aYang, Yiqi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 139 p.267-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002900189245008000218300001200298500001400310506007600324520141500400592002801815506003701843650001201880650001001892650001101902650001401913650002701927650002001954650002201974650001901996650001102015650000902026650002702035650001402062650001502076650001602091650001202107700001902119700002102138773012402159856008202283852000902365655001202374IND60675898520221207090738.0191110e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589852DNAL7 a10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-4332doi7 aPMC27054152pmcid7 a115594852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAranguren-Méndez, José10aGenetic diversity in Spanish donkey breeds using microsatellite DNA markers  ap. 433.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic diversity at 13 equine microsatellite loci was compared in five endangered Spanish donkey breeds: Andaluza, Catalana, Mallorquina, Encartaciones and Zamorano-Leonesa. All of the equine microsatellites used in this study were amplified and were polymorphic in the domestic donkey breeds with the exception of HMS1, which was monomorphic, and ASB2, which failed to amplify. Allele number, frequency distributions and mean heterozygosities were very similar among the Spanish donkey breeds. The unbiased expected heterozygosity (HE) over all the populations varied between 0.637 and 0.684 in this study. The low GST value showed that only 3.6% of the diversity was between breeds (P < 0.01). Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were shown for a number of locus-population combinations, except HMS5 that showed agreement in all analysed populations. The cumulative exclusion probability (PE) was 0.999 in each breed, suggesting that the loci would be suitable for donkey parentage testing. The constructed dendrogram from the DA distance matrix showed little differentiation between Spanish breeds, but great differentiation between them and the Moroccan ass and also with the horse, used as an outgroup. These results confirm the potential use of equine microsatellite loci as a tool for genetic studies in domestic donkey populations, which could also be useful for conservation plans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aasses 3abreeds 3aevolution 3afrequency distribution 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahorses 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3apopulation 3aprobability 3atesting1 aJordana, Jordi1 aGómez, Mariano,0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2001 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.433-433dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-33-4-4333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245013800130300001600268520153100284592002801815650001201843650002901855650001801884650001401902650001901916650004301935650001901978650001101997650001702008650002202025650001502047650001202062650001202074650001502086650001302101651001802114653001902132653001902151653003202170653002202202700001602224700001702240700001802257700001702275773018302292852000902475655001202484IND60128395120221119053146.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiping, Zhang10aIdentifying Alpine Wetlands in the Damqu River Basin in the Source Area of the Yangtze River using Object-Based Classification Method  ap. 186-192.  aAlpine wetlands are very sensitive to global change, have great impacts on the hydrological condition of rivers, and are closely related to peoples' living in lower reaches. It is essential to monitor alpine wetland changes to appropriately manage and protect wetland resources; however, it is quite difficult to accurately extract such information from remote sensing images due to spectral confusion and arduous field verification. In this study, we identified different wetland types in the Damqu River Basin located in the Yangze River source region from Landsat remote sensing data using the object-based method. In order to ensure the interpretation accuracy of wetland, a digital elevation model (DEM) and its derived data (slope, aspect), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Kauth-Thomas transformation were considered as the components of the spectral characteristics of wetland types. The spectral characteristics, texture features and spatial structure characteristics of each wetland type were comprehensively analyzed based on the success of image segmentation. The extraction rules for each wetland type were established by determining the thresholds of the spatial, texture and spectral attributes of typical parameter layers according to their histogram statistics. The classification accuracy was assessed using error matrixes and field survey verification data. According to the accuracy assessment, the total accuracy of image classification was 89%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adigital elevation models 3aglobal change 3ahydrology 3aimage analysis 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aspatial data 3aspectral analysis 3astatistics 3asurveys 3atexture 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aYangtze River 0aalpine wetland 0aremote sensing 0aobject-based classification 0aDamqu River Basin1 aYili, Zhang1 aLinshan, Liu1 aMingjun, Ding1 aXueru, Zhang0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.186-192dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245012600160300001600286520139100302592002801693650002501721650001501746650002601761650002601787650002201813650002601835650001301861650001501874650002701889650001301916650002201929650001301951651001201964700002201976700002201998700002002020773010702040856007102147852000902218655001202227IND60517329120221121021845.0160329e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051732912DNAL7 a10.1139/z11-1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeatty, William S.10aGenetic structure of a Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) population inhabiting a fragmented agricultural ecosystem  ap. 101-109.  aFragmentation has drastically altered the quality of habitats throughout numerous ecosystems, often leading to dramatic changes in the composition of wildlife communities. The ecology and associated movement behavior of a species may also be modified as a result of forest fragmentation, resulting in changes in genetic composition of the affected species. In this research, we evaluated the genetic structure of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana Kerr, 1792) at the landscape and local scales in a fragmented, agricultural ecosystem in northern Indiana using 13 microsatellite loci. We examined 290 samples from opossums inhabiting 28 discrete habitat patches, and evaluated partitioning of genetic variation of opossums among and within habitat patches. We observed low but significant levels of genetic structure (FST = 0.005) overall, and pairwise comparisons of FST values among habitat patches also were relatively low. Relatedness within patches was highly variable (–0.077 ≤ rₓy ≤ 0.060), with a few patches exhibiting significantly higher levels of relatedness than random expectations, and we detected no evidence of sex-biased natal dispersal. These results contrast with previous field studies that documented male-biased dispersal in the Virginia opossum, indicating dispersal in this species is plastic and dependent upon local environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidelphis virginiana 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aopossums 3aspecies dispersal 3awildlife 3aIndiana1 aBeasley, James C.1 aDharmarajan, Guha1 aRhodes, Olin E.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 90, no. 1 p.101-109dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z11-1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007000166300001800236520126400254592002801518650002001546650001101566650001301577650002001590650001401610650000901624650001901633650001201652653002101664653001301685653002901698653002301727653001001750653002301760700001601783700001601799700001801815773011601833856008401949852000902033655001202042IND60121973920221118192534.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197392DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9583752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahboob, Q.10aInvestment into Human Risks in Railways and Decision Optimization  ap. 1299-1313.  aThe Life Quality Index (LQI) is a rational way to establish a relationship among the resources utilized to improve human safety and the expected fatalities that can be avoided by safety improvement. This article uses the LQI approach to quantify the social benefits of a number of safety management plans for a railway facility such as level crossing (LC). We apply influence diagrams (IDs), which are the extensions of Bayesian Networks, to model and assess the life safety risks. In IDs, problems of probabilistic inference, economics-based utility values, and decision alternatives are combined and optimized. The optimal decision, which maximizes total benefits to society, is obtained for the LC. As low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) case, and is a widely accepted risk acceptance criteria in the railway industry. According to the ALARP, there exists a so-called tolerable region between the regions of intolerable and negligible risks. In the tolerable region, risk is undertaken only if a benefit is desired. To quantify socioeconomic benefits, one needs to have an additional risk acceptance criterion such as LQI. In this article we apply and discuss the advantages of the LQI and the IDs for a number of safety management plans for railway LCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aquality of life 3arailroads 3arisk 3asocial benefit 3asociety 0alife safety risk 0arailways 0arisk acceptance criteria 0alife quality index 0aALARP 0ainfluence diagrams1 aSchöne, E.1 aMaschek, U.1 aTrinckauf, J.0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1299-1313dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9583753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008300155300002000238520091000258592002801168650001501196650001401211650002301225650001601248650002501264650001501289650001101304650001301315700001401328700001501342700001501357700001601372773014401388856007401532852000901606655001201615IND60671093720221118191022.0191002e20150728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067109372DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01600b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hao10aIncorporated oxygen in MoS₂ ultrathin nanosheets for efficient ORR catalysis  ap. 16050-16056.  aControllable engineering of high-electronegativity oxygen (O)-heteroatoms into MoS₂ ultrathin nanosheets is realized via a facile post-modification process. The incorporated oxygen atoms impart a dramatically enhanced ORR activity to the pristine nanosheets, with a 7.8-fold current increase as well as 180 mV and 160 mV positive shifts in both onset and half-wave potentials that are almost comparable with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, oxygen incorporation also triggers a transformation of the process from two-electron to a four-electron process. The improved topical conductivity, as well as the preferential adsorption of oxygen molecules originating from the heteroatoms engineering is supposed to be responsible for the efficient ORR. The prospect of controllably engineering heteroatoms into MoS₂ ultrathin nanosheets with versatile applications is also highlighted in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aplatinum1 aFeng, Xun1 aDu, Cuicui1 aWu, Siyuan1 aSong, Wenbo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 July 28, v. 3, no. 31 p.16050-16056dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01600b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002200135245015300157300001500310520172700325592002802052650001102080650001802091650001002109650001502119650001302134650000902147650001202156650001202168650000902180650002202189650002202211650000902233650002302242650001702265650000902282650001202291650001602303700002202319700002402341700001902365700002102384773015202405856006902557856010502626990002302731852000902754655001202763IND60643199720221118050131.0190510e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064319972DNAL7 a10.3791/580392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShionoya, Yoshiki10aEthanol-induced cervical sympathetic ganglion block applications for promoting canine inferior alveolar nerve regeneration using an artificial nerve  ap. e58039.  aPolyglycolic acid collagen (PGA-C) tubes are bio-absorbable nerve tubes filled with collagen of multi-chamber structure, which consist of thin collagen films. Favorable clinical outcomes have been achieved when using these tubes for the treatment of damaged inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). A critical factor for the successful nerve regeneration using PGA-C tubes is blood supply to the surrounding tissue. Cervical sympathetic ganglion block (CSGB) creates a sympathetic blockade in the head and neck region thus increasing blood flow in the area. To ensure an adequate effect, the blockade must be administered with local anesthetics one to two times a day for several consecutive weeks; this poses a challenge when creating animal models for investigating this technique. To address this limitation, we developed an ethanol-induced CSGB in a canine model of long-term increase in blood flow in the orofacial region. We examined whether IAN regeneration via PGA-C tube implantation can be enhanced by this model. Fourteen Beagles were each implanted with a PGA-C tube across a 10-mm gap in the left IAN. The IAN is located within the mandibular canal surrounded by bone, therefore we chose piezoelectric surgery, consisting of ultrasonic waves, for bone processing, in order to minimize the risk of nerve and vessel injury. A good surgical outcome was obtained with this approach. A week after surgery, seven of these dogs were subjected to left CSGB by injection of ethanol. Ethanol-induced CSGB resulted in improved nerve regeneration, suggesting that the increased blood flow effectively promotes nerve regeneration in IAN defects. This canine model can contribute to further research on the long-term effects of CSGB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aanimal models 3ablood 3ablood flow 3acollagen 3adogs 3aethanol 3aganglia 3ahead 3alocal anesthetics 3along term effects 3aneck 3anerve regeneration 3anerve tissue 3arisk 3asurgery 3aultrasonics1 aSunada, Katsuhisa1 aTsujimoto, Gentarou1 aShigeno, Keiji1 aNakamura, Tatsuo0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Nov. 30, , no. 141 p.e58039-e58039dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580393Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58039/ethanol-induced-cervical-sympathetic-ganglion-block-applications-for  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05003naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014800185300001800333520260800351592002802959650002002987650002203007650003503029650003203064650002903096650001803125650001603143650001303159650001303172650002703185650001103212650003203223650002403255650002803279650001703307650001203324650001003336650002103346650002503367650002103392650001303413650002303426650004503449650001803494650002203512650001903534650002003553650001003573650007803583650001003661650002603671650002103697650004103718650001203759650002803771650001403799650004603813650003403859650002703893650002203920651001003942700002203952700001603974700002003990700001804010773011504028856008104143852000904224655001204233IND50074249620221121221034.0150121e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007424962DNAL7 a238933112pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5130-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiang-Ke10aCommunity composition and cellulase activity of cellulolytic bacteria from forest soils planted with broad-leaved deciduous and evergreen trees  ap. 1449-1458.  aCellulolytic bacteria in forest soil provide carbon sources to improve the soil fertility and sustain the nutrient balance of the forest ecological system through the decomposition of cellulosic remains. These bacteria can also be utilized for the biological conversion of biomass into renewable biofuels. In this study, the community compositions and activities of cellulolytic bacteria in the soils of forests planted with broad-leaved deciduous (Chang Qing Garden, CQG) and broad-leaved evergreen (Forest Park, FP) trees in Wuhan, China were resolved through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. All of the isolates exhibited 35 RFLP fingerprint patterns and were clustered into six groups at a similarity level of 50 %. The phylogeny analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that these RFLP groups could be clustered into three phylogenetic groups and further divided into six subgroups at a higher resolution. Group I consists of isolates from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis complex (I-A) and from Paenibacillus amylolyticus-related complex (I-B) and exhibited the highest cellulase activity among all of the cellulolytic bacteria isolates. Cluster II consists of isolates belonging to Microbacterium testaceum (II-A), Chryseobacterium indoltheticum (II-B), and Flavobacterium pectinovorum and the related complex (II-C). Cluster III consists of isolates belonging to Pseudomonas putida-related species. The community shift with respect to the plant species and the soil properties was evidenced by the phylogenetic composition of the communities. Groups I-A and I-B, which account for 36.0 % of the cellulolytic communities in the CQG site, are the dominant groups (88.4 %) in the FP site. Alternatively, the ratio of the bacteria belonging to group III (P. putida-related isolates) shifted from 28.0 % in CQG to 4.0 % in FP. The soil nutrient analysis revealed that the CQG site planted with deciduous broad-leaved trees has a richer organic nutrient (total organic carbon and total nitrogen) than the FP site planted with evergreen broad-leaved trees. Against this background, the population density and the diversity of cellulolytic bacteria in the CQG site are clearly higher than those in the FP site, and the latter was dominated with high-cellulase-activity Bacillus- and Paenibacillus-related bacteria. The canonical correspondence analysis further indicated that the distribution of these groups is correlated with the FP site, whereas groups II and III are correlated with the organic nutrient-rich CQG site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aChryseobacterium indoltheticum 3aFlavobacterium pectinovorum 3aMicrobacterium testaceum 3aPaenibacillus 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acarbon 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aforest soils 3aforests 3agenes 3anitrogen content 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrient balance 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil fertility 3asoil properties 3atrees 2aBacteriaxclassificationxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiota 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aForests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 0aChina1 aZhang, Jing Jing,1 aYu, Heng-Yu1 aCheng, Jian-Wen1 aMiao, Li-Hong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.1449-1458dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5130-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245005300182520134600235592002801581650001101609650001601620650001401636650001301650650001101663650002401674650001501698650002501713650001701738650002201755650002001777651001401797653002201811653002901833653001601862653001501878653001501893653001301908700002101921700002401942700002901966700002201995773011902017856008802136852000902224655001202233IND60756435420221116162412.0220214e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075643542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachin Ferrero, Lucas M.10aWater footprint of lemon production in Argentina  aThis work comes to fill a knowledge gap regarding the sustainability of the lemon industry. The motivation is the prominent role of the citrus sector in the economy of the northwest of Argentina and in the world: Argentina is the eighth largest producer of fresh citrus fruits, one of the four leading lemon-producing countries and the world's first lemon processor. A water footprint study is conducted to obtain relevant information on the water consumption and degradation associated with citrus production, according to the Water Footprint Network guidelines. A remarkable aspect is that most data used come mainly from actual practices and sources considering daily weather data of seven weather stations from 2012 to 2018. The green, blue and grey water footprints linked to the primary production of lemons are evaluated every year. The water footprint is distributed approximately in 69% (234 m³t⁻¹) green, 8% (30 m³t⁻¹) blue and 23% (82 m³t⁻¹) grey. In addition, the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) indicator is used for outlining the blue water sustainability, resulting in a potential for blue water deprivation of 102 m³ world eq. per tonne of harvested lemons. This work is expected to serve as a baseline to provide diagnosis and improvement opportunities in the lemon sector for public and private stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aenvironment 3agreywater 3aindustry 3alemons 3ameteorological data 3amotivation 3aprimary productivity 3astakeholders 3awater deprivation 3awater footprint 3aArgentina 0aWater consumption 0aWater scarcity footprint 0aGreen water 0aBlue water 0aGrey water 0aTucumán1 aAraujo, Paula Z.1 aValdeón, Daniel H.1 aNishihara Hun, Andrea L.1 aMele, Fernando D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 816 p.151614-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011400171300001600285520141500301592002801716650001401744650002101758650002101779650001701800650001101817650002201828650001401850650001801864650002801882651001001910653001701920653001701937653002401954653003401978653002602012700002002038700002602058700002102084700002202105700001802127700002702145773015002172856008502322852000902407655001202416IND60122549820221119101347.0210908e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012254982DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2014.9096352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmankwah, Kwadwo10aInstitutional dimensions of veterinary services reforms: responses to structural adjustment in Northern Ghana  ap. 296-315.  aThis study examines the effect of the post-1980s' structural adjustment reforms on the delivery and smallholders' use of veterinary services in two districts in Northern Ghana. Our analytical framework distinguishes between allocative, cognitive, and normative institutions to analyse the effects on four areas of service delivery: (1) prevention; (2) clinical services; (3) provision of drugs, vaccines, and other products; and (4) human health protection. The reforms were accompanied by substantial reductions in the allocation of both financial and human resources to public veterinary services; this in turn induced fragmentation in service supply, preferential service to progressive (or wealthy) farmers, and non-adherence to international protocols for livestock health reporting. A few communities self-organized to access veterinary services. Thus, the reforms triggered changes mostly in formal allocative institutions, but these triggered further changes in informal allocative, cognitive, and normative institutions that structured the impact of the reforms. The paper concludes that institutional change is not a one-off outcome of an intervention. Rather, such interventions trigger new dynamics that policy-makers and analysts need to take into account. This requires regular monitoring of anticipated and unanticipated effects of privatization and decentralization to enable policy adjustment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3adecentralization 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3aprivatization 3asustainable agriculture 3aGhana 0ainstitutions 0apublic goods 0aveterinary services 0asmallholder livestock keeping 0astructural adjustment1 aKlerkx, Laurens1 aSakyi-Dawson, Owuraku1 aKarbo, Naaminong1 aOosting, Simon J.1 aLeeuwis, Cees1 avan der Zijpp, Akke J.0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2014 July 3, v. 12, no. 3 p.296-315dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2014.9096353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014100174300001600315520144100331592002801772650001701800650001501817650001501832650002201847650001701869650002801886651001001914653003101924653003401955653001201989653003002001653004202031700001802073700002402091700001902115700002002134700002202154700002102176700002702197773015002224856008502374852000902459655001202468IND60122549920221119101555.0210908e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012254992DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2014.9096372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKpéra, G.

Using a comparative case study conducted in three villages and a framing perspective, this study aims to elucidate how stakeholders frame the presence of crocodiles, and how they use formal and informal institutions to deal with them. Respondents framed the presence of the crocodiles as problematic because of their negative effects on local livelihoods and people's tranquillity. Both causes and solutions are, however, framed differently in the three communities. Whereas in Nikki and Sakabansi, respondents seek solutions in changing the ecological environment, requiring others (the council, fishermen, and crocodiles) to change their behaviour, Fombawi respondents seek to adapt their own behaviour by respecting and applying traditional and practical rules for sharing their dam. Damage per crocodile is the highest in Nikki and the lowest in Fombawi, suggesting that the crocodiles in Nikki behave more aggressively than those in Fombawi. Further investigation is merited to determine whether or not crocodiles behave less aggressively when dealt with according to specific institutions. Intensive communication among stakeholders in the three villages is recommended to exchange experiences and ideas that may support a peaceful human–crocodile relationship inspired by existing institutional solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrocodiles 3aecosystems 3aprotected species 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3aBenin 0awater resources management 0ahuman–crocodile interaction 0aframing 0aformal and informal rules 0acompeting claims on natural resources1 aAarts, Noelle1 aTossou, Rigobert C.1 aMensah, Guy A.1 aSaídou, Aliou,1 aKossou, Dansou K.1 aSinsin, A.

The seed germination process and the seedling grown in vitro are described. Seeds of the studied species are unitegmic and have conspicuous thickening in the anticlinal and inner periclinal cell walls. The embryo consists of a relatively long and multicellular suspensor. At first stage of seedling development, the embryo differentiates into a protocorm with rhizoids and meristematic tissue. The budding occurs on the protocorms. The endogenous taproot is produced after the first leaves have emerged. The root is triarch or tetrarch and it possesses velamen. Structural characters related to seed coat, suspensor, ontogeny of leaves, and vascular system of the root are significant indicators for the separation of Laeliinae species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3aSophronitis 3avelamen 3acell walls 3aseedlings 3ameristems 3aontogeny 3aCattleya loddigesii 3aseed coat 3aLaelia 3aleaves 0aLeaf 0aRoot 0aProtocormo 0aRaíz 0aCubierta seminal 0aHoja 0aseeds 0aProtocorm 0aEmbryo 0aSeed coat 0aEmbrión1 aSouza, Luiz A.1 aMilaneze-Gutierre, Maria A.1 aAlmeida, Odair J.G.0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2016 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.68-73dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de BiologíawJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002200135245008800157300001500245520169300260592002801953650002401981650001302005650001302018650002202031650001902053650001102072650001102083650001902094650001902113650001102132650001002143650001302153650001002166650000902176650001202185650001702197700002202214700003702236773015202273856006902425856010402494990002302598852000902621655001202630IND60643199920221118050056.0190510e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064319992DNAL7 a10.3791/580422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPornaro, Cristina10aMeasuring stolons and rhizomes of turfgrasses using a digital image analysis system  ap. e58042.  aLength and diameter of stolons or rhizomes are usually measured using simple rulers and calipers. This procedure is slow and laborious, so it is often used on a limited number of stolons or rhizomes. For this reason, these traits are limited in their use for morphological characterization of plants. The use of digital image analysis software technology may overcome measurement errors due to human mistakes, which tend to increase as the number and size of samples also increase. The protocol can be used for any kind of crop but is particularly suitable for forage or grasses, where plants are small and numerous. Turf samples consist of aboveground biomass and an upper soil layer to the depth of maximum rhizome development, depending on the species of interest. In studies, samples are washed from the soil, and stolons/rhizomes are cleaned by hand before analysis by digital image analysis software. The samples are further dried in a laboratory heating oven to measure dry weight; therefore, for each sample, the resultant data are total length, total dry weight, and average diameter. Scanned images can be corrected before analysis by excluding visible extraneous parts, such as remaining roots or leaves not removed with the cleaning process. Indeed, these fragments normally have much smaller diameters than stolons or rhizomes, so they can be easily excluded from analysis by fixing the minimum diameter below which objects are not considered. Stolon or rhizome density per unit area can then be calculated based on sample size. The advantage of this method is quick and efficient measurement of the length and average diameter of large sample numbers of stolons or rhizomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acalipers 3acleaning 3acomputer software 3adigital images 3aforage 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3aovens 3arhizomes 3aroots 3asoil 3astolons 3aturf grasses1 aMacolino, Stefano1 aRichardson, M.

Rockwell10aAirborne Chemical Information and Context-Dependent Post-Strike Foraging Behavior in Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus)  ap. 649-656.  aPredators demonstrate context-dependent foraging behaviors to dynamically and successfully track prey and can use multiple cues in this process. In squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards), chemical signals from prey significantly influence predatory behavior, especially substrate and airborne cues. In this study, we examined behavioral variation in rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) during strike-induced chemosensory searching (SICS), a sterotyped complex of behaviors seen in squamates. Rattlesnakes can use both substrate and airborne chemical cues during SICS, but we sought to determine the changes during SICS when either substrate, airborne, or air-deposited chemical cues were the only types available to snakes in a Y-maze. We hypothesize that these cues represent the spectrum of chemical information available in the natural environment. We also modified scoring of choice in the Y-maze by deriving a choice penalty score, a reflection of how extensively the snake explored the unscented arm of the maze. In the presence of substrate trails, rattlesnakes relocated prey fastest, had highest rates of tongue-flicking, and received the lowest choice penalty scores during SICS. Airborne chemical cues enabled successful relocation, but rattlesnakes took longer to relocate prey, increased the frequency of many searching behaviors, and more extensively explored the Y-maze (more negative choice penalties). When air-deposited cues were the only type available, rattlesnakes took the longest to choose an arm, had the lowest rates of tongue-flicking, and backtracked most often. We suggest that as prey odor becomes more dilute, rattlesnakes demonstrate behavioral plasticity in SICS to preserve their ability to relocate prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus oreganus 3aforaging 3alizards 3aodors 3apredation 3apredators 3asnakes1 aKardong, Kenneth V.0 tCopeia.g2017 Dec., v. 105, no. 4 p.649-656dThe American Society of Ichthyologists and HerpetologistswJournal:19631x0045-85117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CE-16-5443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245009700171300002000268520167900288592002801967650002201995650000802017650002102025650004402046650003702090650002902127650002802156650001502184650001102199650001702210650002802227650001402255650001502269650001702284650001902301650001102320650002402331650001102355650003702366650000902403653000802412653002402420653001702444653002502461653002002486700003502506700002302541700007002564700002902634700005702663773014202720856007802862852000902940655001202949IND60626756320221122125630.0181226e20181214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062675632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b170132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVellampatti, Srivithya10aBacterial Resistance and Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Toward Metal-Ion-doped DNA Complexes  ap. 44290-44300.  aDNA nanotechnology has laid a platform to construct a variety of custom-shaped nanoscale objects for functionalization of specific target materials to achieve programmability and molecular recognition. Herein, we prepared DNA nanostructures [namely, synthetic DNA rings (RDNA) and DNA duplexes extracted from salmon (SDNA)] containing metal ions (M²⁺) such as Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, and Zn²⁺ as payloads for delivery to exterminate highly pathologic hospital bacterial strains (e.g., Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and prostate cancer cells (i.e., PC3, LNCaP, TRAMP-C1, 22Rv1, and DU145). Morphologies of these M²⁺-doped RDNA were visualized using atomic force microscopy. Interactions between M²⁺ and DNA were studied using UV–vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Quantitative composition and chemical changes in DNA without or with M²⁺ were obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, M²⁺-doped DNA complexes were subjected to antibacterial activity studies. They showed no bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on bacterial strains used. Finally, in vitro cellular toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pristine DNA and M²⁺-doped DNA complexes on prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicities conferred by M²⁺-doped DNA complexes for most cell lines were significantly higher than those of M²⁺ without DNA. Cellular uptake of these complexes was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using PhenGreen FL indicator. On the basis of our observations, DNA nanostructures can be used as safe and efficient nanocarriers for delivery of therapeutics. They have enhanced therapeutic window than bare metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell lines 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahospitals 3ametal ions 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3anickel 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asalmon 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc 0aDNA 0ametal-ion-doped DNA 0aspectroscopy 0abacterial resistance 0aprostate cancer1 aChandrasekaran, Gopalakrishnan1 aMitta, Sekhar Babu1 aDugasani, Sreekantha Reddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5805-87131 aLakshmanan, Vinoth-Kumar1 aPark, Sung Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0256-33630 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 14, v. 10, no. 51 p.44290-44300dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b170133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013200159300002000291520112600311592002801437650001401465650001101479650001301490650001901503650001501522650000901537650000901546650001601555650001201571650002201583650001801605700001601623700001701639700001401656700001801670700001701688700001901705773014301724856007401867852000901941655001201950IND60671094220221118190957.0191002e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067109422DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01617g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xiangfei10aGraphene oxide sheets-induced growth of nanostructured Fe₃O₄ for a high-performance anode material of lithium ion batteries  ap. 12938-12946.  aNanostructured Fe₃O₄ is intrinsically prone to aggregation, which hinders insertion and extraction of lithium ions. To overcome this problem, we adopt graphene oxide sheets (GOS) and induce growth of nanostructured Fe₃O₄ on the GOS in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). During the synthetic process, GOS provides a template to regulate the growth of nanostructured Fe₃O₄ and the HMT is able to coordinate with Fe³⁺ and control its hydrolysis rate. After the annealing process, GOS is reduced to GS (graphene sheets), and Fe₃O₄/GS composite is obtained. In this hierarchical structure, GS is capable of enhancing the electronic transport of Fe₃O₄, and the Fe₃O₄/GS composite has superior electronic conductivity (106 S m⁻¹). Benefitting from the uniform dispersion of the nanosized Fe₃O₄ on GS and the superior electronic conductivity, the obtained Fe₃O₄/GS exhibits prolonged cycling stability (1002 mA h g⁻¹ after 175 cycles at a current density of 0.50 A g⁻¹) and excellent rate capability (715, 647 and 535 mA h g⁻¹ at 1.6, 3.2 and 5.0 A g⁻¹, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aanodes 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3airon 3airon oxides 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials1 aXu, Youlong1 aSun, Xiaofei1 aWang, Jie1 aXiong, Lilong1 aDu, Xianfeng1 aMao, Shengchun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 June 9, v. 3, no. 24 p.12938-12946dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01617g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011100203300001800314520160700332592002801939650002501967650001901992650002502011650002002036650001002056650002702066650002602093650002202119650001602141650001702157650001502174650001302189650001502202650002002217700005902237700002502296700002002321700001702341700002602358700002002384700005802404700006802462700005902530700005702589773012902646856008402775852000902859655001202868IND60604648620180911000000.0180717e20180612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060464862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b008752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuan, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6295-243510aAutonomous Multimodal Metabolomics Data Integration for Comprehensive Pathway Analysis and Systems Biology  ap. 8396-8403.  aComprehensive metabolomic data can be achieved using multiple orthogonal separation and mass spectrometry (MS) analytical techniques. However, drawing biologically relevant conclusions from this data and combining it with additional layers of information collected by other omic technologies present a significant bioinformatic challenge. To address this, a data processing approach was designed to automate the comprehensive prediction of dysregulated metabolic pathways/networks from multiple data sources. The platform autonomously integrates multiple MS-based metabolomics data types without constraints due to different sample preparation/extraction, chromatographic separation, or MS detection method. This multimodal analysis streamlines the extraction of biological information from the metabolomics data as well as the contextualization within proteomics and transcriptomics data sets. As a proof of concept, this multimodal analysis approach was applied to a colorectal cancer (CRC) study, in which complementary liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) data were combined with proteomic and transcriptomic data. Our approach provided a highly resolved overview of colon cancer metabolic dysregulation, with an average 17% increase of detected dysregulated metabolites per pathway and an increase in metabolic pathway prediction confidence. Moreover, 95% of the altered metabolic pathways matched with the dysregulated genes and proteins, providing additional validation at a systems level. The analysis platform is currently available via the XCMS Online (XCMSOnline.scripps.edu).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adata collection 3agenes 3ainformation processing 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atranscriptomics1 aPalermo, Amelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5705-65211 aIvanisevic, Julijana1 aRinehart, Duane1 aEdler, David1 aPhommavongsay, Thiery1 aBenton, H.

The ecological environment of valley basins is very fragile, while bearing the enormous pressure of economic development and population growth, which has damaged the balance of the ecosystem structure and ecosystem services. In this study, we selected two typical valley basins—Guanzhong Basin and Hanzhong Basin—as study areas. The spatial heterogeneity of trade-offs and synergies among multiple ESs (net primary production (NPP), habitat quality (HQ), soil conservation (SC), water conservation (WC), and food supply (FS)) were quantified using the correlation analysis and spatial overlay based on the gird scale to quantitatively analyze and compare the interaction among ESs in two basins. Our results found that: (1) Trade-offs between FS and other four services NPP, HQ, SC, and WC were discovered in two basins, and there were synergistic relationships between NPP, HQ, SC, and WC. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the conflicted relationships between paired ESs gradually increased, and the synergistic relationship became weaker. Furthermore, the rate of change in Guanzhong Basin was stronger than that in Hanzhong Basin. (3) The spatial synergies and trade-offs between NPP and HQ, WC and NPP, FS and HQ, SC and FS were widespread in two basins. The strong trade-offs between pair ESs were widly distributed in the central and southwest of Guanzhong Basin and the southeast of Hanzhong Basin. (4) Multiple ecosystem service interactions were concentrated in the north of Qinling Mountain, the central of Guanzhong Basins, and the east of Hanzhong Basin. Our research highlights the importance of taking spatial perspective and accounting for multiple ecosystem service interactions, and provide a reliable basis for achieving ecological sustainable development of the valley basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3anet primary productivity 3apopulation growth 3asoil conservation 3aspatial variation 3asustainable development 3awater conservation 3aChina1 aLi, Jing 1 aLiu, Xianfeng 1 aRen, Zhiyuan 1 aZhou, Zixiang 1 aDuan, Yifang 0 tForests.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110202093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014300163300001600306520146400322592002801786650001701814650001001831650002001841650001201861650001301873650001101886650001701897650001001914650000901924650001601933650001101949650002401960650001401984650002501998650000902023651001002032653001302042653001702055653000802072653001302080653002002093653001002113700001702123700001502140700001402155700001602169700001202185773010502197856008402302852000902386655001202395IND60524617820221121072511.0160711e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052461782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Kun10aCharacterization of metal kinetics and bioavailability using diffusive gradients in thin films technique in sediments of Taihu Lake, China  ap. 153-160.  aFor an improved understanding of the metal behavior between the sediment and overlaying water of Taihu Lake, the technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) was used to characterize the DGT measured concentration in sediments and release kinetics of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in representative lake parts. Spatially, the DGT-measured concentration of heavy metals showed that Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Pb had higher concentrations in the northern lake than in the eastern Lake Taihu. The order of the release flux for the studied metals from sediments to overlaying water was Zn>Cu>Ni, Cr>Pb>Cd (p<0.05). DGT devices were deployed over a series of time (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48h) in sediment cores from the two typical lake parts (northwest algae dominant area and southeast macrophyte dominant area) to explore the dynamics in the sediment/DGT system, and the best fitted regression model was selected to characterize the release of metals in the two lake parts. The fitted results showed that the equilibration time of the metal release was approximately 24h and Zn had a higher release capacity than other metals. Further analyses indicated that significant correlation existed between the DGT-measured metal concentrations in sediments and metal concentrations in lake organisms (r=0.943 and 0.996 for zoobenthos and coilia ectenes, p<0.05), suggesting that DGT technique is more effective to predict the metal bioavailability in lake sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoilia nasus 3aalgae 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3alead 3amacrophytes 3anickel 3aregression analysis 3asediments 3atime series analysis 3azinc 3aChina 0aSediment 0aHeavy metals 0aDGT 0aKinetics 0aBioavailability 0aTaihu1 aHan, Xuejiao1 aZhao, Jian1 aQiao, Fei1 aLi, Zicheng1 aYu, Tao0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 June, v. 128 p.153-160dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011700208300001700325520160300342592002801945650004101973650001202014650001902026650000902045650002002054650002302074650001602097650001602113650002502129650001502154700005902169773016002228856008202388852000902470655001202479IND60712290420221120204032.0201009e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071229042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01825-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlodah, Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0815-457910aInfluence of output size of stochastic weather generators on common climate and hydrological statistical indices  ap. 993-1021.  aWhile Stochastic Weather Generators (SWGs) are used intensively in climate and hydrological applications to simulate hydroclimatic time series and estimate risks and performance measures linked to climate variability, there have been few investigations into how many realizations are required for a robust estimation of these measures. Given the computational cost and time necessary to force climate-sensitive systems with multiple realizations, the estimation of the optimal number of synthetic time series to generate with a particular SWG for a predefined accuracy when estimating a particular risk or performance measure is particularly important. In this paper, the required number of realizations of five SWGs coupled with a SWAT model (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool) needed in order to achieve a predefined Relative Root Mean Square Error is investigated. The statistical indices used are the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of four hydroclimatic variables: precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and annual streamflow obtained for each observed and model-generated time series. While the results vary somewhat across SWGs, variables and indicators, they overall show that the marginal improvement decreases dramatically after 25 realizations. The results also indicate that the benefit of generating more than 100 realizations of climate and streamflow data is very minimal. The methodology presented herein can be applied in further investigations of other set of risk indicators, SWGs, hydrological models, and watersheds to minimize the required workload.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3astandard deviation 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds1 aSeidou, Ousmane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1706-01760 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2020 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.993-1021dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01825-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001100144245012300155300002000278520131700298592002801615650001501643650001301658650001501671650001101686650001201697650001501709650001501724650001201739650002201751650001301773650001501786650001301801650002301814653003701837653002001874653003001894653001901924653002201943700005301965700005402018700001602072773014202088856007802230852000902308655001202317IND60626756420221122125521.0181226e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062675642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b170512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qi10aMonodispersed Ag Nanoparticle in Layered Double Hydroxides as Matrix for Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry  ap. 44751-44759.  aMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) range is a long-standing challenge because of the fragments from the matrix and the heterogeneity of the matrix-analyte crystals. In this work, a homogeneous film with the monodispersed Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in the confined interlayer of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has been achieved. The Ag NPs with advantageous optical absorption could realize the energy capture and transfer process, and LDHs with abundant hydroxyl groups are beneficial for the deprotonated reaction. Therefore, the as-prepared film exhibited interference-free deprotonated signals in negative-ion mode with high ionization efficiency. The uniform matrix-analyte spots were constructed through the homogeneous assembly process, contributing to the high reproducibility for both the liquid and gaseous samples. Good linearities were successfully realized in the range from 0.1 μM to 1.0 mM for glucose with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.8%, and 0.2–2.0 mM with the average RSD of 4.5% for psoralen samples, respectively. It is believed that the proposed matrix could exhibit competitive advantages for MALDI detection in the LMW region, which may provide new insight into development for MALDI mass detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystals 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ahydroxides 3aionization 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3ananosilver 3apsoralen 3astandard deviation 0alayered double hydroxides (LDHs) 0ahydroxyl groups 0aAg nanoparticles (Ag NPs) 0amonodispersion 0anegative-ion mode1 aTian, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5356-99441 aLü, Chao,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7841-74771 aLi, Haifang0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 04, v. 10, no. 51 p.44751-44759dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b170513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010800170300001600278520104000294592002801334650001201362650001701374650001101391650000901402650001601411650002801427653001901455653002201474653001701496653001701513653001001530653002701540700002001567700002301587700001601610700001901626700002201645700003301667773015001700856008501850852000901935655001201944IND60122550220221119103504.0210908e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012255022DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2014.9096402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidibé, Amadou10aWomen, shea, and finance: how institutional practices in a Malian cooperative create development impact  ap. 263-275.  aDevelopment impacts are often framed in terms of the effects of exogenous inputs, such as finance or technologies, on measurable ultimate outcomes for a specified group of beneficiaries, for example increased income. This case study of sourcing, processing, and trading shea butter and kernels by a Malian women's cooperative emphasizes intermediate outcomes, specifically early signs of institutional change, as measures for assessing the development impacts of access to finance. The cooperative succeeded in obtaining working capital provided by a microfinance organization. The impact of this arrangement was most visible in how the provision of working capital catalysed emerging institutional practices within the cooperative, particularly in sourcing and stocking, which altered relations with non-members and traders. Hence, access to finance achieved an impact in terms of the interaction between the evolving strategies of the cooperative and the activities of people not directly included in the group-based activity itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3aincome 3ashea 3ashea butter 3asustainable agriculture 0awomen's groups 0acollective action 0avalue-adding 0amicrofinance 0atrade 0aevaluation methodology1 aVellema, Sietze1 aDembélé, Fadiala1 aTeme, Bino,1 aYossi, Harouna1 aTraoré, Mamoudou1 aKuyper, Th.

Agroforestry, monoculture, and natural tropical forests were investigated to calculate the carbon stock and sequestration based on three different combinations of oil palm and agarwood in agroforestry systems from 2014 to 2018. These combinations were oil palm (27 years) and agarwood (seven years), oil palm (20 years) and agarwood (seven years), and oil palm (17 years) and agarwood (five years). Monoculture oil palm (16 years), oil palm (six years), and natural tropical forest were set as the control. Three randomly selected plots for agroforestry and monoculture plantation were 0.25 ha (50 × 50 m), respectively, whereas for the natural tropical forest it was 0.09 ha (30 × 30 m). A nondestructive sampling method followed by the allometric equation determined the standing biomass. Organic and shrub layers collected in a square frame (1 × 1 m) were analyzed using the CHN628 series (LECO Corp., MI, USA) for carbon content. Soil bulk density of randomly selected points within the three different layers, that is, 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 30 cm were used to determine the total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stock in each agroforestry system which was 79.13, 85.40, and 78.28 Mg C ha⁻¹, respectively. The TEC in the monoculture oil palm was 76.44 and 60.30 Mg C ha⁻¹, whereas natural tropical forest had the highest TEC of 287.29 Mg C ha⁻¹. The forest stand had the highest TEC capacity as compared with the agroforestry and monoculture systems. The impact of planting systems on the TEC showed a statistically significant difference at a 95% confidence interval for the various carbon pools among the agroforestry, monoculture, and natural tropical forests. Therefore, the forest must be sustained because of its higher capacity to store carbon in mitigating global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aagroforestry 3aallometry 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aconfidence interval 3aecosystems 3aequations 3aforest stands 3aglobal warming 3anondestructive methods 3aplanting 3arivers 3asampling 3ashrubs 3asoil carbon 3asoil density 3atropical forests 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aSuardi, Herawandi 1 aPhua, Mui How,1 aJames, Daniel 1 aMokhtar, Mazlin  Bin1 aAhmed, Minhaz  Farid0 tForests.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110202103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001600278520129700294592002801591650002301619650001501642650002101657650002301678650001601701650001501717650001301732650001101745650001401756650002001770650001901790650002201809650002301831651001101854651000901865653001301874653002201887653003001909653001401939653001701953653001801970653001501988653001102003653001302014653002002027653002802047653001402075653001702089653001702106653001602123653001102139700002102150700002802171773019902199856008202398852000902480655001202489IND60527322120221116235723.0190415e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052732212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueroa, Judith10aModelación de la distribución del oso andino Tremarctos ornatus en el bosque seco del Marañón (Perú)  ap. 230-238.  aThe Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) is a vulnerable species, his habitat is gradually fragmented by the expansion of human activities. In Peru, the Marañón dry forest, an ecoregion with little biological and ecological research, is the habitat of the species. Unfortunately, at the present time, it is being affected by agriculture, livestock and road construction, and soon will be threatened by the implementation of large scale economic activities, such as hydroelectric stations. In order to identify priority sectors for research and conservation of the Andean bear in the Marañón dry forest of Cajamarca and Amazonas regions, its habitat was modeled using MaxEnt algorithm. Sixty records of its presence as well as 6 environmental and climatic variables were used. Considering a total extension of 6,501.2km2 of Marañón dry forest, the suitable existing habitat for the Andean bear would be only 480.7km2 (7.4%) and the marginal existing habitat, 2,418.5km2 (37.2%). Three priority sectors for research and conservation were identified which also present connectivity to montane forests and paramos inside protected areas: Cutervo National Park, Huangamarca Municipal Conservation Area (Cajamarca) and Private Conservation Areas, Huiquilla and Huaylla Belén-Colcamar (Amazonas).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTremarctos ornatus 3aalgorithms 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3adry forests 3aecoregions 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alivestock 3amontane forests 3anational parks 3aroad construction 3avulnerable species 3aBrazil 3aPeru 0aAmazonas 0aÁreas protegidas 0aBosque seco del Marañón 0aCajamarca 0aConectividad 0aConservación 0aOso andino 0aMaxEnt 0aAmazonas 0aProtected areas 0aDry forest of Marañón 0aCajamarca 0aConnectivity 0aConservation 0aAndean bear 0aMaxEnt1 aStucchi, Marcelo1 aRojas-VeraPinto, Roxana0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2016 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.230-238dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de BiologíawJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010100169520111100270592002801381650001701409650001501426650001601441650001301457650001301470653003201483653002301515653001501538653001001553700001301563700001501576700001601591700001701607700001801624700001601642773011901658856008801777852000901865655001201874IND60756436020221116162651.0220214e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075643602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junjie10aCritical strategies for recycling process of graphite from spent lithium-ion batteries: A review  aWith the explosive growth of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the effective recycling of graphite as a key negative electrode material has become economically attractive and environmentally significant. This review reports the recent research progress in recycling strategies for spent graphite from the perspectives of separation and reuse. First, technologies for separating graphite powder after direct crushing and artificially splitting are introduced, and the shortcomings of cost control and separation efficiency are reported. Subsequently, the reuse of recycled spent graphite is systematically summarized in terms of regeneration into battery materials, low-value utilization, and high-value conversion. Special attention has been paid to different aging degrees of retired batteries, as well as the performance and applications of regenerated graphite. Finally, upcoming research efforts on evaluation the standard establishment, development of advanced technology, and potential value enhancement to meet practical the industrial conditions and facilitate industry installation are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost control 3aelectrodes 3aenvironment 3agraphene 3aindustry 0aSpent lithium-ion batteries 0aGraphite recycling 0aSeparation 0aReuse1 aShi, Hui1 aHu, Xingyu1 aGeng, Yanni1 aYang, Liming1 aShao, Penghui1 aLuo, Xubiao0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 816 p.151621-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009300165300002000258520024400278592002800522650001100550650001400561650001600575650001100591650001200602700002200614700002500636700002700661700002600688700002400714700002700738773013600765856007500901852000900976655001200985IND60537591920221120151554.0160809e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053759192DNAL7 a10.1021/ie400245c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolotarev, Andreii

Overall, ISO is considered as one of the most reliable techniques to derive long-term reservoir operating rules for reservoirs. This method employs a deterministic optimization model to estimate the optimal reservoir allocations under different inflow scenarios and later constructs operating rules for each month by relating the ensemble of the optimal releases, the initial storage volume and future inflow values. Those rules are generally established by fitting approaches including linear regression or nonlinear methods. This work illustrates the applicability to combine copulas with ISO to define reservoir operation policies based on a probabilistic procedure. Firstly, synthetic streamflow scenarios are simulated using a periodic vine copula model. Afterward, optimal release data are estimated by ISO for a set of inflow scenarios. Joint probability distribution functions based on copulas are constructed in order to forecast the expected release, conditioned to the initial reservoir volume and future inflows data. Results indicate that the proposed model represents a flexible approach to construct operating rules and derive long-term reservoir operating policies with low variability, allowing to reproduce different dependence structures of simulated data.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3aregression analysis 3astream flow 3avines 3awater power 3awater reservoirs 3aBrazil1 aMine, Miriam R.

Merr.] in the Upper Midwest of the United States and is primarily controlled by insecticides. Soybean aphid resistance (i.e., Rag genes) has been documented in some soybean accessions but more sources of resistance are needed. Incorporation of the resistance into marketed varieties has also been slow. Genome‐wide association mapping can aid in identifying resistant accessions by correlating phenotypic data with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a genome. Aphid population measures from 2366 soybean accessions were collected from published studies screening cultivated soybean (G. max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) with aphids exhibiting Biotype 1, 2, or 3 characteristics. Genotypic data were obtained from the SoySNP50K high‐density genotyping array previously used to genotype the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. Significant associations between SNPs and soybean aphid counts were found on 18 of the 20 soybean chromosomes. Significant SNPs were found on chromosomes 7, 8, 13, and 16 with known Rag genes. SNPs were also significant on chromosomes 1, 2, 4 to 6, 9 to 12, 14, and 17 to 20 where Rag genes have not yet been mapped, suggesting that many Rag genes remain to be discovered. These SNPs can be used to determine accessions that are likely to have novel aphid resistance traits of value for breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Minnesota's Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship 3aAphis glycines 3aGlycine max 3aGlycine soja 3abiotypes 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenotyping 3agermplasm conservation 3ahost plants 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 3aMidwestern United States1 aLorenz, Aaron J.1 aHesler, Louis S.1 aBhusal, Siddhi J.1 aBansal, Raman1 aMichel, Andy P.1 aJiang, Guo‐Liang1 aKoch, Robert L.0 tThe plant genome.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 3 p.e180011-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2018.02.00113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245007300181300001600254520116200270592002801432650001501460650001501475650002401490650001501514650002301529650001701552650002001569650001301589650001101602650002101613651001101634653001301645653002501658653002301683653002401706653002101730653001501751653002501766653002001791653001901811653002001830700003701850700003701887700004001924773019901964856008202163852000902245655001202254IND60527322220221116235154.0190415e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052732222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Badillo, Leonardo,10aAnálisis herpetofaunístico de la zona árida del estado de Hidalgo  ap. 156-170.  aWe studied richness and distribution of amphibians and non-avian sauropsids from the 2 arid ecoregions of Hidalgo.

In addition, we discussed natural history attributes of species, their conservation status, and endemism. We report 82 species (20 amphibian and 62 non-avian sauropsids). The eco-region Central Mexican Shrub showed the greatest richness (65 species; 29 unique and 36 shared with the Central Plateau Shrub eco-region). We found 62 species distributed only in xeric shrub, 2 in deciduous tropical forest and 18 in both types of vegetation. The complementarity between ecoregions was 55 for amphibians and 32.07 for non-avian sauropsids. The greater similarity (52.4) was found with the arid zone of Querétaro. Most species are terrestrial, insectivores, and oviparous. There were more nocturnal amphibians and more diurnal non-avian sauropsids registered.

The potential-time curves revealed that PHTA and ATA shift the potential of iron toward the positive values. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicated that the presence of PHTA and ATA and the increase of their concentrations decrease the iron corrosion by increasing the solution and polarization resistances. This effect also decreases the corrosion current and corrosion rate for iron as confirmed by potentiodynamic polarization data. Potentiostatic current–time curves indicated that the presence of PHTA and ATA molecules decreases the absolute current and severity of pitting corrosion of iron in the test solutions. In situ Raman spectra for iron in chloride solution containing PHTA and ATA confirmed that the inhibition of iron corrosion is achieved by the adsorption of PHTA and ATA molecules onto its surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3airon 3asodium chloride 3atriazoles0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 52, no. 41 p.14507-14513dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie400725z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08363naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245009200158300001600250500000900266500001500275520663000290592002806920650002006948650002206968650002806990650001507018650001407033650001507047650002307062650002007085650003007105650002307135650001407158650001407172650001007186650002407196650002007220650002407240650001707264650001707281650002107298650002007319651001207339653003307351653001807384700001907402700001807421700001607439700001907455773020207474852000907676856007707685990002307762655001207785IND2060553120221121024901.0191122e199704  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206055312DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1997.03232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathre, D.

Half of the no-till, one cultivation, or burned plots that were planted with either a leaf spot susceptible or a leaf spot resistant cultivar, were sprayed with several applications of Tilt fungicide (propiconizole —1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1, 3-dioxolaa-2-yl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole) at 4 fl oz/acre. The disease resistant cultivar Baronesse had a higher yield than the susceptible cultivar Harrington in all 3 yr by an average of 14 bu/acre. Application of Tilt fungicide had a similar effect on both cultivars and increased the yield of Harrington by an average of 9.6 bu/acre and Baronesse by an average of 9.0 bu/acre. Test weight and percentage plump seed were higher with Baronesse than with Harrington. Percentage seed protein and percentage thin kernels increased with disease susceptibility. Although the experimental design did not allow for direct comparisons among residue management treatments, the impact of residue management tended to vary over the 3 yr. Highest yields were harvested from the burned treatment in 1994 and 1995, while this same treatment produced the lowest yields in 1993. Research QuestionConcern about soil erosion caused by both water and wind has prompted the small grain producer to adopt management practices that maintain crop residues on the soil surface. The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of net blotch on barley production under three residue management schemes. Literature SummaryUnder semi-arid conditions, no-till annual spring wheat production has been shown to be the most efficient practice from the standpoint of yield and water-use efficiency when compared with sweep tillage in a crop-fallow system. Some of the major obstacles to adoption of practices that maintain residue on the soil surface are weeds, insects, and diseases. Producers have to develop strategies to minimize the losses from these pests if they are to maintain an economically viable small grain operation. Although the use of resistant cultivars or pesticides can be effective in minimizing the impact of residue-related pests, growers often do not know how much these choices will affect yield and grain quality. One of the important foliar diseases whose severity is related to residue management in barley is net blotch. Study DescriptionThis research was conducted on the Western Triangle Agricultural Research Center at Conrad, MT, from 1993 to 1995. Test plots in all 3 yr were placed on land planted the previous year with ‘Harrington’ barley. The standing residue varied between 3500 and 4500 lb/acre. Three separate residue treatment areas were as follows: (i) all residue burned with essentially no residue remaining on the soil surface, (ii) residue tilled one time just prior to seeding using a sweep cultivator, and (iii) standing residue left untilled. Each strip was divided into four blocks (replicates) and four treatment combinations (two cultivars with and without fungicide application) randomized within each block. Just prior to seeding, the entire plot area was sprayed with 0.9 qt/acre of glyphosate and top-dressed with 60 lb N/acre as urea. Two barley cultivars were used for seeding. Harrington, a net blotch susceptible cultivar, and ‘Baronesse’, a cultivar that has some resistance to net blotch. Twelve-row plots 20 ft long with rows 12 in. apart were seeded concurrently with 100 lb/acre of 11-51-0 fertilizer. The fungicide propiconizole (Tilt) was applied to half the plots at a rate of 4 fl odacre of formulated product. The first application was at the four-leaf stage in all 3 yr, with a second application at flagleaf emergence. In 1994, a third application was made at the head emergence stage. Leaf spots that developed were identified as being caused by Pyrenophora teres f. maculata based on isolations made onto sterile media. Applied QuestionsDoes residue management affect the development of barley net blotch? Initial disease readings were always lowest in the burned area, but later readings taken post-flowering were similar throughout the plot area. The lack of response to residue management may have been due in part to the relatively small size of our plots and to the fact that they were adjacent to each other, which would allow secondary inoculum to spread throughout the test area. Does residue management affect the agronomic qualities associated with spring barley? Test weight was greatest for the cultivar Baronesse and increased with fungicide treatment. Kernel plumpness was less affected than was yield by the various treatments with the largest differences developing in 1995 when the yield potential was greatest (Table 1). Harrington had higher grain protein than Baronesse, especially in 1993 and 1995. The foliar fungicide treatment affected grain protein only in 1995, where application of fungicide reduced grain protein (but not statistically significantly) over the no-fungicide treatment. These data show the impact on total production as affected by management practices (i.e., cultivar selection, residue management, and application of a foliar fungicide). While the fungicide application certainly has a significant input cost factor associated with it, the two other practices probably are less associated with significant costs, though certainly not without some cost (i.e., difference in seed cost, since Baronesse is a proprietary cultivar, and the cost of herbicides for weed contiol in a no-till system). RecommendationBarley producers can reduce the impact of foliar disease when using either minimum or no-till production schemes by cultivar selection, and by use of a foliar fungicide if their yield potential will justify the latter. The data we collected also suggest that additional research efforts by barley breeders to increase the resistance of their new cultivars will be worthwhile.

A promising approach that could enable selection prior to phenotyping is genomic selection that uses genome‐wide markers to estimate breeding values (BVs) for quantitative traits. To evaluate this approach for seedling and/or adult plant resistance (APR) to STB, SNB, and TS, we compared the predictive ability of least‐squares (LS) approach with genomic‐enabled prediction models including genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), Bayes A (BA), Bayes B (BB), Bayes Cπ (BC), Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BL), and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces markers (RKHS‐M), a pedigree‐based model (RKHS‐P) and RKHS markers and pedigree (RKHS‐MP). We observed that LS gave the lowest prediction accuracies and RKHS‐MP, the highest. The genomic‐enabled prediction models and RKHS‐P gave similar accuracies. The increase in accuracy using genomic prediction models over LS was 48%. The mean genomic prediction accuracies were 0.45 for STB (APR), 0.55 for SNB (seedling), 0.66 for TS (seedling) and 0.48 for TS (APR). We also compared markers from two whole‐genome profiling approaches: genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArTseq) for prediction. While, GBS markers performed slightly better than DArTseq, combining markers from the two approaches did not improve accuracies. We conclude that implementing GS in breeding for these diseases would help to achieve higher accuracies and rapid gains from selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aPyrenophora tritici-repentis 3abreeding programs 3abreeding value 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aleaf spot 3aleast squares 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3amodels 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aquantitative traits 3aseedlings 3awheat1 aSingh, R.

However, the knowledge on microbiota along with their functional potential in this special habitat are still lacking. In this study, we recovered 1168 non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from nine landfill leachate samples collected from eight cities across China, spanning 42 phyla, 73 classes, 114 orders, 189 families, and 267 genera. Totally, 74.1% of 1168 MAGs could not be classified to any known species and 5.9% of these MAGs belonged to microbial dark matter phyla. Two putative novel classes were discovered from landfill leachate samples. The identification of thousands of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes showed similar richness level compared to the cow rumen microbiota. The methylotrophic methanogenic pathway was speculated to contribute significantly to methane production in the landfill leachate because of its co-occurrence with the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways. The genetic potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was observed, implying DNRA may play a role in ammonium generation in landfill leachate. These findings implied that landfill leachate might be a valuable microbial resource repository and filled the previous understanding gaps for both methanogenesis and nitrogen cycling in landfill leachate microbiota. Our study provides a comprehensive genomic catalog and substantially provides unprecedented taxonomic and functional profiles of the landfill leachate microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanaerobic digestion 3acows 3aenvironment 3agenetic traits 3agenome 3ahabitats 3alandfill leachates 3ametagenomics 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3aChina 0aLandfill leachate 0aMicrobiome 0aMetagenomic binning 0aCAZymes 0aMethanogenesis 0aNitrogen cycling1 aZhao, Renxin1 aQiu, Zhiguang1 aLi, Bing1 aZhang, Tong1 aGuo, Feng1 aMu, Rong1 aWu, Yang1 aQiao, Xuejiao1 aZhang, Liyu1 aCheng, Jay J.1 aNi, Jinren1 aYu, Ke0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 816 p.151635-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1516353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245010800199300001800307500002000325520177200345592002802117596008702145596005002232650002202282650001602304650001702320650002102337650001402358650001302372650001302385650001202398650002002410650001302430650001502443650003302458650001302491650001802504650001702522650001102539650001802550700005902568700005802627700005902685700005902744700005602803700005402859773015102913856007503064852000903139655001203148IND60752831920221119074924.0211007e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075283192DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.112342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLužaić, Tanja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0424-597210aPrediction of mechanical extraction oil yield of new sunflower hybrids: artificial neural network model  ap. 5827-5833.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Sunflower seeds are in the top five most abundant oilseeds in the world, as well as sunflower oil in the edible oils group. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to cold‐pressed sunflower oil because less processing is involved and no solvent is used. The present study was carried out to investigate dimensions (length, width, thickness), firmness, general (moisture content and hull content, mass of 1000 seeds), gravimetric (true and bulk density, porosity) and geometric characteristics (equivalent diameter, surface area, seed volume, sphericity) of 20 new sunflower hybrid seeds. Steps to determine most of these parameters are quite simple and easy since the process does not require long time or special equipment. RESULTS: Principal component analysis and cluster analysis confirmed differences in the mentioned characteristics between oily and confectionary sunflower hybrid seeds. One of the major differences between two groups of samples was in extraction oil yield. Mechanical extraction oil yield of the oily hybrid seeds was significantly (P ˂ 0.05) higher (from 68.72 ± 4.21% to 75.61 ± 1.99%) compared to confectionary hybrids (from 20.10 ± 2.82% to 39.91 ± 6.23%). Extraction oil yield values are known only after oil extraction. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the extraction oil yield value before the mechanical extraction enables better management of the process. By application of the artificial neural network approach, an optimal neural network model was developed. The developed model showed a good generalization capability to predict the mechanical extraction oil yield of new sunflower hybrids based on the experimental data, which was a main goal of this paper. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a451‐03‐9/2021‐14/200134cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  cMinistry of Education, Science and Technology 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagriculture 3abulk density 3acluster analysis 3aequipment 3afirmness 3ageometry 3ahybrids 3aneural networks 3aporosity 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolvents 3asunflower oil 3asurface area 3asweets 3awater content1 aRomanić, Ranko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5329-45111 aGrahovac, Nada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6635-35681 aJocić, Siniša1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2189-93721 aCvejić, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7531-589X1 aHladni, Nada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1317-06451 aPezo, Lato1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0704-30840 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Nov., v. 101, no. 14 p.5827-5833dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.112343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245011300197300002000310520120900330592002801539650001701567650001401584650001101598650002601609650002801635650001501663650001101678650002001689650001101709700001501720700001601735700001801751700002501769700002201794700005701816700005101873700005501924773014901979856007702128852000902205655001202214IND60608957720221120174129.0181020e20180725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060895772DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b060202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jihye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8644-210310aStabilization of Hexaaminobenzene in a 2D Conductive Metal–Organic Framework for High Power Sodium Storage  ap. 10315-10323.  aRedox-active organic materials have gained growing attention as electrodes of rechargeable batteries. However, their key limitations are the low electronic conductivity and limited chemical and structural stability under redox conditions. Herein, we report a new cobalt-based 2D conductive metal–organic framework (MOF), Co-HAB, having stable, accessible, dense active sites for high-power energy storage device through conjugative coordination between a redox-active linker, hexaaminobenzene (HAB), and a Co(II) center. Given the exceptional capability of Co-HAB for stabilizing reactive HAB, a reversible three-electron redox reaction per HAB was successfully demonstrated for the first time, thereby presenting a promising new electrode material for sodium-ion storage. Specifically, through synthetic tunability of Co-HAB, the bulk electrical conductivity of 1.57 S cm–¹ was achieved, enabling an extremely high rate capability, delivering 214 mAh g–¹ within 7 min or 152 mAh g–¹ in 45 s. Meanwhile, an almost linear increase of the areal capacity upon increasing active mass loading up to 9.6 mg cm–² was obtained, demonstrating 2.6 mAh cm–² with a trace amount of conducting agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abatteries 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aredox reactions 3asodium1 aLee, Minah1 aFeng, Dawei1 aHuang, Zhehao1 aHinckley, Allison C.1 aYakovenko, Andrey1 aZou, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6748-66561 aCui, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6103-63521 aBao, Zhenan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0972-17150 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 July 25, v. 140, no. 32 p.10315-10323dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b060203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01083naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007100173300001600244520028300260592002800543650002700571650002000598650001200618650002200630773007400652856008200726852000900808655001200817IND60092696320221118040921.0161019e20130829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009269632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchier, Alexander F.10aShould I Stay or Should I Go: Neuromodulators of Behavioral States  ap. 955-956.  aAnimals are often in discrete behavioral states, but it is unclear how one specific state is generated and opposes alternative states.

To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework was applied to the Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water allocation plans for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water allocation plans for the future (2079–2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water allocation plans to fail under future climate change. Developing robust allocation plans in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3adry season 3amanagers 3amodels 3aresearchers 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asaltwater intrusion 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aMulti-objective evolutionary algorithms 0aClimate uncertainties 0aRobust decision making 0aPearl River basin1 aLudwig, Fulco1 aHuang, He Qing1 aWerners, Saskia E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 31, v. 607-608 p.294-303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.2653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009200167300001800259520151900277592002801796650002201824650001201846650001901858650002301877650002001900650001301920700002101933700002201954773012101976856008202097852000902179655001202188IND60562227520221118162127.0170203e20160825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056222752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b017922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBomblies, Rainer10aMechanism of pKID/KIX Association Studied by Molecular Dynamics Free Energy Simulations  ap. 8186-8192.  aThe phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain (pKID) associates with the kinase interacting domain (KIX) via a coupled folding and binding mechanism. The pKID domain is intrinsically disordered when unbound and upon phosphorylation at Ser133 binds to the KIX domain adopting a well-defined kinked two-helix structure. In order to identify putative hot spot residues of binding that could serve as an initial stable anchor, we performed in silico alanine scanning free energy simulations. The simulations indicate that charged residues including the phosphorylated central Ser133 of pKID make significant contributions to binding. However, these are of slightly smaller magnitude compared to several hydrophobic side chains not defining a single dominant binding hot spot. Both continuous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy analysis demonstrate that phosphorylation significantly stabilizes the central kinked motif around Ser133 of pKID and shifts the conformational equilibrium toward the bound conformation already in the absence of KIX. This result supports a view that pKID/KIX association follows in part a conformational selection process. During a 1.5 μs explicit solvent MD simulation, folding of pKID on the surface of KIX was observed after an initial contact at the bound position of the phosphorylation site was enforced following a sequential process of αA helix association and a stepwise association and folding of the second αB helix compatible with available experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aalanine 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3aphosphorylation 3asolvents1 aLuitz, Manuel P.1 aZacharias, Martin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Aug. 25, v. 120, no. 33 p.8186-8192dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b017923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010400163300002000267520073400287592002801021650000801049650001201057650002501069650001901094653002201113653002601135653002101161653001901182653001401201700001401215700001801229700001801247700001701265773012601282856008001408852000901488655001201497IND60558114020221120102831.0161109e20161109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055811402DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b090212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chunyang10aMultifunctional Graphene/DNA-Based Platform for the Construction of Enzyme-Free Ternary Logic Gates  ap. 30287-30293.  aIn this work, we have successfully realized multivalued logic circuits including ternary INHIBIT and ternary OR logic gates in an enzyme-free condition by integration of graphene oxide and DNA for the first time.

A fluidic layer containing the gate structure and a pneumatic layer are fabricated by soft-lithography in PDMS and bonded permanently with an oxygen plasma treatment. The microvalve structures are then reversibly bonded to a featureless glass or plastic substrate to form hybrid glass-PDMS and plastic-PDMS microchannel structures. The break-through pressures of the microvalve increase linearly up to 65 kPa as the closing pressure increases. The pumping capability of these structures ranges from the nanoliter to microliter scale depending on the number of cycles and closing pressure employed. The micropump structures exhibit up to 86.2% pumping efficiency from flow rate measurements. The utility of these structures for integrated sample processing is demonstrated by performing an automated immunoassay. These lifting gate valve and pump structures enable facile integration of complex microfluidic control systems with a wide range of lab-on-a-chip substrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aglass 3aimmunoassays 3aoxygen 3apumps1 aKang, Minjee1 aJensen, Erik C.1 aMathies, Richard A.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 84, no. 4 p.2067-2071dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac202934x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245004500207300001600252520066600268592002800934650000800962650002100970650001300991650001401004650001301018650002201031653001901053653001401072653001301086653002101099653001201120700001501132773007101147856008401218852000901302655001201311IND60560974820221117232014.0170720e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056097482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Nianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5558-231410aNanocarbons for DNA sequencing: A review  ap. 293-311.  aDNA sequencing using nanopores, so-named nanopore sequencing, is one of the most promising and revolutionary DNA sequencing technologies to provide the order and the type of nucleobases in a DNA molecule.

A clear understanding of these processes is necessary for making informed and effective management decisions. Due to the spatially and temporally dynamic nature of many systems, population connectivity and local extinction-colonization processes can be difficult to assess, but graph theoretic and occupancy modeling approaches are increasingly being utilized to answer such vital ecological questions. In our study, we used 6 years of egg mass counts from 34 ponds for Rana sylvatica to parameterize spatially explicit demographic network models. Our models revealed that the studied populations have spatial structure with strong source-sink dynamics. We also assessed the colonization and persistence probability of each pond using multi-season occupancy modeling. We observed extreme fluctuation in reproductive effort among years, resulting in variable levels of connectivity across the landscape. Pond colonization and persistence were most influenced by local population dynamics, but colonization was also affected by precipitation. Our demographic network model had moderate ability to predict reproductive effort, but accuracy was hindered by variation in annual precipitation. Source populations had higher colonization and persistence rates as well as a greater proportion of ravine habitat within 1,000 m than sink populations. By linking a spatially explicit connectivity model with a temporal occupancy/persistence model, we provide a framework for interpreting patterns of occupancy and dispersal that can serve as an initial guide for future habitat management and restoration. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aponds 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability1 aRittenhouse, Tracy A.

Reliable air/water (KAW), 1-octanol/water (KOW), and octanol/air partition coefficients (KOA) for those compounds and their common degradation product, dimethylsilanediol, are critical for accurate prediction of the environmental fate, distribution, and transport of these materials. Challenges have been encountered in determining these properties for cVMS and their degradation products mainly due to the extremely low water solubility of the organosiloxanes, low volatility of their degradation products, and reactivity of those compounds in the water/1-octanol system that can lead to inconsistent and inaccurate partition coefficients. A novel direct method is presented for the simultaneous determination of KAW, KOW, and KOA of organic compounds and was applied to these organosilicon compounds. It was tested in a range of log KAW values from −6.8 to 3.1, log KOW values from −0.4 to 8.9, and log KOA values up to 7. The advantages of the new direct method include the improved accuracy, a shortened measurement time, simultaneous measurement of three partition coefficients of multiple compounds, self-consistency among resultant partition coefficients, and a wide range of applicability including materials that may be slowly reactive in the water/1-octanol system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenvironmental fate 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 3aprediction 3asiloxanes 3awater solubility1 aKropscott, Bruce0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 84, no. 4 p.1948-1955dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac202953t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001600263520089700279592002801176650001501204650001201219650001201231650001501243650001501258650002301273650001301296650002201309651001101331653001901342653001501361653001801376653001101394653001301405653001201418700001801430773009801448856008501546852000901631655001201640IND60466562620221123003126.0170724e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046656262DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2015.10416582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aØian, Hogne10aProperty and Possession: Hunting Tourism and the Morality of Landownership in Rural Norway  ap. 104-118.  aAs forest areas have become increasingly relevant to the public as recreational landscapes, and outdoor recreation is increasingly diverse and specialized, we explore how notions of property and issues of public access are made relevant in controversies over hunting rights in Norway. Focusing on responses of local hunters to landowners’ recent promotion of hunting tourism, one central finding is that the hunters tend to engage with the hunting grounds as part of landscapes they identify strongly with. While recognizing the principle of private ownership to hunting rights, local hunters raise moral and political objections to how the ownership is performed. We conclude that taking the contextual nature of property relations into account is important when considering controversies over access to land and resources, not least in connection with development of nature-based tourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecotourism 3aforests 3ahunters 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3aoutdoor recreation 3apolitics 3aprivate ownership 3aNorway 0aland ownership 0alandscapes 0amoose hunting 0aNorway 0aproperty 0atourism1 aSkogen, Ketil0 tSociety & natural resources.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.104-118dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.10416583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011400167300001600281520197800297592002802275650002302303650001202326650001402338650002302352650002002375650001002395650001302405650002902418650001602447700002302463773012402486856008202610852000902692655001202701IND60567575820180615000000.0170425e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056757582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b112482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnee, Josefine10aOperando Raman to Enhance the Methanol-to-DME Conversion Over Non-Thermally-Pretreated Keggin Heteropolyacids  ap. 556-566.  aHeteropolyacids (HPAs) are metal–oxygen clusters that are nowadays widely used in acid catalysis. Indeed, as they possess a very strong Brönsted acidity, approaching the superacid region, they generally allow performing reactions at lower temperatures than conventional catalysts. In the present paper, we use in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy to optimize the catalytic performance of H₃PW₁₂O₄₀the strongest Keggin-type HPAin the low temperature (150 °C) gas phase dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME), which is one of the most promising renewable fuels for the future. Precisely, we demonstrate that the ability of methanol to displace the HPA’s crystallization water located in-between the Keggin unitsand thus to reach the acidic protonsdecreases with increasing temperature. Actually, we show that one and the same flow of methanol scarcely displaces the crystallization water at reaction temperature 150 °C, whereas, at a temperature as low as 25 °C, it succeeds to completely dehydrate the HPA. By exploiting this, namely by pre-exposing the initially hydrated HPA to methanol at 25 °C right before heating it to a reaction temperature of 150 °C, the conversion increases dramatically, precisely by a factor 3. As reflected by the spectra, the flow of methanol at 25 °C does not only dehydrate but also recrystallizes the HPA (so rendering its structure more rigid and the diffusion in-between the Keggin units later at 150 °C more difficult). As a consequence, the conversion obtained at 150 °C is not as high as after a thermal dehydration under inert atmosphere. However, to be complete, the latter requires a temperature as high as 320 °C which is not tolerated by all HPA-based catalysts. In other words, the present work shows how to pretreat an HPA-based catalyst in order to maximize its catalytic performance in the methanol-to-DME reaction, depending on its resistance or not to a harsh thermal pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallization 3agases 3amethanol 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature1 aGaigneaux, Eric M.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.556-566dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b112483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013600155300001600291500002000307520121300327592002801540596009701568596013101665596007501796596005001871650001001921650001301931650003101944650001001975650002001985650002102005650002102026650001302047650001202060650002002072650002202092650000902114650002002123700005602143700001602199700001502215700001502230700001602245700002102261773015002282856007302432852000902505655001202514IND60627773320221122034944.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062777332DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.129932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jiajie14aThe effect of dietary ginseng polysaccharide supplementation on porcine milk‐derived esRNAs involved in the host immune responses  ap. 276-282.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGinseng polysaccharides (GPS) have been well known as an immune modulator. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplemental GPS on the immune responses involved in sow’s milk‐derived exosomal shuttle RNAs (esRNAs) using RNA‐Seq and miRNA‐Seq. Of the 213 identified miRNA types, a total of 26 conserved miRNAs were differently expressed in response to GPS supplementation, including 10 up‐regulated and 16 down‐regulated miRNAs in GPS feeding group. In addition, exosomal transcriptome analysis identified 14,696 protein‐coding genes in sow’s milk exosomes, and 283 genes with 204 and 79 candidates showing up and down‐regulation were significantly responded to GPS supplementation. Integrated analysis of each differently expressed miRNA with significantly expressed genes further revealed the presence of 51 highly conserved miRNA–gene interactions that were annotated to be related to immunoregulatory functions. This work provided an important advance in the functional identification of dietary GPS supplementation and more fundamental information about how GPS promoted the immune response and healthy growth of the infant from mothers at molecular levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017KTSCX023cInnovative projects of General Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province  aOSKL201502cOpening Foundation of the State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro‐bioresources  a2016YFD0500503cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31472163cNatural Science Foundation of China 3aPanax 3aexosomes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3amicroRNA 3amothers 3apolysaccharides 3asequence analysis 3asows 3atranscriptomics1 aXiong, Jiali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0274-22111 aYao, Liyuan1 aChen, Ting1 aLuo, Junyi1 aXi, Qianyun1 aZhang, Yongliang0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2019 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.276-282dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.129933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002500172245007800197300001600275520146100291592002801752650002201780650002001802650001301822650001701835650001701852650001701869650002301886650000901909650001801918650001101936650000901947650001201956650001401968650003201982650002102014650003102035650001502066650002202081650003402103650003702137650003402174650000902208650002302217650003102240650003402271650002602305700002902331700003102360700004602391700002302437700002702460773010202487856008702589852000902676655001202685IND50060233220221121035128.0141112e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006023322DNAL7 a231379762pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerreault, François10aGenotoxic effects of copper oxide nanoparticles in Neuro 2A cell cultures  ap. 117-124.  aCopper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are used for their biocide potential however they were also shown to be highly toxic to mammalian cells. Therefore, the effects of CuO NPs should be carefully investigated to determine the most sensitive processes for CuO NP toxicity. In this study, the genotoxicity of CuO NPs was investigated in vitro, using the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A. Genotoxic effects related to DNA fragmentation, DNA methylation and chromosomal damage, as well as lipid peroxidation, were investigated and compared to cytotoxic effects, measured by the mitochondrial reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide into formazan. Based on mitochondrial activity, CuO NPs were found to be cytotoxic. At the highest concentration tested (400mgl⁻¹), 63% of cell viability was found in Neuro-2A cells after 24h of treatment to CuO NPs. CuO NPs were also found to induce DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and micronucleus formation. The micronucleus assay was the most sensitive to evaluate CuO NP genotoxicity and micronucleus frequency was increased significantly at 12.5mgl⁻¹ CuO NPs after 24h of treatment. At this concentration, no significant change of cell viability was found using the mitochondrial activity assay. These results highlight the important risk of genotoxic effects of CuO NPs and show that genotoxicity assays are a sensitive approach to evaluate the risk of CuO NP toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aDNA methylation 3abromides 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3agenotoxicity 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoxides 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aCytochalasin Bxmetabolism 2aDNA Damage 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aDNA Methylationxdrug effects 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxtoxicity 2aMice 2aMicronucleus Tests 2aMitochondriaxdrug effects 2aTetrazolium Saltsxmetabolism 2aThiazolesxmetabolism1 aMelegari, Silvia Pedroso1 ada Costa, Cristina Henning1 ade Oliveira Franco Rossetto, Ana Letícia1 aPopović, Radovan,1 aMatias, William Gerson0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 441 p.117-124dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014900168300001600317500002000333520145100353592002801804650002301832650001101855650001601866650001501882650001001897650002701907650003401934650001501968650001801983650001602001650001102017650001202028650001302040650002102053650002502074650002802099650001702127650001402144650002002158650002802178700001402206700002102220700001702241773013802258856007502396852000902471655001202480IND60770536320221119203035.0220317e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077053632DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.132142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarunarathne, Sakura D.10aCRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and natural variation analysis demonstrate the potential for HvARE1 in improvement of nitrogen use efficiency in barley  ap. 756-770.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrogen is a major determinant of grain yield and quality. As excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer leads to environmental pollution and high production costs, improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is fundamental for a sustainable agriculture. Here, we dissected the role of the barley abnormal cytokinin response1 repressor 1 (HvARE1) gene, a candidate for involvement in NUE previously identified in a genome‐wide association study, through natural variation analysis and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated protein 9 (Cas9)‐mediated gene editing. HvARE1 was predominantly expressed in leaves and shoots, with very low expression in roots under low nitrogen conditions. Agrobacterium‐mediated genetic transformation of immature embryos (cv. Golden Promise) with single guide RNAs targeting HvARE1 generated 22 T₀ plants, from which four T₁ lines harbored missense and/or frameshift mutations based on genotyping. Mutant are1 lines exhibited an increase in plant height, tiller number, grain protein content, and yield. Moreover, we observed a 1.5‐ to 2.8‐fold increase in total chlorophyll content in the flag leaf at the grain filling stage. Delayed senescence by 10–14 d was also observed in mutant lines. Barley are1 mutants had high nitrogen content in shoots under low nitrogen conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of ARE1 in NUE improvement in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abarley 3achlorophyll 3acytokinins 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant height 3apollution 3aprotein content 3asustainable agriculture1 aHan, Yong1 aZhang, Xiao‐Qi1 aLi, Chengdao0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2022 Mar., v. 64, no. 3 p.756-770dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.132143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245007000193300001500263520175200278592002802030650000802058650001502066650001202081650001002093650003502103650001602138650003102154650001002185650001402195650001802209650001502227650001602242650001102258650003102269650001502300650001502315650001502330650001202345700002802357700002302385700001702408700002102425700001902446700002002465700002402485700002702509700002702536773015102563856006902714856010202783990002302885852000902908655001202917IND60643414520221118080142.0190510e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064341452DNAL7 a10.3791/502452doi7 aPMC36395162pmcid7 a235243782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Kurt10aPurification of transcripts and metabolites from Drosophila heads  ap. e50245.  aFor the last decade, we have tried to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal degeneration using Drosophila as a model organism. Although fruit flies provide obvious experimental advantages, research on neurodegenerative diseases has mostly relied on traditional techniques, including genetic interaction, histology, immunofluorescence, and protein biochemistry. These techniques are effective for mechanistic, hypothesis-driven studies, which lead to a detailed understanding of the role of single genes in well-defined biological problems. However, neurodegenerative diseases are highly complex and affect multiple cellular organelles and processes over time. The advent of new technologies and the omics age provides a unique opportunity to understand the global cellular perturbations underlying complex diseases. Flexible model organisms such as Drosophila are ideal for adapting these new technologies because of their strong annotation and high tractability. One challenge with these small animals, though, is the purification of enough informational molecules (DNA, mRNA, protein, metabolites) from highly relevant tissues such as fly brains. Other challenges consist of collecting large numbers of flies for experimental replicates (critical for statistical robustness) and developing consistent procedures for the purification of high-quality biological material. Here, we describe the procedures for collecting thousands of fly heads and the extraction of transcripts and metabolites to understand how global changes in gene expression and metabolism contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These procedures are easily scalable and can be applied to the study of proteomic and epigenomic contributions to disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aanimals 3abrain 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afruit flies 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistology 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aorganelles 3aproteomics 3atechnology 3atissues1 aSanchez-Garcia, Jonatan1 aWilliams, Caroline1 aKhare, Swati1 aMathur, Krishanu1 aGraze, Rita M.1 aHahn, Daniel A.1 aMcIntyre, Lauren M.1 aRincon-Limas, Diego E.1 aFernandez-Funez, Pedro0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Mar. 15, , no. 73 p.e50245-e50245dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/502453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50245/purification-of-transcripts-and-metabolites-from-drosophila-heads  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170520113500316592002801451650001601479650002801495650001401523650001301537650002301550650001301573650001501586650001801601650001101619650001101630650001801641650002001659650001101679651001301690653001601703653001201719653001201731653001701743653001201760653002001772700001901792700002101811773009601832856008501928852000902013655001202022IND60729671920221121042402.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072967192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2021.1008582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHook, Sharon E.12aA metatranscriptomic analysis of changing dynamics in the plankton communities adjacent to aquaculture leases in southern Tasmania, Australia  aAquaculture releases nitrogen to the marine environment, potentially changing dynamics of local plankton populations and causing adverse impacts. Metatranscriptomics have been used to study planktonic nutrient cycles and community dynamics. We hypothesised that the metatranscriptome could be used to monitor changing phytoplankton physiology near leases. To test this hypothesis, opportunistic samples were collected from one oceanic location in winter and one estuarine location in spring and analysed via RNASeq. Transcriptomes from different locations were found to have little overlap, due to different community compositions in the oceanic and estuarine locations. Transcript function was similar at each location. Proximity to the salmon pen had little influence over the transcriptome at the estuarine location. In the oceanic environment, diatom-based activity decreased near pens and dinoflagellate-based activity increased as demonstrated through the abundance of carbon fixation and nitrogen-acquisition-related transcripts. Our initial results suggest that the use of the metatranscriptome in monitoring is promising.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aestuaries 3agenomics 3amarine environment 3anitrogen 3aphysiology 3aphytoplankton 3asalmon 3aspring 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awinter 3aTasmania 0aAquaculture 0aAmmonia 0aNitrate 0aTransporters 0aDiatoms 0aDinoflagellates1 aWhite, Camille1 aRoss, D.

Adjuvants have been proved to be successful in several species at inducing increased immune responses against poorly immunogenic antigens. Fish are not the exception and promising results of adjuvanted vaccine formulations in many species are needed. In this study, over a period of 300 days, we characterized the apparent damage and immune response in gilthead seabream immunized by intraperitoneal injection with the model antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) alone or formulated with Montanide ISA water-in-oil (761 or 763), or Imject™ aluminum hydroxide (aluminium), as adjuvants. Throughout the trial, external tissue damage was examined visually, but no change was observed. Internally, severe adhesions, increased fat tissue, and hepatomegaly were recorded, but, without impairing animal health. At 120 days post priming (dpp), histopathological evaluations of head-kidney, spleen and liver revealed the presence of altered melanomacrophage centers (MMC) in HK and spleen, but not in liver. Surprisingly, in all aluminium treated fish, classical stains unmasked a toxic effect on splenic-MMC, unequivocally characterized by a strong cell depletion. Furthermore, at 170 dpp transmission electron microscopy confirmed this data. Paradoxically, at the same time powerful immune responses were recorded in most vaccinated groups, including the aluminium treatment. Whatever the case, despite the observed adhesions and MMC depletion, fish physiology was not affected, and most side-effects were resolved after 300 dpp. Therefore, our data support adjuvant inclusion, but strongly suggest that use of aluminium must be further explored in detail before it might benefit the rational design of new vaccination strategies in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aadjuvants 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aanimal health 3aaquaculture 3afish 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3aintraperitoneal injection 3akeyhole limpet hemocyanin 3akidneys 3aliver 3amodels 3ashellfish 3aspleen 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aAdjuvant 0aAluminum hydroxide 0aImmunity 0aMelanomacrophage centers 0aMontanide 0aSeabream 0aSide-effects 0aVaccination1 aGarcía-Alcazar, Alicia1 aMeseguer, José,1 aMulero, Victoriano0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Feb., v. 85 p.31-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245014900209520171500358592002802073650001302101650001602114650001602130650001902146650001102165650001602176653002602192653003102218653001902249653002502268653002702293653002102320700001402341700005302355700002102408700001702429700006202446700002502508700005502533700001702588700006002605700002102665773010702686856008702793852000902880655001202889IND60776141420221119214725.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1191302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohno, Nanase1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8200-780110aImpacts of missing OH reactivity and aerosol uptake of HO2 radicals on tropospheric O3 production during the AQUAS-Kyoto summer campaign in 2018  aGaining quantitative information about the HOₓ cycle involved in ozone (O₃) production is important for reduction of tropospheric O₃. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of both the missing OH reactivity and the heterogeneous loss of HO₂ due to ambient aerosol uptake on the photochemical O₃ production potential and regime analysis during the Air QUAlity Study (AQUAS)-Kyoto summer campaign in 2018. We examined the missing OH reactivity, which was 50% of the averaged total OH reactivity (9.8 ± 3.8 (1σ) s⁻¹), and the uptake loss rate of HO₂ on ambient aerosols of 0.0017 ± 0.0015 s⁻¹. The real-time uptake loss rate of HO₂ was measured by employing a versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES). The O₃ production potential increased by a factor of two when the missing OH reactivity was considered and decreased by ∼20% when the HO₂ loss due to aerosol uptake was considered. In addition, the missing OH reactivity and the HO₂ loss due to aerosol uptake decreased the relative sensitivity of the O₃ production rate to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and increased that to NOₓ (= NO + NO₂). Consequently, the NOₓ limited regime period, the period in which the relative sensitivity of the O₃ production rate to NOₓ was higher than that to VOCs, was expanded by a few hours. Finally, the effect of aerosol uptake on O₃ production was anti-correlated with the NO concentration and peaked around noon when the NO concentration was the minimum. It is concluded that aerosols likely affect tropospheric O₃ production in suburban and rural areas, where the concentrations of NOₓ, particularly NO, are very low ([NO] < 0.3 ppb).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aenvironment 3aphotochemistry 3asummer 3atroposphere 0aMissing OH reactivity 0aLaser-induced fluorescence 0aAerosol uptake 0aHydroperoxyl radical 0aHeterogeneous reaction 0aOzone production1 aZhou, Jun1 aLi, Jiaru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3576-98591 aTakemura, Marina1 aOno, Natsuki1 aSadanaga, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4993-86521 aNakashima, Yoshihiro1 aSatō, Kei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3716-37301 aKato, Shungo1 aSakamoto, Yosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9863-42411 aKajii, Yoshizumi0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 July 15, v. 281 p.119130-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1191303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245006700176300001800243520131000261592002801571650002201599650002901621650001501650650001201665650002801677650002701705650001601732650001501748650001301763651001701776651001801793700002501811700002201836700002301858700006401881773010701945856008202052852000902134655001202143IND60717618220221118165844.0201113e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071761822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02157-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenkenberger, Joseph S.10aWatershed influences on mercury in tributaries to Lake Ontario  ap. 1614-1626.  aMercury (Hg) concentrations and speciation were measured in nine tributaries to Lake Ontario as part of two independent field-sampling programs. Among the study tributaries, mean total Hg (THg) concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 ng/L; mean dissolved Hg (THgD) ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 ng/L; mean particulate Hg (THgP) ranged from 0.3 to 2.0 ng/L; and mean methylmercury (MeHg) ranged from 0.06 to 0.14 ng/L. Watershed land cover, total suspended solids (TSS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were evaluated as potential controls of tributary Hg. Significant relationships between THgD and DOC were limited, whereas significant relationships between THgP and TSS were common across watersheds. Total suspended solids was strongly correlated with the percentage of agricultural land in watersheds. Particle enrichment of Hg (mass Hg/mass TSS) was highly variable, but distinctly higher in US tributaries likely due to higher TSS in Canadian tributaries associated with higher urban and agricultural land cover. MeHg was largely associated with the aqueous phase, and MeHg as a fraction of THg was positively correlated to percent open water coverage in the watershed. Wetland cover was positively correlated to THg and MeHg concentrations, while urban land cover was only related to higher THgP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adissolved organic carbon 3aland cover 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3atotal suspended solids 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aLake Ontario 3aUnited States1 aFakhraei, Habibollah1 aBranfireun, Brian1 aMontesdeoca, Mario1 aDriscoll, Charles T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-28900 tEcotoxicology.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 10 p.1614-1626dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02157-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015900166300001600325520166200341592002802003650001402031650001202045650001502057650001702072650001602089650001902105650002102124650001502145650002002160650002202180650001402202650002702216650001802243650002402261650001902285650001102304653002002315653003102335653002302366653003102389653003602420700001602456700002402472700001802496700001802514773011202532856008502644852000902729655001202738IND60593636720221116154643.0180830e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059363672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bumjoo10aEnergy efficiency enhancement of electromembrane desalination systems by local flow redistribution optimized for the asymmetry of cation/anion diffusivity  ap. 280-287.  aIn an electrochemical system, ion transport near ion exchange membranes or electrodes induces inevitable concentration polarization (i.e., formation of diffusion boundaries), which impedes the mass transport and worsens the energy efficiency. To mitigate the effect of concentration polarization (CP), various efforts towards mass transport enhancement employed structures, often called spacers, which promote mixing and modify the flow velocity distribution in the channel. In this work, we employed an electrodialysis (ED) system as a model to investigate the mass transport effects of embedded microstructures, which can redistribute the local flow velocity. We placed a row of cylindrical posts inside the diluate channel and varied the distance from the posts to the membranes. We studied the effect of this post-to-membrane distance on the mass transport by measuring the current-voltage responses and visualizing ion concentration and flow velocity profiles. The study was done through microfluidic ED model experiments and direct numerical simulation based on the coupled Navier-Stokes and Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Our results indicate that when the posts are positioned near the center of the channel, the mass transport is enhanced due to the increase in local convection near the concentration boundary layers. More importantly, we discovered that the mass transport is maximized when the location of the posts is slightly off-centered, due to the asymmetry of the cation/anion diffusivity (DNa+<DCl-). Compared to a system without any structures, the embedded posts can improve both the electrical energy efficiency and the salt removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acations 3aconvection 3adesalination 3adiffusivity 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrodialysis 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3aion-exchange membranes 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amicrostructure 3amixing 0aElectrodialysis 0aMass transport enhancement 0aSpacer engineering 0aConcentration polarization 0aIon concentration visualization1 aChoi, Siwon1 aPhạm, Văn Sáng,1 aKwak, Rhokyun1 aHan, Jongyoon0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 524 p.280-287dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04258naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015000165520221200315592002802527650002002555650001902575650002002594650001602614650001702630650001802647650002502665650002602690650001402716650001902730650001102749650001402760650000902774650001502783650002502798650001602823650001002839650001402849653000702863653000702870653000802877653001102885653000902896653000902905653001002914653000902924653000802933653000802941653000902949653000602958653000802964653000702972653000902979653000802988653001002996653001503006653002003021653001903041653002203060653002403082653002703106700005203133700002203185700001603207700001403223700005303237773011603290856008503406852000903491655001203500IND60729672120221122045850.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072967212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuthar, A.10aAnti-piroplasmic activity of novobiocin as heat shock protein 90 inhibitor against in vitro cultured Theileria equi and Babesia caballi parasites  aTheileria equi and Babesia caballi are the causative agents of equine piroplasmosis (EP). Currently, imidocarb dipropionate (ID) is the only available drug for treating the clinical form of EP. Serious side effects and incomplete clearance of infection is a major drawback of ID. Heat-shock proteins (Hsp) play a vital role in the life cycle of these haemoprotozoans by preventing alteration in protein conformation. These Hsp are activated during transmission of EP sporozoites from the tick vector (poikilotherm) to the natural host (homeotherm) and facilitate parasite survival. In the present study, we targeted the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) pathway of T. equi and B. caballi by using its inhibitor drug - novobiocin. Dose-dependent efficacy of novobiocin on the growth of T. equi and B. caballi was observed in in vitro culture. Additionally, we examined dose-dependent cell cytotoxicity on host peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and haemolytic activity on equine red blood cells (RBC). In vivo organ toxicity of novobiocin was also assessed in a mouse model. The IC₅₀ (50 % inhibitory concentration) value of novobiocin against T. equi and B. caballi was 165 μM and 84.85 μM, respectively. Novobiocin significantly arrested the in vitro growth of T. equi and B. caballi parasites at 100 μM and 200 μM drug concentration, respectively. In vitro treated parasites had distorted nuclear material and showed no further viability. Based on the equine PBMCs and RBC, the drug was found to be safe even at 1000 μM concentration and the CC₅₀ (50 % cytotoxicity concentration) values were 11.63 mM and 261.97 mM. Very high specific selective index (SSI) values (70.47 and 1587) were observed for equine PBMCs and RBC, respectively. Organ-specific biochemical markers and histopathological examination indicated no adverse effect of the drug at a dose rate of 50 mg kg body weight in the mouse model. The results demonstrate the growth inhibitory effect of novobiocin against T. equi and B. caballi parasites and its safety for host cell lines with very high SSI. Hence, it can be inferred that the Theileria/Babesia Hsp-90 family are potential drug targets worthy of further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia caballi 3aTheileria equi 3aadverse effects 3abody weight 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aequine piroplasmosis 3aheat-shock protein 90 3ahemolysis 3ahistopathology 3ahorses 3aimidocarb 3amice 3anovobiocin 3aprotein conformation 3asporozoites 3aticks 3aviability 0aEP 0aID 0aHSP 0aHsp-90 0aCC50 0aIC50 0aPBMCs 0aRBCs 0aSSI 0aOIE 0aMASP 0ah 0aPHA 0aOD 0aKSHV 0aPBS 0aNOAEL 0aNovobiocin 0aBabesia caballi 0aTheileria equi 0aCell cytotoxicity 0aHaemolytic activity 0aIn vivo organ toxicity1 aMaji, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2675-96831 aGopalkrishnan, A.1 aRaval, S.H.1 aKumar, R.1 aKumar, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1455-47200 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 July, v. 12, no. 4 p.101696-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245011400202300001300316520112000329592002801449650002001477650001701497650000901514650001801523650001901541650002601560650003301586650002601619650002901645653002001674653001701694653002001711653001701731653003901748653001301787653002001800653003901820653001801859653001501877700002501892700002101917700002201938700001801960700002001978700002101998773009702019856007702116852000902193655001202202IND60596858920221117203014.0210213e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059685892DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2017-00742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidaković, Vera1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2330-208X10aSignificance of diarylheptanoids for chemotaxonomical distinguishing between Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana  ap. 9-16.  aDiarylheptanoids are a group of secondary metabolites widely distributed in the Betulaceae family and characteristic for Alnus species. In this study, the chemotaxonomic power of diarylheptanoids, such as hirsutanonol-5-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, rubranoside A, oregonin, platyphylloside, alnuside A and hirsutanonol, has been investigated in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) for differentiation of Alnus species. Concentrations of six diarylheptanoids in the bark extracts of two natural populations of Alnus glutinosa (black alder) and Alnus incana (gray alder) were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). PCA clearly shows the separation of three groups. Populations I (A. glutinosa) and II (A. incana) both consisted of individuals of the corresponding species. Four individuals from both sampled populations formed a separate group (population III), which possibly represents a hybrid group. Accordingly, diarylheptanoids may serve in combination with PCA as chemotaxonomic markers at the species level, which may also reveal hybrid species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aAlnus incana 3abark 3achemotaxonomy 3ahybrid species 3aliquid chromatography 3aprincipal component analysis 3asecondary metabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAlnus glutinosa 0aAlnus incana 0adiarylheptanoid 0ahirsutanonol 0alinear discriminant analysis (LDA) 0aoregonin 0aplatyphylloside 0aprincipal component analysis (PCA) 0arubranoside A 0aUPLC-MS/MS1 aNovaković, Miroslav1 aPopović, Zorica1 aJankovič, Milan,1 aMatić, Rada,1 aTešević, Vele1 aBojović, Srdjan0 tHolzforschung.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 72, no. 1 p.9-16dDe GruyterwJournal:1940x1437-434X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2017-00743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245005800209300001800267520150300285592002801788596004501816596007401861650002601935650002101961650002001982650001102002650002102013650001902034650001402053650000902067650001402076650001402090650001002104650001202114650002802126650001102154650001202165650001502177651001302192700002202205700002302227700001502250700001902265700002102284700001402305700001902319700001502338700002002353700001902373773010702392856008202499852000902581655001202590IND60717618420221118171446.0201113e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071761842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-020-02163-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillard, Geoffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3310-483710aPatterns and trends of fish mercury in New York State  ap. 1709-1720.  aIn the mid-2000s a survey was conducted to evaluate fish mercury in lakes across New York State. Approximately 10 years later a second survey examining adult sportfish from 103 lakes and reservoirs was conducted to evaluate the response of fish mercury to recent declines in US mercury emissions. Of those lakes, 43 were part of the earlier survey and were examined to determine if mercury concentrations in four popular sport species, Yellow Perch, Walleye, and Small- and Largemouth Bass, declined in response to decreasing emissions. Water samples were also collected at 35 of these lakes and analyzed for mercury, methylmercury and other analytes. The Adirondack and Catskill regions remain biological mercury hotspots with elevated concentrations in fish. The most widely sampled species, Yellow Perch, showed significant increases in mercury in the Northeast and West regions of New York State over the past decade. The increases in Yellow Perch mercury is not consistent with significant reductions in water concentrations of both total and methylmercury observed corresponding in lake water samples. This discrepancy suggests watershed and in-lake processes beyond mercury emissions, such as recovery from acid deposition, impacts from climate change, or changes in food web structure may be controlling fish mercury concentrations. These results demonstrate a need for a consistent, long-term program to monitor fish mercury to inform the status of mercury contamination in New York State.  aPublisher supplied data  aDGE-1449617cNational Science Foundation  a034357cNew York State Energy Research and Development Authority (US) 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aPerca flavescens 3aacid deposition 3aadults 3achemical species 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3afish 3afood webs 3agame fish 3alakes 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3asports 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aNew York1 aDriscoll, Charles1 aMontesdeoca, Mario1 aYang, Yang1 aTaylor, Mariah1 aBoucher, Stephen1 aShaw, Amy1 aRichter, Wayne1 aPaul, Eric1 aParker, Colleen1 aYokota, Kiyoko0 tEcotoxicology.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 10 p.1709-1720dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02163-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245004800169520120500217592002801422650001501450650001501465650001501480650001101495650001601506653001201522653001501534653001201549653001301561653001401574700001701588773013301605856008401738852000901822655001201831IND60729672220221122045801.0211106e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072967222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Carlos10aAesthetic plating and motivation in context  aPrevious research has suggested that people prefer balanced over unbalanced plating compositions. Importantly, though, the question remains as to whether plating balance influences consumers' associations of plating with approach and avoidance motivation. In the present research, we study how plating balance influence people's aesthetic evaluations and approach and avoidance associations. In addition, based on the idea that context can influence aesthetic evaluations, we manipulate whether the different plates are presented in regular dining or high-end restaurant scenarios. Throughout two experiments we extend previous findings suggesting that plating balance influences aesthetic pleasure. We find that balanced plates are considered more aesthetically pleasing than unbalanced plates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that people associate balanced plates more (less) strongly with approach (avoidance) words relative to unbalanced plates. Notably, our analysis failed to reveal an effect of plating context on either aesthetic pleasure or approach and avoidance ratings. This suggests that balance may be a robust feature in aesthetic plating when it comes to its influence on these variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3agastronomy 3amotivation 3apeople 3arestaurants 0aPlating 0aAesthetics 0aContext 0aApproach 0aAvoidance1 aVeflen, Nina0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2021 July, v. 24 p.100323-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245011400213300002000327506007600347520140000423592002801823506003701851650001601888650001201904650000901916650000901925650001601934650001401950650002501964650001201989650001302001650001702014650001602031650002602047650001102073650001602084650001702100650001902117650002502136650000902161651001802170653000802188653001402196653001902210653001602229653001202245700001902257700002402276773019402300856007902494852000902573655001202582IND60230277820221207080120.0150614e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023027782DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14068531112doi7 aPMC42845582pmcid7 a255125102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTessum, Christopher W.10aLife cycle air quality impacts of conventional and alternative light-duty transportation in the United States  ap. 18490-18495.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCommonly considered strategies for reducing the environmental impact of light-duty transportation include using alternative fuels and improving vehicle fuel economy. We evaluate the air quality-related human health impacts of 10 such options, including the use of liquid biofuels, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) in internal combustion engines; the use of electricity from a range of conventional and renewable sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically detailed life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling; and exposure, concentration–response, and economic health impact modeling for ozone (O ₃) and fine particulate matter (PM ₂.₅). We find that powering vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or “grid average” electricity increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80% or more relative to using conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by low-emitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by 50% or more. Consideration of potential climate change impacts alongside the human health outcomes described here further reinforces the environmental preferability of EVs powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair quality 3aclimate 3acoal 3acorn 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3agasoline 3ahuman health 3ainventories 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asolar energy 3atransportation 3avehicles (equipment) 3awind 3aUnited States 0aLCA 0apollution 0abioelectricity 0aexternality 0aspatial1 aHill, Jason D.1 aMarshall, Julian D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 111, no. 52 p.18490-18495dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14068531113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002000195245013600215300001800351520162100369592002801990650001402018650001402032650001602046650002102062650001502083650001602098650001902114650002002133650001102153650002102164650001102185650001302196650001702209650001302226650001402239650001802253650002002271650001802291650002402309650001002333700002202343700002302365700002302388700002102411700002402432700002302456700001602479700002202495700001902517773009902536856008802635990002302723852000902746655001202755IND60098668120221117021942.0141105e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009866812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0072doi7 aPMC38204172pmcid7 a238498442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Joseph C.10aCoculturing human endometrial epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts alters cell-specific gene expression and cytokine production  ap. 1132-1143.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of coculturing endometrial epithelial cells (eEC) with paired endometrial stromal fibroblasts (eSF) on cell-specific gene expression and cytokine secretion patterns. DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: University research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Endometrial biopsies were obtained from premenopausal women. INTERVENTION(S): Polarized eEC and subject-paired eSF were cultured for 12.5 hours alone (monoculture) or combined in a two-chamber coculture system without cell-cell contact. Cells and conditioned media were analyzed for global gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. Purified, endometrial tissue-derived eEC and eSF isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) were used as noncultured controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cell-specific global gene expression profiling and analysis of secreted cytokines in eEC/eSF cocultures and respective monocultures. RESULT(S): Transepithelial resistance, diffusible tracer exclusion, expression of tight junction proteins, and apical/basolateral vectorial secretion confirmed eEC structural and functional polarization. Distinct transcriptomes of eEC and eSF were consistent with their respective lineages and their endometrial origin. Coculture of eEC with eSF resulted in altered cell-specific gene expression and cytokine secretion. CONCLUSION(S): This coculture model provides evidence that interactions between endometrial functionally polarized epithelium and stromal fibroblasts affect cell-specific gene expression and cytokine secretion underscoring their relevance when modeling endometrium in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3acytokines 3aendometrium 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3apatients 3apremenopause 3aproteins 3asecretion 3astromal cells 3atight junctions 3atranscriptome 3auniversity research 3awomen1 aErikson, David W.1 aPiltonen, Terhi T.1 aMeyer, Michelle R.1 aBarragan, Fatima1 aMcIntire, Ramsey H.1 aTamaresis, John S.1 aVo, Kim Chi1 aGiudice, Linda C.1 aIrwin, Juan C.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Oct., v. 100, no. 4 p.1132-1143dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245014600210300001800356506007600374520215800450592002802608506003702636650002102673650001602694650001802710650002302728650001202751650001602763650001402779650001402793650001502807650001002822650001502832650000902847650001302856650002202869650002002891650001902911650001802930650001902948650001002967653002902977653000903006653002203015653002003037653002003057700002303077700001403100700001803114700002103132773018203153856008303335852000903418655001203427IND60544478420221207120612.0190417e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054447842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2015.03.0172doi7 aPMC45841612pmcid7 a259754572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheean, Patricia10aExploring Diet, Physical Activity, and Quality of Life in Females with Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Pilot Study to Support Future Intervention  ap. 1690-1698.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHistorically, women with metastatic breast cancer are excluded from lifestyle interventions under the assumptions that diet and physical activity will have little impact on their disease trajectory. However, recent treatment advances have led to significant increases in survivorship that pose challenges to this assumption.The objectives of this study were to measure dietary intake, physical functioning, and quality of life in a subset of women with metastatic breast cancer, and to inform future interventions in this growing population.Demographics, clinical characteristics, dietary intake, physical functioning, and quality of life were examined cross-sectionally using validated methodologies.Twenty-five women with metastatic breast cancer were recruited during a 4-month period (June 2014 to September 2014) from two university hospitals in the Midwest that serve an ethnically diverse patient population. Women completed questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls (1 weekday, 1 weekend).Lifestyle habits were analyzed.Means (±standard deviations) and frequencies were tallied and t tests were conducted.On average, participants were 58.8 (±12.8) years of age, predominantly minority, had been living with metastatic breast cancer for a mean of 36.9 (±29.3) months, and exhibited significant nutrition-impact symptomology (eg, pain, dry mouth, fatigue). Bone and lung were the most common sites of metastases. Compared to a larger, normative sample of women with metastatic breast cancer, study participants displayed similar physical (P=0.61) and functional well-being scores (P=0.76), but higher social (P=0.10) and emotional well-being scores (P<0.01). The analyses of lifestyle factors showed that the majority of women were overweight or obese (n=14), not routine exercisers (n=15), and had dietary patterns high in fat and low in fiber.This study supports that many women with metastatic breast cancer are in need of carefully tailored, evidence-based lifestyle strategies that address symptom burden, including weight management. The implications of diet and physical activity on quality of life in this population remain unexplored.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3adiet recall 3aeating habits 3aethnic differences 3afemales 3afood intake 3ahospitals 3alifestyle 3ametastasis 3amouth 3aoverweight 3apain 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3asurvival rate 3aweight control 3awomen 0aMetastatic breast cancer 0aDiet 0aPhysical activity 0aQuality of life 0aBody mass index1 aKabir, Christopher1 aRao, Ruta1 aHoskins, Kent1 aStolley, Melinda0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2015 Oct., v. 115, no. 10 p.1690-1698dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2015.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011500176300001800291520214200309592002802451650002402479650002602503650001102529650001502540650001202555650002602567650001402593650001102607650002002618650001502638650001302653650002402666650001002690650002202700650001002722650003202732650001402764651001402778700001902792773010602811856008102917852000902998655001203007IND50070920620221119231259.0150211e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007092062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-013-0422-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasparri, Nestor Ignacio10aRegional patterns and controls of biomass in semiarid woodlands: lessons from the Northern Argentina Dry Chaco  ap. 1131-1144.  aLand use change, particularly in forested ecosystems, has a direct impact on the global carbon cycle. Consequently, the regional assessment of biomass and the understanding of its current spatial controls are research priorities for regional ecology and land use. Field data and satellite imagery were combined here to map woodlands and estimate their above-ground biomass (AGB) in the Dry Chaco ecoregion of northern Argentina. Allometric equations were used to derive AGB from diameter at breast height data collected at 50 samples during 2007. In order to generate the AGB regional map, this information was later associated with MODIS-Terra spectral data (NDVI) using the Random Forest (RF) method. Finally, AGB spatial patterns were associated with potential biophysical and human controlling factors through correlation and regression analyses. Results indicate that the use of RF and NDVI of the dry season derived from MODIS-Terra was suitable to map regional AGB, what makes this methodology applicable to other dry woodlands. The RF model used to map AGB showed a mean deviation of 2.9 % and a precision of 15 % for one prediction. At this regional scale of analysis, biophysical rather than human factors controlled AGB spatial patterns, in part because the region includes a wide range of environmental situations. Warmer conditions showed a higher biomass, suggesting an energetic limitation for AGB accumulation. However, human controls (distance to towns, cultivation, and roads) also conditioned AGB patterns, suggesting lower AGB values near cultivated areas. The relation between AGB and water availability was surprisingly weak, but partially obscured by the land use history and degradation due to extensive cattle ranching. We propose that a combination of environmental factor and land use affects the AGB regional patterns and promotes unexpected relationships with environmental factors. This work represents the first spatially explicit AGB (patterns and controls) analysis for an extensive subtropical dry woodland area (113,000 km²) and shows how biophysical and human factors co-control regional patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acattle 3adry season 3aecology 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3ahumans 3aland use change 3aprediction 3aranching 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3aspectral analysis 3atowns 3atree and stand measurements 3awoodlands 3aArgentina1 aBaldi, Germán0 tRegional environmental change.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 6 p.1131-1144dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-013-0422-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245006900163506002800232520172600260592002801986506003702014650002602051650003402077650003202111650000902143650001402152650001202166651001402178653001202192653002802204653000902232653000902241653001402250700002102264700002102285773011702306856007702423852000902500655001202509IND60773781720221207060238.0171211e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077378172DNAL7 a10.14692/jfi.9.6.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraptana, R Heru10aPatogenisitas Virus Tungro pada Varietas Tetua Padi Tahan Tungro  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Tungro is one of the major diseases in rice which has become a constraint in increasing rice production in Indonesia. Tungro is caused by infection of two different viruses, i.e. Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV), both of which can only be transmitted by green leafhoppers <em>Nephotettix virescens </em>(Distant) in a semipersistent manner. Since there is an indication of the existance of virulence variation of tungro viruses from different areas and the specific relationship between resistance of varieties and tungro viruses isolates, it is important to study the pathogenicity of tungro viruses from some endemic areas in Indonesia. This study aimed to identify the pathogenicity of tungro viruses from several endemic areas in Indonesia in some resistant varieties. One susceptible variety i.e. TN1 and ten resistant varieties were used in the study. Surveys and collection of infected plants and green leafhoppers were done in tungro endemic areas, namely West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara. Artificial transmission using the test tube method was used in the pathogenicity test. Green leafhoppers caught from the field were used as transmitters.. The pathogenicity of tungro viruses were identified by the values of the incidence of tungro and the diseases indexes (DI). The result showed that difference in pathogenicity of tungro viruses in some resistant varieties was observed. Isolates from Central Java, Central Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara were able to infect all of resistant varieties and the pathogenicity of Central Java isolate was the highest among the other isolates.</p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNephotettix virescens 3aRice tungro bacilliform virus 3aRice tungro spherical virus 3arice 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aIndonesia 0aendemic 0aresistance of varieties 0aRTBV 0aRTSV 0avirulence1 aSumardiyono, Y B1 aTrisyono, Y Andi0 tJurnal Fitopatologi.g2014 Aug., v. 9, no. 6dPerhimpunan Fitopatologi IndonesiawJournal:27732x2339-24797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.14692/jfi.9.6.1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166300001800299520220900317592002802526650001302554650001002567650000902577650002202586650001302608650001202621650002802633650001202661650001602673650002302689650001902712650001402731650001902745650001302764651001302777700002502790700002002815700001902835700001502854773010702869856008202976852000903058655001203067IND60717618620221118165900.0201113e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071761862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02142-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauer, Amy K.10aMercury exposure in songbird communities within Sphagnum bog and upland forest ecosystems in the Adirondack Park (New York, USA)  ap. 1815-1829.  aMercury (Hg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies within both aquatic and terrestrial food webs resulting in adverse physiological and reproductive effects on impacted wildlife populations, including songbird communities. Due to reducing conditions, wetland ecosystems promote the formation of methylmercury. Regional studies have documented elevated blood mercury concentrations in songbird species within these habitat types. The overall goal of this research was to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of Hg exposure for targeted songbird species within Sphagnum bog wetland systems and compare these patterns with adjacent upland forests in the Adirondack Park of New York State. Project sampling was conducted at study plots within four Sphagnum bog and associated upland forest sites from May - August during the 2008, 2009, and 2011 field seasons. The overall results documented: (1) blood Hg concentrations were elevated in songbird species inhabiting Sphagnum bog habitats as compared to nearby upland forest species; (2) target species within each habitat type exhibited consistent species-level patterns in blood Hg concentrations at each study site; and (3) no seasonal change in blood Hg concentrations within Sphagnum bog habitats was documented, but an increasing, followed by a decreasing seasonal pattern in mercury exposure was detected for upland forest species. Habitat type was demonstrated to influence avian Hg exposure levels. Moreover, Sphagnum bog ecosystems may be contributing to elevated Hg concentrations in biota within the surrounding environment. Seasonal patterns for blood Hg concentrations were found to vary between habitat type and are likely related to a combination of variables including habitat-driven Hg concentrations in prey items, seasonal dietary shifts, and annual molting cycles. This project emphasizes the importance of prioritizing future research efforts within identified high Hg habitat types, specifically wetland systems, to better characterize associated avian exposure levels, estimate the spatial extent of wetland systems on the surrounding environment, and identify locations of potential biological hotspots across the Adirondack Park.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3ablood 3abogs 3aforest ecosystems 3ahabitats 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3amolting 3aneurotoxins 3aseasonal variation 3asoil food webs 3asongbirds 3aupland forests 3awildlife 3aNew York1 aDriscoll, Charles T.1 aEvers, David C.1 aAdams, Evan M.1 aYang, Yang0 tEcotoxicology.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 10 p.1815-1829dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02142-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013100165300001600296520154900312536018901861592002802050596011302078650002002191650001602211650002402227650001902251650002102270650001302291650002602304650001502330650001102345650000902356650002302365650001002388650004202398650003302440650003002473650001802503650001702521650002202538653001102560653000902571653001202580653002102592653001802613653001502631653004802646700002202694700006602716700002402782700002302806700002302829700003002852773010602882856008002988852000903068655001203077IND60614946120221116154735.0181003e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061494612DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858177383162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, Fabio B.10aAnalysis of Bacterial and Fungal Nucleic Acid in Canine Sterile Granulomatous and Pyogranulomatous Dermatitis and Panniculitis  ap. 124-132.  aNext generation sequencing (NGS) studies are revealing a diverse microbiota on the skin of dogs. The skin microbiota of canine sterile granulomatous and pyogranulomatous dermatitis (SGPD) has yet to be investigated using NGS techniques. NGS targeting the 16S rRNA and ITS-1 region of bacterial and fungal DNA, respectively, were used to investigate if bacterial and fungal DNA were associated with skin lesions in cases of canine SGPD. The study included 20 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin samples and 12 fresh samples from SGPD-affected dogs, and 10 FFPE and 10 fresh samples from healthy dogs. DNA was extracted from deep dermis and panniculus, and microbial DNA was amplified using primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA V1-V3 and fungal ITS-1 regions. The amplified DNA was utilized for NGS on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. The sequences were processed using QIIME. No differences in fungal or bacterial alpha diversity were observed between the SGPD and control samples. Beta diversity analysis demonstrated differences in the bacterial communities between SGPD and control, but not in the fungal communities. Compared to controls, the family Erysipelotrichaceae and genus Staphylococcus were significantly more abundant in the SGPD FFPE samples, and genus Corynebacterium were more abundant in fresh samples. The bacteria found to be more abundant in SGPD are common inhabitants of skin surfaces, and likely secondary contaminants in SGPD cases. This study provides additional evidence that SGPD lesions are likely sterile.  aFunding Fabio B.

This electrode architecture consists of four levels of interconnected hierarchy: a primary macroporous Ni foam scaffold (≥500 μm), an intermediate vertically-aligned MnCo₂O₄ core-nanoflake array (50–100 nm), topmost ultra-thin MnO₂ nanosheets (∼10 nm) and short-range ordered mesopores (∼5 nm) on the MnO₂ nanosheets. This freestanding, hierarchical porous electrode has advantages in enhancing electroactive surface area, enabling efficient mass transport through the porous structure. The heterostructured electrode exhibits a low onset potential (1.33 V vs. RHE), a high anodic peak current density (1000 mA cm⁻² g⁻¹ at 1.7 V vs. RHE) and long-term catalytic stability for urea oxidation, which surpasses previous reported electrode materials for urea electrolysis. Remarkably, the MnO₂/MnCo₂O₄/Ni electrode possesses bifunctional catalytic activity for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution. A urea electrolytic cell with both anode and cathode using the heterostructured electrodes has been fabricated and a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² has been achieved at a cell voltage of 1.55 V. This noble metal-free quadruple hierarchy electrode shows potential as a new platform for multi-purpose applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3afoams 3ahydrogen production 3amanganese dioxide 3amass transfer 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asurface area 3aurea1 aLi, Shuni1 aZhang, Xinyi1 aMacFarlane, Douglas R.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 May 3, v. 5, no. 17 p.7825-7832dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta00980a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245017600178300002100354500001500375520163000390592002802020650003302048650002002081650001702101650001402118650001302132650003902145650002102184650002102205650001102226650001602237650002502253650001202278650003802290650001602328650001602344650001902360650001202379650001702391650000902408650002502417650002302442650001902465650001702484650000902501650002402510653001702534700002002551700002202571700002002593773010202613856008802715990002302803852000902826655001202835IND60098668420221117021623.0141105e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009866842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilarkaje, Narayana10aAntioxidants enhance the recovery of three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin–induced testicular dysfunction, pituitary-testicular axis, and fertility in rats  ap. 1151-1159.e5.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an antioxidant cocktail (AC) on bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)–induced testicular dysfunction. DESIGN: In vivo study. SETTING: Research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTION(S): The rats were treated with three cycles of 21 days each of therapeutically relevant dose levels of BEP (0.75, 7.5, and 1.5 mg/kg) with or without the AC (a mixture of α-tocopherol, L-ascorbic acid, Zn, and Se). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sperm parameters, fertility, serum hormone levels (ELISA), testicular histopathology, and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and transferrin (Western blotting and immunohistochemistry) were evaluated at the end of treatment and a 63-day recovery period. RESULT(S): At the end of treatment, the AC improved BEP-induced decrease in sperm motility and increase in abnormality but had no effect on reduced sperm count, fertility, and tubular atrophy, although it up-regulated germ cell proliferation. The AC normalized reduced inhibin B levels, but had no effect on decreased transferrin and testosterone and elevated LH levels. At the end of the recovery period, the AC enhanced the expression of PCNA and transferrin, repopulation of germ cells, LH-testosterone axis, and fertility, but had no effect on reduced FSH and elevated inhibin B levels. CONCLUSION(S): The antioxidants protect and then enhance the recovery of testicular and reproductive endocrine functions when administered concomitantly with BEP therapy. The AC may be beneficial to regain testicular functions after chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ain vivo studies 3adrug therapy 3acisplatin 3aselenium 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aWestern blotting 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aadults 3atransferrin 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aatrophy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aspermatozoa 3ablood serum 3asperm motility 3ainhibin 3atestosterone 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3acell proliferation 3ahistopathology 3aantioxidants 3azinc 3aluteinizing hormone 0achemotherapy1 aMousa, Alyaa M.1 aAl-Bader, Maie M.1 aKhan, Khalid M.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Oct., v. 100, no. 4 p.1151-1159.e5dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245015900177300002100336520149700357592002801854650001601882650001401898650001101912650001501923650001401938650001901952650002401971650001601995650002102011650003502032650003102067650001102098650002702109650002102136650003102157650002402188650001802212650001302230650001702243650004302260650001202303700003002315700002002345700002502365700002002390700002102410700003302431700002802464773010202492856008802594990002302682852000902705655001202714IND60098668520221117021834.0141105e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009866852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalitkumar, Sujata10aPolyethylene glycated leukemia inhibitory factor antagonist inhibits human blastocyst implantation and triggers apoptosis by down-regulating embryonic AKT  ap. 1160-1169.e2.  aOBJECTIVE: To study the effect of polyethylene glycated leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) antagonist (PEGLA) in the human blastocyst viability and implantation process.

Analysis of these blastocysts by immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a down-regulation in AKT activation and an increase in caspase-3 activation compared with the control group of blastocysts. CONCLUSION(S): The LIF inhibitor PEGLA could be a potential nonsteroidal fertility-regulating agent in humans. It acts on endometrial epithelial cells by down-regulating endometrial epithelial LIF. Inhibition of blastocyst LIF decreased its cell survival factor p-AKT and increased apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). This highlights that embryonic LIF is vital for human embryo implantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3abiopsy 3ablastocyst 3acaspase-3 3acell viability 3aembryo implantation 3aendometrium 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3ain vitro fertilization 3ain vitro studies 3aleukemia inhibitory factor 3aluteinizing hormone 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3apolyethylene 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athawing1 aBoggavarapu, Nageswara R.1 aMenezes, Judith1 aDimitriadis, Evdokia1 aZhang, Jian-Guo1 aNicola, Nicos A.1 aGemzell-Danielsson, Kristina1 aLalitkumar, Luther P.G.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Oct., v. 100, no. 4 p.1160-1169.e2dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016000166300001600326520167200342592002802014650001602042650002202058650001902080650001202099650001402111650003002125650001602155650001202171650001102183650001502194650001802209650001602227650001202243650002102255650001402276650001302290650001302303650001002316651001002326653002402336653004402360653003902404653002202443653001602465700002002481700002402501700006002525773013902585856008202724852000902806655001202815IND60770537520221119203017.0220318e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077053752DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853210007302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoner, Anamika10aShort-range attraction and oviposition stimulant of a biocontrol agent, Galerucella placida Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) toward weed leaf surface waxes  ap. 204-218.  aTwo Polygonaceae weeds, Rumex dentatus L. and Polygonum glabrum Willd. are abundant in wheat- and rice-fields, respectively, in India. Galerucella placida Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a biocontrol agent of these two weeds. The importance of long-chain alkanes and free fatty acids present in leaf surface waxes of these weeds was assessed as short-range attractant and ovipositional stimulant in G. placida females. Extraction, TLC, GC-MS and GC-FID analyses demonstrated 19 n-alkanes from n-C₁₄ to n-C₃₅ and 14 free fatty acids from C12:0 to C22:0 in leaf surface waxes. Hentriacontane was predominant among alkanes in both weeds, while oleic acid and docosanoic acid were predominant among free fatty acids in R. dentatus and P. glabrum, respectively. Females of G. placida were attracted toward one leaf equivalent surface wax of both weeds against the control solvent (petroleum ether) in a short Y-tube olfactometer bioassay. But, the insect could not differentiate between one leaf equivalent surface wax of R. dentatus and P. glabrum, indicating that both weed leaves were equally attractive in females. A synthetic blend of either 2.44, 35.57 and 23.58 μg ml⁻¹ of octadecane, heptacosane and nonacosane, respectively, resembling the amounts present in one leaf equivalent surface wax of R. dentatus or 4.08, 19.54 and 23.58 μg ml⁻¹ of octadecane, palmitoleic acid and docosanoic acid, respectively, resembling the amounts present in one leaf equivalent surface wax of P. glabrum acted as short-range attractant and ovipositional stimulant in G. placida. These results could be a basis for host plant specificity of the biocontrol agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalerucella 3aPersicaria glabra 3aRumex dentatus 3aalkanes 3abioassays 3abiological control agents 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3aleaves 3aoleic acid 3aolfactometers 3aoviposition 3apaddies 3apalmitoleic acid 3apetroleum 3aresearch 3asolvents 3aweeds 3aIndia 0aGalerucella placida 0along-chain alkanes and free fatty acids 0aolfactometer and oviposition assay 0aPolygonum glabrum 0asurface wax1 aDāsa, Svātī,1 aMobarak, Syed Husne1 aBarik, Anandamay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6164-50000 tBulletin of entomological research.g2022 Apr., v. 112, no. 2 p.204-218dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853210007303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012500152300001800277520091900295592002801214650001101242650001101253650002201264650001701286650002101303650001201324650002201336650001801358650001901376650001901395650001901414650001801433700001401451773014101465856007401606852000901680655001201689IND60642511420221120032312.0190507e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064251142DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta00983f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ge10aPomegranate-like CoO@nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres with outstanding rate behavior and stability for lithium storage  ap. 9801-9806.  aThe rational design and preparation of CoO-based materials with excellent electrochemical performances for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are highly desirable. In this work, we develop a CoO-based material with a novel pomegranate-like microspherical structure, in which ultrafine CoO nanoparticles coupled with a carbon framework are intimately confined within N-doped carbon outer shells (denoted as CoO@NC). Such a robust pomegranate-like architecture can not only facilitate the electron/mass transport in CoO/carbon electrodes to boost rate capability, but can also minimize aggregation of CoO microstructures to prolong their cycle life during the electrochemical process. Correspondingly, the CoO@NC nanocomposite manifests a high capacity of around 1200 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1C, excellent cycling stability up to 150 cycles, and a superior rate capability of 533 mA h g⁻¹ at 10C as an anode material for LIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acobalt oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amass transfer 3amicroparticles 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles1 aShao, Jie0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 May 23, v. 5, no. 20 p.9801-9806dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta00983f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015100167300001600318520185500334592002802189650001502217650001902232650002302251650002002274650001502294650002202309650001202331650003102343650001002374650002602384650001002410650001802420650001802438650001402456650005202470650001102522650002402533650002402557650001602581700002202597700002402619700001702643773011302660856008302773990002302856852000902879655001202888IND60099177820221117030326.0141105e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009917782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLema, Sean C.10aVariation in gene transcript profiles of two V1a-type arginine vasotocin receptors among sexual phases of bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum)  ap. 451-464.  aThe neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) mediates behavioral and reproductive plasticity in vertebrates, and has been linked to the behavioral changes associated with protogyny in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum). In this study, we sequenced full-length cDNAs encoding two distinct V1a-type AVT receptors (v1a1 and v1a2) from the bluehead wrasse, and examined variation in brain and gonadal abundance of these receptor transcripts among sexual phases. End point RT-PCR revealed that v1a1 and v1a2 transcripts varied in tissue distribution, with v1a1 receptor mRNAs at greatest levels in the telencephalon, hypothalamus, optic tectum, cerebellum and testis, and v1a2 receptor transcripts most abundant in the hypothalamus, cerebellum and gills. In the brain, v1a1 and v1a2 mRNAs both localized by in situ hybridization to the dorsal and ventral telencephalon, the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, the ventral hypothalamus and lateral recess of the third ventricle. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that relative abundance of these two receptor mRNAs varied significantly in brain and gonad with sexual phase. Relative levels of v1a2 mRNAs were greater in whole brain and isolated hypothalamus of terminal phase (TP) male wrasse compared to initial phase (IP) males or females. In the gonad, v1a1 mRNAs were at levels 2.5-fold greater in the testes of IP males – and 4–5-fold greater in the testes of TP males – compared to the ovaries of females. These results provide evidence that V1a-type AVT receptor transcript abundance in the hypothalamus and gonads of bluehead wrasse varies in patterns linked to sexual phase, and bestow a foundation for future studies investigating how differential expression of v1a1 and v1a2 teleost AVT receptors links to behavioral status and gonadal function in fish more broadly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThalassoma 3aanimal ovaries 3aarginine vasotocin 3abehavior change 3acerebellum 3acomplementary DNA 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agills 3ain situ hybridization 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3apreoptic area 3aprotogyny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atestes 3atissue distribution 3avasotocin receptors 3avertebrates1 aSlane, Melissa A.1 aSalvesen, Kelley E.1 aGodwin, John0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 179, no. 3 p.451-464dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.10.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle00943naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245004100174300001200215520015600227592002800383650001500411650002100426650001300447773009700460856008800557990002300645852000900668655001200677IND60098668720221117021259.0141105e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009866872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuster, John E.10aIntroduction: Sexual health matters!  ap. 897.  aFemale sexual dysfunction, though reputedly intractable and difficult, can be managed very successfully if caregivers will ask their patients about it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3afemale fertility 3apatients0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Oct., v. 100, no. 4 p.897-897dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.08.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245011400136300001400250506002800264520084100292592002801133506003701161650001401198650001801212650001401230650001301244650001401257650001901271650001201290650001401302650001301316650002401329653001401353653000801367653001901375653002401394653002201418700002001440700002101460773013001481852000901611655001201620IND60773782420221207054752.0171221e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077378242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTehubijuluw, Hellna10aWaste Cooking Oil Conversion To Biodeisel Catalized By Egg Shell Of Purebred Chiken With Ethanol As A Solvent  ap. 52-64.  aResource is Open Access  aThe synthesis of biodiesel from the waste cooking oil was carried out using the catalyst from egg shell of purebred chiken with ethanol as a solvent.

A papillary squamous cell carcinoma subtype is characterized by dominant exophytic architectural growth with limited invasion, a lower metastatic rate, and better overall survival compared with conventional SCC. Whereas most canine oral conventional SCCs are easily diagnosed by histologic examination, the diagnosis of canine oral papillary squamous cell carcinoma (COPSCC) can be challenging since the exophytic portion lacks histologic features of malignancy and appears similar to oral nonviral papillomas. In contrast, the invasive portion of COPSCC has morphologic similarities to conventional SCC and canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma. The goals of this study were to immunophenotype these 3 entities and to potentially identify discriminating markers. A panel of 17 immunohistochemical markers was investigated in tissue microarrays that included 25 COPSCCs, 10 conventional SCCs, and 10 canine acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Additionally, COPSCCs were screened for papillomavirus as a potential cause using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. COPSCC had immunophenotypical similarities with conventional SCC and acanthomatous ameloblastoma, but the combined differences in immunolabeling for AE1/AE3, 34βE12, p63, and calretinin discriminated between the entities. Papillomavirus was not detected in any COPSCC, making a viral pathogenesis unlikely. A better understanding of the immunophenotype of COPSCC will aid in a more accurate diagnosis and potentially improve therapeutic approaches.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aanimal pathology 3ain situ hybridization 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicroarray technology 3aodontogenic neoplasms 3adogs 3atherapeutics 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3ametastasis 0atissue microarrays 0adigestive 0aneoplasia 0apathogenesis 0aoral cavity1 aSledge, Dodd G.1 aCollins-Webb, Alexandra1 aKiupel, Matti0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 55, no. 2 p.224-232dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858177417323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011700165300001600282506002800298520191700326592002802243506003702271650000902308650001802317650001502335650001602350650001102366650001302377650001502390650001102405650001802416650001002434650001202444650001602456650001002472650002302482700002402505700001702529700002202546773010702568856007902675852000902754655001202763IND60773782720221207085618.0161227e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077378272DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.94642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuharyatun, Siti14aThe clay content effect on the formation of shallow mole drainage and the rate of lowering soil moisture content  ap. 347-353.  aResource is Open Access  aInstalling shallow mole drainage in the soil is inﬂ uenced by various factors, namely; the physical properties of soil and tools which are used. One of the physical properties of soil that inﬂ uences the formation of the mole drainage is the clay content of soil. This study aimed to explore the condition of the mole drainage formed in paddy soil with different clay contents. The study was conducted in a laboratory scale using a soil bin, a model of mole plough, and soil which was kept homogeneous in the boxes. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory for Energy and Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta. Mole drainage was installed in 3 paddy soils with different clay content, namely; 13.12% (soil A; loam soil), 41.17% (soil B; clay soil) and 53.36% (soil C; clay soil). The study was conducted by analyzing the geometry of the mole drainage and observing the soil deformation which occurred due to the formation of the mole drainage. The study showed that perfect mole drainages were installed in all of those three types of soil. The mole drainages were quite good and stable with little cracks. Based on the soil crack and ﬁ ssuring of soil, the largest soil deformation has occurred in soil with the highest clay content and the smallest one in soil with the lowest clay content. The characteristics of those three installed mole drainages were almost the same, but they had different effect on the rate of lowering soil moisture content. Here, the mole drainage installed in loam soil is different from which of installed in clay soil. The mole drainage installed in the loam soil did not inﬂ uence the rate of lowering soil moisture content. Contrary, the mole drainage installed in clay soil has effected to increase the rate of lowering soil moisture content.

The objectives of this study were to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics, short-term safety, and synovial fluid levels of CBD following oral administration in horses. A prospective, randomized, controlled study design was used. Twelve horses were administered sunflower lecithin oil-based CBD at either 1 mg/kg (Group 1) or 3 mg/kg (Group 2) for a 24-hour pharmacokinetic study. Horses then received 0.5 mg/kg (Group 1) or 1.5 mg/kg (Group 2) CBD q12 PO for 6 weeks, with steady state and elimination sampling performed up to 96 hours post-final dose. Synovial fluid CBD concentrations were evaluated at 12 and 24 hours, and 5 weeks. Horses were monitored daily and clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated. Mean ± SD Cmax and tmax were 4.3 ± 2.1 ng/ml and 4.1 ± 4.1 hours, and 19.9 ± 15.6 ng/ml and 5.0 ± 3.7 hours for Groups 1 and 2, respectively. CBD was detectable in synovial fluid in 8/12 horses during steady state. Mild hypocalcemia was seen in all horses and elevated liver enzymes were observed in 8/12 horses, but these changes improved or normalized within 10 days after the final CBD dose. CBD had dose-dependent, but variable, oral bioavailability at 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg daily dosing and was consistently detectable at steady state in synovial fluid at the higher dose. Further investigation is needed to establish clinically effective doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aadults 3abioavailability 3acannabidiol 3adose response 3ahorses 3ahypocalcemia 3alecithins 3aliver 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3asynovial fluid 3aveterinary medicine 0aCannabidiol 0aHorse 0aPharmacokinetics 0aSafety 0aCBD1 aO'Fallon, Elsbeth S.1 aGustafson, Daniel L.1 aContino, Erin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1756-510X0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 June, v. 113 p.103933-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014700164300001600311520108900327592002801416650002101444650002601465650002601491650001301517650001701530650002601547650002701573650002501600650001701625650001801642650002001660650001301680650001301693650001601706653001701722653001301739653002601752653002101778653002201799653001701821700001601838700001701854700001601871700001701887773010101904856008602005852000902091655001202100IND60776142320221119220053.0220531e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2022.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Li10aDiscovery of a novel acrylic acid formation pathway in Gluconobacter oxydans and its application in biosynthesis of acrylic acid from glycerol  ap. 182-189.  aThis study revealed a novel metabolic pathway of acrylic acid in Gluconobacter oxydans. First, the intermediate metabolite acrolein was confirmed by HPLC and GC-MS analyses. Then, the enzymes involved were identified based on mRNA expression analysis and gene deletion studies. This novel pathway includes three successive reactions: i) an alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes 1,3-propanediol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde; ii) two isozymes, 3-hydroxyacyl-(ACP) dehydratase and 3-hydroxydecanoyl-(ACP) dehydratase convert 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to acrolein; iii) an aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes acrolein to acrylic acid. An engineered Escherichia coli strain, coexpressing the glycerol dehydratase of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the 3-hydroxyacyl-(ACP) dehydratase of G. oxydans was constructed for acrylic acid production from glycerol. The recombinant strain produced 144.0 ± 9.8 mg/L of acrylic acid in a shake-flask culture. This is the first report demonstrating the biosynthetic pathway of acrylic acid via acrolein, and it provides a new approach for acrylic acid biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aacrolein 3aacrylic acid 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3agene deletion 3agene expression 3aglycerol 3aisozymes 3ametabolites 0aAcrylic acid 0aGlycerol 0aGluconobacter oxydans 0aEscherichia coli 0aMetabolic pathway 0aBiosynthesis1 aZhu, Jiawei1 aRo, Kum-Song1 aXie, Jingli1 aWei, Dongzhi0 tProcess biochemistry.g2022 July, v. 118 p.182-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2022.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245016500204300001600369520170000385592002802085650002202113650001802135650001502153650001002168650001102178650002302189650001902212650002002231650001202251650002302263650003002286650002002316650001602336650001202352650001302364650002002377650001302397650001002410651001102420653002802431653001202459653001702471653002502488653002302513700005702536700006802593700005602661700005802717773013902775856008202914852000902996655001203005IND60770538020221119202834.0220318e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077053802DNAL7 a10.1017/S000748532100081X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala, Amanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9214-688010aSuperparasitism and fitness parameters in three native wasp parasitoids (Braconidae: Opiinae) of the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 253-260.  aKnowledge on reproductive strategies and host use in insect parasitoids is fundamental for biological control purposes. Superparasitism and multiparasitism, oviposition in a previously parasitized host by a female of the same or different species, respectively, may impact pest management decisions. Our objective was to determine the occurrence of superparasitism and multiparasitism in three species of native larval−pupal solitary endoparasitoids that attack Anastrepha Shiner species (Diptera: Tephritidae) in the Neotropical region, and the possible effect on offspring fitness parameters. Doryctobracon crawfordi (Viereck), Utetes anastrephae (Viereck), and Opius hirtus (Fischer) occur in sympatry in Mexico, and are currently under consideration for use as biocontrol agents. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions with females acting alone (self-superparasitism), females in groups of the same species (conspecific superparasitism), and females in mixed groups (multiparasitism). Our results showed that self-superparasitism is an uncommon strategy in the three native species and is rare under conditions of intraspecific competition. In the case of multiparasitism, a higher number of immature stages of U. anastrephae was observed, compared to those of D. crawfordi and O. hirtus. However, it is not clear yet if this was due to some adult female trait or to the competitive ability of the larvae. We conclude that most females of the native species studied appeared to avoid superparasitism, specifically when acting alone, suggesting a high discrimination ability, which is probably a result of a close relationship and evolutionary history with Anastrepha hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnastrepha ludens 3aDoryctobracon 3aNeotropics 3aOpius 3aadults 3abiological control 3aconspecificity 3aendoparasitoids 3afemales 3aindigenous species 3aintraspecific competition 3amultiparasitism 3aoviposition 3aprogeny 3aresearch 3asuperparasitism 3asympatry 3awasps 3aMexico 0aDoryctobracon crawfordi 0aOpiinae 0aOpius hirtus 0aself-superparasitism 0aUtetes anastrephae1 aToledo, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9569-60791 aPérez-Lachaud, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8924-16061 aLiedo, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0004-17211 aMontoya, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8415-33670 tBulletin of entomological research.g2022 Apr., v. 112, no. 2 p.253-260dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748532100081X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245021000175520228600385592002802671650002002699650001902719650001702738650001002755650000902765650001002774650002002784650001602804650001302820650001402833650002402847650001102871650002002882650001102902650002402913653002002937653001602957653002702973653001103000653002003011700006003031773012103091856008303212852000903295655001203304IND60770824420221119135515.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077082442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhaes, Humberto B.10aTransrectal ultrasonography of the caudal placental pole and fetal eyeball diameter and associations with the season, duration of gestation, placental weight, sex of the foal, and birthweight in donkeys☆  aThis study aimed to establish normal ranges and determine variables affecting the duration of gestation, placental and fetal eyeball measurements in donkeys. Jennies (n = 121) were submitted to transrectal ultrasonography at 15-day-intervals from 120 days of gestation until parturition. During each examination, variables assessed included: the combined thickness of uterus and placenta (CTUP), fetal eyeball diameter, amniotic membrane thickness, allantoic and amniotic fluids echogenicity, and chorioallantois edema. Parametric data were analyzed with t-test, linear regression, mixed models, ANOVA, Tukey's as posthoc, and non-parametric data with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. The mean duration of gestation was 365.4 ± 10.4 days, and there were effects of the season (P < .001), sex of the foal (P = .001), but there was no interaction (P = .89). Spring-bred jennies had 16d longer gestation than summer- and fall-bred (P < .0001), and with no difference between the latter (P = .81). Colts had four days longer gestation than fillies (P = .0001). The proportion of colts (51%) and fillies (49%) were similar (P = .8). The CTUP measurements varied with gestation age (P < .0001), but there were no effects of the season (P = .68), sex of the foal, or interactions (P = .80). The incidence and scores of chorioallantois edema increased from 240 to 300 days (P < .001). Amniotic membrane thickness increased minimally between mid- and late-gestation (P = .02). The fetal eyeball was strongly associated with gestational age (r=0.78) but not with any other variable (P > .05). Allantoic fluid echogenicity did not vary throughout gestation (P = .21); however, the amniotic fluid echogenicity increased from mid-to late-gestation (P = .0001). In conclusion, the season and sex of the foal affected the duration of gestation, but no other variables. The CTUP displayed a sigmoid increase throughout pregnancy, and gestational age was the only variable affecting it.

Caprine cases have previously been reported to be caused by avirulent R. equi strains. Six cases of R. equi infection in goats yielding 8 R. equi isolates were identified from 2000 to 2017. Lesions varied from bronchopneumonia, vertebral and humeral osteomyelitis, and subcutaneous abscesses, to disseminated infection involving the lungs, lymph nodes, and multiple visceral organs. Isolates of R. equi from infected goats were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for R. equi virulence-associated plasmid (vap) genes. Seven of 8 isolates carried the VapN plasmid, originally characterized in bovine isolates, while 1 isolate lacked virulence plasmids and was classified as avirulent. The VapN plasmid has not been described in isolates cultured from goats.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 3aRhodococcus equi 3aabscess 3aanimal pathology 3abronchopneumonia 3acaseous lymphadenitis 3acattle 3agenes 3agoats 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3aosteomyelitis 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avirulence 0acaseous lymphadenitis 0agoat 0aRhodococcus equi 0avirulence plasmids 0avirulence-associated protein N1 aPlumlee, Quinci D.1 aLawhon, Sara D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9154-89091 aCohen, Noah D.1 aBryan, Laura K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0746-94610 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 55, no. 2 p.273-276dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858177473273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245013700192300001600329520101700345592002801362650002001390650001501410650001301425650000701438650001101445650001201456650001301468650001901481650004401500650002501544650003401569650003001603650003101633650002201664650001501686650002401701650001601725650001701741650002901758650002601787650005701813700001801870700001801888700001701906773008801923856008602011852000902097655001202106IND50060312720221118022349.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006031272DNAL7 a230731142pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Gil, G.10aLeaching and accumulation of trace elements in sulfate reducing granular sludge under concomitant thermophilic and low pH conditions  ap. 238-246.  aThe leaching and/or accumulation of trace elements in sulfate reducing granular sludge systems was investigated. Two thermophilic up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors operated at pH 5 were fed with sucrose (4gCODlᵣₑₐcₜₒᵣ ⁻¹d⁻¹) and sulfate at different COD/SO₄ ²⁻ ratios. During the start-up of such acidogenic systems, an initial leaching of trace elements from the inoculum sludge occurred regardless of trace elements supplementation in the reactor influent. The granular sludge maintained the physical structure despite high Fe leaching. After start-up and nonetheless the acidic conditions, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo and Se were retained or accumulated by the sludge when added. Particularly, Ni and Co accumulated in the carbonates and exchangeable fractions ensuring potential bioavailability. Otherwise, the initial stock in the inoculum sludge sufficed to operate the process for nearly 1year without supplementation of trace elements and no significant sludge wash-out occurred.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acarbonates 3aleaching 3apH 3asludge 3asucrose 3asulfates 3atrace elements 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSolubility 2aSulfatesxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification1 aLopes, S.I.C.1 aSaikaly, P.E.1 aLens, P.N.L.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Dec., v. 126 p.238-246dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008200169300001400251520159100265592002801856650002501884650001601909650002201925650002401947650001201971650001901983650001902002650001802021650001702039650002502056650002102081650001502102650002502117650001502142653001702157653003502174653002102209653003002230653002302260700001802283700001702301700001602318700002202334773011002356856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60593637920221116154756.0180830e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059363792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahlangu, O.T.10aHydrophilic fouling-resistant GO-ZnO/PES membranes for wastewater reclamation  ap. 43-55.  aFouling of pressure-driven membranes remains a major challenge in membrane technology applications to wastewater treatment as it results in the deterioration of membrane performance. Several studies focusing on novel anti-fouling membranes incorporated with nanoparticles have been carried out but these membranes are not yet a viable solution due to their high energy requirements and poor trace organic compound (TOrC) rejection properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to fabricate novel energy-efficient polyethersulfone (PES) membranes modified with graphene oxide – zinc oxide (GO-ZnO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for wastewater reclamation. A unique membrane synthesis approach called double-casting phase inversion (DCPI) was adopted. In this technique, the casting solutions are cast twice before coagulation. The addition of PVP and GO-ZnO increased membrane pure water permeability, hydrophilicity, and tensile strength while salt rejection increased slightly. The rejection of TOrCs and anti-fouling properties were also improved due to reduction in membrane-solute and membrane-foulant non-electrostatic or affinity interactions. These interactions were computed from contact angles of membranes, foulants and TOrCs based on the Lifshitz-van der Waals/acid-base approach. Compared to commercial NF-270 membranes under similar experimental conditions, the novel membranes exhibited higher fluxes, with less fouling and high rejection of TOrCs. Therefore, novel GO-ZnO membranes have the potential to compete with commercial membranes for wastewater reclamation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acoagulation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy requirements 3afouling 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3atensile strength 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azinc oxide 0aAnti-fouling 0aDouble-casting phase inversion 0aEnergy-efficient 0aGraphene oxide-zinc oxide 0aInteraction energy1 aNackaerts, R.1 aThwala, J.M.1 aMamba, B.B.1 aVerliefde, A.R.D.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 524 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04111naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245009600139300001600235506002800251520278200279592002803061506003703089650002303126650001703149650002003166650002803186650002703214650001703241650001403258650001403272650002503286650002703311653003303338653001703371653001803388653002003406700003203426700003003458773020403488852000903692655001203701IND60773783120221207085617.0201111e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077378312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConte, Francieli Aline10aAzeite de oliva extravirgem e espessura íntima-média carotídea: uma revisão integrativa  ap. 456-465.  aResource is Open Access  aIntrodução: O espessamento da camada íntima-média carotídea ou mesmo o desenvolvimento da aterosclerose representam riscos sério sobre a morbidade e mortalidade cardiovascular.

ABSTRACT Olive oil extravirgem and carotid intima-media thickness: an integrating review Introdution: Carotid intima-media thickness or even the development of atherosclerosis pose serious risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Typical foods of the Mediterranean diet can help prevent or reduce the oxidizing and inflammatory process, among them, extra virgin olive oil, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. Objetive: This study aims to verify if extra virgin olive oil is able to reduce carotid intima-media thickness. Materials and methods: This is an integrative review. A scientific search was conducted in the electronic bases, Capes, PubMed, BVS and Scielo, published in the period from 2008 to 2017, using the terms individually and later entertaining them "olive oil" and "Carotid intima-media thickness", in Portuguese, English And Spanish. Results: Studies have shown that minority olive oil compounds promote the improvement of endothelial function by reducing the production of interleukins, platelet aggregation agents, tumor necrosis factor. Discussion: The cardiovascular protection effects of olive oil and the Mediterranean diet have been demonstrated, however, the reduction of the carotid intima intima thickness or even of the atheroma plaque has not yet been elucidated. More controlled studies need to be performed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aantioxidants 3aatherosclerosis 3acardioprotective effect 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3ainterleukins 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aplatelet aggregation 3atumor necrosis factors 0aartéria carótida primitiva 0ainflamação 0aaterosclerose 0aazeite de oliva1 aFranz, Ligia Beatriz Bento,1 aBusnello, Maristela Borin0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2018 Aug., v. 12, no. 72 p.456-465dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245011600170300001600286520155900302536027501861592002802136596001402164650001402178650001502192650002102207650000902228650001702237650001402254650001202268650001102280650002302291650001702314650001402331650001302345653001802358653001402376653001102390653000902401653002602410653000902436653001402445653001402459653001202473653001702485653001402502700002702516700002202543700002202565773010602587856008002693852000902773655001202782IND60614946920221116154557.0181003e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061494692DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858177473292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchott, Courtney R.10aHistologic Grade Does Not Predict Outcome in Dogs with Appendicular Osteosarcoma Receiving the Standard of Care  ap. 202-211.  aCanine appendicular osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone neoplasm that imposes a short survival time. There are several published histologic grading systems for canine osteosarcoma but no universally accepted system. Location within the skeleton and therapy received are both correlated with survival time, but these factors were not always considered when the prognostic value of published grading systems was determined. Our objective was to compare 2 published histologic grading systems in a population of dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma treated with the standard of care for curative intent. Three evaluators graded 85 tumors using 2 histologic grading systems. The relationships between histologic grade as well as individual histologic features and outcome (survival time and disease-free interval) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival functions and a univariate Cox proportional hazards model. Histologic grade, as assigned by any evaluator, did not correlate with outcome. Increased number of mitotic figures per 3 randomly selected 400× microscope fields, as assessed by 1 evaluator, was correlated with both survival time and disease-free interval; this was the only individual histologic feature that was significantly correlated with outcome for any evaluator. These findings cast doubt on the predictive value of routine histologic grading in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma who receive amputation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and highlight the need for better tools to predict outcome in canine appendicular osteosarcoma.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: OVC Fellowship Program and Ontario Graduate Scholarship Program to C.R.S., and OVC Pet Trust funded the research and publication.  aPublisher supplied data  cPet Trust 3aadjuvants 3aamputation 3aanimal pathology 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3ahistology 3amitosis 3amodels 3anutritional status 3aosteosarcoma 3aprognosis 3askeleton 0aanatomic site 0aasymmetry 0abiopsy 0abone 0adisease-free survival 0adogs 0ahistology 0aneoplasia 0agrading 0aosteosarcoma 0aprognosis1 aTatiersky, Laetitia J.1 aFoster, Robert A.1 aWood, Geoffrey A.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 55, no. 2 p.202-211dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858177473293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245016100188300001600349520138400365592002801749650001501777650001801792650001801810650001601828650002401844650002201868650001901890650001201909650002001921650002201941650002201963650001101985650001301996650001802009650001202027650001602039650002102055651001002076653002902086653001802115653001802133653001702151653001702168700002602185700002202211700002602233700001902259773010102278856008602379852000902465655001202474IND60776142620221119220003.0220531e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077614262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2022.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSriramavaratharajan, Venkatraman10aMulti target interactions of essential oil nanoemulsion of Cinnamomum travancoricum against diabetes mellitus via in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches  ap. 190-204.  aThis study reports antidiabetic activity of leaf essential oil (EO) of Cinnamomum travancoricum from the Western Ghats, India via in vitro , in vivo and in silico methods. EO was characterized by GC-MS and GC-FID. Essential oil nanoemulsions (EN) were prepared and characterized. Antidiabetic potential was evaluated through in vitro assays namely, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition, glucose uptake and insulin secretion assays. In vivo study was conducted on STZ-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Molecular docking was conducted to find the lead antidiabetic compounds. Of the 42 compounds identified in the EO, α-phellandrene (5.9%), β-phellandrene (12.6%), linalool (23.6%), safrole (6.8%) and shyobunol (5.1%) were major constituents. Of the two ENs formulated, 1:2 ratio (EO to surfactants) was better in zeta size (51.4 nm) and potential (−30.9). In vitro results were impressive. EN lowered elevated blood glucose level to normal (p < 0.01) and improved the insulin secretion (p < 0.01) in diabetic rats. Further, serum AST, ALT, ALP, triglyceride and pancreatic β-cell damage were seen reduced (p < 0.05). Molecular docking studies showed minor constituents of EO, namely, δ-cadinene, elemol, spathulenol and α-copaen-11-ol playing active role in antidiabetic activity through α-amylase, α-glucosidase, insulin receptor, and insulin secretion proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum 3aalpha-amylase 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acomputer simulation 3adiabetes mellitus 3aessential oils 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin secretion 3aleaves 3alinalool 3ananoemulsions 3asafrole 3aspathulenol 3atriacylglycerols 3aIndia 0aCinnamomum travancoricum 0aWild cinnamon 0aEssential oil 0aNanoemulsion 0aAntidiabetic1 aChellappan, David Raj1 aKarthi, Shanmugam1 aIlamathi, Mathialagan1 aMurugan, Ramar0 tProcess biochemistry.g2022 July, v. 118 p.190-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2022.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013000174500002200304520171000326592002802036650000802064650002002072650002402092650001502116650001302131650002102144650000902165650001502174650001202189650002002201650002002221650001602241650002702257650001602284650002402300650002302324650003002347650002202377653002502399653001902424653002502443653002402468700002202492773009202514856008702606852000902693655001202702IND60651015020221121222422.0190711e20190706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065101502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Measrainsey12aA Data-Driven Approach to Investigating the Impacts of Air Temperature on the Efficiencies of Coal and Natural Gas Generators  aPre-press version  aThe efficiency of a thermoelectric generator is dependent on a number of operational and climatic variables, including ambient air temperature. To date, there has not been a data-driven analysis of the impacts of climate variability on electricity generator performance that includes a statistically representative set of generators. This study develops regression models to estimate changes in the efficiencies of over one thousand coal and natural gas generators as a function of ambient air temperature and operational variables, across different fuel types, prime movers, cooling systems, and climate zones during the years ranging from 2008 to 2017. The efficiencies of generators with dry cooling, particularly those in hot and dry climates, demonstrated the greatest sensitivity to increases in ambient temperature. Results for generators utilizing wet cooling systems were largely inconclusive, most likely because other factors, such as cooling water temperature, are better predictors of efficiency. Natural gas combustion generator efficiency, which show a large sensitivity to rises in air temperature in theoretical models, had a counterintuitive trend, in which losses were relatively small in the hottest and driest climates. This result is likely due to the fact that natural gas combustion generators in hot and arid regions often utilize inlet air cooling technologies to reduce the temperature of ambient air before it enters the compressor, thereby mitigating efficiency losses. The analytical framework developed offers generalized methods for cleaning, processing, and merging federally available electricity generation and climate datasets to increase their value in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aarid zones 3acleaning 3aclimatic factors 3acoal 3acombustion 3acooling 3acooling systems 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3anatural gas 3aregression analysis 3atheoretical models 3athermoelectric generators 3awater temperature 0aThermal power plants 0aData analytics 0aGenerator efficiency 0aClimate variability1 aSanders, Kelly T.0 tApplied energy.g2019 July 06,  p.113486-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100006500143245007700208300001600285520165700301592002801958650002201986650002402008650001302032650001702045650002202062650001802084650001902102653002002121653004502141700005602186700001702242700002002259700001302279700002202292700006102314773011702375856007802492852000902570655001202579IND60752829320221122044316.0220421e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075282932DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2021.01462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSierra Velez, Desiree1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5746-295X10aEffects of a Pediatric Weight Management Intervention on Parental Stress  ap. 160-167.  aBackground: Few studies have examined the associations of pediatric weight management interventions (PWMIs) with reduction in parental stress. We sought to examine the extent to which a PWMI reduces parental stress and whether changes in parental healthful feeding practices and support for physical activity are associated with reduction in parental stress. Methods: We analyzed data from the Clinic and Community Approaches to Healthy Weight randomized controlled trial (RCT). Parental stress change over 12 months was analyzed using a multivariate mixed linear model. We then examined associations of changes in healthful feeding practices and support for physical activity over 12 months with changes in stress using a multivariate linear model. Results: In multivariate-adjusted models, participation in a PWMI was associated with decrease in parental stress at 12 months, with a mean difference (MD) of −0.24 U [95% confidence interval (CI): −0.45, −0.04]. Increases in scores for exercising regularly [MD = −0.27 (95% CI: −0.52, −0.03)] and keeping healthy food at home [MD = −0.38 (95% CI: −0.66, −0.10)] were associated with decrease in stress. Conclusions: Participation in a PWMI was associated with decrease in parental stress. Encouraging parents of children with overweight and obesity to keep healthy food in the house and exercise regularly may represent important strategies to improve parental stress. PWMI effectiveness studies should consider parental stress as an outcome while addressing social determinants of health that may influence parental stress.

A retrospective study of CIC included all colony animals between 2007 and 2009. A prospective study included 36 rhesus macaques treated for CIC in 2008 and 2009 and age/sex matched controls. Data incorporated retrospective analyses of medical records and prospective analysis of behavioral measures (focal behavior, dominance rank, personality) and biological measures (fecal cultures, complete blood counts (CBC)/chemistry, baseline cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) testing, histopathology). Retrospective results indicate the incidence of new cases of CIC averaged about 4% per year and the prevalence of ongoing cases averaged about 6% per year or about 60 cases per 1000 animals. CIC symptoms began between 6 months and 1 year of age with males affected at a higher incidence than females. Results suggest CIC subjects were low ranking, spent more time away from others, and personality tests indicate they were low gregarious individuals. CIC baseline cortisol levels were low compared to healthy controls although CIC subjects responded normally to ACTH challenge. Hematology and clinical chemistry values indicate most CIC subjects had relatively high levels of glucose, triglycerides, and basophils and low levels of electrolytes (Na, Cl, K). CIC subjects were routinely negative for Campylobacter, Yersinia, Shigella and Salmonella species. Histological analysis confirmed moderate plasmacytic colitis with crypt microabscesses. Results suggest CIC is a dynamic, multi-factorial disease that affects both biology and behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aMacaca mulatta 3aSalmonella 3aShigella 3aYersinia 3aanimals 3abasophils 3achemistry 3acolitis 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3aelectrolytes 3afemales 3aglucose 3ahematology 3ahistopathology 3amales 3aprospective studies 3aretrospective studies 3atriacylglycerols1 aWhite, Daniel1 aIngram, Sonya1 aJackson, Raven1 aLarin, Jorge1 aMorales, Pablo1 aGarcia, Ana Patricia1 aHicks, Chassey1 aHopper, Kelly1 aWagner, Joseph0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2012 Mar., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.208-220dElsevier B.V.x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245008300201300001600284506007600300520092300376592002801299506003701327650001501364650001101379650001801390650001001408650001001418650002501428650003001453650001801483650000901501700001501510700001701525700002001542700001601562773010501578856008101683852000901764655001201773IND50088831220221207075734.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008883122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-013-0423-y2doi7 aPMC41885002pmcid7 a253204262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Hua10aComparison of Culture Methods for Isolation of Salmonella in Yak Fecal Samples  ap. 223-226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo compare the effectiveness of culture methods for identifying yak Salmonella, three selective enrichment broths (SC, TTB, MSRV) and three media (SS, XLD, CAS) for detecting Salmonella were evaluated in this study. The results showed that TTB broth was better than SC broths and MSRV broths, and SS medium has the highest isolation rate, significantly higher than those of CAS and XLD media (P < 0.05). It is worth noticing that there was no overlapping of the positive results given by TTB, SC and MSRV broths. In addition, all of the yak Salmonella isolates were detected positive by the five reported PCR assays, targeting the invA, srfC, invE, stn and 16S–23S rRNA genes. The combination of TTB and MSRV broths and SS and CAS media (or XLD) recommended in this study was relatively efficient in recovering Salmonella from yak feces, and the five PCR assays can be successfully used to identify yak Salmonella.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3abroths 3aculture media 3afeces 3agenes 3aisolation techniques 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ayaks1 aZhang, Bin1 aZhu, Xiaoxia1 aZhang, Huanrong1 aTang, Cheng0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2014 June, v. 54, no. 2 p.223-226dSpringer-Verlagx0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-013-0423-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245014200159300002000301520142600321592002801747650000801775650002401783650001701807650002601824650001101850650004401861650001301905650002101918650002501939650001001964700002101974700002701995700005802022700005702080700005702137773014902194856007702343852000902420655001202429IND60608955420181020000000.0181020e20180719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060895542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b045822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunzen, Hana10aAchieving Large Volumetric Gas Storage Capacity in Metal–Organic Frameworks by Kinetic Trapping: A Case Study of Xenon Loading in MFU-4  ap. 10191-10197.  aOne of the main problems of gas storage in porous materials is that many molecules of interest adsorb too weakly to be retained effectively. To enhance gas storage in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), we propose the use of kinetic trapping, i.e., a process where the guest gas is captured in the voids at loading conditions and not released immediately at normal conditions. In this approach, the diffusion-limiting pore size and the framework flexibility have to be matched to the gas, requiring flexible pore apertures to be smaller than the van der Waals diameter of the trapped guest. We selected the Metal–Organic Framework Ulm University-4 (MFU-4) with a pore aperture of 2.52 Å as a model coordination framework and used it for storage of xenon (with van der Waals diameter of 4.4 Å). Although xenon atoms are substantially larger than the MOF pore aperture, MFU-4 could be loaded with xenon by applying moderately high gas pressures. This is demonstrated to be due to the pore flexibility as confirmed by computational studies. The xenon loading could be tuned (from 0 wt % to more than 44.5 wt %) by changing the loading parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time, and the xenon atoms remained inside the pores upon exposing the material to air atmosphere at room temperature. To understand the material behavior, TGA, XRPD, and ¹²⁹Xe NMR spectroscopy and computational studies were carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acase studies 3acoordination polymers 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporosity 3athermogravimetry 3avan der Waals forces 3axenon1 aKolbe, Felicitas1 aKalytta-Mewes, Andreas1 aSastre, German1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0496-63311 aBrunner, Eike1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3511-98991 aVolkmer, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8105-21570 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 July 19, v. 140, no. 32 p.10191-10197dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b045823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005000152245009500202520168600297592002801983650001402011650002202025650001102047650001102058650001202069650001102081650001602092653003802108653002502146653002902171653003002200653001902230700002702249700001502276773011202291856008702403852000902490655001202499IND60651015220221121222513.0190725e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065101522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6955-433312aA hierarchical charging control of plug-in electric vehicles with simple flexibility model  aThe demand for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is increasing exponentially, which could add a considerable amount of load onto the power grid, because charging one PEV is nearly equivalent to adding three houses to the power system. On the other hand, their capability to actively interact with the grid presents excellent opportunities for load management, demand response, and various other grid services. This paper proposes a hierarchical charging scheduling and control framework to enable PEVs for grid services while meeting vehicle owners’ travel needs. The proposed control framework consists of coordination and vehicle layers. In the vehicle layer, each set of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is equipped with a controller that estimates charging power and energy flexibility based on vehicle characteristics, charging equipment power rating, battery energy state, and upcoming trip information. The controller also controls vehicle charging power in real-time. In the coordination layer, with the charging flexibility model received from each EVSE controller, the central coordinator determines the optimal power allocation for a look-ahead time window based on grid services to be provided. The proposed charging coordination approach can help reduce computational complexity and communication requirement compared with existing methods. It is also scalable to the expanding PEV fleet and robust to uncertainties in upcoming vehicle trips and future system condition. The proposed method is studied using a prototypical feeder developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and detailed trip information extracted from National Household Travel Survey.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3amodels 3asurveys 3atravel 3auncertainty 0aElectric vehicle supply equipment 0aHierarchical control 0aModel predictive control 0aPlug-in electric vehicles 0aSmart charging1 aRadhakrishnan, Nikitha1 aHuang, Sen0 tApplied energy.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 253 p.113490-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008000159300001800239520171000257592002801967650002201995650003702017650001402054650001102068650001502079650001402094650002202108650001202130650003202142650001802174650001102192650001702203650001402220650001402234650002602248650002202274650002002296650002302316650001602339650003702355700001802392773014002410856007402550852000902624655001202633IND60670518120221122093450.0191002e20140204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067051812DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12708g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Abhijit10aEnergy efficient role of Ni/NiO in PdNi nano catalyst used in alkaline DEFC  ap. 3237-3250.  aThe present investigation is based on a study of electro-oxidation of ethanol in alkaline medium over the carbon supported PdₓNiy catalyst formulations synthesized by simultaneous reduction of the precursors using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. X-ray diffraction studies of the PdNi/C nano-particles reveal formation of the face-centered cubic crystalline Pd, NiO and Ni(OH)₂ on a meso porous carbon support whereas XPS confirmed the presence of metallic Ni and the oxide phases NiO, Ni(OH)₂, NiOOH in the catalyst matrix. The structure and morphology of the binary matrix and the role of Ni and its oxide as a catalytically contributing entity in the oxidation process was ascertained by the help of respective analytical techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Sequential oxidation steps were suggested involving dimeric (NiO)₂ as one of the intermediate species during the oxidation reaction proceeding towards aldehyde formation and further to carbonate production via the intermediate formation of a six member ring, thereby increasing the reaction rates. This phenomenon has been discussed at molecular level using the results obtained from XPS analysis. The observations were further accomplished by extending the work to ion chromatography for quantitative analysis of the products formed during oxidation of ethanol. All the above results are congruent with the mechanistic interpretation and reflect the paramount significance of NiO existing in the binary catalyst matrix for accelerating ethanol oxidation reaction kinetics at a temperature 40 °C and above.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaldehydes 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3aion exchange chromatography 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aquantitative analysis 3areaction kinetics 3areducing agents 3asodium borohydride 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDatta, Jayati0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Feb. 4, v. 2, no. 9 p.3237-3250dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta12708g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013300160300001400293500002000307520197100327592002802298596006802326650002202394650002502416650002502441650002702466650002302493650002002516650001902536650002102555650002102576650002302597650001402620650001202634650000902646650001402655650001202669650001202681650003102693650001402724650001302738650000902751650001502760650001602775650001102791650001002802700006302812700002802875700002302903700002202926773013002948856007303078852000903151655001203160IND60627770820221123014350.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062777082DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.125562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJado, Rana Hasan10aFloral resources to enhance the potential of the parasitoid Aphidius colemani for biological control of the aphid Myzus persicae  ap. 34-42.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlowering plants have been widely used to enhance biological control. However, this approach has been limited to some extent by the lack of suitable flowering plant species of wide applicability, particularly for global pests. A key example is the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (GPA). It is commonly attacked by the polyphagous koinobiont aphidiidae, Aphidius colemani, which is also of global occurrence. Here, eight flowering plants were evaluated for the potential enhancement of GPA biological control using A. colemani under laboratory conditions. These included buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), alyssum (Lobularia maritima), white rocket (Diplotaxis erucoides.), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), wild marjoram (Origanum vulgare), thyme (Origanum marjorana) and pepper mint (Mentha piperita). The effects of access to these flowers on the longevity (days), potential fecundity (number of dissected eggs) and parasitism rate for A. colemani compared with the control treatment (water) were studied. Longevity of A. colemani which had access to buckwheat was 4–5 times longer than the control and 2–3 times longer than it was in the other plant treatments; the latter did not differ significantly between each other. Potential fecundity of A. colemani was the highest when it had been provided with buckwheat flowers. Exposing A. colemani to flowering plants for longer time intervals (12 hr and 24 hr) increased the number of eggs produced compared with 6 hr. The number of parasitized aphids/female A. colemani with buckwheat flowers was the highest of all treatments; it ranged from 14 in the control to 219 with buckwheat. Further studies should be carried out under field conditions to determine the effect of a range of flowering plants on A. colemani. For example, although buckwheat was highly effective, in many climates it may be a useful component in mixtures comprising other, more robust species.  aPublisher supplied data  cDeanship of Academic Research (DAR) at the University of Jordan 3aAphidius colemani 3aDiplotaxis erucoides 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aLobularia maritima 3aMentha piperita 3aMyzus persicae 3aOriganum vulgare 3aSinapis arvensis 3abiological control 3abuckwheat 3aclimate 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3aflowers 3alaboratory experimentation 3alongevity 3amarjoram 3amint 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apepper 3athyme1 aAraj, Salah‐Eddin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0169-44251 aAbu‐Irmaileh, Barakat1 aShields, Morgan W.1 aWratten, Steve D.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2019 Feb., v. 143, no. 1-2 p.34-42dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.125563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011300161300001800274500002000292520119000312592002801502650004401530650002701574650002301601650001701624650001401641650001501655650001901670650001101689650002001700650001801720700001801738700002201756700001801778700002101796700001901817773011301836856007401949852000902023655001202032IND60571927620221117190344.0170712e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057192762DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.282252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngverud, Tobias10aHigh water‐content thermoresponsive hydrogels via electrostatic macrocrosslinking of cellulose nanofibrils  ap. 3415-3424.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAtom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been utilized to synthesize tri‐ and star‐block copolymers of poly(di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) (PDEGMA) and quaternized poly(2‐(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (qPDMAEMA). The block copolymers, all with a minimum of two cationically charged blocks, were sequentially used for electrostatic macrocrosslinking of a dilute dispersion of anionic TEMPO‐oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (CNF, 0.3 wt%), forming free‐standing hydrogels. The cationic block copolymers adsorbed irreversibly to the CNF, enabling the formation of ionically crosslinked hydrogels, with a storage modulus of up to 2.9 kPa. The ability of the block copolymers to adsorb to CNF was confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM‐D) and infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), and the thermoresponsive properties of the hydrogels were investigated by rheological stress and frequency sweep, and gravimetric measurements. This method was shown to be promising for the facile production of thermoresponsive hydrogels based on CNF. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Here, we demonstrate that incorporating strongly π-donating, nitrogen-containing β-ketoiminate (acNac), β-diketiminate (NacNac), and N,N′-diisopropylbenzamidinate (dipba) ancillary ligands can demonstrably perturb the excited-state kinetics, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields (ΦPL) for red-emitting compounds. A comprehensive study of the quantum yields and lifetimes for these complexes reveals that for the compounds with the highest quantum yields, the radiative rate constant (kᵣ) is significantly higher than that of related complexes, and contributes substantially to the increase in ΦPL. Experimental and computational evidence is consistent with the notion that an increase in spin–orbit coupling, caused by an enhancement of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character of the excited state via destabilization of the HOMO, is mainly responsible for the faster radiative rates. One of the compounds was shown to be effective as the emissive dopant in an organic light-emitting diode device.  aPublisher supplied data 3airidium 3aligands 3alight emitting diodes 3aphosphorescence 3aphotoluminescence1 aBrysacz, Caroline H.1 aAlam, Md Kamrul1 aAyoub, Nicholas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4354-77221 aGray, Thomas G.1 aBao, Jiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6819-01171 aTeets, Thomas S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7471-84670 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 July 21, v. 140, no. 32 p.10198-10207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b048413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012500168300001600293520142100309592002801730650002101758650002601779650002801805650001101833650001301844650001901857650002301876650001301899650001401912650001901926700002001945700002301965700002901988773012402017856008202141852000902223655001202232IND60567573220221119232010.0170425e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056757322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b107412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArjmand, Mohammad10aCarbon Nanotube/Graphene Nanoribbon/Polyvinylidene Fluoride Hybrid Nanocomposites: Rheological and Dielectric Properties  ap. 169-181.  aResults of the present study demonstrate the potential of graphene nanoribbon to induce giant synergistic effects in the broadband dielectric properties of multiwalled carbon nanotube/graphene nanoribbon/polyvinylidene fluoride (MWCNT/GNR/PVDF) nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were prepared using a melt-mixing technique at various nanofiller total contents and MWCNT/GNR weight ratios. Rheology coupled with AC conductivity measurements of the nanocomposites unearthed highly superior capability of MWCNT to neighbor or interlace compared to GNR; i.e., the MWCNT has higher ability to participate in a percolative network. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy demonstrated superior dielectric properties for MWCNT/GNR/PVDF ternary (hybrid) nanocomposites compared to the MWCNT or GNR binary nanocomposites. For instance, at 1.5 wt % and 1000 Hz, the ternary nanocomposite with an MWCNT/GNR ratio of 3:1 presented a real permittivity and dissipation factor of 41.4 and 0.91, surpassing the binary MWCNT nanocomposite with a real permittivity and dissipation factor of 39.3 and 86.7, respectively. We attribute this synergistic effect to the poor interlacing ability of GNRs, as secondary conductive nanofillers, acting as extra nanoelectrodes. In fact, the role of GNRs as extra nanoelectrodes in conjunction with their poor propensity to bridge MWCNTs led to effective nanocapacitor structures with low energy loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3aphysical chemistry 3arheology 3asynergism 3athermoplastics1 aSadeghi, Soheil1 aKhajehpour, Maryam1 aSundararaj, Uttandaraman0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.169-181dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b107413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012000161300001800281500002000299520125100319592002801570650002101598650002601619650001601645650002901661650001301690650002101703650001401724650001101738650001901749650001301768650001801781650001301799700001301812700001301825700001901838700001901857700001801876700001901894700001901913700001601932773011301948856007402061852000902135655001202144IND60571927720221117190318.0170712e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057192772DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.282362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Sheng‐Qi10aLong‐subchain hyperbranched poly(aminoethyl acrylate): A potent antimicrobial polymer with low hemolytic toxicity  ap. 3462-3469.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe emergency of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria and their wide spread has posed a worldwide threat to public health, and traditional antibiotics are gradually overwhelmed by infectious bacteria. Herein, we report an efficient and economical strategy to construct antimicrobial polymers with net cationic component and hyperbranched architecture, which exhibit highly selective toxicity toward bacteria over human cells. To this aim, cationic poly(aminoethyl acrylate) (PAEA) without hydrophobicity is chosen for low hemolysis activity and targeting the negative bacterial membranes, and hyperbranched architecture is introduced to solve the dilemma of low antimicrobial activity. Long‐subchain hyperbranched PAEA (lhb‐PAEA) samples kills >99.99% gram‐negative Escherichia coli and >98% gram‐positive Staphylococcu aureus at the dose of ≤4 μg/mL. Moreover, lhb‐PAEA samples exhibit great biocompatibility, for the hemolysis percentage was ≤35% even at the high dose of 1024 μg/mL.

Due to the long asymptomatic period, the most important and efficient tool for HLB management is early detection, which enables fast decisions to protect the farm. In this sense, a new methodology using a portable laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) system and statistical tools was developed. It is capable of identifying not only symptomatic HLB leaves in the field, but also asymptomatic HLB trees and symptomatic citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) trees. The differentiation reaches accuracy better than 90% and provides the ability of detecting an asymptomatic diseased tree 21 months before the symptoms appear, results supported by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3acitrus variegated chlorosis 3acrop production 3aearly diagnosis 3afarms 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agreening disease 3aleaves 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atrees 0aEarly diagnosis 0aLaser induced fluorescence spectroscopy 0aHuanglongbing (HLB) 0aCitrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) 0aPhytosanitary control 0aCitrus diseases1 aCardinali, Marcelo C.B.1 aKubota, Thiago M.K.1 aFreitas-Astúa, Juliana1 aFerreira, Ednaldo J.1 aBellete, Barbara S.1 ada Silva, Maria Fátima G.F.1 aVillas Boas, Paulino R.1 aMagalhães, Aida B.1 aMilori, Débora M.B.P.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Apr., v. 144 p.133-144dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277500002000295520086900315592002801184650001401212650002701226650003301253650001701286650001501303650001701318700001701335773011301352856007401465852000901539655001201548IND60571927820221117190331.0170712e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057192782DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.282312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudo, Atsushi12aA highly rigid diamine monomer derived from naturally occurring myo‐inositol and its use for polyamide synthesis  ap. 3436-3443.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA rigid diamine was synthesized from myo‐inositol, a naturally occurring cyclic hexaol, and used as a monomer to synthesize polyamides. myo‐Inositol was treated with 1,1‐dimethoxycyclohexane to yield a bisketal bearing two hydroxyl groups, and from this bisketal, the target diamine was synthesized in three steps: (1) derivation of the diol into the corresponding bistriflate, (2) nucleophilic substitution of the bistriflate with sodium azide yielding a diazide, and (3) reduction of the diazide to the target diamine. The target diamine readily underwent polycondensation with dicarboxylic acid chloride in solution.

Molecular simulation is becoming increasingly important to screen large databases of structures and identify potential candidates for challenging gas separations, but such efforts rely on the availability of accurate molecular models that can predict adsorption in a wide range of different MOFs. MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) pose particular problems because standard force fields are unable to describe their specific interactions with certain adsorbates. In this Article, we demonstrate that our previous approach to describe adsorption in open metal sites, based on a combination of classical Monte Carlo simulations and quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory calculations, is transferable to several Cu-containing MOFs. By fitting the parameters of our model to match adsorption energies of ethylene on HKUST-1 and transferring them to the Cu-paddlewheel units of other MOFs, we obtain predictions in good agreement with experimental adsorption measurements. Where agreement is not as satisfactory, we show that this can be explained by limited accessibility or diffusion through the pore network. For one particular MOF, UMCM-150, we show that separate parameters need to be used for the Cu-trimer unit, for which the interaction energies with ethylene are much lower than those in the Cu-paddlewheel. Overall, our approach demonstrates that the specific CUS interactions in MOFs can be parametrized separately from other interaction types, such as van der Waals, thus opening the way for the development of an accurate and fully transferable force field for this class of materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adatabases 3aethylene 3amolecular models 3aprediction 3avan der Waals forces1 aFerreiro-Rangel, Carlos A.1 aFischer, Michael1 aGomes, José R.

Oscillation in Stability of Consecutive Chemical Bonds  ap. 459-470.  aThe stability of chemical bonds at the molecule–metal interface is of fundamental importance for a majority of applications based on organic materials. It remains, however, extremely difficult to determine this stability using experimental and theoretical methods. A detailed analysis of the static SIMS (S-SIMS) data obtained for the homologous series of thiolate- and selenolate-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the Ag(111) substrate reveals positional oscillations in the stability of consecutive chemical bonds in the vicinity of the molecule–metal interface. The observed oscillations are much more pronounced compared to recently reported analogous data for the Au(111) substrate, which confirms the universal nature of this phenomenon and its strong dependence on the type of molecule binding atom (S or Se) and the substrate (Ag or Au). Importantly, such an analysis has not been conducted to date using any other technique, and this study not only reveals the universal mechanisms of molecule–metal interface stability but also presents S-SIMS as a unique tool for such an analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3agold 3aselenium 3asilver1 aRysz, Jakub1 aTerfort, Andreas1 aCyganik, Piotr0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.459-470dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b107623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011600163300002000279520188200299592002802181650003502209650003002244650002402274650001402298650002802312650000902340650001902349650001202368650001702380650001102397650001502408650001302423650001802436650001902454650001302473650002102486700001802507700002502525700002202550700002202572700002002594700002302614700002002637700003202657700002502689700002302714700005902737773014902796856007702945852000903022655001203031IND60608955920221120225523.0181020e20180721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060895592DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b051052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Siobhan M.10aIridium Nanoparticles for Multichannel Luminescence Lifetime Imaging, Mapping Localization in Live Cancer Cells  ap. 10242-10249.  aThe development of long-lived luminescent nanoparticles for lifetime imaging is of wide interest as luminescence lifetime is environmentally sensitive detection independent of probe concentration. We report novel iridium-coated gold nanoparticles as probes for multiphoton lifetime imaging with characteristic long luminescent lifetimes based on iridium luminescence in the range of hundreds of nanoseconds and a short signal on the scale of picoseconds based on gold allowing multichannel detection. The tailor-made IrC₆ complex forms stable, water-soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of 13, 25, and 100 nm, bearing 1400, 3200, and 22 000 IrC₆ complexes per AuNP, respectively. The sensitivity of the iridium signal on the environment of the cell is evidenced with an observed variation of lifetimes. Clusters of iridium nanoparticles show lifetimes from 450 to 590 ns while lifetimes of 660 and 740 ns are an average of different points in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Independent luminescence lifetime studies of the nanoparticles in different media and under aggregation conditions postulate that the unusual long lifetimes observed can be attributed to interaction with proteins rather than nanoparticle aggregation. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), confocal microscopy studies and 3D luminescence lifetime stacks confirm the presence of bright, nonaggregated nanoparticles inside the cell. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis further supports the presence of the nanoparticles in cells. The iridium-coated nanoparticles provide new nanoprobes for lifetime detection with dual channel monitoring. The combination of the sensitivity of the iridium signal to the cell environment together with the nanoscaffold to guide delivery offer opportunities for iridium nanoparticles for targeting and tracking in in vivo models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acellular microenvironment 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence microscopy 3agold 3aimage analysis 3airidium 3aluminescence 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3awater solubility1 aClaire, Sunil1 aTeixeira, Rodolfo I.1 aDosumu, Abiola N.1 aCarrod, Andrew J.1 aDehghani, Hamid1 aHannon, Michael J.1 aWard, Andrew D.1 aBicknell, R.

In urban environments, vegetation phenology is also important because of its influence on public health (e.g., allergies), and energy demand (e.g. cooling effects). In this study, we studied the potential use of remotely sensed observations (i.e. Landsat data) to derive some phenology indicators for vegetation embedded within the urban core domains in four distinctly different U.S. regions (Washington, D.C., King County in Washington, Polk County in Iowa, and Baltimore City and County in Maryland) during the past three decades. We used all available Landsat observations (circa 3000 scenes) from 1982 to 2015 and a self-adjusting double logistic model to detect and quantify the annual change of vegetation phenophases, i.e. indicators of seasonal changes in vegetation. The proposed model can capture and quantify not only phenophases of dense vegetation in rural areas, but also those of mixed vegetation in urban core domains. The derived phenology indicators show a good agreement with similar indicators derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in situ observations, suggesting that the phenology dynamic depicted by the proposed model is reliable. The vegetation phenology and its seasonal and interannual dynamics demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern in urban domains with an earlier (9–14days) start-of-season (SOS) and a later (13–20days) end-of-season (EOS), resulting in an extended (5–30days) growing season length (GSL) when compared to the surrounding suburban and rural areas in the four study regions. There is a general long-term trend of decreasing SOS (−0.30day per year), and increasing EOS and GSL (0.50 and 0.90day per year, respectively) over past three decades for these study regions. The magnitude of these trends varies among the four urban systems due to their diverse local climate conditions, vegetation types, and different urban-rural settings. The Landsat derived phenology information for urban domains provides more details when compared to the coarse-resolution datasets such as MODIS, thus improves our understanding of human-natural systems interactions (or feedbacks) in urban domains. Such information is very valuable for urban planning in light of rapid urbanization and expansion of major metropolitans at the national and global levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agrowing season 3ahypersensitivity 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphenology 3apublic health 3arural areas 3aseasonal variation 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3avegetation types 3aDistrict of Columbia 3aIowa 3aMaryland 3aWashington (state) 0aUrban systems 0aLandsat 0aDouble sigmoid 0aVegetation phenology 0aUrbanization1 aZhou, Yuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1765-67891 aAsrar, Ghassem R.1 aMeng, Lin0 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.2453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245012300199300001300322500001100335520147800346592002801824596006401852596018501916596006102101650002102162650002002183650002002203650001902223650001702242650001702259650003102276650002002307650001902327651001802346700001602364700002202380700002002402700001802422700001702440773012902457856007302586852000902659655001202668IND60627771120221122211809.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062777112DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.125622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdosa, Tariku T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0119-073710aCurrent status of the management of fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea: Towards the integrated pest management development  ap. 1-10.  aREVIEW  aThe fall‐webworm (FWW), Hyphantria cunea, is a highly polyphagous insect pest that is native to North America and distributed in different countries around the world. To manage this insect pest, various control methods have been independently evaluated in the invaded areas. Some of the control methods have been limited to the laboratory and need further study to verify their effectiveness in the field. On the other hand, currently, integrated pest management (IPM) has become a promising ecofriendly insect pest management option to reduce the adverse effect of insecticides on the environment. The development of an IPM for an insect pest must combine different management options in a compatible and applicable manner. In the native areas of the insect pests, there are some recommended management options. However, to date, there is no IPM for the management of the FWW in the newly invaded areas. Therefore, to develop an IPM for this insect pest, compilation of effective management option information is the first step. Thus, believing in the contribution of an IPM to the established management strategies, the chemical, biological, natural enemy, sex pheromone, and molecular studies regarding this insect were reviewed and potential future research areas were delineated in this review study. Therefore, using the currently existing management options, IPM development for this insect pest should be the subject of future research in the newly invaded areas.  aPublisher supplied data  a617077‐5cExport Promotion Technology Development Program  a116110‐2cKorea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through Advanced Production Technology Development Program  cMinistry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) 3aHyphantria cunea 3aadverse effects 3acontrol methods 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3anatural enemies 3asex pheromones 3aNorth America1 aJo, Yong H.1 aKeshavarz, Maryam1 aAnh, Young Sang1 aNoh, Mi Young1 aHan, Yeon S.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2019 Feb., v. 143, no. 1-2 p.1-10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.125623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245017700177300001600354520188100370592002802251650001102279650001702290650001602307650001102323650004302334650001502377650001602392650002402408650001902432650001302451650001302464651001302477653002502490653002302515653001802538653004602556653001602602653002202618700001802640700002002658773010002678856008502778852000902863655001202872IND60466560320221123030853.0151125e20160207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046656032DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2015.10415632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGara, Tawanda Winmore10aPredicting forest carbon stocks from high resolution satellite data in dry forests of Zimbabwe: exploring the effect of the red-edge band in forest carbon stocks estimation  ap. 176-192.  aIn this study, we tested whether the inclusion of the red-edge band as a covariate to vegetation indices improves the predictive accuracy in forest carbon estimation and mapping in savanna dry forests of Zimbabwe. Initially, we tested whether and to what extent vegetation indices (simple ratio SR, soil-adjusted vegetation index and normalized difference vegetation index) derived from high spatial resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) predict forest carbon stocks. Next, we tested whether inclusion of reflectance in the red-edge band as a covariate to vegetation indices improve the model's accuracy in forest carbon prediction. We used simple regression analysis to determine the nature and the strength of the relationship between forest carbon stocks and remotely sensed vegetation indices. We then used multiple regression analysis to determine whether integrating vegetation indices and reflection in the red-edge band improve forest carbon prediction. Next, we mapped the spatial variation in forest carbon stocks using the best regression model relating forest carbon stocks to remotely sensed vegetation indices and reflection in the red-edge band. Our results showed that vegetation indices alone as an explanatory variable significantly (p < 0.05) predicted forest carbon stocks with R ² ranging between 45 and 63% and RMSE ranging from 10.3 to 12.9%. However, when the reflectance in the red-edge band was included in the regression models the explained variance increased to between 68 and 70% with the RMSE ranging between 9.56 and 10.1%. A combination of SR and reflectance in the red edge produced the best predictor of forest carbon stocks. We concluded that integrating vegetation indices and reflectance in the red-edge band derived from high spatial resolution can be successfully used to estimate forest carbon in dry forests with minimal error.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adry forests 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asavannas 3avariance 3aZimbabwe 0aforest carbon stocks 0avegetation indices 0ared-edge band 0ahigh spatial resolution satellite imagery 0adry forests 0asavanna woodlands1 aMurwira, Amon1 aNdaimani, Henry0 tGeocarto international.g2016 Feb. 7, v. 31, no. 2 p.176-192dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2015.10415633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245007100192300001800263520064300281592002800924650002700952650002300979650001801002650002401020650001601044650001501060650002801075650002401103650002801127650002601155650006201181700001901243700001801262700003001280700002401310773011501334856004801449852000901497655001201506IND4473049520221120222054.0130325e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447304952DNAL7 a223502582pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-3928-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoblete-Castro, Ignacio10aIndustrial biotechnology of Pseudomonas putida and related species  ap. 2279-2290.  aSince their discovery many decades ago, Pseudomonas putida and related subspecies have been intensively studied with regard to their potential application in industrial biotechnology.

The loads applied to the soil and the resulting pressure influences the degree of soil compaction. This study was conducted to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres. This was conducted initially on a non-deformable surface; a later study will consider pressures within the subsoil. From this the tyre carcass stiffness was determined and methods to predict carcass stiffness were evaluated. Tyre carcass stiffness is defined as an equivalent pressure resulting from the stiffness of the tyre carcass. In order to estimate the carcass stiffness of tyres a number of approaches were considered including: (i) footprint area, (ii) tyre load – deflection, (iii) pressure mapping and (iv) tyre manufacturer's specification methods. Carcass stiffness values obtained from the footprint area method gave results significantly lower (30–40%) than those obtained using the pressure mapping system. The method based on the tyre load – deflection characteristics was found to give a better estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness of the smooth rather than the treaded tyre. The technique of using the tyre manufacturer's specification data, where the estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness was calculated using the theoretical load that the tyre could support at zero inflation pressure, produced estimates that were within ±20% of the mean carcass stiffness determined using the pressure mapping system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3asoil compaction 3atires 0aTyre carcass stiffness 0aContact pressure 0aPressure mapping 0aSoil – tyre interactions1 aRichards, Terence E.1 aBlackburn, Kim1 aGodwin, Richard J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 July, v. 147 p.183-192dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002700137245013400164300001600298520139900314592002801713650001101741650001101752650001101763650001101774650002001785650002501805650002201830650001501852650002001867653003001887653001901917653002901936653001601965700002001981773011702001856007202118852000902190655001202199IND60752830020221119074956.0211007s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075283002DNAL7 a10.1071/BT200722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGellie, Nicholas J.

Often programs have not selected appropriate levels of vegetation classification and mapping for management purposes. Here, we provide an alternative broad vegetation classification at the macrogroup level in the international vegetation classification for eastern New South Wales (NSW) that could be applied in regional and local environmental planning and management. Existing aerial photographic interpretation (API) floristic and canopy maps available for eastern NSW were collated and reclassified and incorporated into a unifying dataset of macrogroups, which also included types dominated by exotic vegetation such as exotic plantations. There we identified, in total, 71 macrogroups across eastern New South Wales (NSW) of a total of 85 identified for NSW mapped at 1:25000 scale, or finer, in the following three sections: north-east, Sydney basin and central west, and southern coast and Snowy Mountains. These were then amalgamated into a single remnant vegetation map covering 23 525 280 ha. This alternative broad vegetation hierarchy provides a reliable and overt vegetation classification and mapping dataset that can easily incorporate future revisions as new mapping data become available.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abotany 3acanopy 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aimage interpretation 3aintroduced plants 3avegetation 3avegetation maps 0avegetation classification 0avegetation map 0afuel type classification 0aeastern NSW1 aHunter, John T.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2021, v. 69, no. 7 p.450-467dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44712x0067-19247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT200723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245005300155300002000208520089700228592002801125650001401153650001901167650001501186650001501201650001101216650002001227700001701247700001201264700001701276700001701293773014401310856007401454852000901528655001201537IND60670518820221122093413.0191002e20131112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067051882DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12726e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xuan12aA new solid oxide molybdenum–air redox battery  ap. 14858-14861.  aA new type of rechargeable molybdenum–air battery based on the technologies of reversible solid oxide fuel cells and chemical looping is reported in this study.

With decreasing temperature and reduction of the librational motion, we observe an increase in the experimentally measured CQ explaining the discrepancy between experiments and predictions from density functional theory. In addition, at low temperatures and in the absence of ¹H decoupling, we observe a well-resolved ¹H–¹⁷O dipole splitting in the spectra, which provides information on the structure of the H₂O molecule. The splitting arises because of the homogeneous nature of the coupling between the two ¹H–¹⁷O dipoles and the ¹H–¹H dipole.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abarium 3abound water 3amagnetic fields 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3aspinning 3atemperature1 aMichaelis, Vladimir K.1 aGriffin, Robert G.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 120, no. 32 p.7851-7858dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b057553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013700159300002000296520112600316592002801442650001101470650002301481650001301504653002301517653002901540653002401569653002501593653001601618653002301634700001301657700001801670700001401688700001601702700001201718700001701730700001501747773014101762856008001903852000901983655001201992IND60558112420170710000000.0161109e20161109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055811242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b069672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yaping10aDiketopyrrolopyrrole Polymers with Thienyl and Thiazolyl Linkers for Application in Field-Effect Transistors and Polymer Solar Cells  ap. 30328-30335.  aConjugated polymers consisting of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units have been successfully applied in field-effect transistors (FETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), while most of the DPP polymers were designed as symmetric structures containing identical aromatic linkers. In this manuscript, we design a new asymmetric DPP polymer with varied aromatic linkers in the backbone for application in FETs and PSCs. The designation provides the chance to finely adjust the energy levels of conjugated polymers so as to influence the device performance. The asymmetric polymer exhibits highly crystalline properties, high hole mobilities of 3.05 cm² V–¹ s–¹ in FETs, and a high efficiency of 5.9% in PSCs with spectra response from 300 to 850 nm. Morphology investigation demonstrates that the asymmetric polymer has a large crystal domain in blended thin films, indicating that the solar cell performance can be further enhanced by optimizing the microphase separation. The study reveals that the asymmetric design via adjusting the aromatic linkers in DPP polymers is a useful route toward flexible electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 0aconjugated polymer 0afield-effect transistors 0apolymer solar cells 0adiketopyrrolopyrrole 0acrystalline 0aasymmetric polymer1 aWu, Yang1 aZhang, Andong1 aLi, Cheng1 aTang, Zheng1 aMa, Wei1 aWu, Yonggang1 aLi, Weiwei0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 09, v. 8, no. 44 p.30328-30335dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b069673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245009300182300001400275520171400289592002802003650001102031650002302042650001402065650001402079650001802093650001502111650001102126650002302137651001802160651001802178653003102196653002402227653002002251653002702271653001402298653003602312700002302348700002302371700002202394700002302416700002202439700001802461700002202479700002502501773010502526856008502631852000902716655001202725IND60560972520221119065611.0190214e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056097252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, T. D.q(Timothy D.),10aAssessing the effectiveness of a large marine protected area for reef shark conservation  ap. 64-71.  aLarge marine protected areas (MPAs) have recently been established throughout the world at an unprecedented pace, yet the value of these reserves for mobile species conservation remains unclear. Reef shark populations continue to decline even within some of the largest MPAs, fueling unresolved debates over the ability of protected areas to aid mobile species that transit beyond MPA boundaries. We assessed the capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the 54,000km2 U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of >0.5 million satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively benefit reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926km from Palmyra Atoll, 810km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366km from Palmyra) captured 2% of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatolls 3aconservation areas 3afisheries 3afishermen 3afishing boats 3asatellites 3asharks 3athreatened species 3aPacific Ocean 3aUnited States 0aCarcharhinus amblyrhynchos 0aSatellite telemetry 0aVessel tracking 0aMarine protected areas 0aFisheries 0aAutomatic identification system1 aCarlisle, Aaron B.1 aKroodsma, David A.1 aBlock, Barbara A.1 aCasagrandi, Renato1 aDe Leo, Giulio A.1 aGatto, Marino1 aMicheli, Fiorenza1 aMcCauley, Douglas J.0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Mar., v. 207 p.64-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245013800208300001600346500001500362506007600377520159900453592002802052506003702080650001102117650003302128650001002161650002002171650000802191650001002199650002102209650001502230650002102245650001302266650001402279650001102293650001902304650001802323650001902341650002202360650001402382650002402396650001502420650002702435650002402462650001702486650001002503653001402513700002102527700001802548700001702566773010502583856008102688852000902769655001202778IND50088832120221207075723.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008883212DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-013-0435-72doi7 aPMC41884952pmcid7 a253204182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDash, Sandip K.10aCarbon-Mercaptooctadecane/Carboxylated Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes Composite Based Genosensor for Detection of Bacterial Meningitis  ap. 170-177.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman brain bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening disease mainly caused by Neisseria meningitidis, lead to several complications including damage of brain or even death. The present available methods for diagnosis of meningitis have one or more limitations. A rmpM gene based genosensor was fabricated by immobilizing 5′-amino modified 19-mer single stranded DNA probe onto carbon-mercaptooctadecane/carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite electrode and hybridized with 2.5–40 ng/6 μL of single stranded genomic DNA (ssG-DNA) of N. meningitidis from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the suspected meningitis patients. The electrochemical response was measured by using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using 1 mM methylene blue as redox indicator in 30 min (including a response time of 1 min) at 25 °C. The sensitivity of the genosensor was 3.762 (μA/cm²)/ng and limit of detection was 2 ng of ssG-DNA of N. meningitidis with DPV. The genosensor has specificity only to N. meningitidis and does not hybridize with the genomic DNA of any other possible pathogen in human CSF. The immobilization of the probe and hybridization of the ssG-DNA were characterized by using electrochemical impedance in presence of 5 mM potassium ferricyanide and scanning electron microscopy. The genosensor loses only 12 % of its original DPV current on storage at 4 °C for 6 months. Carbon composite based electrochemical array can be constructed to detect multiple bacterial meningitis suspected patient CSF samples during an outbreak of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3ascanning electron microscopy 3agenes 3adetection limit 3aDNA 3abrain 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3apatients 3apathogens 3ahumans 3amethylene blue 3ahybridization 3ananocomposites 3adisease outbreaks 3apotassium 3amicrobial detection 3ameningitis 3aNeisseria meningitidis 3acerebrospinal fluid 3abrain damage 3adeath 0aimpedance1 aSharma, Minakshi1 aKhare, Shashi1 aKumar, Ashok0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2014 June, v. 54, no. 2 p.170-177dSpringer-Verlagx0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-013-0435-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245018500155300001600340520121200356592002801568650001701596650001101613650001501624650002201639650001501661650002501676650001101701650001501712651001501727653000801742653001201750653003201762653002701794653002201821653002801843653002601871700002501897700001801922773011701940856007202057852000902129655001202138IND60752830220221119074851.0211007s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075283022DNAL7 a10.1071/BT201082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddicott, Eda10aAligning quantitative vegetation classification and landscape scale mapping: updating the classification approach of the Regional Ecosystem classification system used in Queensland  ap. 400-413.  aVegetation classification systems form a base for conservation management and the ecological exploration of the patterns and drivers of species’ distributions. A standardised system crossing administrative and geographical boundaries is widely recognised as most useful for broad-scale management. The Queensland Government, recognising this, uses the Regional Ecosystem (RE) classification system and accompanying mapping as a state-wide standardised vegetation classification system. This system informs legislation and policy at local, state and national levels, underpinning decisions that have wide-ranging implications for biodiversity and people’s livelihoods. It therefore needs to be robust from a scientific and legal perspective. The current approach in the RE system for identifying vegetation communities relies on expert-based class definition procedures. This is in contrast to best practice, which is based on quantitative procedures. This paper discusses the RE system in a global context and outlines the updated approach that incorporates quantitative class definition procedures, synthesises the research behind the updated approach and discusses its implications and implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abotany 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alaws and regulations 3apeople 3avegetation 3aQueensland 0aQld 0amapping 0aclass definition procedures 0avegetation communities 0aplant association 0aconservation management 0aclassification system1 aNeldner, Victor John1 aRyan, Timothy0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2021, v. 69, no. 7 p.400-413dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44712x0067-19247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT201083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147242003500170245004000205500002200245520114900267592002801416650001901444650001601463650001801479650000901497650002401506650001901530650002601549650001201575650002101587650002601608650002601634650001301660650000901673650001001682653002101692653001701713653002601730653001601756653002401772653001201796653002901808653001801837700002101855773014201876856008102018852000902099655001202108IND60560972620221119065709.0170719s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056097262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastel, Bérénice10aMother's breastfeeding feeding10aAlimentation de la mère allaitante  aPre-press version  aBreast milk is the only source of nutrition for breastfed infants and its nutritional composition is partially related to the mother's diet. The question of an ideal diet suitable for breastfeeding women arises, and also the necessity or not of a supplementation. We know that the energy requirements are unique to each mother (with a lower limit not to cross) and the distribution of macronutrients (lipids, proteins and carbohydrates) is identical to what is recommended for the population of non-breastfeeding women, ensuring an adequate and balanced contribution in various essential fatty acids. By giving priority to foods, which is nutritionally interesting and adopting a balanced diet, breastfeeding women can cover their nutritional needs. Consequently dietary advice, although they are not always followed, should be given systematically. Finally, some sub-populations are at higher risk of nutritional deficiency and supplementation may then be necessary. And moreover, if supplementation is basically medicinal nowadays, the idea of an enriched food for breastfeeding women could be an effective, reachable and economical solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acarbohydrates 3adiet 3aenergy requirements 3aenriched foods 3aessential fatty acids 3ainfants 3anutrient content 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient requirements 3aproteins 3arisk 3awomen 0aFemme allaitante 0aAlimentation 0aBesoins nutritionnels 0aAllaitement 0aBreastfeeding women 0aFeeding 0aNutritional requirements 0aBreastfeeding1 aBilleaud, Claude0 tCahiers de Nutrition et de Dietetique.g2017, dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2016.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015500170300001600325520170100341592002802042650002602070650001302096650002502109650001602134650001702150650001002167650002302177650001402200650002502214650001802239650001102257650002502268653003702293653003102330653002702361653002302388653002902411700001902440700002002459700001902479700001702498700002202515700005702537773010602594856008702700852000902787655001202796IND60570180520221123042029.0170708e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057018052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.2502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jangwoo10aQuantitative and qualitative changes in antibiotic resistance genes after passing through treatment processes in municipal wastewater treatment plants  ap. 906-914.  aIn this study, quantitative and qualitative changes in antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated in two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treating pretreated livestock or industrial wastewater as well as municipal sewage. Total eight ARGs (tetX, tetM, tetA, sul1, sul2, ermB, qnrD, and blaTEM) were quantified, and their relative abundance was assessed by ARGs copies/16S rRNA gene copies. The fate of ARGs was observed to be different between two WWTPs: sul, qnrD, and blaTEM were proliferated during the treatment processes only in the WWTP1 which received pretreated livestock wastewater. Furthermore, dynamic shifts in patterns of ARGs occurrence were observed during biological, secondary sedimentation and coagulation processes. During biological treatment in both WWTPs, relative abundance of tet and ermB changed: tet increased significantly by 211.6–357.6%, while ermB decreased by 70.4–92.0%. Little variation was observed in sul, qnrD and blaTEM. Subsequently, the relative abundance of tet decreased during the secondary sedimentation and coagulation in both WWTPs: tet decreased by 56.0–86.3% during sedimentation and by 48.2–75.7% during coagulation, respectively. During the final treatment, different responses of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and ARGs to ultraviolet (UV) disinfection were found: removal efficiencies of ARB were observed in the range of 34–75%, while obvious reduction in ARGs was not observed at the UV dose of 27mJ/cm2. Although ARGs underwent various treatment processes, considerable levels of ARGs remained at discharge amounting to 4.2×1018 copies/day from WWTP1 and 5.4×1016 copies/day from WWTP2, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiological treatment 3acoagulation 3adisinfection 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3alivestock 3amunicipal wastewater 3aribosomal RNA 3asewage 3awastewater treatment 0aAntibiotic resistance gene (ARG) 0aWastewater treatment plant 0aPhysiochemical process 0aBiological process 0aUltraviolet disinfection1 aJeon, Jong Hun1 aShin, Jingyeong1 aJang, Hyun Min1 aKim, Sungpyo1 aSong, Myoung Seok1 aKim, Young Mo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0716-242X0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 605-606 p.906-914dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.2503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014800157300002000305520124400325592002801569650000801597650002001605650001301625650001701638650001301655650001401668650001901682650001401701650001801715650001901733650001601752700001901768700002301787700001701810700002401827700001801851700001801869773014301887856007402030852000902104655001202113IND60670519120221121225558.0191002e20131002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067051912DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12735d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Nhien H.10aSolution-processable conductive micro-hydrogels of nanoparticle/graphene platelets produced by reversible self-assembly and aqueous exfoliation  ap. 12900-12908.  aPreventing the π–π restacking of graphene-based platelets is essential to advance their fundamental attributes in a wide range of scalable chemical processes. Using macroscopic hydrogels of water-intercalated metal-oxide/graphene platelets is a novel approach to produce microscopic hydrogels with extraordinary surface accessibility and electronic properties. Nanoparticle decoration and surface hydration prevent irreversible π–π stacking, paving the way for reversible self-assembly and aqueous-phase exfoliation. The hydrophilic nanoparticle coating facilitates the colloidal stability of hybrid microgels in aqueous and organic media without the assistance of surfactants. This allows these materials to versatilely function as basic building blocks as well as applied nanomaterials in wet-chemistry applications. The preservation of unique properties of SnO₂-decorated graphene platelets leads to significantly enhanced adsorptive and photocatalytic activities. By exploiting the fluorescence quenching effect, a dye–hydrogel complex can be utilized as a supramolecular sensor for sensitive DNA detection. This study also initiates an innovative synthetic strategy to synthesize high-quality graphene-based nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood platelets 3acoatings 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3amicrogels 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3asurfactants1 aSeema, Humaira1 aKemp, K.

Tomato has a long growth cycle and large fertiliser requirement; thus, K stress often occurs and degrades crop yield and quality. It is the most suitable method to provide nutrition based on the actual requirement of crop growth. An accurate monitoring and diagnosis of nutrition during crop growth is key to realise a precise nutrient management. Crop K monitoring methods have been developed to improve K fertiliser management, and most of them are based on leaf or canopy optical property measurements. However, sensitivity to environmental interference remains an important drawback of these methods. Electrical impedance has been applied to determine the physiological and nutritional status of plant tissues, but no studies related to plant K contents have been reported. This study aims to evaluate the K nutrition level based on leaf impedance spectroscopy. Five sets of tomato samples with different K contents were grown. Total K content of leaves was determined, and electrical impedance data recorded in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The measured impedance data were analysed using an equivalent circuit model for cellular tissues. The change rule of equivalent parameters was obtained, and the sensitive impedance spectroscopy characteristics of K nutrition level were extracted. Moreover, the influence of moisture content on impedance measurement is discussed and the prediction model for K content is established. Results show that electrical impedance can be applied to the detection and diagnosis of plant K nutrition status.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3aplant tissues 3apotassium fertilizers 3anutritional status 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3amonitoring 3amodels 3adielectric spectroscopy 3acrop yield 3apotassium 3awater content 3aleaves 3anutrient management 0aElectrical impedance spectroscopy 0aPotassium nutrition level 0aDiagnosis and detection 0aimpedance1 aMeiqing, Li1 aHanping, Mao1 aWenjing, Zhu0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 July, v. 147 p.130-138dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015600172300001400328520061000342592002800952650002500980650002401005650004401029653002501073653001801098653000801116653003001124653001801154653001401172653003401186700002601220700002401246700002201270700002001292773008801312856008401400852000901484655001201493IND60560972720221119065605.0170606e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056097272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2016.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakiet, Katarzyna10aStructure of the O-specific polysaccharide from the lipopolysaccharide of Aeromonas hydrophila strain K691 containing 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose  ap. 23-29.  aThe O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) was isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of Aeromonas hydrophila strain K691 and studied by chemical methods and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-detected heteronuclear 1H,13C HSQC, and HMBC experiments.

High-Temperature Heat Pumps (HTHPs) are being investigated as a feasible energy conversion technology alternative to traditional fossil fuel boilers. This paper presents the first experimental results of an HTHP prototype equipped with a modified scroll compressor and internal heat exchanger (IHX). The elements of the main and secondary circuits are presented, as well as the test methodology and heat balances are exposed. The tests have been performed using HFC-245fa at heat source temperatures between 60 and 80 °C, and heat sink temperatures between 90 and 140 °C. The heating capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) varied between 10.9 and 17.5 kW and between 2.23 and 3.41, respectively. An exergetic analysis indicated that the expansion valve was the component with the worst second law efficiency and the compressor presented the highest potential improvement over the other cycle components. A computational analysis of low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant alternatives was carried out, which confirmed the benefits of using an internal heat exchanger (IHX) and the good performances of the low-GWP refrigerants: HCFO-1224yd(Z), HCFO-1233zd(E), and HFO-1336mzz(Z). Finally, we proved that the proposed system can save up to 57% of the equivalent CO2 emissions of a natural gas boiler. This paper provides a reference for the high-temperature heat pump recovery of the low-grade waste heat from industrial energy processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aboilers 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aexergy 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3anatural gas 3aprototypes 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3awaste heat recovery 0aHTHP 0aLiquid-to-suction heat exchanger 0aEnergy efficiency 0aVapour compression 0aPrototype1 aNavarro-Esbrí, Joaquín1 aMota-Babiloni, Adrián1 aMolés, Francisco1 aAmat-Albuixech, Marta0 tApplied energy.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 253 p.113504-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012300160300001600283520056400299592002800863650001100891650001200902650002200914650001900936650000900955650002700964650002500991700001601016700001501032700001501047700001601062700001701078773010201095856004801197852000901245655001201254IND4474000620221120222124.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447400062DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954110700882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, X.

Multitemporal SPOT VGT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for the period 2009–2010 were used for the analysis. The classification was performed adopting ISODATA clustering to build a non-agricultural area mask followed by rice area mapping. The derived rice area was stratified by logical modelling of ancillary data sets into five rice cultural types: irrigated wet, upland, flood-prone, drought-prone, and deep-water. The uniqueness of this study is a synergistic approach based solely on single-source, high-temporal remote-sensing data coupled with ancillary data, which demonstrate the application of SPOT VGT NDVI data in building a geospatial database for rice crops over a wide spatial extent. This approach was adopted for cost effectivity as the study extent was vast and thus lacking ground truth information. Comparison of the derived rice area against the reported literature values for validation yielded a good correlation (linear coefficient of determination, R ² = 0.95–0.99). The high-temporal resolution NDVI data enabled effective characterization of vegetation phenology. The derived spatial outputs can be used in various studies associated with the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, change detection, and inputs to crop simulation models, which are significantly related to different rice cultural types.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrops 3adata collection 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahighlands 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apaddies 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3arice 3asimulation models 3aspatial data 3avegetation 3aSouth East Asia1 aMore, Revati S.1 aJain, N.K.1 aPanigrahy, Sushma1 aParihar, J.S.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 36, no. 24 p.6008-6030dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.11102593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100003500136245011500171300001800286520133200304592002801636650001101664650002201675650001501697650001101712650002401723700002301747700001901770700001901789773011101808856003901919852000901958655001201967IND4466786420221120190136.0120727e20111129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446678642DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.81012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Nieuwenhuyse, Bartel H. J.10aPattern‐process relationships in surface hydrology: hydrological connectivity expressed in landscape metrics  ap. 3760-3773.  aThe degree of hydrological connectivity is mainly determined by the spatial organisation of heterogeneity. A meaningful and aggregate abstraction of spatial patterns is one of the promising means to gain fundamental insights into this complex interaction and can, moreover, be used as a tool to acquire a profound understanding of the major controls of catchment hydrology. In order to disclose such controls, pattern‐process relationships and the explanatory power of landscape metrics were tested by simulating the runoff of differently patterned virtual basins, generated by neutral landscape models and fractal networks and solved by a surface hydrological model composed of kinematic wave routing and Green‐Ampt infiltration. A total of 23 landscape metrics quantified the spatial patterns and were subsequently related to the functional connectivity, assessed as the proportion of internal runoff generation constituting the hydrological response at the outlet. Landscape metrics allowed the identification of dominant features of heterogeneity that explained the observed connectivity, and to disclose changes in control with class abundance. Therefore, landscape metrics are a useful tool for basin comparison and classification in terms of the dominant processes and the corresponding model structure requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahydrologic models 3alandscapes 3arunoff 3awatershed hydrology1 aAntoine, Michaël,1 aWyseure, Guido1 aGovers, Gerard0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Nov. 29, v. 25, no. 24 p.3760-3773dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8101  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013200155300001800287500002000305520087100325592002801196650004401224650002301268650003801291650002101329650004401350650001901394650001301413650002001426700002201446700001201468700001901480773011401499856007401613852000901687655001201696IND60571928420221117190329.0170712e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057192842DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.282532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kan10aHydrogen‐bonding characteristics and unique ring‐opening polymerization behavior of Ortho‐methylol functional benzoxazine  ap. 3635-3642.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonofunctional benzoxazine with ortho‐methylol functionality has been synthesized and highly purified.

As a result, there is significant interest in fabricating BₙNₙ-substituted graphene networks from the bottom-to-up to be used to as precursors in flexible two-dimensional one-atom thick electronic and optical devices. In this report, we present a piece of theoretical work dealing with the microscopic electronic dipole–dipole polarizabilities (static and dynamic) of borazine (B₃N₃) doped graphenes in zero and two dimensions. Polarizability is a fundamental property that describes the distortion of the electron cloud in the presence of weak static external electric fields and delivers important information about the electronic structure and spectroscopic behavior of molecules. The robust polarizability trends presented and discussed in this work point out local cyclic electron delocalization (aromaticity in rings) as the leading element that differentiates zero-dimensional B₃N₃ doped graphene flakes from two-dimensional B₃N₃ doped graphene sheets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectronic circuits 3agraphene 3aoptical properties 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy1 aKaramanis, Panaghiotis1 aEl-Kelany, Khaled E.1 aRérat, Michel1 aMaschio, Lorenzo1 aCivalleri, Bartolomeo1 aKirtman, Bernard0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.709-722dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b108373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245011400204520168200318592002802000650000802028650002102036650002402057650001402081650001302095650001202108650001602120650000902136650002502145650002402170650001502194650002102209650002002230650001102250650001502261650001102276653004402287653002802331653003902359653002402398700005102422700001702473700001702490700001502507700001402522700001302536773009802549856008702647852000902734655001202743IND60651016320221118234642.0190718e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065101632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1004-996210aNumerical and experimental investigation of precast concrete facade integrated with solar photovoltaic panels  aThis paper proposes a novel approach to integrate photovoltaic (PV) panel into a precast concrete (PC) facade renamed PVPC facade, as a special application for prefabricated high-rising buildings. In the PVPC facade, PV panels and insulation are inserted into a reserved groove of the concrete wall, which could be easily installed and help achieve a smooth appearance of the facade. After developing its configuration and installation procedure, the thermal and electrical performance of the proposed PVPC facade is numerically simulated based on real-time ambient temperature and solar radiation data. The prototype of PVPC facade is constructed in a factory and then demonstrated in a field. Onsite operating data has been collected to validate simulation results and evaluate the performance of the proposed facade. The simulation results show that the PVPC facade can generate approximately 62.56 kWh/m2 electricity annually. The maximum temperature difference between external and internal PVPC facade is approximately 16.00 °C in summer and 35.03 °C in winter, demonstrating that the proposed PVPC facade can not only generate electricity but also reduce the cooling/heating load of the building, and in total about 64.34 kWh/m2 of electricity can be saved per year for the air-conditioning system due to the thermal resistance effect of the PVPC facade. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the influence of certain factors, such as the thickness of the insulation, air gap and wind speed, on the thermal and electrical performance of PVPC facade. Finally, based on the numerical simulations, an optimal thickness of insulation is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aambient temperature 3abuildings 3aconcrete 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3amathematical models 3aprototypes 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awind speed 3awinter 0aBuilding-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) 0aPrecast concrete facade 0aThermal and electrical performance 0aParametric analysis1 aMa, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3803-27481 aLiu, Jiaying1 aLi, Huanhuan1 aXu, Yaling1 aGu, Wenbo1 aShen, Lu0 tApplied energy.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 253 p.113509-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137072000900146100001400155245012800169300001600297500002400313500001500337520146000352650001001812650002001822650002001842650002101862650002101883650001001904650001901914650001401933650001001947650001301957650001601970650001101986650002101997650002102018650001402039650001802053650001702071650001802088650001002106650003502116650003302151653001002184653001702194653001902211653001802230653002402248653002502272653001402297700002702311773009402338852000902432856007002441945002502511946001102536655001202547IND4361792020221122045231.0040329e20040216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436179202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aM001 0aL210 0aL6001 aLee, K.J.10aLong-term effects and interactions of dietary vitamins C and E on growth and reproduction of yellow perch, Perca flavescens  ap. 377-389.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was conducted to examine the effects of dietary vitamin C and/or E and their interaction on growth and reproductive performance in yellow perch. Yellow perch juveniles were divided into four treatments with triplicate groups and fed with one of four semi-purified diets for 32 weeks. The experimental diets were formulated to contain no or high vitamin E levels (160 mg/kg) without or with vitamin C supplementation (250 mg/kg) designated as diets -C-E, -C+E, +C-E, or +C+E, respectively. The growth rates and survival of yellow perch fed with +C-E and +C+E diets were significantly higher than the fish fed with -C-E diet. Total- and dehydro-ascorbate concentrations in liver and testis increased in response to its dietary supplementation. The α-tocopherol concentration in sperm was significantly affected by dietary supplementation of vitamin C. Gonadosomatic index of males was lower in the fish fed with -C-E diet compared to that of fish fed with other diets. Hatching rates of embryos obtained from testing sperm viability was significantly improved in fish fed with the diets sufficient in vitamin C (82±7%) compared to the fish fed with the -C-E diet (59±7). This study indicates that supplementation of dietary vitamin C and E increase growth rate, and semen quality can be improved by dietary vitamin C supplementation within one maturation cycle, and vitamin C may spare sperm vitamin E depending on vitamin E stores in tissues. 3asemen 3avitamin content 3aembryo (animal) 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aPerca flavescens 3aperch 3amale fertility 3ajuveniles 3amales 3ahatching 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3afeed supplements 3afeed composition 3amortality 3aascorbic acid 3afish culture 3aanimal growth 3aliver 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3afertilization (reproduction) 0aPerca 0areproduction 0afeeding trials 0asemen quality 0agonadosomatic index 0atestis somatic index 0avitamin E1 aDąbrowski, Kazimierz.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Feb. 16, v. 230, no. 1-4 p.377-389dElsevier Pub.

The model is based on a continuous equation of the oyster abundance as a function of individual growth rate, inter-individual growth variability and mortality rate. The growth model depends on water temperature, particulate organic matter concentration and total individual mass. Inter-individual growth variability was introduced into the general population dynamics equation by a diffusion coefficient K that was set to 0.05. The population dynamics model took into account the two culture methods (i.e. "collees" and "pignes" oysters) and rearing strategies of oyster farmers by using timetables of seeding and harvesting obtained through interviews of oyster farmers. Distributions of standing stocks were obtained through assessments conducted in the lagoon in March 2000, October 2000 and March 2001 and were used to calibrate the model. The model estimated the total marketable production at ca. 17,900 t between March 2000 and March 2001. The major part of the production (ca. 70%) was in spring. Seventy percent of the annual production came from "collees" oysters. Sensitivity analyses showed that the key parameters are those related to harvesting. The model was used to evaluate the effects of different environmental conditions (e.g. a decrease in the oyster growth rate, a harvesting closure due a toxic algae bloom, a massive summer mortality due to an anoxic crisis) on short- and long-term variations in the standing stock and the production for both culture methods. A decrease in the growth rate of ca. 20% resulted in losses of 18% in the first year of production for both culture methods. Long-term simulations showed that the production of "pignes" oysters was more affected than that of the "collees" oysters (reductions of 26% and 4%, respectively). Simulated scenarios included a 2-month long harvesting closure (i.e. November and December) or a massive summer mortality (i.e. 45% and 20% for "collees" and "pignes" oysters, respectively). No long-term effect was predicted for either event, although losses of ca. 10% were estimated in the first year of production for both culture techniques. The model can be a useful tool for predicting marketable production of oysters as a function of rearing strategy and environmental conditions. 3aoyster fisheries 3afish farms 3aoyster culture 3adynamic models 3aorganic matter 3aspatial distribution 3aresource management 3aanimal production 3aseasonal variation 3amass 3apopulation dynamics 3aCrassostrea gigas 3awater temperature 3aharvesting 3asimulation models 3aalgal blooms 3aequations 3amortality 3aoysters 3aanimal growth 3aenvironmental factors 3aFrance 0amathematical models 0aoyster rearing techniques 0astocking/transplanting1 aBacher, C.1 aBuestel, D.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Feb. 16, v. 230, no. 1-4 p.323-347dElsevier Pub.

Sixteen populations within Alabama (USA) were surveyed using five primer combinations. A total of 454 reproducible, polymorphic bands were detected from 282 individuals, with an average heterozygosity of 0.135. The percentage of polymorphic loci varied greatly within distinct populations, ranging from 18.26% to 100%. Research populations tended to have a lower percentage of loci polymorphic than farm populations. The estimated average Fst value across all loci was 0.4456. However, this value dropped to 0.1763 when the Hicks Farm stock was excluded from the analysis. Cluster analysis by Jaccard's pairwise similarity coefficient indicated high similarity among individuals, with some population-specific clusters and with the Hicks Farm stock being highly distinctive. Nei's population-wise identity measures found all populations except the population from the Hick's Farm related with 96% similarity. The Hick's Farm stock was 34% similar to the other populations. The genotypic information derived from this study is consistent with the historical origins and management of catfish broodstocks. The results of this study suggest that many channel catfish farm strains in Alabama are genetically similar, but some very distinct differences exist. Such information has implications for future broodstock selection and management and for further analysis of interactions between domestic and wild populations of channel catfish. 3afish culture 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aloci 3aDNA primers 3asurveys 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3acatfish 3aIctalurus punctatus 3agenetic variation 3astrains 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahatcheries 3afarmed fish 3aAlabama 0amolecular sequence data 0afish hatcheries1 aMorton, C.1 aFeng, J.1 aLi, P.1 aSimmons, M.1 aCao, D.1 aDunham, R.A.1 aLiu, Z.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Dec. 1, v. 228, no. 1-4 p.91-105dElsevier Pub.

The shrimp were kept in tanks with recirculated artificial seawater at a salinity of 22-23 ppt. The water temperature was maintained at 25±0.6 °C. The hemolymph concentrations of both drugs after intra-sinus dosing were best described by a two-compartment open model. The distribution and elimination half-lives (t1/2α and t1/2β) were found to be 0.59 and 33.2 h for oxolinic acid and 0.45 and 24.7 h for oxytetracycline, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution at a steady state (Vss) and total body clearance (CLb) were estimated to be 1309 ml/kg and 28.8 ml/kg/h for oxolinic acid and 748 ml/kg and 22.7 ml/kg/h, respectively. The hemolymph concentration¡time curves after oral administration did not fit by the nonlinear least squares method using one- and two-compartment model with first-order absorption in either of the drugs. The peak hemolymph concentration (Cmax), the time to peak hemolymph concentration (tmax) and the elimination half-life were found to be 17.8 microgram/ml, 7 h and 34.3 h for oxolinic acid and 24.3 microgram /ml, 10 h and 33.6 h for oxytetracycline, respectively. The bioavailability (F) after oral administration was 32.9% for oxolinic acid and 43.2% for oxytetracycline. The hemolymph protein binding in vivo was determined to be 36.7±8.5% for oxolinic acid and 22.9±4.8% for oxytetracycline. 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3ashrimp 3afarmed fish 3acrustacean culture 3apharmacokinetics 3aoxolinic acid 3aoxytetracycline 3abioavailability 3aoral administration 3adrug delivery systems 3ahemolymph 3awater temperature 3aweight 3adosage 3ain vivo studies 3aprotein binding 3aequations 3amodels 3aJapan 0aintra-sinus administration 0aelimination half-life0 tAquaculture.g2004 Feb. 16, v. 230, no. 1-4 p.1-11dElsevier Pub.

To elucidate the genetic mechanism influencing the timing of flower opening and closing, we obtained F1 and F2 hybrids of Hemerocallis fulva (a diurnally blooming species, pollinated by swallowtail butterflies) and H. citrina (a nocturnally blooming species, pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths) and observed their flowering behavior from blooming to closing with the use of digital cameras. For flower opening times, F1 hybrids were highly variable, and F2 hybrids showed a bimodal distribution of flower opening times with peaks in both the morning and evening. The ratio of morning flowering and evening flowering among F2 hybrids did not deviate from 1:1. For the start to close time, both F1 and F2 hybrids were similar in showing the major peak in the evening. The ratio of evening closing and morning closing among F2 hybrids did not deviate from 3:1. These results suggest that the time of flower opening and the start of closing are regulated by different major genes. 3aHemerocallis fulva 3aPapilionidae 3acameras 3aflowering 3aflowers 3ahybrids 3amajor genes 3apollination1 aYasumoto, Akiko A.1 aYahara, Tetsukazu0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2010 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.261-267dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.09000013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02581naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001500119245011000134300001600244500011000260500002400370500001500394520090400409650002101313650002601334650001301360650001801373650002501391650001101416650001301427650001801440650002301458650002301481650002301504650003601527650001801563650001401581650001101595653002701606653003101633653002101664653001901685653002001704700001801724700001801742700003401760773012301794852000901917856007701926945002502003946001102028655001202039IND4361897820221122002838.0040402e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436189782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aAndres, H.10aPhytohormone contents in Corylus avellana and their relationship to age and other developmental processes  ap. 173-180.  aIn the special issue: Adventitious regeneration / edited by T.

Lynwood, and the difficult-to-root Syringa vulgaris cv. Madame Lemoine were used in vitro to investigate the role of polar auxin transport (PAT) in rhizogenesis. Syringa internodes required the distal application of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or naphthaleneacetic acid to induce rooting, while 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was ineffective. In contrast, Forsythia internodes rooted equally well when IBA was applied at either end of the internode. Using [3H]IAA showed transport of exogenous auxin was basipetal, and that despite similar transport velocities, the intensity of auxin transport in Syringa was greater than in Forsythia. Basipetal transport of exogenous auxin was blocked using the PAT inhibitors 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and naringenin (Nar); where Forsythia proved more sensitive to TIBA, but less so to Nar, in comparison with Syringa. In both species, percentage rooting and the number of roots formed were greater in 5-mm-long internodes than in shorter internodes. The results demonstrate the importance of PAT for root initiation in Syringa, whereas Forsythia tissue appears to be more sensitive to the direct application of auxin. 3aSyringa vulgaris 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3a2,4-D 3aroots 3ashoots 3adose response 3aexplants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ain vitro regeneration 3anutrient transport 3aForsythia intermedia 3arooting 3aornamental woody plants 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3anaringenin 3abenzoic acids 3azeatin 3ainternodes 0a2,3,5-triodobenzoic acid 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0aLinsmaier and Skoog medium1 aFord, Y.Y.1 aCameron, R.W.F.1 aGoodwin, C.1 aMyers, P.E.1 aJudd, H.L.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Aug., v. 70, no. 2 p.189-198dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245012200162300001600284520175500300650001402055650001902069650001102088650001402099650001902113650001502132650001702147650001202164700001702176700001502193773008402208852000902292856008402301939003302385946001102418655001202429IND4482851020221122002837.0140702e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448285102DNAL7 a10.2746/042516409X4648162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartineau, H.10aPathology of gastritis and gastric ulceration in the horse. Part 1: Range of lesions present in 21 mature individuals  ap. 638-644.  aReasons for performing study: Gastric ulceration is now widely recognised as an important disease in high performance horses. Little is known about gastric histopathology in healthy or diseased animals; a comprehensive assessment would enhance interpretation of gross findings through assessment of their accuracy and allow for identification of lesion variety and pathogenesis in different anatomical regions of the stomach. Objectives: To investigate the true extent and variety of gastric lesions in a mixed population of mature horses at post mortem. Methods: Stomachs were removed from a mixed population of 21 horses at post mortem. Mucosal abnormalities were recorded in photographic and written form. Representative samples from all gross lesions were taken for histopathology and processed routinely. Special stains including Gram, PAS and Warthin Starry, were used when appropriate. Pathological classification of lesion type using both gross and histological appearances was performed. Results: Classification of lesions within the squamous region included hyperkeratosis, punctate scars, diffuse erosions/ulcerations and margo injuria; and within the glandular region, hyperaemia, focal erosions and ulcerations. Glandular metaplasia was recognised for the first time in the equine stomach. No Helicobacter-like organisms were detected in association with lesion development. Conclusions and potential relevance: This study used gross and histological examination to highlight the large variety of naturally occurring gastric lesions in a mixed population of horses. Analysis of the pathogenesis of lesion development is now possible. Further research regarding the range of pathology in larger, more diverse groups of horses is required. 3agastritis 3ahistopathology 3ahorses 3ahyperemia 3ahyperkeratosis 3ametaplasia 3apathogenesis 3astomach1 aThompson, H.1 aTaylor, D.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2009 Sept., v. 41, no. 7 p.638-644x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2746/042516409X4648163Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140708  aNon-US 7aarticle03624naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001900144245013600163300001600299520203800315650001502353650001002368650001502378650001402393650001302407650002302420650001302443650002302456650001102479650001702490650001302507650002402520650001402544650001502558650002302573650004202596650002402638650001302662650001902675650002302694650001602717650001902733650001402752700002402766700001802790700002002808700002102828773008402849852000902933856008402942939003303026946001103059655001203070IND4482851820221121231442.0140702e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448285182DNAL7 a10.2746/042516409X4362862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrauw, J.C. de10aIn vivo effects of meloxicam on inflammatory mediators, MMP activity and cartilage biomarkers in equine joints with acute synovitis  ap. 693-699.  aReasons for performing study: Meloxicam is a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in equine practice, but little is known about its in vivo effects on joint inflammation and cartilage turnover. Objectives: To study the effects of meloxicam on biomarkers of inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and cartilage biomarkers in joints with experimental synovitis. Methods: In a 2-period cross-over study, synovitis was induced at T = 0 h in the L or R intercarpal joint of 6 horses by intraarticular injection of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Horses received once daily meloxicam (0.6 mg/kg bwt per os) or placebo starting at post injection hour (PIH) 2, and clinical evaluations as well as blood and synovial fluid (SF) sampling were performed at PIH 0, 8, 24 and 168. Synovial fluid was analysed for prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, substance P, general MMP activity, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), CS846 epitope, type II collagen cleavage fragments (C2C) and type II collagen carboxypropeptide (CPII). Concentrations in meloxicam- vs. placebo-treated joints over time were compared using a linear mixed model. Results: Lipopolysaccharide injection caused marked transient synovitis without systemic effects. Meloxicam caused a significant reduction in lameness at PIH 8 and 24 and tended to reduce effusion. In addition, meloxicam significantly suppressed SF prostaglandin E2 and substance P release at PIH 8 and bradykinin at PIH 24 compared to placebo treatment. General MMP activity at PIH 8 and 24 was significantly lower in meloxicam- vs. placebo-treated joints, as were GAG, C2C and CPII concentrations at PIH 24. Conclusions: Acute transient synovitis leads to substantial increases in SF biomarkers of inflammation, MMP activity and cartilage turnover, which can be significantly suppressed by meloxicam. Potential relevance: Early oral treatment with meloxicam ameliorates not only clinical signs and joint inflammation in acute synovitis, but may also limit inflammation-induced cartilage catabolism. 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abradykinin 3acartilage 3acollagen 3across-over studies 3aepitopes 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3alameness 3alipopolysaccharides 3ameloxicam 3ametabolism 3ametalloproteinases 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3aprostaglandins 3astatistical models 3asubstance P 3asynovial fluid 3asynovitis1 avan de Lest, C.H.A.1 aBrama, P.A.J.1 aRambags, B.P.B.1 aWeeren, P.R. van0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2009 Sept., v. 41, no. 7 p.693-699x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2746/042516409X4362863Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140708  aNon-US 7aarticle02190naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001300128245007000141300001600211500002400227500001500251520106200266650002401328650002201352650002601374650001601400650001701416650001401433650001301447650001901460650001101479650001901490653001101509700001501520773012301535852000901658856007701667945002501744946001101769655001201780IND4361894720221121231419.0040402e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436189472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aX1001 aChen, C.10aMeasurement of gas exchange rates in plant tissue culture vessels  ap. 103-109.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aerial microenvironment in culture vessels has a significant effect on the growth and development of plantlets in vitro. Since the gas exchange between outside air and inner air can influence the microenvironment of culture vessel, it is necessary to measure the air exchange rate for various vessels. In this study, water vapor was used as the tracer gas, and the change of absolute humidity inside the vessel was calculated continuously by the measured values of a relative humidity sensing element. The outside environment was maintained at constant humidity level by a saturated salt solution. The RH data were transformed into absolute humidity and the specific humidity ratio. The air exchange rates of several tissue culture vessels were then calculated. The exchange rate was between 0.0145 h-1 to 0.0376 h-1. This technique provides an inexpensive, rapid and simple way to determine the air exchange rate of a culture vessel within a short period. The effects of the air current velocities on the exchange rates of vessels were also determined. 3amathematical models 3aplant development 3aquantitative analysis 3acell growth 3agas exchange 3aequations 3ahumidity 3acultured cells 3aoxygen 3atissue culture 0aplants1 aChen, J.J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 Nov., v. 71, no. 2 p.103-109dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001800155245015400173300001600327500002400343520116700367650002101534650001801555650002201573650001101595650001601606650001201622650002101634650001301655650002001668650000901688650001601697650002401713650000901737650001301746650001201759650002501771650001201796650006201808650005701870650002101927650003001948650005801978650006902036650002902105650004302134650008602177650000902263650000902272650001902281650006202300650000902362650002102371650002302392650003502415700002002450700001602470700002002486700001802506773010202524852000902626856003902635655001202674IND4457426620221121231311.0110429e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445742662DNAL7 a214426782pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.34802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jeong Ho10aInhibition of Experimental Atopic Dermatitis by Rhubarb (Rhizomes of Rheum tanguticum) and 5-Lipoxygenase Inhibition of its Major Constituent, Emodin  ap. 755-759.  aIncludes references  aThe antiallergic activity of rhubarb and its constituents, anthraquinones, has been reported previously. For further evaluation of the antiallergic activity, a 70% ethanol extract of the rhizomes of Rheum tanguticum (RTE) was prepared and its inhibitory activity on an animal model of atopic dermatitis (AD) was examined for the first time. Oral administration of RTE (30-300 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks significantly inhibited hapten-induced dermatitis in NC/Nga mice based on the skin severity score. In addition, treatment with RTE at 100 mg/kg/day also reduced the numbers of white blood cells, neutrophils and eosinophils in the blood, and led to a significant reduction in the IgE concentration in the serum. In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells, RTE inhibited 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-catalysed leukotriene production (IC₅₀ = 43.6 µg/mL). Among the anthraquinone derivatives isolated, emodin strongly inhibited this parameter (IC₅₀ = 4.3 µm). Taken together, these findings suggest that rhubarb exerts inhibitory activity against AD, and that the 5-LOX inhibitory activity of its major constituent, emodin, may contribute to this inhibitory action. 3aRheum tanguticum 3aanimal models 3aatopic dermatitis 3aemodin 3aeosinophils 3aethanol 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aleukemia 3aleukocyte count 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aoral administration 3arats 3arhizomes 3arhubarb 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnthraquinonesxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnti-Allergic Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBlood Cell Count 2aBlood Cellsxdrug effects 2aDermatitis, Atopicxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aEmodinxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHaptensxadverse effects 2aImmunoglobulin Exbloodxdrug effects. 2aLipoxygenase Inhibitorsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aMice 2aModels, Animal 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRheumxchemistry 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aSkinxdrug effectsxpathology.1 aNgoc, Tran Minh1 aBae, KiHwan1 aKim, Yeong Shik1 aKim, Hyun Pyo0 tPhytotherapy research.g2011 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.755-759dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3480 7aarticle03966naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245012400196300001600320500002400336506007600360520175900436506003702195650001202232650002502244650001602269650001702285650001202302650001202314650003602326650002702362650001102389650001002400650001502410650001902425650001302444650001702457650002002474650001202494650002502506650001802531650002502549650001602574650004402590650002802634650004602662650002102708650003402729650003902763650001902802650008902821650008402910650002402994700001503018700001803033700002403051700001703075773011303092852000903205856007803214655001203292IND4448175320221207124739.0110126e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444817532DNAL7 a209265512pmid7 aPMC30038132pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq3062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sheng10aSex-related differences in morphological, physiological, and ultrastructural responses of Populus cathayana to chilling  ap. 675-686.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLow temperature is one of the abiotic factors limiting plant growth and productivity. Yet, knowledge about sex-related responses to low temperature is very limited. In our study, the effects of low, non-freezing temperature on morphological, physiological, and ultrastructural traits of leaves in Populus cathayana Rehd. males and females were investigated. The results showed that 4 °C temperature caused a chilling stress, and females suffered from greater negative effects than did males. At the early growth stage of development, chilling (4 °C) significantly inhibited plant growth, decreased net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and chlorophyll pigments (Chl), and increased intercellular CO₂ concentration (Ci), chlorophyll a/b (Chl a/b), proline, soluble sugar and H₂O₂ contents, and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity in both sexes, whereas peroxidase (POD) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities decreased and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) content increased only in females. Chilling stress also caused chloroplast changes and an accumulation of numerous plastoglobules and small vesicles in both sexes. However, disintegrated chloroplasts and numerous tilted grana stacks were only found in chilling-stressed females. Under chilling stress, males showed higher Chl and soluble sugar contents, and higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), POD, and GR activities than did females. In addition, males exhibited a better chloroplast structure and more intact plasma membranes than did females under chilling stress. These results suggest that sexually different responses to chilling are significant and males possess a better self-protection mechanism than do females in P. cathayana.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPopulus 3aascorbate peroxidase 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acooling 3afemales 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3amales 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aplant growth 3aplasma membrane 3aproline 3astomatal conductance 3asugar content 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCold Temperature 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPopulusxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSpecies Specificity1 aJiang, Hao1 aPeng, Shuming1 aKorpelainen, Helena1 aLi, Chunyang0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Jan., v. 62, no. 2 p.675-686dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq3063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02453naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009000192300001800282500002400300520107600324650002001400650002301420650001201443650001701455650002201472650002401494650002401518651001401542651001601556651001401572651001601586653003901602653003901641653004101680700002301721700002001744700002101764700002101785700002301806773010201829852000901931856005501940655001201995IND4427428020221121225835.0091016e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442742802DNAL7 a197232832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiez, Jeffrey M.10aLearning from failures: testing broad taxonomic hypotheses about plant naturalization  ap. 1174-1183.  aIncludes references  aOur understanding of broad taxonomic patterns of plant naturalizations is based entirely on observations of successful naturalizations. Omission of the failures, however, can introduce bias by conflating the probabilities of introduction and naturalization. Here, we use two comprehensive datasets of successful and failed plant naturalizations in New Zealand and Australia for a unique, flora-wide comparative test of several major invasion hypotheses. First, we show that some taxa are consistently more successful at naturalizing in these two countries, despite their environmental differences. Broad climatic origins helped to explain some of the differences in success rates in the two countries. We further show that species with native relatives were generally more successful in both countries, contrary to Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, but this effect was inconsistent among families across the two countries. Finally, we show that contrary to studies based on successful naturalizations only, islands need not be inherently more invasible than continents. 3adata collection 3aindigenous species 3aislands 2aBiodiversity 2aPlant Development 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aAustralia 0aNew Zealand 0aDarwin's naturalization hypothesis 0aisland-continent invasion patterns 0ataxonomic patterns of naturalization1 aWilliams, Peter A.1 aRandall, Rod P.1 aSullivan, Jon J.1 aHulme, Philip E.1 aDuncan, Richard P.0 tEcology letters.g2009 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.1174-1183dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01376.x 7aarticle02236naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100002400137245011700161300001600278500002400294500001500318520033300333650001800666650001800684650001500702650002100717650001800738650001500756650003000771650002000801650001400821650002400835650002000859650001900879650001800898650002700916650001800943650001800961650002200979650001901001650002201020650002301042653003201065653002101097653002301118653002601141653001801167653003001185653002701215700002201242700002701264700002401291700002601315773012301341852000901464856007701473945002501550946001101575655001201586IND4361900720221121225853.0040402e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436190072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF4001 aZaldivar-Cruz, J.M.10aAgrobacterium-mediated transient transformation of annatto (Bixa orellana) hypocotyls with the gus reporter gene  ap. 281-284.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHypocotyls from annatto seedlings, were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring a binary vector, pBI.121 or pCAMBIA2301, containing the β-glucuronidase (gus) gene.

The spatial distribution of ET a was performed by means of Kriging method, and the temporal trends of ET a were investigated by the least squares linear model (linear fitted model), the Mann-Kendall method (the M-K method), Kendall τ statistical method (Kendall τ method) and the causes for the variations were discussed by means of the ‘detrended method' and SPS model. The results presented that: (i) the spatial distribution of ET a , as most of the YRB is water-limited, presented a similar spatial pattern with precipitation, which demonstrates decreasing trends from southeast to northwest; (ii) negative trends for ET a were detected by both the linear fitted model and Kendall τ method, and significant decreasing trends (at 95% confidence level) were detected in all regions of YRB; (iii) the timings of abrupt changes detected by the M-K method was 1991, 1979, 1975 and 1978 in the upper, middle, lower region and whole YRB, respectively, and so the ET a during 1961-2006 was divided into two periods: natural period and changed period (e.g. natural period (1961-1990) and changed period (1991-2006) in the upper region); and (iv) the influence of climatic change on ET a contributed to −3.10×10⁹ m³, −4.26×10⁹ m³, −15.68×10⁹ m³ and −16.62×10⁹ m³ between natural period and changed period in the upper region, middle region, lower region and whole basin of YRB, respectively. The trends of ET a , ET p and precipitation reflected that ET a is controlled by precipitation rather than ET p , especially the results presented an evidence for the Bouchet's complementary hypothesis in the middle region of YRB. 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3akriging 3aleast squares 3alinear models 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aYang, Zhifeng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Dec. 15, v. 395, no. 3-4 p.226-234dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.10.031 7aarticle03016naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001300137245012200150300001400272500002400286500001500310520141700325650001901742650001801761650002101779650001801800650001301818650002401831650001301855650002701868650002601895650001501921650000901936650001801945650001801963650001601981650001801997650001902015650001902034650001302053650002202066653001602088653002102104653003102125700001202156700001302168700001402181773012102195852000902316856007702325945002502402946001102427655001202438IND4361815520221120215240.0040330e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436181552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF1201 aYang, A.10aInduction of multiple bud clumps from inflorescence tips and regeneration of salt-tolerant plantlets in Beta vulgaris  ap. 29-34.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe developed an efficient method for sugar beet multiplication in vitro from excised immature inflorescence tips. On Murashige & Skoog medium supplemented with 4.4 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine and 1.3 micromolar naphthaleneacetic acid, multiple bud clumps were induced from segments of inflorescence tips. The clumps proliferated rapidly. By radiation of small bud clumps at an appropriate dose and by directional selection for NaCl tolerance, we obtained salt-tolerant bud clumps and regenerated plantlets. The plants were vernalized and self-pollinated. The seeds of the regenerated plants were sown in pots of sand and irrigated every day with a solution of 342 mM NaCl. Some of the seeds germinated and grew normally in the 342 mM NaCl solution, exhibiting higher salt-tolerance than the control ones; such seedlings after the saline selection were transplanted to soil and the plants grew normally and produced plump root tuber similar to controls. The seeds from two selected lines germinated and grew for a few weeks in 513 mM NaCl solution before the seedlings withered. In saline soil where the salt concentration was about 154 mM, the yields of tuber from the plants of three salt-tolerant lines were about 45-50 tons ha-1, approximately 2.6-2.9 times of the controls. It is concluded that we have got salt-tolerant materials with good agronomic traits for sugar beet breeding via selection in vitro. 3ainflorescences 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3adose response 3aexplants 3acasein hydrolysates 3agenotype 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ain vitro regeneration 3asugar beet 3abuds 3amorphogenesis 3aculture media 3asalt stress 3aBeta vulgaris 3asalt tolerance 3aplant breeding 3asalinity 3agenetic variation 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0aMurashige and Skoog medium1 aZhu, L.1 aZhao, S.1 aZhang, J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2004 Apr., v. 77, no. 1 p.29-34dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03025naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245015400154300001300308500002400321500001500345520138500360650002501745650002101770650001001791650001101801650001801812650001301830650002201843650002601865650002101891650000901912650001201921650001801933650001201951650001701963650001501980650001201995650000902007650001702016650002102033653001602054653002102070653001002091653003102101653002402132653001802156700001902174773012002193852000902313856007702322945002502399946001102424655001202435IND4361814320221120194627.0040330e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436181432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF400 0aF1201 aCapitani, F.10aExogenous calcium enhances the formation of vegetative buds, flowers and roots in tobacco pith explants cultured in the absence of exogenous hormones  ap. 1-10.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPith explants excised from the apical stem internodes of vegetative, flowering, and fruiting tobacco plants were cultured on hormone-free medium in the presence or absence of CaCl2 (3 mM). The aim was to determine the role of exogenous calcium (Ca2+), applied at the concentration normally present in the Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium, in organ formation obtainable in the absence of the exogenous hormonal input. Exclusive formation of vegetative buds was obtained from explants excised from vegetative plants (pure vegetative programme); vegetative buds and flowers (and occasionally roots) on the same sample were obtained from explants from flowering plants (mixed flowering programme); whereas roots, very occasionally associated with vegetative buds and flowers on the same sample, were obtained from explants from fruiting plants (mixed rooting programme). Histological analysis showed that the organs always exhibited indirect regeneration. Exogenous Ca2+ promoted the formation of meristemoids and the first phases of their growth into organs, but did not change the realization of the organogenic programme and did not affect callogenesis. Instead, the influence of exogenous Ca2+ changed with the programme, when considering the last phases of organ growth (i.e., macroscopic development and elongation), and the appearance of morphological anomalies in the organs. 3adevelopmental stages 3amicropropagation 3aroots 3acallus 3adose response 3aexplants 3aNicotiana tabacum 3ain vitro regeneration 3aapical meristems 3abuds 3acalcium 3aculture media 3atobacco 3arhizogenesis 3ainternodes 3aflowers 3apith 3acaulogenesis 3aplant morphology 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0astems 0aMurashige and Skoog medium 0aHormone-free medium 0aplant anatomy1 aAltamura, M.M.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2004 Apr., v. 77, no. 1 p.1-10dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle04012naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001500146245015100161300001600312500002400328500001500352520223300367650002702600650002502627650001602652650002202668650002002690650002602710650002502736650001102761650003002772650001402802650001802816650002602834650001802860650002502878650002602903650002102929650002102950650001302971650001502984650002002999651001003019653002703029653002303056653001803079653003203097700001503129700001603144700001803160773009303178852000903271856007003280945002503350946001103375655001203386IND4361784820221120234546.0040326e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436178482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aM001 0aL6001 aFarias, A.10aPolyunsaturated fatty acids in total lipid and phospholipids of chilean scallop Argopecten purpuratus (L.) larvae: effects of diet and temperature  ap. 289-305.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe composition of lipids and fatty acids of larval scallop Argopecten purpuratus were determined when cultured at one of two temperatures and using one of the three algal diets. Larvae grown at 12°C had the lowest values of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and highest values of cholesterol and steryl esters (SE). The ratio of triacylglycerol (TAG)/cholesterol was affected by temperature but not by diet and the lowest values were observed in larvae grown at 12°C. By using the ratio of TAG/cholesterol as an index of larval condition, the best condition was observed at the begining of the experiment, before feeding, with values of 3.9 and 2.9 in eggs and D-larvae, respectively. The best culture conditions for larval scallop from this point of view was a temperature of 19°C and a diet of Isochrysis galbana grown at 25°C while the poorest condition was observed in larvae cultured at 12°C and 19°C and fed the mixture of Isochrysis aff galbana (clone T-Iso) high-protein and Chaetoceros neogracile high-protein (IH/GH diet). However, no significant differences in the growth rate and survival of larvae fed different diets were detected. I. galbana grown at 25°C had no detectable percentage of arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4n-6), but larvae grew well and ARA was detected in PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in similar quantities to other diets. This suggests ARA may not be essential during early life stages of larval Chilean scallops. Total lipids and PC of larvae were affected by the diet in their ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), but PE composition was highly conserved and was unaffected by diet. DHA/EPA ratio in total lipid and in PC showed highest values when larvae were fed I. galbana grown at 25°C. Temperature affected the total highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in total lipids, PC and PE of larvae. In all cases values were lowest when larvae were cultured at 12°C. In addition, increased temperature increased the ratio of EPA/ARA in PC and decreased the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)/saturated fatty acids in PE. The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA was constant in total lipid, PE and PC of larval scallops regardless of temperature or diet. 3afatty acid composition 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aChaetoceros 3awater temperature 3aprotein sources 3anutrient requirements 3astatistical analysis 3alarvae 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3amortality 3alipid content 3aArgopecten purpuratus 3aanimal growth 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3abody composition 3ascallops 3amicroalgae 3amollusc culture 3aChile 0aChaetoceros neogracile 0aIsochrysis galbana 0aphospholipids 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aBell, J.G.1 aUriarte, I.1 aSargent, J.R.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Dec. 1, v. 228, no. 1-4 p.289-305dElsevier Pub.

Puroindoline, a wheat protein which binds starch granule surfaces, contains a unique tryptophan-rich domain likely responsible for this property, though direct evidence is lacking. To test puroindoline’s tight association, prime starch granule extracts were water-washed 8 or 20 times and residual puroindoline removed using a solution of 50% isopropanol/50 mM NaCl. We found that this solvent was consistent in the amount of protein extracted from wheat flour and washed starch, regardless of initial protein content. Relative quantification of puroindoline following water-washing was performed using dot blot. Washing more than 8 times did not further reduce puroindoline content of starch granules suggesting a strong association with the starch granule surface. To identify the tryptophan-rich domain tightly associated with the starch granule surface, a combination of in situ tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry was used. Following digestion and water-washing, 50% isopropanol/50 mM NaCl was used to remove tightly-associated peptides for identification by mass spectrometry. Using this method, we identified the tryptophan-rich domain of puroindoline directly bound to the starch granule surface of wheat. 3adigestion 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3asodium chloride 3astarch granules 3awashing 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awheat protein1 aWheeler, H.L.1 aHuebsch, M.P.1 aSmith, J.C.1 aFigeys, D.1 aAltosaar, I.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Sept., v. 52, no. 2 p.115-120dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02559naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012000166300001600286500002400302520137000326650002201696650001601718650002201734650001801756650001201774650001701786650001401803650002601817650001301843650001501856650001501871650003301886650002001919650001001939700001801949773010001967852000902067856008502076655001202161IND4443288520221120234537.0101005s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444328852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2010.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlazek, Jaroslav10aAmylolysis of wheat starches. II. Degradation patterns of native starch granules with varying functional properties  ap. 295-302.  aIncludes references  aScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate degradation patterns of native starch granules from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by different starch-degrading enzymes. The starches examined were from a waxy wheat and four varieties with slightly elevated amylose content, but with different functional properties. Differences in the digestion patterns after partial α-amylolysis of starch granules were noted between the starches. The waxy starch seemed to be degraded by endocorrosion, whereas the amylose-rich starches followed a slower mode of hydrolysis starting from the granular surface. X-ray diffractograms of the amylose-rich starches were not significantly altered by 2 h of α-amylolysis, whereas partial hydrolysis of the waxy starch decreased scattering intensity at higher 2θ angles, consistent with a different mode of attack by α-amylase in the initial digestion stages of granules of waxy and amylose-rich starches. We propose these differences are due to the combined effects of the change in packing density and partial preference for hydrolysis of amorphous material. The native starch granules were also attacked by beta-amylase, isoamylase and amyloglucosidase, which indicates that α-amylase is not the only starch-degrading enzyme that is able to initiate starch hydrolysis of native granules. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalpha-amylase 3aamylose 3abeta-amylase 3adigestion 3afunctional properties 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3aisoamylase 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules 3awheat1 aCopeland, Les0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Sept., v. 52, no. 2 p.295-302dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.06.0113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02612naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008200160300001600242500002400258520137900282650001801661650001101679650001701690650001801707650001601725650002101741650002001762650002801782650001801810650001701828650000901845650001101854650000701865650002201872650001401894650001401908650001601922700001801938700001601956773010001972852000902072856008502081655001202166IND4443289320221120205036.0101005s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444328932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2010.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaquet, E.10aEffect of xanthan gum on the degradation of cereal β-glucan by ascorbic acid  ap. 260-262.  aIncludes references  aOat and barley β-glucans are polysaccharides known for their beneficial effects on glycemia and cholesterol. These physiological effects seem to be related to increased viscosity in the digestive tract. It has recently been shown that free radicals derived from the reaction of ascorbic acid and oxygen can cause a viscosity loss in β-glucan due to depolymerization through the Fenton reaction. However, recent studies have reported a synergistic effect between xanthan gum and β-glucan on viscosity in heat-treated fruit juices. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if xanthan gum has a protective effect against OH radical-induced depolymerization of β-glucan by ascorbic acid. Oat β-glucan (0.4%) solutions were studied in water at pH 4. Ascorbic acid concentrations and viscosity profiles were measured over a period of 56 days. The addition of ascorbic acid caused a rapid decrease in β-glucan viscosity. The presence of xanthan gum reduced the viscosity loss (p ≤ 0.0001) but did not provide complete protection for β-glucan over time. Therefore, incorporation of β-glucan in food formulations still presents a challenge in ensuring its physical and nutritional stability in the final product. The use of OH radical scavengers such as sugars and antioxidant compounds could be used in addition to xanthan gum to obtain improved protection. 3aascorbic acid 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3adepolymerization 3adigestive tract 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3afruit juices 3aoats 3aoxygen 3apH 3aprotective effect 3asynergism 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum1 aTurgeon, S.L.1 aLemieux, S.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Sept., v. 52, no. 2 p.260-262dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02004naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245004600162300001600208500002400224520105800248650002701306650001201333650002001345650001901365650001901384650000901403650001001412650001601422700001601438700001801454773010001472852000901572856008501581655001201666IND4443289920221120205154.0101005s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444328992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2010.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariotti, M.10aAlkali spreading value and Image Analysis  ap. 227-235.  aIncludes references  aSince its first appearance, the alkali test has been extensively employed in rice quality studies as an indirect estimation of the gelatinisation temperature and the cooking quality. Nevertheless, the modifications brought to this method during the years focused on the experimental conditions of the test without taking into account the subjective interpretation of the results. The aim of this study was the search for a reasonable substitute for the human visual decision-making process implicated in the alkali test and, in particular, for a digital image analysis method involving the use of a flatbed scanner (easy to use and available at low cost) to quantitatively measure the degree of dispersion of rice kernels during the test. Significant correlations were found between a new index, the rice kernel disintegration area, obtained from Image Analysis, and the alkali spreading value (r = 0.942, P ≤ 0.01), the amylose content (r = −0.855, P ≤ 0.01) and the micro-visco-amylographic gelatinisation temperature (r = −0.928, P ≤ 0.01). 3aalkali spreading value 3aamylose 3adecision making 3agelatinization 3aimage analysis 3arice 3aseeds 3atemperature1 aFongaro, L.1 aCatenacci, F.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Sept., v. 52, no. 2 p.227-235dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.05.0113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02034naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245008100162300001600243500002400259520108200283650001101365650002201376650002001398650001601418650001201434700001401446700001401460700001801474700001701492773010101509852000901610856008901619655001201708IND4478186120221120174215.0140307s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447818612DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00253-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUgur, F.10aGrowth and behavioral traits of Turkish Saanen kids weaned at 45 and 60 days  ap. 179-184.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of weaning age on various growth characteristics and behavioral traits of Turkish Saanen kids was investigated. The kids were weaned at 45 and 60 days of age. The body weights, body measurements and behavioral traits were monitored during the experimental period. The average daily live weight gains of the kids in both of the treatment groups were similar between weaning and 4 months of age, and birth and 4 months of age. Weaning age influenced roughage and water consumption, and lying. Although there were no difference between the two groups in terms of growth characteristics, kids in 45-day group consumed more roughage than those in 60-day group. Because of a 15-day difference between the two weaning practices, the kids, weaned at 45 days of age seemed more experienced and spent the rest of their spare time lying. The results of the present study indicated that no significant differences were found in the growth and behavioral traits of Turkish Saanen kids, weaned at 45 or 60 days of age, and suggested that kids could be weaned at 45 days of age. 3aSaanen 3abody measurements 3aliveweight gain 3aparturition 3aweaning1 aSavas, T.1 aDosay, M.1 aKarabayir, A.1 aAtasoglu, C.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Apr., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.179-184dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00253-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02395naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008600162300001800248500002400266500001500290520118800305650001901493650001801512650001401530650001501544650001501559650002201574650001301596650000701609650001301616650001501629650001301644651001901657653001601676700001701692700002401709700001701733700002401750773009301774852000901867856008501876655001201961IND4443656920221120174210.0101015s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444365692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1513-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCigliano, M.10aEffects of ocean acidification on invertebrate settlement at volcanic CO₂ vents  ap. 2489-2502.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe present the first study of the effects of ocean acidification on settlement of benthic invertebrates and microfauna. Artificial collectors were placed for 1 month along pH gradients at CO₂ vents off Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). Seventy-nine taxa were identified from six main taxonomic groups (foraminiferans, nematodes, polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans and chaetognaths). Calcareous foraminiferans, serpulid polychaetes, gastropods and bivalves showed highly significant reductions in recruitment to the collectors as pCO₂ rose from normal (336-341 ppm, pH 8.09-8.15) to high levels (886-5,148 ppm) causing acidified conditions near the vents (pH 7.08-7.79). Only the syllid polychaete Syllis prolifera had higher abundances at the most acidified station, although a wide range of polychaetes and small crustaceans was able to settle and survive under these conditions. A few taxa (Amphiglena mediterranea, Leptochelia dubia, Caprella acanthifera) were particularly abundant at stations acidified by intermediate amounts of CO₂ (pH 7.41-7.99). These results show that increased levels of CO₂ can profoundly affect the settlement of a wide range of benthic organisms. 3acarbon dioxide 3aacidification 3aCrustacea 3aGastropoda 3aPolychaeta 3abenthic organisms 3amolluscs 3apH 3aNematoda 3acollectors 3aBivalvia 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0arecruitment1 aGambi, M.

The animals were given a ration containing 25% cottonseed meal, whilst the farmer complained of significantly reduced milk yield. Various clinically detectable abnormalities were found in the mammary glands; the California mastitis test (CMT) performed was always positive (≥1). Bacterial species isolated from mammary secretion samples were cnS (n=54), Staphylococcus aureus (n=5), Bacillus spp. (n=5), Escherichia coli (n=3) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (n=2). During the post mortem examination, pathological findings characteristic of rumen acidosis were found in the mammary gland, macroscopic and histological lesions characteristic of chronic mastitis were seen. Bacteria (cnS, n=23; Bacillus spp., n=3; S. aureus, n=2; E. coli, n=2) were also isolated from mammary tissue samples. Gossypol was detected in pooled milk samples collected from the ewes. A hypothetical model involving the high prevalence rate of staphylococcal mastitis with the increased dietary intake of gossypol is proposed. 3aArcanobacterium pyogenes 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3acase studies 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3acottonseed meal 3adairy sheep 3aewes 3aflocks 3agossypol 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aruminal acidosis 3aCalifornia1 aLeontides, L.1 aSkoufos, J.1 aTaitzoglou, I.A.1 aTzora, A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Apr., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.185-189dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00232-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02857naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245013400167300001400301500002400315520153500339650002001874650002701894650001101921650001201932650001001944650001201954650001801966650001901984650002302003650002802026650002002054650001902074650002002093650001102113650001202124651001902136700002302155700001902178700001702197773009902214852000902313856008902322655001202411IND4478181020221120174219.0140307s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447818102DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00225-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentura, M.R.10aNutritive value of forage shrubs: Bituminaria bituminosa, Rumex lunaria, Acacia salicina, Cassia sturtii and Adenocorpus foliosus  ap. 13-18.  aIncludes references  aThe nutritive value of three forage shrubs endemic from Canary Islands (Bituminaria bituminosa, Rumex lunaria, Adenocorpus foliosus) and two introduced shrubs (Acacia salicina, Cassia sturtii) was studied along the year. Mean organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and protein content (g kg-1 dry matter (DM)) of four cuts along the year was, respectively, 910, 424 and 184 for B. bituminosa, 865, 329 and 149 for R. lunaria, 955, 452 and 159 for A. foliosus, 879, 412 and 123 for A. salicina, 937, 390 and 102 for C. sturtii. Mean calcium content (kg-1 DM) was the highest for A. salicina (25.1 g), the lowest for A. foliosus (3.2 g), and moderate for the others (range 10.4-14.3 g). Mean phosphorus content of shrubs ranged 1.5-2.8 g kg-1 DM. Mean tannin content (g catequins kg-1 DM) was the highest for C. sturtii and R. lunaria (0.63 and 0.54 g, respectively) and moderate for A. salicina (0.24 g), while B. bituminosa and A. foliosus had only traces of tannins.

Two experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) were conducted in two consecutive years, with Aberdeen Angus heifers grazing continuously OP. In Exp 1, 24 heifers (204 kg initial-weight) were grazing 55 days. The treatments were: unsupplemented control (CON1), or 2 kg per animal per day of ground corn (CORN1), or 75% ground corn + 25% corn gluten meal (C-GM). In Exp 1 herbage mass of OP decreased from 1777 to 1209 kg dry matter (DM)/ha from July to September. The DM concentration averaged 296 g/kg of fresh OP, and crude protein (CP) was below 100 g/kg DM; initially NPN was 47% of CP, decreasing later. Ca increased with time from 3.5 to 6.0 g/kg DM, the other minerals were not affected by date. The ratio K/(Ca+Mg) was high on July (3.80 meq/kg DM) and decreased in August to September (2.73 and 1.94, respectively). Average daily gain (ADG) averaged 921 g per day for C-GM versus 670, 759 for CON and CORN1, respectively. A non-significant decrease in rumen pH was detected for CORN1 (mean of 6.26). Rumen NH(3)-N was not affected by treatment, being the highest value 4.44 mg/dl in September (P<0.05). Plasma levels of Ca and Na were normal and not affected by treatment or date; Mg and K showed higher levels for CORN1 and C-GM versus CON1, K and P increased with date (P<0.05). In Exp 2, 36 heifers (192 kg-initial weight) were grazing OP during 140 days. Treatments in Exp 2 were: unsupplemented control (CON2), ground corn (CORN2) and alfalfa hay (AH). The animals did not reach the targeted intake level for supplements. Thus, daily intakes resulted 1.57 and 1.06 kg per animal for CORN2 and AH. In Exp 2, herbage mass was 1600-1700 kg/ha in May to September, decreasing in October. The lowest DM content was 20 g/kg of fresh OP in May to June, increasing in July. Initial CP was the highest (164 g/kg DM), it dropped in July increasing again in October; NPN content was 28% of CP in May, decreasing in October. Ca content raised from 3.6 g/kg DM in May to 6.0 g/kg DM in October. K decreased but Mg, P and Na have not changed their concentrations with time. The ratio K/(Ca+Mg) for OP was highest on May (6.23 meq/100 g DM), decreasing in October. ADG for CORN was 872 g, higher (P<0.05) than 718 g (CON2) or 781 g (AH). No differences were found for ruminal pH (mean=6.8); but for ruminal NH(3)-N the highest value was for AH (3.35 mg/dl), also varying with sampling date (P<0.05). Plasma levels of Ca and K decreased with time, being in July 8.76 and 19.22 mg/dl, respectively (P<0.05). Mg was not affected by either treatment or sampling date, P was higher for CORN2=7.91 mg/dl. Na levels were larger for CON2 and AH than for CON2, with 272, 282 and 256 mg/dl, respectively (P<0.05). Animal performance was improved by both energy and escape protein supplementation. However, treatments did not appear to modify to a great extent ruminal fermentation patterns or have any effect on blood mineral levels. 3aAngus 3aalfalfa hay 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3ablood 3ablood composition 3acalcium 3acorn 3acorn gluten meal 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3aforage 3agrazing 3aheifers 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3aoats 3apH 3apastures 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein supplements 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3asodium1 aArzadún, M.J.1 aLaborde, H.E.1 aVasquez, M.G.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2003 Mar. 31, v. 105, no. 1-4 p.29-42dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0377-8401(03)00045-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03714naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245014700169300001300316500002400329520243100353650001602784650001602800650001402816650002402830650001602854650001102870650001402881650000702895650001002902650002102912650001102933650001102944700001802955700002102973700002102994700001703015700001903032700001803051773011303069852000903182856008903191655001203280IND4478180820221120174314.0140307s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447818082DNAL7 a10.1016/S0377-8401(03)00057-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlevesahl, E.A.10aEffect of a wide range in the ratio of supplemental rumen degradable protein to starch on utilization of low-quality, grass hay by beef steers  ap. 5-20.  aIncludes references  aHereford×Angus steers were used in a 14-treatment, 2-period, crossover design experiment to examine effects of a wide range in the ratio of supplemental starch to rumen degradable protein (RDP) on low-quality forage utilization and ruminal characteristics. Steers were given ad libitum access to grass hay (4.9% CP, 42.4% ruminally degradable) and supplemented in a 2×7 factorial arrangement of treatments. All supplements were administered directly into the rumen and delivered one of two levels of ruminally degradable starch (cornstarch grits; 0 and 0.3% of initial BW) and one of seven levels of RDP (sodium caseinate; 0, 0.015, 0.051, 0.087, 0.123, 0.159, and 0.195% of initial BW). Supplementation with RDP increased consumption of forage OM, total OM, NDF, and digestible OM in a quadratic (P<0.01) fashion (intake increased and then declined). Starch supplementation depressed (P<0.01) forage OM and NDF intakes. In general, RDP supplementation elicited a positive quadratic response on NDF digestion (P=0.02). However, an interaction between supplemental starch and RDP level was observed (P<0.01) for NDF digestion. At the four lowest levels of supplemental RDP, starch supplementation substantially reduced NDF digestion, although for steers receiving the three highest levels of supplemental RDP, starch supplementation had little effect on NDF digestion. In contrast, neither the starch×RDP interaction nor the starch main effect was significant for OM digestion, which increased linearly (P<0.01) with supplemental RDP. Supplementation with RDP altered passage rate of acid detergent insoluble ash in a quadratic (P=0.05) manner that paralleled the intake response. However, liquid passage rate was not affected significantly. A decline in ruminal pH was associated (P=0.02) with increasing supplemental RDP and tended (P=0.07) to be associated with increasing starch, but it was not requisite for starch-induced depressions in NDF digestion. Ruminal NH(3) concentration increased in response to increasing RDP, although the increase when starch was supplemented was less than that observed without starch (P=0.03). Supplemental starch generally elicited negative effects on low-quality forage intake and fiber digestion, but the effects on fiber digestion were overridden by adequate supplemental RDP. Supplemental RDP exerted a highly positive effect on consumption and digestion of this low-quality forage. 3abeef cattle 3acorn starch 3adigestion 3aexperimental design 3afeed intake 3aforage 3agrass hay 3apH 3arumen 3asodium caseinate 3astarch 3asteers1 aCochran, R.C.1 aTitgemeyer, E.C.1 aWickersham, T.A.1 aFarmer, C.G.1 aArroquy., J.I.1 aJohnson, D.E.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2003 Mar. 31, v. 105, no. 1-4 p.5-20dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0377-8401(03)00057-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02225naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002000161245010400181300001800285500002400303520125700327650004301584650001701627650001701644700001901661700002001680700002001700773011201720852000901832856008201841655001201923IND4442693520221120174226.0100917s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444269352DNAL7 a208062382pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010002512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Jared S.10aPhysical characterization and evaluation of HPLC columns packed with superficially porous particles  ap. 2547-2557.  aIncludes references  aTwo HPLC columns packed with superficially porous packing material (Kinetex[trade mark sign] 1.7 and 2.6 μm C18 particles) were evaluated in terms of their physical properties and performance characteristics.

The columns packed with superficially porous particles displayed a comparably narrower size distribution, which is narrower than the distribution of the totally porous sub-2 μm particles. Physical characteristics of the Kinetex[trade mark sign] particles were evaluated in terms of surface area, pore diameter, and specific pore volume. Total, external, internal, and shell porosities among the four different columns were evaluated and compared. The specific permeability for the Kinetex[trade mark sign] columns showed values close to those predicted by the Kozeny-Carman equation. All four columns were evaluated in terms of their chromatographic performance and compared using the Knox equation.

In a local goat breed reared in the North East of Sicily, "Argentata dell’Etna", the combined use of electrophoretic milk analysis (SDS-PAGE) and 11th exon genomic analysis (PCR-RFLP) made it possible to identify three genotypes respectively normal (CSN1S2)(NN)), heterozygote for the null allele (CSN1S2(NO)) and homozygote for the null allele (CSN1S2(OO)). In 214 "Argentata dell'Etna" goats, CSN1S2(O) allele has shown a frequency of 0.033. An immunological test, REAST-inhibition assay (REAST, reverse enzyme allergo sorbent test), was carried out on three lyophilized milk samples (casein and seroprotein fractions) produced by goats with different genotypes at CSN1S2 locus, in order to assess their allergenic potency. By comparing the C(50), the casein fraction CSN1S2(NN) turned out to be the most allergenic, followed by the fraction CSN1S2(OO) with 60% potency compared to the first one, while the fraction CSN1S2(NO) presented 54% potency compared to the first one. 3aallergenicity 3aalphaS2-casein 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agoat milk 3agoats 3aloci 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3anitric oxide 3anull alleles 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein composition 3aSicily1 aBordonaro, S.1 aGuastella, A.M.1 aFalagiani, P.1 aCrimi, N.1 aD'Urso, G.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Apr., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.19-24dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00226-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02817naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002000153245005000173300001600223500002400239520155900263650002401822650002501846650001201871650001001883650001101893650002201904650002001926650001901946650001201965650002601977650002402003650002402027700002002051700001702071700001702088700002102105700001402126700001502140700001502155773009902170852000902269856009302278655001202371IND4478180020221120164724.0140307s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447818002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorand-Fehr, P.10aStrategy for goat farming in the 21st century  ap. 175-183.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this paper is to contribute to progress in the choices of strategies for further development of goat farming in the 21st century. During the last 20 years, the number of goats around the world increased (by about 60%) not only in the countries with low income (75%) but also in those with high (20%) or intermediate (25%) income. This situation is due to the capacity for adaptation by goats to very different environments, to the development of goat farming in developing countries where subsistence farming, barter economy and community culture are important, and where the market economy is relatively limited, and to the ecological image of goat farming and products in developed countries. Goat farming is in a good position to pursue its development in the 21st century, if a satisfactory policy is applied tactfully. For that, the factors explaining goat farming success during the end of the 20th century must be maintained and developed as the social aspects of goat farming in developing and developed countries, particularly in land management and the sociological integration into an economically sustainable life. Moreover we have to improve or maintain the good image of goat products. The two main improvements to bring into goat farming in the 21st century concern research organisations, which must encounter the needs of goat farmers and be well adapted to different production systems in order to lower the research deficit in the goat sector, and investments for better supplies particularly to the poor goat farmers. 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3agoats 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3amarket economy 3amarkets 3aproduction technology 3aresearch management 3asubsistence farming1 aBoutonnet, J.P.1 aDevandra, C.1 aDubeuf, J.P.1 aHaenlein, G.F.W.1 aHolst, P.1 aMowlem, L.1 aCapote, J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.175-183dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.08.0133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02697naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245013400173300001400307500002400321520149000345650002501835650002301860650001801883650001901901650001001920650001201930650001301942650001101955650000901966650001501975650001601990650001602006651001002022700001902032700002102051700001802072773009902090852000902189856008902198655001202287IND4478182520221120164601.0140307s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447818252DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00223-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, Douglas J.10aGoat weight gains, forage selectivity and forage quality dynamics in three cultivated warm season pastures in north-central Texas  ap. 53-62.  aIncludes references  aCultivated warm-season pastures are needed to compliment range-based goat production in south central USA. Boer×Spanish does averaging 25 kg were evaluated to determine average daily gain (ADG) and selectivity for six legumes, redroot pigweed, and crabgrass grown in full-sun grass-only, full-sun mixed, and pecan grove shaded mixed paddocks during two warm seasons. Goats in the mixed pasture obtained the highest (100 g per day) and the grass-only pasture goats the lowest ADG (27 g per day) during the low rainfall year (year×pasture interaction P=0.05). The animals in both the shaded mixed and grass-only paddocks had greater ADG whereas mixed pasture animals were unchanged the second, higher rainfall year, indicating that there was competition for moisture between the herbaceous forages and the pecan trees when rainfall was low and that crabgrass monocultures require more soil moisture to maintain animal gains. Grass percentage composition increased over time for all treatments in both years. Legume percentage composition decreased over time for both mixed pasture treatments in both years, indicating goat selection for this component. Forbs tended to survive longer in mixed pasture than in the shaded mixed pasture while the grass component tended to increase in both paddocks with time. Herbage analyses indicated that crude protein (CP) tended to decrease over time while acid detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin increased, at least partially due to animal selection. 3aacid detergent fiber 3aaverage daily gain 3acrude protein 3aforage quality 3agoats 3alegumes 3apastures 3apecans 3arain 3asoil water 3awarm season 3aweight gain 3aTexas1 aMuir, James P.1 aWittie, Roger D.1 aBrown, Tim F.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Apr., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.53-62dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00223-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02428naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002700161245012700188300001800315500002400333520125400357650001101611650001501622650001301637650004301650650000701693650001401700650001601714700003401730700003401764700003801798700002701836773011201863852000901975856008201984655001202066IND4442695220221120164527.0100917s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444269522DNAL7 a206657652pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010000362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoguerol-Cal, Rosalía10aLiquid chromatographic methods to analyze hindered amines light stabilizers (HALS) levels to improve safety in polyolefins  ap. 2698-2706.  aIncludes references  aA chromatographic method using ultra performance LC with ultraviolet spectrophotometry detection system (UPLC-UV-visible (UV/Vis)) (UPLC, ultra performance LC) was developed to determine Chimassorb 944 and Tinuvin 770, high- and low-molecular mass hindered amine light stabilizers, respectively. The use of a bridge ethylene hybrid-based particles C₁₈ UPLC column, being compatible with a buffered mobile phase adjusted to pH 11.5, was used to achieve a satisfactory elution of possible non-ionizated units of polymeric Chimassorb 944. In addition, a HPLC with positive ion mode ESI and hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ) Fourier transform (FT) Orbitrap MS detection system (HPLC-UV/Vis-ESI-LTQ(FT)Orbitrap) was used for screening and identification purposes. Reliable determinations of monomeric units of Chimassorb 944 and molecule of Tinuvin 770 were achieved by HPLC-ESI(+)-LTQ FT Orbitrap MS method using scan mode. Quality parameters of UPLC-UV/Vis method were evaluated. Obtained LODs and LOQs were 3.41 and 11.4 mg/L for Tinuvin 770 and 0.83 and 2.78 mg/L for Chimassorb 944, respectively. Satisfactory quality parameters of this chromatography method provided the chance to count on a good tool to know the compliance with legal requirements. 3aamines 3acompliance 3aethylene 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apH 3ascreening 3astabilizers1 aLópez-Vilariño, Jose Manuel1 aFernández-Martínez, Gerardo1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, M.

There were 50 pullets for each strain. The pullets were housed in single bird cages and monitored for egg number and egg weight. The egg numbers were summarized on monthly basis for four months while egg weights were recorded at first egg, 30 and 40 weeks respectively. The results indicate that the repeatability estimates for monthly egg numbers ranged from 0.12-0.85 in strain 1 and 0.05-0.62 in strain 2. The repeatability estimates for egg numbers for the four months taken together were low in strain 1 (R = 0.17) and strain 2 (R = 0.07). The repeatability estimates for weight of first egg, egg weight at 30 and 40 weeks were generally low in the two strains of chicken and ranged from 0.04-0.19. The only exception was egg weight at 40 weeks in strain I (R = 0.44). The low repeatability estimates recorded for most of the traits imply that collection of additional records and improvement of non genetic factors influencing egg production will improve the accuracy of characterizing the inherent transmitting ability of the birds in these traits. 3aestimation 3alaying hens 3achicken breeds 3afecundity 3agenetic improvement 3afemale fertility 3aegg weight 3aselection criteria 3areproductive traits 3alaying performance 3aegg production 3arepeatability 3aheritability 3aclutch size 0aH and N Brown Nick (chicken breed) 0aBlack Olympia (chicken breed) 0aegg quality0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2010, v. 9, no. 7 p.675-677x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/9(7).htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/09/25  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03300naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245013900167300001800306500002400324500001500348520178500363650002702148650001302175650001202188650001302200650002302213650001402236650003102250650001102281650001102292650001402303650001402317650002502331650001302356651001102369653001102380700001902391700001802410700001802428700001502446700002202461700001602483700002002499700002002519700002102539700002302560773009302583852000902676856008502685655001202770IND4443657520221120182431.0101015s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444365752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1519-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuérouil, Sophie10aMolecular insight into the population structure of common and spotted dolphins inhabiting the pelagic waters of the Northeast Atlantic  ap. 2567-2580.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSeveral cetacean species exhibit fine-scale population structure despite their high dispersal capacities and the apparent continuity of the marine environment. In dolphins, most studies have focused on coastal areas and continental margins, and they revealed differentiated populations within relatively small geographic areas, sometimes in conjunction with a specialisation for different habitats (ecotypes). We analysed the population genetic structure of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) in the Azores and Madeira, the two most isolated archipelagos of the North Atlantic. The archipelago of the Azores is divided into three groups of islands and stands 900 km away from Madeira. It is not known whether individuals migrate between groups of islands and archipelagos, nor whether distinct ecotypes are present. These questions were investigated by genetic analyses of 343 biopsy samples collected on free-ranging dolphins. The analyses consisted in sequencing part of the mitochondrial hyper-variable region, screening up to 14 microsatellite loci, and molecular sexing. Results did not unravel any population structure at the scale of the study area. Lack of differentiation matches expectations for spotted dolphins, which are transient in both archipelagos, but not for common dolphins, which are present year-round in the Azores and potentially resident. Absence of genetic structure over hundreds and even thousands of kilometres implies the existence of gene flow over much larger distances than usually documented in small delphinids, which could be achieved through individual movements. This finding indicates that population structure in oceanic habitat differs from that observed in coastal habitat. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3adolphins 3aislands 3aecotypes 3amarine environment 3agene flow 3asex determination analysis 3acoasts 3abiopsy 3aDelphinus 3ascreening 3apopulation structure 3ahabitats 3aAzores 0asexing1 aFreitas, Luís1 aCascão, Irma1 aAlves, Filipe1 aDinis, Ana1 aAlmeida, Joana R.1 aPrieto, Rui1 aBorràs, Silvia1 aMatos, José A.1 aMendonça, Diogo1 aSantos, Ricardo S.0 tMarine biology.g2010 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2567-2580dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1519-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02798naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100003100146245011900177300001600296500002400312520135700336650001201693650001601705650002501721650001301746650001801759650001201777650001301789650002901802650002001831650002601851650001001877650001901887651001101906700002501917700003001942700002301972700002201995700001602017700003302033700002302066700002902089773011502118852000902233856008602242655001202328IND4444210520221120161912.0101028s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444421052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2009.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuevara-Figueroa, Teresita10aProximate composition, phenolic acids, and flavonoids characterization of commercial and wild nopal (Opuntia spp.)  ap. 525-532.  aIncludes references  aThe proximate composition, phenolic acid, and flavonoid characterization of two commercial and eight wild Opuntia spp., as well two processed products, were analyzed. Commercial varieties were obtained from a local market; wild varieties were collected from the Central and High Plateau zones of Mexico, and Opuntia tablets were purchased at a natural commodities store. Spines from fresh cladodes were removed and clean cladodes were freeze-dried and milled to obtain nopal powder. Differences in proximate composition were determined: wild nopal blanco collected from the High Plateau had the highest protein content, while tapon-II had the highest fiber content. Nopal tablets had low protein and carbohydrate content but had the highest ash content. The wild morado, tempranillo, blanco, and cristalino varieties had the highest total phenolic acid content, while the commercial varieties had the highest total flavonoid contents. Very low amounts of flavonoids were found in nopal tablets. LC-MS/MS was used to identify six phenolic acids (gallic, coumaric, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic, and salicylic acid), and only tapon-II contained all six. The five flavonoids (iso-quercitrin, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, nicotiflorin, rutin, and narcissin) were found in all varieties; nicotiflorin was predominant, followed by narcissin. 3aOpuntia 3aash content 3acarbohydrate content 3acladodes 3afiber content 3amarkets 3aplateaus 3aproducts and commodities 3aprotein content 3aproximate composition 3arutin 3asalicylic acid 3aMexico1 aJiménez-Islas, Hugo1 aReyes-Escogido, María L.1 aMortensen, Anne G.1 aLaursen, Bente B.1 aLin, Li-Wei1 aLeón-Rodríguez, Antonio de1 aFomsgaard, Inge S.1 aBarba de la Rosa, Ana P.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2010 Sept., v. 23, no. 6 p.525-532dAcademic PresswJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2009.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03317naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245012300169300001600292500002400308520163100332650002101963650001801984650002202002650002202024650001502046650001502061650002802076650001802104650001202122650001202134650002202146650001202168650001802180650001102198650002802209650001702237650000902254650001402263650001402277650002102291650001402312650002302326650002002349650001102369650001202380650001402392650000902406700002602415700002002441700002102461700001702482773013302499852000902632856008602641655001202727IND4444210820221120162012.0101028s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444421082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2010.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUusiku, Nangula P.10aNutritional value of leafy vegetables of sub-Saharan Africa and their potential contribution to human health: A review  ap. 499-509.  aIncludes references  aThis paper reviews the literature on African leafy vegetables (ALVs) consumed in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim is to evaluate the nutritional value of these plant species and their potential impact on the nutritional status of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Processing and the presence of antinutritional factors are taken into consideration as they adversely affect the nutritional content of the ALVs. The role of dietary fiber and other important components found in ALVs is also discussed due to their importance in the prevention of chronic and lifestyle diseases. Many of the ALVs are good sources of micronutrients, especially Manihot esculenta which contains 1970 μg retinol equivalents/100 g edible portion and 311 mg/100 g of vitamin C, as well as Chenopodium album with up to 6 mg/100 g iron, 18.5 mg/100 g zinc, 226 mg/100 g calcium and up to 211 mg/100 g magnesium. These vegetables may help to meet daily requirements of these and other essential nutrients, especially in individuals with marginal nutritional status. Furthermore, ALVs such as Arachis hypogea and Bidens pilosa are good sources of dietary fibre, while Nasturtium aquatica, Urtic dioica and Xanthosoma mafaffa are excellent free radical scavengers. In many instances ALVs have levels of these components that are higher than those of exotic vegetables such as spinach and cabbage. Factors such as storage, cooking methods and drying influence the micronutrient, antioxidant and antinutritional factor content of these vegetables. The consumption, cultivation and possibly the commercialization of these ALVs should therefore be promoted. 3aArachis hypogaea 3aBidens pilosa 3aChenopodium album 3aManihot esculenta 3aNasturtium 3aXanthosoma 3aantinutritional factors 3aascorbic acid 3acabbage 3acalcium 3acommercialization 3acooking 3adietary fiber 3adrying 3afree radical scavengers 3ahuman health 3airon 3alifestyle 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3anutritive value 3apeople 3aspinach 3avitamin A 3azinc1 aOelofse, A.q(André)1 aDuodu, Kwaku G.1 aBester, Megan J.1 aFaber, Mieke0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2010 Sept., v. 23, no. 6 p.499-509dAcademic PresswJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2010.05.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03517naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001500173245005400188300001600242500002400258520155000282650002001832650001201852650002301864650002201887650002201909650002201931650001501953650001801968650002801986650001502014650001402029650001002043650001402053650001602067650001202083650002602095650001902121650004402140650002402184650003302208650001202241650003002253650001102283650004202294650001102336650001402347650004602361650002902407650003002436651000902466651002402475700001502499700001702514700001602531773012002547852000902667856008602676930003302762945002502795946001102820655001202831IND4390928920221120101300.0070506e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439092892DNAL7 a172878862pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-007-0053-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aSakha, M. 10aBovine Subclinical Ketosis in Dairy Herds in Iran  ap. 673-679.  aIncludes references  aSubclinical ketosis (SCK) is defined as elevated concentrations of ketone bodies in the absence of clinical signs of ketosis. It is an important metabolic disease in dairy cattle during early lactation and is associated with losses in milk production and several other periparturient diseases. Limited information is available regarding the prevalence of SCK in dairy herds in Iran. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the incidence of SCK in the dairy herds in Kerman province of Iran using serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations, and (ii) to investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of BHB and glucose of cows with SCK. In the present study, 90 multiparous Holstein cows (4-6 years old) from 11 commercial dairy herds were evaluated 3-4 weeks after calving. The distribution of blood BHB concentrations seemed to suggest a cut-off point of 1200 μmol/L between cows with and without SCK. At this cut-off point, 14.4% of tested cows (13/90) were classified as subclinically ketotic, with the prevalence rate within herd ranging from 10% to 20%. Cows with SCK were detected in all the investigated dairies except one. Blood glucose concentrations in cows with SCK were significantly lower (p <= 0.05) than in cows without SCK, and serum BHB and glucose concentration were inversely correlated (r = -0.43, p <= 0.05). The results suggest that, using a cut-off of 1200 μmol/L, BHB concentrations can be used during early lactation for diagnosis and to make management decisions for prevention and treatment. 3acattle diseases 3aketosis 3adisease prevalence 3adisease incidence 3adisease detection 3adisease diagnosis 3abiomarkers 3aketone bodies 3aepidemiological studies 3adairy cows 3alactation 3aherds 3ascreening 3ablood serum 3aglucose 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3adisease course 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3areference standards 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aFemale 2aIncidence 2aKetosisxbloodxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aPostpartum Periodxblood 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 3aIran 0aIranxepidemiology.1 aAmeri, M. 1 aSharifi, H. 1 aTaheri, I. 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2007 Aug., v. 31, no. 6 p.673-679dKluwer Academic Publishersx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-007-0053-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02494naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015400128300001400282500002400296500001500320520110100335650003501436650001501471650001401486650001501500650001501515650002301530650002001553650001801573653001701591653001701608653001501625653002401640653002101664700001401685700003001699700002101729700001401750773015001764852000901914856005401923930003301977945001302010946001302023655001202036IND2055358420221120111230.0970212e199509  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205535842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Amrani, A.10aPurification and characterization of a novel aminopeptidase, plastidial alanine-aminopeptidase, from the cotyledons of etiolated sugar beet seedlings  ap. 87-94.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring prolonged dark growth of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) seedlings, etioplasts, rapidly after the proplastid-etioplast transition, undergo a degenerative process characterized by ultrastructural modifications, protein loss, and the decrease of carotenoid and chlorophyll accumulation upon illumination. Two plastidial aminopeptidase activities were identified as early markers of this degenerative process (A. El Amrani, I. Couee, J.-P. Carde, J.-P. Gaudillere, P. Raymond [1994] Plant Physiology 106: 1555-1565). The present study focuses on one of these markers and describes the purification to homogeneity and characterization of plastidial alanine-aminopeptidase. This novel aminopeptidase was found to be a metallotype naphthylamidase particularly active with alanyl, arginyl, and leucyl substrates. Its plastidial location was confirmed by immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibodies against the purified enzyme. Its physico-chemical and enzymic properties are discussed with respect to other higher plant aminopeptidases and to its potential functions during prolonged dark growth. 3amembrane alanyl aminopeptidase 3aetioplasts 3aseedlings 3acotyledons 3aetiolation 3aprotein metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aBeta vulgaris 0apurification 0alocalization 0asubstrates 0acell ultrastructure 0acharacterization1 aSuire, C.1 aCamara, B.c(Illustrator)1 aGaudillere, J.P.1 aCouee, I.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Sept., v. 109, no. 1 p.87-94dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle03033naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011800130300001800248500002400266520153500290650001701825650002401842650001101866650001401877650002501891650001901916650002001935650002201955650002101977650003001998650002802028650001402056650001802070653001902088653001302107653003002120653001602150653001102166653002502177700001602202700001702218700001702235773015302252852000902405856005402414930003302468945001302501946001302514655001202527IND2055302620221120101315.0970210e199508  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205530262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeneweera, S.P.10aDiurnal regulation of leaf blade elongation in rice by CO2: is it related to sucrose-phosphate synthase activity?  ap. 1471-1477.  aIncludes references  aThe relationship between leaf blade elongation rates (LER) and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) activity was investigated at different times during ontogeny of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Jarrah) grown in flooded soil at either 350 or 700 microliter CO2 L-1. High CO2 concentrations increased LER of expanding blades and in vivo activity (V(limiting)) SPS activity of expanded blades during the early vegetative stage (21 d after planting [DAP]), when tiller number was small and growing blades were strong carbohydrate sinks. Despite a constant light environment, there was a distinct diurnal pattern in LER, V(limiting) SPS activity, and concentration of soluble sugars, with an increase in the early part of the light period and a decrease later in the light period. The strong correlation (r = 0.651 between LER and V(limiting) SPS activity over the diurnal cycle indicated that SPS activity played an important role in controlling blade growth. The higher V(limiting) SPS activity at elevated CO2 at 21 DAP was caused by an increase in the activation state of the enzyme rather than an increase in Vmax. Fructose and glucose accumulated to a greater extent than sucrose at high CO2 and may have been utilized for synthesis of cell-wall components, contributing to higher specific leaf weight. By the mid-tillering stage (42 DAP), CO2 enrichment enhanced V(limiting) and Vmax, activities of source blades. Nevertheless, LER was depressed by high CO2, probably because tillers were stronger carbohydrate sinks than growing blades. 3aOryza sativa 3ahexosyltransferases 3aleaves 3aleaf area 3adevelopmental stages 3acarbon dioxide 3aenzyme activity 3adiurnal variation 3acircadian rhythm 3asource-sink relationships 3adry matter accumulation 3atillering 3acarbohydrates 0aseedling stage 0aflooding 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0agrowth rate 0agrowth 0aspecific leaf weight1 aBasra, A.S.1 aBarlow, E.W.1 aConroy, J.P.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Aug., v. 108, no. 4 p.1471-1477dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle03350naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245011900163300001800282500002400300500001500324506007600339520167000415506003702085650001202122650001702134650002902151650002502180650001602205650001402221650001602235650003102251650002102282650002902303650001302332650004802345650002502393653001502418653001102433653002402444700001502468700001802483700001502501700001702516773015302533852000902686856005402695930003302749945001302782946001302795655001202808IND2055300720221207125144.0970210e199508  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205530072DNAL7 a76597472pmid7 aPMC1575222pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, F.10aEvidence implicating dimethylsulfoniopropionaldehyde as an intermediate in dimethylsulfoniopropionate biosynthesis  ap. 1439-1448.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a3-Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an osmoprotectant accumulated by certain flowering plants and algae. In Wollastonia biflora (L.) DC. (Compositae) the first intermediate in DMSP biosynthesis has been shown to be S-methylmethionine (SMM) (A.D. Hanson, J. Rivoal, L. Paquet, D.A. Gage [1994] Plant Physiol 105: 103-110). Other possible intermediates were investigated by radiolabeling methods using W. biflora leaf discs. In pulse-chase experiments with [35S]SMM, 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionaldehyde (DMSP-ald) acquired label rapidly and lost it during the chase period. Conversely, 3-dimethylsulfoniopropylamine (DMSP-amine), 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionamide (DMSP-amide), and 4-dimethylsulfonio-2-hydroxybutyrate (DMSHB) labeled slowly and continuously during both pulse and chase. When unlabeled compounds were supplied along with [35S]SMM, DMSP-ald promoted [35S]DMSP-ald accumulation but DMSHB, DMSP-amide, and DMSP-amine had no such trapping effect. These data indicate that DMSP-ald is an intermediate in DMSP biosynthesis and that the other three compounds are not. Consistent with this, [35S]DMSHB was not metabolized to DMSP. Although [14C]DMSP-amine and [14C]DMSP-amide were converted slowly to DMSP, similar or higher conversion rates were found in plants that do not naturally accumulate DMSP, indicating that nonspecific reactions were responsible. These nonaccumulating species did not form [35S]DMSP-ald from [35S]SMM, implying that DMSP-ald is specific to DMSP biosynthesis. W. biflora leaf discs catabolized supplied sulfonium compounds to dimethylsulfide at differing rates, in the order DMSP-ald > > DMSP-amine > SMM > DMSP-amide > DMSHB > DMSP.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWedelia 3abiosynthesis 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3abiochemical pathways 3apropionates 3aaldehydes 3ametabolites 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aSulfides 2aSulfonium Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSulfur Radioisotopes 0aprecursors 0aplants 0awollastonia biflora1 aPaquet, L.1 aSparace, S.A.1 aGage, D.A.1 aHanson, A.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Aug., v. 108, no. 4 p.1439-1448dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle02831naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011400123300001800237500002400255520144400279650001501723650001801738650002001756650001601776650001701792650002001809650002501829650001701854650002101871650001701892650001901909650001601928650001301944653001701957653001501974653001401989653002102003653002102024700001602045700001302061773015302074852000902227856005402236930003302290945001302323946001302336655001202349IND2055321920221120091010.0970210e199508  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205532192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, A.10aIsolation and characterization of a protein associated with carotene globules in the alga Dunaliella bardawil  ap. 1657-1664.  aIncludes references  aThe halotolerant alga Dunaliella bardawil accumulates very large amounts of beta-carotene when exposed to high light intensity. The accumulated beta-carotene is concentrated in small, oily globules within the chloroplast and has been suggested to protect the alga against photodamage by high irradiation (A. Ben-Amotz, A. Katz, M. Avron [1982] J Phycol 18: 529-537; A. Ben-Amotz, M. Avron [1983] Plant Physiol 72: 593-597; A. Ben-Amotz, A. Shaish, M. Avron [1989] Plant Physiol 91:1040-1043). A 38-kD protein was identified and purified from beta-carotene globules and was designated carotene globule protein (Cgp). Induction of Cgp occurs in parallel with beta-carotene accumulation in D. bardawil grown under different inductive conditions. Cgp is overproduced in a constitutive mutant strain that overproduces beta-carotene and is not detected in Dunaliella saline, a species that does not accumulate beta-carotene. Cgp production was not suppressed by norflurazon, an inhibitor of beta-carotene synthesis that leads to accumulation of the carotenoid precursor phytoene. Immunogold-labeling analysis by electron microscopy demonstrates that the protein is localized at the periphery of the globules. Proteolytic cleavage by trypsin enhances the coalescence and destruction of the globules, in parallel with Cgp disappearance. It is suggested that the function of Cgp is to stabilize the structure of the globules within the chloroplast. 3aDunaliella 3abeta-carotene 3alight intensity 3aphotoperiod 3alipid bodies 3aprotein content 3aamino acid sequences 3apolypeptides 3amolecular weight 3achloroplasts 3aultrastructure 3aproteolysis 3agenotype 0alocalization 0ainhibition 0ainduction 0aunique sequences 0aprotein analysis1 aJimenez, C.1 aPick, U.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Aug., v. 108, no. 4 p.1657-1664dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle03655naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245012700163300001800290500002400308500001500332506007600347520122700423506003701650650002401687650001301711650002601724650001901750650000801769650001401777650002501791650002601816650002001842650001701862650001101879650002101890650002001911650002001931650001101951650002401962650001201986650002101998650006402019650004902083650004202132650003102174650001502205650003202220650002802252650002202280650003402302650003702336650005002373653001102423653001502434653001502449653002802464653002602492653002102518700001602539700002002555700001602575700001902591773015302610852000902763856005402772930003302826945001302859946001302872655001202885IND2055313920221207102856.0970210e199508  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205531392DNAL7 a76597552pmid7 aPMC1575442pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, B.10aAssociation of a 33-kilodalton cysteine proteinase found in corn callus with the inhibition of fall armyworm larval growth  ap. 1631-1640.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein patterns of callus from corn (Zea mays L.) inbreds that are either resistant or susceptible to fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda [J.E.

Fall armyworm larvae reared on callus initiated from resistant inbreds were significantly smaller than those reared on callus of susceptible inbreds. A 33-kD protein found in callus from the resistant inbreds Mp704 and Mp708 was absent in callus from the susceptible inbreds Tx601 and Ab24E. However, a 36-kD protein found in Ab24E callus immunoreacted with polyclonal antibody raised against the 33-kD protein. When Mp704 nonfriable callus changed to friable, larval growth was not inhibited and the 33-kD protein was absent. There was a significant negative correlation between the concentration of the 33-kD protein in the callus and the weight of the larvae feeding on the callus in the F2 progeny of Mp704 X Tx601. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 33-kD protein suggested that it was cysteine proteinase. Purification of the 33- (Mp708) and 36-kD (Ab24E) proteins indicated that they were both cysteine proteinases. The 33-kD cysteine proteinase had 7-fold higher specific activity than the 36-kD enzyme.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amechanism of action 3aZea mays 3aDiatraea grandiosella 3aembryo (plant) 3aage 3anutrition 3aamino acid sequences 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aliveweight gain 3ainbred lines 3alarvae 3amolecular weight 3apest resistance 3aenzyme activity 3acallus 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCysteine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aInbreeding 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpodopteraxgrowth & development 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgeneticsxparasitology. 0agrowth 0afriability 0ainhibition 0amolecular sequence data 0abiological resistance 0aprotein analysis1 aSiregar, U.1 aWilleford, K.O.1 aLuthe, D.S.1 aWilliams, W.P.0 tPlant physiology.g1995 Aug., v. 108, no. 4 p.1631-1640dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRUM  aOther US 7aarticle01710naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245006100162300001600223500002400239500001500263520074300278650001101021650001101032650003101043650001901074650001201093650001001105650002001115653001401135700001601149773011201165852000901277856008601286655001201372IND4444232520221120055510.0101029s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444423252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2010.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasekan, O.10aFlavour chemistry of palm toddy and palm juice: a review  ap. 494-501.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSystemic analytical approaches aimed at characterizing key odourants, such as Aroma Extraction Dilution Analysis (AEDA), PTR-MS, EXOM, ADA and Stable Isotope Dilution Assays (SIDA) are very useful tools for elucidating the flavour and off-flavour components in palm toddy and palm juice.

No correlation was observed between clustering of cyanobacteria and the host species of Gunnera. 3aGunnera 3aNostoc 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCluster Analysis 2aCyanobacteriaxclassificationxcytologyxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aElectrophoresisxmethods 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxgenetics 2aSymbiosis1 aSvenning, M.M.0 tArchives of microbiology.g2001 Sept., v. 176, no. 3 p.204-210x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020301003133Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle04296naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245017400180300001800354500002400372500001500396520185600411650003602267650002402303650001702327650002502344650002002369650002402389650002102413650001002434650001402444650002002458650001902478650003702497650001202534650003202546650002102578650002702599650003002626650004102656650002502697650005002722650002702772650002902799650004602828650002502874650000902899650002902908650003302937650002602970650004602996653001303042653003003055653002003085653003303105653003003138653002703168653000903195700002503204700001803229700002003247700003903267700002403306700001903330773010703349852000903456856008503465655001203550IND4444336220221120055454.0101029s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444433622DNAL7 a202249092pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0035-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuimi, Nili10aInhibition of TNFα-induced iNOS expression in HSV-tk transduced 9L glioblastoma cell lines by Marasmius oreades substances through NF-κB- and MAPK-dependent mechanisms  ap. 3801-3812.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aNitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous, radical molecule that plays a role in various physiological processes. Previously, we reported that transduction of murine colon cancer cells (MC38) with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene resulted in a significant over-expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and activation of NF-kB pathway. In this study we show that TNFα, but not LPS, was significantly able to stimulate the production of NO in HSV-tk transduced 9L glioblastoma cell lines, mediated by the up-regulation of iNOS transcript and iNOS protein. The TNFα-induced up-regulation of iNOS expression was mediated by MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways as revealed by using selective pharmaceutical inhibitors. A culture liquid extract of the edible and medicinal mushroom Marasmius oreades that was previously shown to inhibit iNOS expression in MCF-7 was utilized to prepare fractions and evaluate their ability to affect TNFα-induced iNOS expression in HSV tk transduced 9L cell lines. While most of the tested fractions were shown to inhibit TNFα-induced iNOS expression, they targeted different signaling pathways in a selective fashion. Here, we report that fraction SiSiF1 interfered with IKBα phosphorylation and consequently interfered with NF-κB activation pathway. SiSiF1 showed minimal interference with the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK proteins. In contrast, fraction SiSiF3 selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and fractions SiSiF4 and SiSiF5 selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK with no observed effect against IKBα and p38 phosphorylation. Our data illustrate the complexity of iNOS regulation in HSV tk transduced 9L cell lines and also the richness of natural products with bioactive substances that may act synergistically through different signaling pathways to affect iNOS gene expression. 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3agene overexpression 3anitric oxide 3acolorectal neoplasms 3amedicinal fungi 3asignal transduction 3athymidine kinase 3agenes 3aMarasmius 3aphosphorylation 3aherpes simplex 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 2aAnimals 2aCell Extractsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChemical Fractionation 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGlioblastomaxenzymologyxpathology. 2aMarasmiusxchemistry 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIxmetabolism 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aSimplexvirusxenzymology 2aThymidine Kinasexmetabolism 2aTransduction, Genetic 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxpharmacology 0aproteins 0a9L glioblastoma cell line 0aiNOS expression 0aMarasmius oreades substances 0aNF-κB activation pathway 0aIκBα phosphorylation 0aMAPK1 aPetrova, Roumyana D.1 aAgbaria, Riad1 aSussan, Sherbel1 aVasser, S.

This has been confirmed in the present study by a screening of 146 axenic strains from the Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) of cyanobacteria. Use of degenerate PCR primers, designed on the basic of conserved sequence motifs in the aminoacyl-adenylation domain of peptide synthetases, revealed the presence of the corresponding genes in the majority (75.3%) of the strains examined. Among unicellular cyanobacteria, only Chamaesiphon sp strain PCC 6605, two strains of Gloeocapsa and most Microcystis isolates (22 out of 24) contained these genes; no amplicons were detected for any members of the genera Cyanothece, Gloeobacter and Gloeothece and the genera Cyanothece, Gloeobacter and Gloeothece and the genetically diverse representatives of Synechococcus and Synechocystis. By contrast, eight out of ten pleurocapsalean members, 16 out of 25 oscillatorian strains, and all but two of the 63 filamentous heterocystous cyanobacteria tested gave positive amplification results. This information will be highly valuable for further exploring the corresponding cyanobacterial peptides and for elucidating the bioactivity of such non-ribosomally synthesized molecules. 3aCyanothece 3aDNA primers 3aGloeobacter 3aGloeocapsa 3aGloeothece 3aMicrocystis 3aSynechococcus 3aSynechocystis 3abioactive properties 3agenes 3aligases 3apeptides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 2aCyanobacteriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aPeptide Synthasesxgenetics 0aculture collections 0apasteur culture collection 0abioactive compounds1 aDittmann, E.1 aOrdorika, L.V.1 aRippka, R.1 aHerdman, M.1 aBorner, T.0 tArchives of microbiology.g2001 Dec., v. 176, no. 6 p.452-458x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020301003493Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03311naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245006400172300001600236500002400252520206400276650001702340650001902357650002602376650001402402650001202416650001602428650001402444650001702458650002402475650001202499650002202511650002102533650001502554650001602569700002302585700002202608700002102630700002502651773010002676852000902776856009202785655001202877IND4444455120221120065850.0101029s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444445512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02118.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOCHANEK, JITKA10aPre‐zygotic parental environment modulates seed longevity  ap. 837-848.  aIncludes references  aThe potential for the pre‐zygotic plant growth environment to play a role in determining seed longevity was investigated for a species that inhabits arid to semi‐arid Australia. Seed longevity is particularly important for wild populations in fluctuating environments because the longer a seed‐lot is able to survive in the soil seed bank the more likely it is to buffer the population from unpredictable environments. Thus Wahlenbergia tumidifructa plants received wet or dry soil moisture within a warm or cool glasshouse until flowering. Seeds subsequently produced by flowers that opened on the day that plants were moved to a common environment were collected at maturity and longevity assessed by controlled ageing at 60% relative humidity and 45°C. Mean seed longevity was similar for seeds produced by plants that grew in warm‐wet, warm‐dry and cool‐dry conditions (P₅₀ of about 20 days), but extended for plants in cool‐wet conditions (P₅₀ = 41.7 days). Cool temperatures resulted in seeds with a wider distribution of lifespans (σ = 20 days) than warm conditions (σ = 12 days); the large σ caused the extended P₅₀ for cool‐wet plants, but not cool‐dry as a result of a concomitant reduction in initial seed germination (Ki). After moving to the common environment, all plants generated new vegetative material, which went on to produce seeds with similar longevity (P₅₀ approx. 20 days) irrespective of original environment. Visible phenotypic responses of the parent to environmental conditions correlated with longevity and quality parameters of the progeny seeds, suggesting that a parental effect modified seed longevity. Our study provides novel empirical data showing that environmental conditions expected under climate change scenarios may potentially cause seed longevity to decline for a species that inhabits arid to semi‐arid Australia. These negative impacts on population buffering may weaken the storage effect mechanism of species coexistence in fluctuating environments. 3aburied seeds 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agreenhouses 3alongevity 3aplant growth 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3aseed germination 3asoil water 3atemperature1 aBUCKLEY, YVONNE M.1 aPROBERT, ROBIN J.1 aAdkins, Steve W.1 aSTEADMAN, KATHRYN J.0 tAustral ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 35, no. 7 p.837-848dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02118.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02349naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002600161245014400187300001600331500001500347520078400362650002901146650001701175650001201192650001601204650002201220650002001242650002401262650001101286650001501297650001601312650001501328650001501343650001801358650001601376650002801392650001901420650002001439650001901459653002001478653002501498653001601523773009201539852000901631856007501640930003301715945002501748946001101773990002301784655001201807IND4441376220221120050756.0100817s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444137622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Hen day egg production, egg weight, shell thickness and shell percentage were significantly (p<0.05) increased for hens watered 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 g/L ASA. RBC, Hb, WBC and PCV did not show significant differences, but glucose, cholesterol and H/L of treated hens significant (p<0.05) low.

Sequence analysis revealed that the complementing fragment carried an open reading frame, termed brnQ, that encodes a protein with sequence similarities to branched-chain amino acid carriers of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The brnQ gene specifies a predominantly hydrophobic protein of 426 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 44.9 kDa. A topology prediction by neural network computer analysis suggests the existence of 12 hydrophobic segments that most probably form transmembrane alpha-helices. A C. glutamicum mutant strain harboring a defined deletion of brnQ in the chromosome showed a considerably lower isoleucine uptake rate of 0.04 nmol min-1 mg (dry mass)-1 as compared to the wild-type strain rate of 1.2 nmol min-1 mg (dry mass)-1. Overexpression of brnQ by means of a tac promotor resulted in an elevated uptake rate for isoleucine of 11.3 nmol min-1 mg (dry mass)-1. Evidently, the brnQ gene encodes the only transport system in C. glutamicum directing isoleucine uptake. 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3achromosomes 3acomputer analysis 3adeformation 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoleucine 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aneural networks 3aopen reading frames 3aprediction 3asequence homology 3atopology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCorynebacteriumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aIsoleucinexpharmacokinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOpen Reading Framesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aHermann, T.1 aBurkovski, A.1 aKramer, R.1 aPühler, A.1 aKalinowski, J.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1998 Apr., v. 169, no. 4 p.303-312x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300505763Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03386naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001700159245009700176300001600273520127400289650002801563650002301591650002901614650003001643650001801673650001601691650002301707650001501730650001001745650001101755650003701766650001801803650001401821650002401835650001401859650006101873650004001934650002701974650005302001650003202054650003802086650003002124650002802154650004102182650003602223650003602259650002502295650002602320653003802346700001702384700001602401700001802417700001202435700002002447700001502467773008302482852000902565856008102574930003302655945001302688946001102701655001202712IND2198077920221120042659.0990412e199811  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219807792DNAL7 a97992822pmid7 a10.1007/s0020300506592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKronstad, J.10aSignaling via cAMP in fungi: interconnections with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways  ap. 395-404.  aThe cAMP signal transduction pathway controls a wide variety of processes in fungi. For example, considerable progress has been made in describing the involvement of cAMP pathway components in the control of morphogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ustilago maydis, and Magnaporthe grisea. These morphological processes include the establishment of filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae and U. maydis, and the differentiation of an appressorial infection structure in M. grisea. The discovery that appressorium formation requires cAMP signaling provides an immediate connection to fungal virulence. This connection may have broader implications among fungal pathogens because recent work indicates that cAMP signaling controls the expression of virulence traits in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. In this fungus, cAMP also influences mating, as has been found for Schizosaccharomyces pombe and as may occur in U. maydis. Finally, cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways appear to function coordinately to control the response of certain fungi. e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to environmental stress. There are clues that interconnections between these pathways may be common in the control of many fungal processes. 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aUstilago zeae 3aappressoria 3acontrol components 3acyclic AMP 3afungi 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amorphogenesis 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 3avirulence 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinasesxphysiology 2aCryptococcus neoformansxphysiology 2aCyclic AMPxphysiology 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxphysiology 2aFungal Proteinsxphysiology 2aFungixpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aGenes, Fungalxphysiology 2aMagnaporthexphysiology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexphysiology 2aSchizosaccharomycesxphysiology 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aUstilagoxphysiology 2aVirulencexphysiology 0ac-amp signal transduction pathway1 aDe Maria, A.1 aFunnell, D.1 aLaidlaw, R.D.1 aLee, N.1 aMoniz de Sa, M.1 aRamesh, M.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1998 Nov., v. 170, no. 6 p.395-404x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300506593Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02540naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001800159245014600177300001400323520069200337650003301029650002701062650002301089650003301112650002701145650001201172650001701184650001701201650001601218650001201234650001401246650002101260650001401281650002001295650003101315650003101346650005501377650005301432650003301485650005801518650003101576650005101607700001601658700001401674700001701688700001401705700001501719773008101734852000901815856008101824930003301905945001301938946001101951655001201962IND2198669020221120042729.0990512e199812  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219866902DNAL7 a98710222pmid7 a10.1007/s0020300506802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstrovsky, D.10aEffect of oxidative stress on the biosynthesis of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate and isoprenoids by several bacterial strains  ap. 69-72.  aIn this study, the gram-negative bacteria Xanthomonas campestris, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas putida, facultative parasites of plants and animals, were shown to accumulate 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEC) in response to benzylviologen-induced oxidative stress.

Because R. capsulatus grows readily on N2 in the dark by anaerobic respiration with dimethylsulfoxide, the diazotrophic capacities of various strains in the dark were examined. No rnf mutants tested grew diazotrophically, and a nonpolar fdxN-null mutant showed decreased diazotrophic growth in the dark, suggesting that the Rnf and FdxN proteins form the primary electron donor pathway to nitrogenase in the dark as well as in the light. Nonphotosynthetic mutants lacking the component of cyclic electron transport grew diazotrophically and the levels of Rnf proteins were similar to those of the wild-type. These results indicate that rnf gene products play an essential role in nitrogen fixation without any functional link to the cyclic electron transport system. 3aRhodobacter capsulatus 3aanaerobiosis 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectron transfer 3agenes 3amutants 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aproteins1 aKumagai, H.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1998 May, v. 169, no. 5 p.464-467x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300505983Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02964naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245008700167300001600254500002400270520152400294650001901818650001201837650001801849650001401867650001001881650002401891650001201915650002101927650002001948650001501968650002501983651002002008700001802028700001702046700001902063700002602082700002602108700002102134700001702155700001702172700001802189700001802207700001702225773013302242852000902375856008602384655001202470IND4444211620221120042847.0101028s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444421162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnglberger, Lois10aCarotenoid and riboflavin content of banana cultivars from Makira, Solomon Islands  ap. 624-632.  aIncludes references  aThe Solomon Islands face problems of vitamin A deficiency and infectious diseases, including malaria. It is essential to identify nutrient-rich indigenous foods for preventing and alleviating these diseases. Previous work in Micronesia identified yellow/orange-fleshed carotenoid-rich banana cultivars, in particular Fe’i cultivars (characterized by upright bunches), with potential to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Although there is a great diversity of Solomon Islands bananas, little is documented about these cultivars and their nutrient content. Using an ethnographic approach, this study aimed to identify nutrient-rich cultivars and to collect information relating to production and consumption. Seven Fe’i cultivars (not previously analyzed) and three non-Fe’i cultivars were assessed for flesh color, fruit size and other attributes and analyzed for provitamin A carotenoids (β- and α-carotene), total carotenoids and riboflavin. Five Fe’i and two non-Fe’i cultivars were identified as carotenoid-rich. Of 10 cultivars analyzed the concentrations of β-carotene equivalents ranged from 45 to 7124 μg/100 g. Compared to cultivars with light-colored flesh, the yellow/orange-fleshed cultivars generally contained higher carotenoid concentrations. All Fe’i cultivars contained riboflavin, from 0.10 to 2.72 mg/100 g, some having substantial concentrations. The nutrient-rich cultivars, including Fe’i, should be promoted for their potential to contribute to vitamin A intake and overall health. 3aalpha-carotene 3abananas 3abeta-carotene 3acultivars 3afoods 3ainfectious diseases 3amalaria 3anutrient content 3anutrient intake 3ariboflavin 3avitamin deficiencies 3aSolomon Islands1 aLyons, Graham1 aFoley, Wendy1 aDaniells, Jeff1 aAalbersberg, William.1 aDolodolotawake, Usaia1 aWatoto, Claudine1 aIramu, Ellen1 aTaki, Belden1 aWehi, Francis1 aWarito, Peter1 aTaylor, Mary0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2010 Sept., v. 23, no. 6 p.624-632dAcademic PresswJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02649naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245013600169300001600305500002400321520138600345650002901731650001801760650001801778650002501796650001701821650001301838650001401851650002101865650001101886650001201897650001301909650001401922650002001936650001201956650001301968700002301981700001302004773011502017852000902132856008602141655001202227IND4444211920221120042830.0101028s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444421192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdalid, Ana María10aEvaluation and selection of tomato accessions (Solanum section Lycopersicon) for content of lycopene, β-carotene and ascorbic acid  ap. 613-618.  aIncludes references  aTomato has been identified as a food of great interest given its nutritional and bioactive components (mainly lycopene, β-carotene and ascorbic acid) and its high consumption rate all year round. Previous works have indicated that some local tomato cultivars and accessions of related species could have great potential, and even as nutraceutical foods. Nevertheless, most local cultivars have disappeared from fields because they have been replaced by hybrids and modern cultivars which produce higher yields and are more disease-resistant. In this work, 49 accessions of underutilized tomato or related species are evaluated in order to recover their use (directly in fields or as variability sources to obtain new cultivars) and increase agrobiodiversity. Fourteen accessions of the cherry type and two of the common tomato type were selected for their high and balanced nutritional properties, causing them to be of great interest for direct human consumption (especially BGV008057, BGV006863 and BGV008060). Furthermore, BGV008365 and BGV012627 (cherry types with over 1.5 times the normal average ascorbic acid content) as well as BGV008166 (Solanum pimpinellifolium accession which presented more than nine times the normal average lycopene content) would be of interest as donor parents for breeding programmes to increase the nutrition properties of commercial varieties. 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive properties 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3acultivars 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3alycopene 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aparents 3atomatoes1 aRoselló, Salvador1 aNuez, F.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2010 Sept., v. 23, no. 6 p.613-618dAcademic PresswJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02447naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001300155245006100168300001800229500002400247500001500271520111400286650001301400650002101413650001901434650001401453650002101467650001301488650001801501650001501519653002001534700001601554700001201570700001601582700001301598700001301611700001101624700001201635773016001647852000901807856007801816930003301894945002501927946001301952655001201965IND4390789520221120042819.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439078952DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070046c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aYe, J.H.10aPreparation of Partially Decaffeinated Instant Green Tea  ap. 3498-3502.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe caffeine level of instant tea extracted from decaffeinated leaf tea with 4.0 mg g-1 caffeine is commonly above 10.0 mg g-1, the maximum limit of caffeine for decaffeinated instant tea. Further removal of caffeine by active carbon (AC) from the green tea extract was investigated. It showed that the removal of caffeine from the tea extract solutions depended on the treatment time and tea extract concentration while the ethanol concentration and pH had little effect on the removal of caffeine. According to the removal of caffeine and the ratio of total catechins to caffeine in the tested samples, the optimum decaffeination conditions were determined to be as follows: tea extract concentration 15-30 g L-1 for common tea extract but higher for partially decaffeinated tea leaf extract; ratio of tea solution to AC, 100 mL:4 g; treatment time, 4 h; and natural tea extract pH. Instant tea powder extracted from partially decaffeinated leaf tea with a caffeine level of 4.03 mg g-1 and further decaffeinated by AC had a caffeine level of 7.81 mg g-1, which was 31% lower than that without AC treatment. 3acaffeine 3aactivated carbon 3adecaffeination 3agreen tea 3afood composition 3aextracts 3ainstant foods 3aadsorption 0afood processing1 aLiang, Y.R.1 aJin, J.1 aLiang, H.L.1 aDu, Y.Y.1 aLu, J.L.1 aYe, Q.1 aLin, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3498-3502dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070046c3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle02533naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001700146245016500163300001800328500002400346520116000370650002201530650001301552650001401565650002201579650001601601650001501617650001701632650001701649650002101666653006001687700001501747700001601762700001501778773016001793852000901953856007801962930003302040945002502073946001302098655001202111IND4390788620221120042944.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439078862DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07018422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aBeckmann, M.10aRepresentation, Comparison, and Interpretation of Metabolome Fingerprint Data for Total Composition Analysis and Quality Trait Investigation in Potato Cultivars  ap. 3444-3451.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding attributes of crop varieties and food raw materials underlying desirable characteristics is a significant challenge. Metabolomics technology based on flow infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) has been used to investigate the chemical composition of potato cultivars associated with quality traits in harvested tubers. Through the combination of metabolite fingerprinting with random forest data modeling, a subset of metabolome signals explanatory of compositional differences between individual genotypes were ranked for importance. Interpretative analysis of highlighted signals based on ranking behavior, intensity correlations, and mathematical relationships of ion masses correctly predicted metabolites associated with flavor and pigmentation traits in potato tubers. GC-MS profiling was used to further validate proposed compositional differences. The potential for the development of a database strategy for large scale, long-term projects requiring comparison of chemical composition in plant breeding, mutant population analysis in functional genomics experiments, or food raw material analysis is described. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3acultivars 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3afood quality 3afood composition 0aflow infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry1 aEnot, D.P.1 aOvery, D.P.1 aDraper, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3444-3451dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07018423Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle02063naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245008400164300001800248500002400266520081300290650002401103650001501127650002101142650001501163650001801178650004301196653001201239653001601251700001801267700002001285700001401305700001601319773016001335852000901495856007801504930003301582945002501615946001301640655001201653IND4390786920221120021338.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439078692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070182h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aDell'Agli, M.10aDetermination of Aloesin and Aloeresin A for the Detection of Aloe in Beverages  ap. 3363-3367.  aIncludes references  aThis work describes a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the quantification of aloesin and aloeresin A in alcoholic beverages containing aloe as a flavoring agent.

Identification of the analytes was confirmed under selective ion monitoring mode by the presence of two dominant ion fragments within the specific time windows (±1% of the relative retention time with respect to the calibration standards) and matching of relative ion intensities of the concerned ions in samples and calibration standards (within ±5%). Quantification was based on the measurement of concentration ratios of the natural and isotopic analogues in the sample and calibration blends. To circumvent the tedious iterative process of exact isotope matching that is often used in isotope dilution mass spectrometry analysis, a single-point calibration procedure was adopted with the isotopic amount ratios in the sample and calibration blends close to unity (0.9-1.1). Under the described approach, intraday and interday repeatability of replicate analyses of organochlorine pesticides in the ginseng root sample were below 1.4%. The expanded relative uncertainty ranging from 4.0 to 6.5% at a coverage factor of 2 was significantly lower than those of conventional gas chromatographic methods using other calibration techniques (internal or external standards). A deviation of less than 2.0% from the certified values was achieved when applying the developed method to determine hexachlorobenzene, -, and -hexachlorocyclohexane in a certified reference material (CRM), BCR-CRM 115. Because of the unavailability of relevant CRMs of herbal origins, the concerned ginseng root sample, after verification of the "true values" of the concerned organochlorine pesticides by the valid primary method, is suitable for serving as an in-house reference material for quality assurance and method validation purposes. 3amedicinal plants 3apesticide residues 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aPanax ginseng 3aisotope dilution technique 3ahexachlorobenzene 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aroots 3aherbal medicines 0aorganochlorine pesticides 0acontamination1 aKong, M.F.1 aWong, Y.C.1 aWong, S.K.1 aSin, D.W.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3339-3345dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06371683Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070802b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/02  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245015000171300001800321500002400339520109800363650000901461650003101470650001001501650002001511650001501531650003001546650001501576650001301591650002601604650001101630650002401641650001701665653004001682653002401722653001701746700001701763700001801780700001701798700001701815700001401832773016001846852000902006856007802015930003302093945002502126946001302151655001202164IND4390785120221120021326.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439078512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06293362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ204 0aR2001 aCharels, D.10aToward Metrological Traceability for DNA Fragment Ratios in GM Quantification. 3.

In this paper the suitability of two DNA calibrants, genomic DNA from plant leaves and plasmidic DNA, was investigated. The PCR efficiencies, the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves, and the ratios between PCR efficiencies of transgenic and endogenous sequences were compared for both calibrants using 59 data sets produced by 43 laboratories. There were no significant differences between plasmidic and genomic DNA except for the PCR efficiencies of the calibration curves for the transgene of the construct-specific real-time PCR method. In the GM system investigated, PCR efficiencies of plasmidic calibrants were slightly closer to the PCR efficiencies observed for the unknowns than those of the genomic DNA calibrant. Therefore, plasmidic DNA was the more suitable calibrant for the PCR measurements on genomic DNA extracted from MON 810 seeds. It is shown that plasmidic DNA is an appropriate choice for the calibration of measurements of MON 810 corn with respect to the DNA copy number ratio. 3acorn 3agenetically modified foods 3afeeds 3arecombinant DNA 3aextraction 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atransgenes 3aplasmids 3aquantitative analysis 3aleaves 3areference standards 3atraceability 0areal time polymerase chain reaction 0aDNA fragment ratios 0aMON 810 corn1 aBroeders, S.1 aCorbisier, P.1 aTrapmann, S.1 aSchimmel, H.1 aEmons, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3268-3274dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06293363Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070802b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/02  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002200158245007800180300001600258500002400274500001500298520099500313650001601308650001801324650002601342650001801368650002401386650001001410650002101420650002501441650001701466650001301483653002301496700002201519773019101541852000901732856008901741930003301830945002501863946001101888655001201899IND4390753620140723000000.0070501e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439075362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aSaura-Calixto, F.10aPolyphenols associated with dietary fibre in wine: A wine Polyphenols gap  ap. 613-619.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe presence of polyphenolic compounds associated with dietary fibre is a characteristic feature of polyphenol-rich plant foods. It was recently reported that soluble dietary fibre is a common constituent of wine. The objective of this work was to ascertain whether significant amounts of wine polyphenols are associated with dietary fibre. Total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, and HPLC analysis were determined in wines and in corresponding dietary fibre solutions obtained after enzymatic treatments and dialysis. Results showed that 35-60% of total polyphenols in red wine and about 9% in white wine are associated with dietary fibre. These polyphenols are not detected by the usual HPLC analytical techniques and consequently may be ignored in most chemical and biological studies - what we call "the wine polyphenols gap". Our findings suggest that a significant part of wine polyphenols are not bioaccesible in the human small intestine and reach the colon along with dietary fibre. 3apolyphenols 3adietary fiber 3anutrient availability 3asoluble fiber 3aenzymatic treatment 3awines 3afood composition 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adialysis 0aphenolic compounds1 aDíaz-Rubio, M.E.0 tFood research international.g2007 June, v. 40, no. 5 p.613-619dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20070814b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001800187242013900205245012100344300001600465500002400481500002400505520107200529650002701601650001801628650002301646650001401669650001401683650002701697650001701724700002401741700002101765700002101786700002201807773010901829852000901938856009101947856013102038930003302169945002502202946001102227655001202238IND4390767820140723000000.0070501e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND439076782DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aX3801 aBeserra, E.B.10aBiologia e exigências térmicas de Aedes aegypti (L.)

The life cycle of A. aegypti populations was studied at constant temperatures of 18, 22, 26, 30 and 34°C, and 12h photophase. The development period, egg viability and larval and pupal survival were evaluated daily as well as adult longevity and fecundity. The low threshold temperature of development (Tb) and the thermal constant (K) were determined. The number of generations per year in laboratory and field were also estimated. The favorable temperature to A. aegypti development is between 21°C and 29°C, and to longevity and fecundity is between 22°C and 30°C. The egg to adult basal temperature, thermal constant and the number of generations in field were, in order, 9.5, 8.5, 3.4, 7.1, 13.5°C; 244.5, 273.9, 298.5, 280.9 and 161.8 degree-days; and 21.9, 23.8, 24.2, 21.1 and 22.1 generations in populations from Boqueirão, Brejo dos Santos, Campina Grande, Itaporanga and Remígio. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aAedes aegypti 3ainsect development 3alongevity 3afecundity 3ageographical variation 3ahuman health1 aCastro, F.P. de Jr.1 aSantos, J.W. dos1 aSantos, T. da S.1 aFernandes, C.R.M.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2006 , v. 35, no. 6 p.853-860dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1519-566X20060006&lng=en&nrm=iso3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03372naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100002100178242022300199245022400422300001600646500002400662500002400686520143800710650001602148650003002164650002002194650003002214650002502244650002002269650001902289650002302308650003102331653002602362700002102388700001902409700002402428700001702452773010902469852000902578856009102587856013102678930003302809945002502842946001102867655001202878IND4390767320140723000000.0070501e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND439076732DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aL821 0aL0011 aGonçalves, J.R.10aInteração entre Acarophenax lacunatus (Cross & Krantz) (Prostigmata: Acarophenacidae) e Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) sobre Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)10aInteraction between Acarophenax lacunatus (Cross & Krantz) (Prostigmata: Acarophenacidae) and Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) on Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)  ap. 823-827.  aIncludes references  aSummary in English.  aThe interaction between Acarophenax lacunatus (Cross & Krantz) and Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) may be a promising tool for the integrated pest management of stored grain insect pests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of these two natural enemies on Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius). The experimental units were petri dishes (140 x 10 mm) containing 30 g of whole wheat grains (13% water content) infested with 20 adults of R. dominica. The treatments consisted of inoculation of A. lacunatus and A. calandrae, separately and associated, in eight replicates. Three inoculations of five adult females of the natural enemies were carried out in each petri dish at five, ten and fifteen days after the infestation of R. dominica. All treatments were stored during 60 days in environmental chamber at 30 ± 1°C, 60 ± 5% relative humidity and 24h scotophase. The smallest numbers of physogastric females of A. lacunatus and of adults of A. calandrae were obtained when the natural enemies were in association. The use of A. calandrae alone demonstrated a low instantaneous rate of increase (r(i)) of R. dominica and a high protection of the wheat grains. The association of A. calandrae with A. lacunatus led to the lowest number of immatures of R. dominica. These results demonstrate the importance of this interaction as a tool of for the integrated management of R. dominica in stored wheat grains. 3aAcarophenax 3aAnisopteromalus calandrae 3anatural enemies 3abiological control agents 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3astorage insects 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aintegrated pest management 0aAcarophenax lacunatus1 aFaroni, L.R.D'A.1 aGuedes, R.N.C.1 aOliveira, C.R.F. de1 aGarcia, F.M.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2006 , v. 35, no. 6 p.823-827dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1519-566X20060006&lng=en&nrm=iso3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001400171245019000185300001600375500002400391520123600415650001201651650001701663650003001680650002001710650002701730650001401757650002301771650001701794650002001811650001901831650002001850650001301870700002001883700001701903700001801920700001601938700001201954700001901966700001601985700001502001700001502016773012102031852000902152856009402161930003302255945002502288946001102313655001202324IND4390766620221123013929.0070501e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439076662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ2011 aPerni, S.14aThe resistance to detachment of dairy strains of Listeria monocytogenes from stainless steel by shear stress is related to the fluid dynamic characteristics of the location of isolation  ap. 384-390.  aIncludes references  aStrains of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from artisanal Portuguese cheese-making dairies were divided into two categories on the basis of the locations from which they were isolated: strains from dynamic locations were those that were habitually exposed to flowing liquids during the process of cheese-making, whereas those from static locations were rarely, if ever, exposed to the shear stresses generated by liquid flows. The strength of attachment to stainless steel discs of all of these strains was obtained using a radial flow chamber. Initial attachment strengths to stainless steel (after a 0.5 h contact time) of L. monocytogenes strains were greater for the 5 isolates from surfaces exposed to flow (dynamic isolates) than for most (3 out of 4) of those that were not (static isolates). After a 24 h contact time, attachment strength of all isolates reached similar levels. These results suggest that strains having high initial attachment strength are more likely to persist on surfaces exposed to flow than strains having low initial attachment strength. The numerical values of shear forces obtained could prove useful in the rational design of cleaning and decontamination procedures in food processing facilities. 3adairies 3acheesemaking 3afood processing equipment 3astainless steel 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aserotypes 3abacterial adhesion 3ashear stress 3afluid mechanics 3astatic testing 3adecontamination 3acleaning1 aAldsworth, T.G.1 aJordan, S.J.1 aFernandes, I.1 aBarbosa, M.1 aSol, M.1 aTenreiro, R.P.1 aChambel, L.1 aZilhao, I.1 aBarata, B.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2007 May 30, v. 116, no. 3 p.384-390dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02543naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001800162245008100180300001600261500002400277520118600301650001301487650001501500650001201515650002301527650001501550650001701565650001901582650002201601650001201623650002301635650002301658651000901681700001901690700001601709700001901725700002001744700001601764773012101780852000901901856009401910930003302004945002502037946001102062655001202073IND4390766120221123014051.0070501e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439076612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2011 aTajkarimi, M.10aSeasonal study of aflatoxin M1 contamination in milk in five regions in Iran  ap. 346-349.  aIncludes references  aBetween April 2003 and February 2004, 98 samples of raw milk were obtained from milk tanks in one dairy plant in each of five regions in Iran. These were chosen with mean distances apart of 400 km, whereby they have different ecologies (temperature, relative humidity, etc.) and different agricultural products were used for animal feeding. Samples (24-25 per season) were laboratory heat treated and were analyzed for aflatoxin M1 with a validated High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. The overall mean of all samples was 0.041-0.065 μg/L (95% confidence) and the adjusted mean based on statistical modification was 0.039 ppb: 61 samples had 0.000-0.050 μg/L, 29 samples were contaminated with 0.05-0.10 μg/L, and the remaining 8 samples had 0.1-0.39 μg/L. All of the samples were lower than Codex Alimentarius and FDA standards (0.5 μg/L). Levels of aflatoxin M1 were higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.07). However, the level of aflatoxin in milk from one region (Hamedan) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in those of the other regions (Gorgan, Rasht, Shiraz, Tehran). 3araw milk 3amilk tanks 3adairies 3afood contamination 3aecologists 3aaflatoxin M1 3afood pathogens 3afood intoxication 3aseasons 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aseasonal variation 3aIran1 aAliabadi, F.S.1 aNejad, M.S.1 aPursoltani, H.1 aMotallebi, A.A.1 aMahdavi, H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2007 May 30, v. 116, no. 3 p.346-349dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02810naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002000180245010700200300001600307500002400323500001500347520135900362650002201721650001901743650002801762650002701790650002201817650001901839650001301858650001901871650002001890650002801910650002101938653001701959653002701976700001802003700001402021773012102035852000902156856009402165930003302259945002502292946001102317655001202328IND4390766720221123014116.0070501e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439076672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ200 0aX1001 aCorradini, M.G.10aModeling non-isothermal heat inactivation of microorganisms having biphasic isothermal survival curves  ap. 391-399.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiphasic isothermal inactivation constitutes a special case of non-linear mortality kinetics. It can be modeled with a primary model that contains an 'If' statement and three temperature dependent survival parameters: the first and second logarithmic inactivation rate constants and the time of the transition from one phase to the other. The temperature dependence of the two inactivation rates of Salmonella enteritidis and that of the transition time determined from published data could be described by empirical logistic terms. These were used to construct an inactivation rate equation for non-isothermal heating and cooling regimes. The resulting differential equation, despite having an 'If' statement in its formulation, could be easily solved numerically for simple as well elaborate temperature profiles. The solutions for a variety of realistic heat treatment histories indicated that when the heating or cooling rate is high enough, the biphasic character of the inactivation disappears. This is true regardless of whether the rate at the first phase is higher than at the second, the most common scenario, or vice versa. Theoretically, the same will happen with inactivation caused by a non thermal agent whose intensity increases or diminishes, in biphasic growth under rapidly varying conditions and in enzymatic activity or inactivation. 3aheat inactivation 3adynamic models 3abacterial contamination 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3afood preservation 3afood pathogens 3akinetics 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3apredictive microbiology 3anonlinear models 0ainactivation 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aNormand, M.D.1 aPeleg, M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2007 May 30, v. 116, no. 3 p.391-399dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001900180245007100199300001600270500002400286520122000310650001501530650002401545650001001569650001601579650001201595650001601607650002101623650001701644650002001661700001701681700001401698700001601712700001501728773009301743852000901836856009401845930003301939945002501972946001101997655001202008IND4390764620221123013938.0070501e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439076462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aGuenette, S.A.10aPharmacokinetics of eugenol in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 262-265.  aIncludes references  aClove oil, eugenol being its main constituent, has been used to anaesthetise fish for the last decade however no pharmacokinetic study of this drug has yet been realised in fish. The objective of the present study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters following immersion of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a eugenol solution. A total of 30 fish (n = 3 per time point) of similar length and weight were immersed in a solution of 75 mg/L of eugenol for 15 min. After thorough rinsing, individuals were placed in a recuperation tank in oxygenated conditioned water. Blood samples were collected at selected time points (at predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h) post-exposition. The samples were then submitted to mass spectrometry analysis using dansyl-chloride derivatisation. Pharmacokinetic results obtained are a Cmax of 10.53 μg/mL, a AUC0-t 16.55 μg h/mL, AUC0-inf 17.04 μg h/mL and a half life of 12.14 h. These results indicate that eugenol is well absorbed and eliminated using a bath immersion at 4 °C. The long half life suggests that eugenol may accumulate in trout following repeated administration and further studies are required to evaluate its potential toxicity. 3afish farms 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atrout 3afarmed fish 3aeugenol 3aanesthetics 3apharmacokinetics 3afish culture 3aanimal handling1 aUhland, F.C.1 aHelie, P.1 aBeaudry, F.1 aVachon, P.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.262-265dElsevier Pub.

Results show that all liposomes tested in this study were much more oxidatively stable than a commercial product based on fish oil emulsion. Whereas the initial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration in the emulsion was only slightly higher than in liposomes, the concentration of TBARS in the emulsion increased up to values three orders of magnitude above those registered by liposomes after 21 h of incubation. Among the different liposome formulations, results indicate that vesicles composed of phospholipids containing long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (krill phospholipid extract) were generally less stable than those composed of shorter length-chain and more saturated acyl chains. In regards to the particle size changes during enrichment, all liposomes maintained their original size during the experimental period when incubated without nauplii. In the presence of nauplii, liposomes did not exhibit notable changes in their size, except for unilamellar vesicles prepared by the extrusion methodology and formulated with soybean phosphatidylcholine. The implications of the results on the capability of liposomes to be used in Artemia nauplii enrichments are discussed. 3afish culture 3afatty acid composition 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aArtemia 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3along chain fatty acids 3alive feeds 3aoxidative stability 3afish larvae 3aliposomes (artificial) 3afish feeding 0adipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine 0aphospholipids1 aNavarro, J.C.1 aAmat, F.1 aGonzalez, P.1 aHontoria, F.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.200-210dElsevier Pub.

LFK was prepared by removing exoskeletons from dried whole krill to give a fluoride content of approximately one-fourth of krill meal (KM) at 230 ppm for LFK and 870 ppm for KM. Experimental diets replaced FM with LFK at the replacement proportions of 0.0%, 7.7%, 15.4%, 30.8%, 46.2% and 100.0% (control, LFK7, LFK15, LFK30, LFK46 and LFK100) and were fed to groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in duplicate for 95 days in fresh water and growth was observed. In all experimental groups, feed intake, feed efficiency, specific growth rate and hepatosomatic index were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet (P < 0.05). After 95 days, the fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of the fish of each experimental group, except LFK100, was below the detectable limit (1 mg/kg), and in vertebral bones it was between 220 mg/kg and 420 mg/kg. However, the dorsal muscle and the vertebral bone of LFK100 contained 1 mg/kg and 1800 mg/kg of fluoride, respectively. Tissue specimens of the liver of each experimental group at 95 days had no histopathological changes. The total replacement of FM from LFK in diets was successful with no defects of growth performances. This study showed that krill protein had a nutritional value equivalent to FM. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afarmed fish 3atrout 3aanimal growth 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3amuscle tissues 3achemical composition 3afeeds 3afeed composition 3adietary protein 3afish meal 3aEuphausia superba 3afluorides 3afish feeding 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 0ahepatosomatic index1 aAoki, M.1 aOshima, S.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.219-225dElsevier Pub.

Fish were subjected to long-term (i) food deprivation, (ii) exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, (iii) hypoxia, respectively. Fish growth (fork length and body weight) and scale increments (circulus number and radius length) were measured. Results of Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between scale increment and growth for the red drum (fast growing) and the marine medaka (small sized) (r = 0.741-0.882, p < 0.001). For the slow growing orange-spotted grouper, a significant correlation was found only between body weight and circulus number (r = 0.406, p < 0.05). Overall, scale circulus number is more consistently linked to fish growth than that of radius length. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that daily circulus deposition on scales of fast-growing red drum is feasible to indicate daily growth of the fish. Moreover, scale increment exhibited the strongest correlation with fish growth as compared to that of serum T3 level and muscle RNA:DNA ratio. Our data support the use of scale increment as a means of indicating fish growth and growth impairment, particularly for the fast growing fish. 3aSciaenops ocellatus 3aEpinephelus coioides 3agrouper 3aanimal growth 3afeed deprivation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aoxygen 3afish feeding 3afish culture 3amariculture 0aOryzia melastigma 0abenzo(a)pyrene1 aChaille, P.M.1 aRandall, D.J.1 aGray, J.S.1 aAu, D.W.T.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.102-111dElsevier Pub.

By cloning, sequencing and designing alternative PCR primers the tetracycline resistance gene tet(E) was found in (27/30) 90% of the previously negatively tested Aeromonas spp. The strains originated from farmed fish, water and sediment in Denmark (n = 27) and Canada (n = 3). The tet(E) gene was in several cases located on large horizontally transferable plasmids (approx. 150 kb) capable of interspecies transfer to Escherichia coli. This is the first report of horizontally transferable tet(E). Additionally, 15 motile Aeromonas strains with previously identified tetracycline resistance genes were tested, and this on one hand verified former findings of tet(E), but also identified more than one tet gene in some strains. The use of multiplex PCR for detection of tet(E) should be done with caution. tet(E) seems to occur frequently in Aeromonas spp. from fish farms and may spread horizontally among bacteria in the aquatic environment. 3afish culture 3afish farms 3atetracycline 3aAeromonas bestiarum 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afreshwater aquaculture 3aplasmids 3aAeromonas sobria 3afish diseases 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3abacterial infections 3adrug resistance 3aCanada 3aDenmark 0aAeromonas1 aBruun, M.S.1 aDalsgaard, I.1 aLarsen, J.L.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.47-52dElsevier Pub.

At 60% RH, 60% of the nymphs emerged and survived, while with 0% RH only approximately equal to 15% of eggs hatched, and most nymphs died. Emerged nymphs from egg masses placed in plastic boxes with a gradient of humidity remained on egg shells for ca. one day. After this period, they dispersed and regrouped on top of shells 6.8 ± 0.67 times, until they abandoned the shells toward the source of humidity, avoiding the water-saturated areas. Duration taken for each rearrangement (dispersal + regroup) increased with time, with a range of approximately equal to 26 min to 44 min. The mean duration of the grouping behavior on egg shells after each rearrangement decreased from approximately equal to 102 min (1(st)) to 24 min (6(th) and last grouping). The rearrangement behavior of 1(st) instars on top of egg shells apparently compensates for the water loss of nymphs. 3aNezara viridula 3arelative humidity 3ainsect development 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aHemipteraxgrowth & development 2aHumidity 2aNymph 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTime Factors 0aPentatomidae1 aPanizzi, A.R.1 aCattelan, A.J.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2006 , v. 35, no. 6 p.757-761dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1519-566X20060006&lng=en&nrm=iso3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245013100198300001400329500002400343520131500367650001501682650001701697650001501714650002601729650001701755650001801772650002501790650002301815650002701838650003101865650001601896650002301912650001801935651001101953700001301964700002001977700001901997700001902016773009102035852000902126856009402135930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4390757320221123001110.0070501e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439075732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aM001 0aM1201 aMikkelsen, H.10aVariability among Vibrio anguillarum O2 isolates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.): Characterisation and vaccination studies  ap. 16-25.  aIncludes references  aFarmed Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., in Norway are vaccinated against Vibrio anguillarum serotypes O1, O2a and O2b, but outbreaks of classical vibriosis remain relatively common. In the present study, V. anguillarum isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated cod between 2002 and 2005, were shown to differ in biochemical, serological and genetic characteristics compared to V. anguillarum serotypes O2a and O2b. They did not utilize sorbitol and some were shown to be lysine decarboxylase positive or did not produce gelatinase. Furthermore, they displayed varying reaction patterns with monoclonal antibodies, and appeared in a separate cluster in a similarity dendrogram based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) analysis, distant from the cluster containing both serotypes O2a and O2b. The results indicate that these V. anguillarum isolates belong to a sero-subtype other than O2a or O2b. The efficacy of ALPHA MARINE Vibrio vaccine in cod varied depending on the V. anguillarum O2 isolate used for challenge. The vaccine elicited good protection against bath challenge with isolates of V. anguillarum O2b and O2a (RPS > 80) comparable to the vaccine strains, but protected poorly (RPS of 32) or not at all when challenged with two recent and differing isolates from diseased vaccinated cod. 3afish farms 3aGadus morhua 3acod (fish) 3afarmed animal species 3afish culture 3afish diseases 3abacterial infections 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3avaccination 3adisease prevention 3apathogenicity 3aNorway1 aLund, V.1 aMartinsen, L.C.1 aGravningen, K.1 aSchroder, M.B.0 tAquaculture.g2007 June 1, v. 266, no. 1-4 p.16-25dElsevier Pub.

Specimens of L. eximia were monthly collected in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, during two years and the adult females dissected to estimate fecundity. Body size was estimated by measuring wing and tibia. Fecundity and body size were seasonally analysed. A relatively constant temporal trajectory was found for fecundity, wing and tibia size over twenty-four months. Strong positive correlations between wing and tibia size, fecundity and wing and fecundity and tibia were observed. The maintenance of stable values in L. eximia indicates that it has suffered little seasonal influence over the period analysed. This result confirms the demographics and life history stable profile of the species in spite of seasonal climatic changes observed in the study area. 3aLucilia 3afecundity 3ainsect surveys 3aseasonal variation 3abody size 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aFertility 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSeasons 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aLucilia eximia 0aCalliphoridae1 aGodoy, W.A.C.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2006 , v. 35, no. 6 p.753-756dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1519-566X20060006&lng=en&nrm=iso3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151100001700160242016800177245015500345300001600500500002400516500002400540520142900564650001701993650001702010650001002027650001702037650001202054650001402066651001102080700002002091773010902111852000902220856009102229856013102320930003302451945002502484946001102509655001202520IND4390757020140723000000.0070501e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND439075702DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL3001 aLofego, A.C.10aÁcaros (Acari) associados a mirtáceas (Myrtaceae) em áreas de cerrado no estado de São Paulo com análise faunística das famílias Phytoseiidae e Tarsonemidae10aMites (Acari) associated to Myrtaceae in areas of Cerrado in the State of São Paulo with faunistic analysis of families Tarsonemidae and Phytoseiidae  ap. 731-746.  aIncludes references  aSummary in English.  aThe objective of this study was to determine and to analyse the diversity of mites on native Myrtaceae of the "Cerrado" vegetation type of the State of São Paulo, with particular attention to the families Phytoseiidae and Tarsonemidae. In the year 2000, mites were collected from Myrtaceae species in three "Cerrado" areas in the State of São Paulo. Samples of leaves, flowers and fruits were taken from three plant of each species in each site. Mites of 49 genera belonging to 14 families were found. Fourteen phytoseiid species of nine genera and 19 tarsonemid species of six genera were collected. The most abundant phytoseiids were Euseius citrifolius Denmark & Muma, Transeius bellottii (Moraes & Mesa) and Amblyseius acalyphus Denmark & Muma. The most abundant tarsonemids were Daidalotarsonemus tesselatus DeLeon, Daidalotarsonemus folisetae Lofego & Ochoa and Metatarsonemus megasolenidii Lofego & Ochoa. The highest indexes of diversity of phytoseiids and tarsonemids were observed in the fall; the lowest indexes were found in the winter for phytoseiids and in the spring for tarsonemids. Taking into consideration the total number of phytoseiids and tarsonemids collected in this work, the corresponding indexes of diversity (Shannon) were similar and close to 2.0. Different predatory mite species prevailed on distinct plant species, indicating the complementariness of the latter as reservoirs of the former. 3aTarsonemidae 3aPhytoseiidae 3amites 3abiodiversity 3acerrado 3aMyrtaceae 3aBrazil1 aMoraes, G.J. de0 tNeotropical entomology.g2006 , v. 35, no. 6 p.731-746dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20060006000033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1519-566X20060006&lng=en&nrm=iso3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002200158245011900180300001600299500002400315520092200339650001801261650002401279650001901303650002801322650002301350650002801373650000801401650003001409650001001439650001401449700002601463700001801489700002301507773019101530852000901721856008901730930003301819945002501852946001101877655001201888IND4390755320140723000000.0070501e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439075532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2021 aEstrada, C.S.M.L.10aComparison of DNA extraction methods for pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica detection from meat food by nested PCR  ap. 637-642.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this work was to compare three different methods of DNA extraction from meat food, and to determine whether these methods removed inhibitors of nested PCR for pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica detection. The amplification of the yadA gene from the DNA obtained from a pure Y. enterocolitica culture could be carried out with all the protocols. DNA amplification from the food samples was observed with two of the three tested protocols, which gave highly sensitive amplifications (detection limit 1 CFU/ml). These protocols detected a lower limit of 0.6 fg/microliter of DNA extracted from Y. enterocolitica pure culture. We concluded that these protocols were able to eliminate satisfactorily the PCR inhibitors present in the foods. The nested PCR tested could be used satisfactorily in the investigation of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in foods in the presence of a high background of microflora. 3ameat products 3amicrobial detection 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aphenotype1 aVelázquez, L. del C.1 aDi Genaro, S.1 aGuzmán, A.M.S. de0 tFood research international.g2007 June, v. 40, no. 5 p.637-642dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20070814b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03011naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245011000185300001600295500002400311520150700335650001501842650002501857650002801882650005901910650002001969650002601989650002302015650002102038650002202059650002502081650002302106650001402129650001702143700001802160700001702178773019102195852000902386856008902395930003302484945002502517946001102542655001202553IND4390754320221123001052.0070501e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439075432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aT2001 aCollado, M.C.10aIn vitro analysis of probiotic strain combinations to inhibit pathogen adhesion to human intestinal mucus  ap. 629-636.  aIncludes references  aCompetition with pathogens for adhesion and colonization of the mucosal surfaces are possible protective mechanisms of probiotics. In this study we evaluated the ability of commercial strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus LC705, B. breve 99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS) each strain alone and in different combinations to inhibit, displace and compete with selected pathogens in order to test the influence of the presence of the other probiotic in the adhesion pathogens to immobilized mucus. The ability to inhibit the adhesion or to displace adhered pathogens was variable depending on both the probiotic combination and the pathogen tested. Our results demonstrate that different probiotic combinations were able to enhance the inhibition percentages to pathogen adhesion to intestinal mucus. All probiotic combinations tested in this study showed inhibition abilities against pathogen infection with values which were over 40% for some pathogens tested. Combinations had specific properties and inhibition abilities against some or all of the tested pathogens. These results suggest that combinations of probiotics strains could be useful and more effective in inhibition of pathogen adhesion. The inhibition and displacement profiles were very different suggesting that different mechanisms are implied in both processes. Selection of new probiotic combinations should be conducted for specific target pathogens or pathogen associated microbiota aberrancies. 3aprobiotics 3alactic acid bacteria 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aPropionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 3aBifidobacterium 3acompetitive exclusion 3acolonizing ability 3ain vitro culture 3aintestinal mucosa 3abacterial infections 3abacterial adhesion 3asynergism 3ahealth foods1 aMeriluoto, J.1 aSalminen, S.0 tFood research international.g2007 June, v. 40, no. 5 p.629-636dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20070814b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02444naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001600167245009800183300001600281500002400297520100700321650001801328650002401346650001401370650001901384650002501403650002601428650002601454650003301480650001801513650002401531650001001555650001001565650002401575700001501599700001401614773019101628852000901819856008901828930003301917945002501950946001101975655001201986IND4390755620221122231504.0070501e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439075562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aS2001 aYap, K.Y.L.10aInfrared-based protocol for the identification and categorization of ginseng and its products  ap. 643-652.  aIncludes references  aQuality assurance of ginseng is important since many ginseng products sold today are in various formulations, and it is difficult to identify them by morphological means such as physical appearance, smell, or even taste. Different chemical constituents in herbs like ginseng tend to exhibit characteristic infrared fingerprints. We have established a simple and rapid protocol based on infrared wavelengths and principal component analysis for the identification and categorization of ginseng, and called it the 2-6PC rule. The advantage of this protocol is that it is able to provide rapid identification of natural products since it avoids tedious extraction or purification procedures. Our results show that this protocol was not only able to discriminate raw ginseng roots, but also different types of ginsengs in three commercial ginseng products. The potential of the novel 2-6PC rule as a rapid quality surveillance tool in the authentication of ginseng and its products is definitely appealing. 3aPanax ginseng 3aPanax quinquefolius 3acultivars 3aplant taxonomy 3aproduct authenticity 3astandards of identity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3arapid methods 3aphysical properties 3asmell 3ataste 3adietary supplements1 aChan, S.Y.1 aLim, C.S.0 tFood research international.g2007 June, v. 40, no. 5 p.643-652dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20070814b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03676naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001900189245017100208300001600379500002400395500001500419520154200434650002001976650001901996650001602015650001702031650001402048650000902062650001102071650001002082650001202092650001902104650001902123650001602142650001202158650001502170650001202185650005102197650002802248650002902276650001102305650000902316650000902325650002402334650003102358650002102389650003102410650003402441650001902475650002202494653002502516653003002541653001602571700002002587700002602607700002202633700002402655773010202679852000902781856009302790930003302883945002502916946001302941655001202954IND4390921120221122220257.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439092112DNAL7 a174619492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00258.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aHAVIG, MARC E.10aRelationship of Tibial Plateau Slope to Limb Function in Dogs Treated with a Lateral Suture Technique for Stabilization of Cranial Cruciate Ligament Deficient Stifles  ap. 245-251.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate the effect of a lateral suture technique (LST) on tibial plateau angle (TPA) measurement and to compare TPA with functional outcome in dogs treated for cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) rupture with LST. Prospective clinical study. Dogs (n=34) with unilateral CrCL instability. All dogs had lameness examination, survey stifle radiographs, and force plate analysis before and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after surgery. Radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) scores and lameness scores were assigned using previously reported methods. Preoperative radiographs were performed in all dogs, and postoperative serial radiographs were performed in 6 dogs for measurement of TPA. Differences in TPA measurements were evaluated with a random effects repeated measures model. The significance of LST on TPA measurement was established in 6 dogs and the effect of TPA on vertical impulse, peak vertical force, progression of radiographic scores, and lameness score were analyzed by general linear models in all dogs. Differences were considered significant if P<.05. Significant differences were not noted between pre- and serial postoperative measurements of TPA. A significant correlation was not established between TPA and postoperative vertical impulse, peak vertical force, lameness score, or radiographic OA scores. TPA values were unchanged after LST and TPA does not affect outcome measures in dogs treated with LST. TPA has no predictive value on clinical outcome in dogs treated with LST for stabilization of CrCL deficient stifles. 3apathophysiology 3adisease course 3aradiography 3adog diseases 3aligaments 3adogs 3astifle 3atibia 3asurgery 3ajoint diseases 3alimbs (animal) 3ameasurement 3asutures 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aAnterior Cruciate Ligamentxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aDogsxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aFemale 2aGait 2aMale 2aProspective Studies 2aRange of Motion, Articular 2aRupturexsurgery 2aStiflexinjuriesxsurgery. 2aSuture Techniquesxveterinary 2aTibiaxsurgery 2aTreatment Outcome 0atibial plateau angle 0acranial cruciate ligament 0amethodology1 aDyce, Jonathan.1 aKOWALESKI, MICHAEL P.1 aREYNOLDS, LISA R.1 aBUDSBERG, STEVEN C.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2007 Apr., v. 36, no. 3 p.245-251dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00258.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/02/25  aOther US 7aarticle03298naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002400180245007100204300001600275500002400291500001500315520125900330650002101589650002801610650002001638650001501658650002001673650001001693650001401703650001901717650002701736650001801763650002001781650002101801650007401822650001201896650002101908650002101929650006901950650002302019650001102042650002202053650001502075650002602090650004202116650004002158650001402198650002402212653001702236700001802253700002602271700001802297700001502315773013502330852000902465856009302474930003302567945002502600946001102625655001202636IND4390913320221122192336.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439091332DNAL7 a174726572pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2007.00858.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aINGVAST-LARSSON, C.10aClinical pharmacology of buprenorphine in healthy, lactating goats  ap. 249-256.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe pharmacokinetics and the effects of the opioid buprenorphine on behavior, cardiovascular parameters, plasma concentrations of cortisol and vasopressin were studied in the goat. After intravenous injection at a dosage of 0.02 mg/kg bw, the terminal half-life was 73.8 ± 19.9 min (mean ± SD), the apparent volume of distribution 5.22 ± 1.01 L/kg, and total body clearance 79.1 ± 18.5 mL/min/kg. After intramuscular administration of buprenorphine at the same dosage, bioavailability was complete and clearance was 54.7 ± 16.6 mL/min/kg. Heart rate, blood pressure and concentrations of cortisol and vasopressin in plasma increased after drug administration. The goats became agitated and stopped ruminating. The effects were more pronounced the first time the animals received the drug, especially the influence on the hormone levels. The concentrations of cortisol and vasopressin in plasma remained unaffected after the second dose despite a wash-out period of 3-6 weeks. Buprenorphine may be an unsuitable drug in goats because of the profound inhibition of rumination and the agitation it causes. The short half-life of buprenorphine may limit its use if long-term analgesia is required but be advantageous if a short acting drug is desirable. 3aveterinary drugs 3aintramuscular injection 3aanimal behavior 3arumination 3adrug evaluation 3agoats 3alactation 3arumen motility 3aphysiological response 3abuprenorphine 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesic effect 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBuprenorphinexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aGoatsxmetabolism 2aHeart Rate 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aInjections, Intravenousxveterinary 2aLactation 2aVasopressinsxblood 0apharmacology1 aSVARTBERG, K.1 aHYDBRING-SANDBERG, E.1 aBONDESSON, U.1 aOLSSON, K.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2007 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.249-256dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2007.00858.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03564naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001500180245011000195300001600305500002400321520159400345650002101939650002401960650001601984650001602000650002402016650001202040650002202052650001002074650001002084650002102094650003202115650001102147650002502158650001202183650003302195650008402228650002102312650003002333650004302363650003602406650002302442650007402465650001102539650002302550650000902573650003102582700001702613700001402630773013502644852000902779856009302788930003302881945002502914946001102939655001202950IND4390910820221122192401.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439091082DNAL7 a174726492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2007.00857.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aWOMBLE, A.10aPharmacokinetics of oral doxycycline and concentrations in body fluids and bronchoalveolar cells of foals  ap. 187-193.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to determine the disposition of orally administered doxycycline in foals. Six healthy 4- to 8-week-old foals were used. Doxycycline was administered to each foal via the intragastric (IG) route at dosages of 10 and 20 mg/kg, in a cross-over design. After the first 10 mg/kg dose, five additional doses were administered at 12-h intervals. A microbiological assay was used to measure doxycycline activity in serum, urine, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal (CSF), pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF), and bronchoalveolar (BAL) cells. Following administration at 10 mg/kg, mean ± SD time to peak serum doxycycline activity (tmax) was 3.0 ± 1.2 h, maximum serum activity (Cmax) was 2.54 ± 0.27 μg/mL, and terminal half-life (t₁/₂) was 8.5 ± 2.8 h. Administration at a dose of 20 mg/kg resulted in a significantly longer tmax (5.5 ± 1.8 h) as well as a tendency toward higher Cmax (2.89 ± 0.33 μg/mL) and longer t₁/₂ (11.9 ± 2.6 h). After multiple IG doses, doxycycline activity in CSF was significantly lower than concurrent serum activity, whereas peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and BAL cell doxycycline activity was similar to concurrent serum activity. Doxycycline activity in urine and PELF was significantly higher than that found at other sites. Oral administration at a dosage of 10 mg/kg every 12 h would maintain serum, PELF, and BAL cell activity above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of Rhodococcus equi, β-hemolytic streptococci, and other susceptible bacterial pathogens for the entire dosing interval. 3apharmacokinetics 3aoral administration 3adoxycycline 3abody fluids 3atissue distribution 3abronchi 3apulmonary alveoli 3acells 3afoals 3aveterinary drugs 3aintragastric administration 3adosage 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aArea Under Curve 2aAscitic Fluidxmetabolism 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxcytology 2aCerebrospinal Fluidxmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDoxycyclinexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aFemale 2aHorsesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aSynovial Fluidxmetabolism1 aGIGUÈRE, S.1 aLEE, E.A.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2007 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.187-193dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2007.00857.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03465naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001900180245006100199300001600260500002400276520164300300650000901943650001701952650002201969650001901991650002502010650001002035650002502045650001102070650001402081650004402095650007502139650001202214650002502226650006402251650002902315650000902344650001102353650006102364650006802425650000902493650002202502653003102524700001502555700001502570700001602585773011502601852000902716856009302725930003302818945002502851946001102876655001202887IND4390891120221122192357.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439089112DNAL7 a174256942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aWilliams, D.L.10aReduced tear production in three canine endocrinopathies  ap. 252-256.  aIncludes references  aPrevious reports have suggested that hypothyroid and diabetic patients can be predisposed to keratoconjunctivitis sicca. This study aimed to measure tear production in dogs with diabetes, hypothyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism using the Schirmer tear test and to compare these results with Schirmer tear test values for a group of normal dogs. Schirmer tear tests were performed on 16 dogs with hyperadrenocorticism, 18 with diabetes and 12 with hypothyroidism together with 100 control dogs. Corneal sensitivity was also measured in 12 of the 18 diabetic dogs with a Cochet Bonnet aesthesiometer and compared with age- and breed-matched normal dogs. Schirmer tear test values in dogs with hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes were 12·3±3·2, 14·0±4·0 and 12·3±5·3 mm/minutes, respectively. Schirmer tear test values were significantly lower than that for the control group (19·6±4·2 mm/minutes) in all dogs with an endocrinopathy. Only in two hypothyroid dogs and three diabetics, this was manifested as profound keratoconjunctivitis sicca with Schirmer tear test value lower than 5 mm/minutes. Diabetic dogs had significantly reduced corneal sensitivity compared with a matched set of control dogs. This study shows a significant reduction in tear production in animals with diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which this reduction in tear production occurs. Assessment of tear production should be undertaken in animals diagnosed with these endocrinopathies, as these animals may progress to clinical keratoconjunctivitis sicca. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3adiabetes mellitus 3ahypothyroidism 3ahyperadrenocorticism 3atears 3akeratoconjunctivitis 3acornea 3asecretion 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAdrenocortical Hyperfunctionxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitusxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxmetabolism 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHypothyroidismxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aKeratoconjunctivitis Siccaxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aTearsxsecretion. 0akeratoconjunctivitis sicca1 aPierce, V.1 aMellor, P.1 aHeath, M.F.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2007 May, v. 48, no. 5 p.252-256dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00349.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02966naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002700179245019000206300001800396500002400414520140800438650001401846650002001860650003401880650001901914650002401933650002101957650002401978650002202002650001702024650001102041650001902052650001402071650002402085650001502109650002002124650002702144700002002171773010802191852000902299856009302308930003302401945002502434946001302459655001202472IND4390868720221122192408.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439086872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aQ305 0aX1001 aCliffe-Byrnes, Valerie10aEffects of Gas Atmosphere and Temperature on the Respiration Rates of Whole and Sliced Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus)-- Implications for Film Permeability in Modified Atmosphere Packages  ap. E197-E204.  aIncludes references  aAn open flowthrough respirometer was used to determine the respiration rates of whole and sliced mushrooms as a function of O₂, CO₂, and storage temperature. Respiration rates were measured under the following O₂ concentrations: 20, 15, 10, 5, and 2% at 5 temperatures (4, 8, 10, 13, and 16 °C). The effects of 5 CO₂ concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, 15%) at two O₂ levels (2 and 20%) were also examined at these temperatures. Mushroom respiration increased with temperature following an Arrhenius-type relationship; activation energies and corresponding Q₁₀ values were calculated. Lowering the oxygen concentration significantly decreased the respiration rate. The effects of reducing O₂ levels were greater at higher storage temperatures. Both activation energies and Q₁₀ values were lower under reduced O₂ atmospheres compared with those in air. A Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics model was evaluated for describing the influence of gas concentrations on respiration rate. The effects of O₂ fitted the O₂ enzyme kinetics model well. CO₂ exhibited small inhibitory effects on respiration of whole and sliced mushrooms, especially at low O₂ concentrations and low temperatures. The enzyme model was used to predict respiration under an optimal modified atmosphere for mushrooms, and the required film O₂ and CO₂ permeabilities were defined for key pack design parameters. 3amushrooms 3afresh-cut foods 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood packaging 3astorage temperature 3acell respiration 3apackaging materials 3afilms (materials) 3apermeability 3aoxygen 3acarbon dioxide 3aequations 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aenzyme kinetics 3apostharvest physiology1 aO'Beirne, David0 tJournal of food science.g2007 May, v. 72, no. 4 p.E197-E204dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00321.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/21  aOther US 7aarticle01858naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001500159245010400174300001600278500002400294520074800318650002301066650000801089650002701097650002001124650002301144650001901167650002201186650002301208773009601231852000901327856009101336930003301427945002501460946001101485655001201496IND4390836320221122151538.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439083632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aPino, J.A.10aCharacterization of rum using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 421-428.  aIncludes references  aHeadspace solid-phase microextraction was used to extract and analyze volatile compounds in different aged rums.

The extraction procedure, using a 100 μm PDMS fibre with 35 min at 30 °C, permitted the isolation of a large quantity of volatile compounds. One hundred and eighty-four volatile compounds were identified, including 64 esters, 47 benzenic compounds, 16 terpenoids, 14 alcohols, 10 acetals, 9 aldehydes, 6 phenols, 6 ketones, 6 furans, 3 acids and 3 benzopyrans. Semi-quantitative analysis, based on area percent, showed very good reproducibility. The use of only 15 volatile compounds permits a differentiation between the 3- and 7 year-old rums. 3aheadspace analysis 3arum 3asolid phase extraction 3amicroextraction 3agas chromatography 3asugar products 3amass spectrometry 3avolatile compounds0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 1 p.421-428dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.09.0313Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02506naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001600168245008900184300001600273500002400289500001500313520104300328650002601371650001801397650001401415650001001429650002101439650001901460650002801479650001501507650003601522650002501558650002301583651000901606653001901615700001301634700001501647700001401662700001401676700001501690700001801705773009601723852000901819856009101828930003301919945002501952946001101977655001201988IND4390835520221122151508.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439083552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aBouayed, J.10aComparative evaluation of the antioxidant potential of some Iranian medicinal plants  ap. 364-368.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMedicinal plants are a source for a wide variety of natural antioxidants. In the study reported here, we have conducted a comparative study between five medicinal plants having the same geographic origin: the Hamadan region in the west of Iran and growing in the same natural conditions. The amount of total phenolics and total flavonoids for parts of these plants used in Iranian popular medicine were evaluated. Furthermore, antioxidant activities for these parts using vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) test were also evaluated. The results show that the antioxidant activities varied greatly among the different plant parts used in this study and some plants are rich in natural antioxidants especially leaves of Lavandula officinalis and of Melissa officinalis. A positive correlation between total phenolic or flavonoid contents and VCEAC was found with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.961 and R2 = 0.817, respectively. These findings show that phenolics in these plants provide substantial antioxidant activity. 3aValeriana officinalis 3afree radicals 3aLamiaceae 3aAlcea 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3afree radical scavengers 3aflavonoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aantioxidant activity 3aphenolic compounds 3aIran 0aphytochemicals1 aPiri, K.1 aRammal, H.1 aDicko, A.1 aDesor, F.1 aYounos, C.1 aSoulimani, R.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 1 p.364-368dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0693Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245011900182300001600301500002400317520126400341650002501605650002801630650002301658650002501681650003601706650001701742653002201759653001701781700001301798700001401811773009601825852000901921856009101930930003302021945002502054946001102079655001202090IND4390834720221122151459.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439083472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aLoo, A.Y.10aAntioxidant and radical scavenging activities of the pyroligneous acid from a mangrove plant, Rhizophora apiculata  ap. 300-307.  aIncludes references  aTotal phenolics content, free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and antioxidant activity of the pyroligenous acid from a mangrove plant, Rhizophora apiculata were evaluated. Dichloromethane extraction of the raw pyroligneous acid successfully yield 2 extracts, i.e. concentrated pyroligneous acid (CPA) and concentrated pyroligneous acid extract (CPAE). Phenolic contents in CPAE and CPA, expressed as (±)-catechin equivalents/g of the sample were 5465 ± 367 mg and 2502 ± 152 mg, and expressed as gallic acid equivalents/g of the sample were 2919 ± 209 mg and 1348 ± 90 mg, respectively. CPAE exhibited superior free radical scavenging activity with EC50 value = 0.1235 mg/ml, or 80.96% of free radical scavenging capability. The ferric reducing power of CPAE was approximately 3.7, 5.1, 6.1, and 21.3 times higher than that of ascorbic acid, BHA, BHT and alpha-tocopherol. In phosphomolybdenum assay, CPAE showed the greatest antioxidant efficacy (A695 = 1.278) compared to those of CPA and different standards. In addition, the free radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing power and total antioxidative activity of CPAE and CPA showed positive correlation with their total phenolic content with R2 values ranging from 0.9624 to 0.9979. 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radical scavengers 3aphenolic compounds 3aRhizophora apiculata 3achemical constituents of plants 3afermentation 0apyroligneous acid 0aDPPH radical1 aJain, K.1 aDarah, I.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 1 p.300-307dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0483Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002100173245010000194300001600294500002400310500001500334520076700349650002201116650001001138650002601148650002701174650001401201650003001215650002301245650002501268650001001293650001501303650002401318650001501342650002301357650003201380650001201412650002901424650001101453650003701464650005401501650003801555650001101593650001501604650007601619650001401695650004201709650001501751650002301766650002701789651002401816653002801840653002301868653002201891653001201913653001801925773012001943852000902063856008602072930003302158945002502191946001102216655001202227IND4390932120221122114456.0070506e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439093212DNAL7 a172942622pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-007-0012-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aHemmatzadeh, F. 10aSequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis of gp51 Gene of Bovine Leukaemia Virus in Iranian Isolates  ap. 783-789.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnalysis of the partial bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) gp51 gene sequences obtained from five BLV strains isolated in different regions of Iran and BLV-FLK strain was carried out.

C306 were subjected to severe water deficit directly or through stress cycles of increasing intensity with intermittent recovery periods (drought acclimation). The antioxidant defense in terms of redox metabolites and enzymes in leaf cells, chloroplasts, and mitochondria was examined in relation to ROS-induced membrane damage. Drought-acclimated seedlings modulated growth by maintaining favorable turgor potential and RWC and were able to limit H₂O₂ accumulation and membrane damage as compared with non-acclimated plants during severe water stress conditions. This was due to systematic upregulation of H₂O₂-metabolizing enzymes especially ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and by maintaining ascorbate-glutathione redox pool in acclimated plants. By contrast, failure in the induction of APX and ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes makes the chloroplast susceptible to oxidative stress in non-acclimated plants. Non-acclimated plants protected the leaf mitochondria from oxidative stress by upregulating superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), APX, and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) activities. Rewatering led to rapid enhancement in all the antioxidant defense components in non-acclimated plants, which suggested that the excess levels of H₂O₂ during severe water stress conditions might have inhibited or downregulated the antioxidant enzymes. Hence, drought acclimation conferred enhanced oxidative stress tolerance by well-co-ordinated induction of antioxidant defense both at the chloroplast and at the mitochondrial level. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacclimation 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3adrought 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater stress 3awheat1 aKhanna-Chopra, Renu0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2006 July, v. 127, no. 3 p.494-506dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2006.00678.x 7aarticle01967naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245008200173300001600255500012900271520087600400650001201276650001701288650001501305650001701320651001801337700001501355700001801370700002301388700002101411773014501432856005501577852000901632655001201641IND60594520220221122093002.0180517e20171222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059452022DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1189.782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, L.

As a result there has been limited success in securing federal funding and national sponsors. The National Initiative for Consumer Horticulture (NICH) has been created to develop a national strategic plan for Consumer Horticulture. In order to research stakeholder interest in and potential support of NICH, a variety of strategies were used to gather information. Face to face meetings, webinars and conference calls were conducted with participants representing different stakeholder groups. Outcomes include a defined mission, vision, core values, goals and objective for the initiative. Next steps include finalizing the strategic plan, selecting an organizational structure, and selecting leadership. 3afunding 3ahorticulture 3aleadership 3astakeholders 3aUnited States1 aBewick, T.1 aBauske, E.

This signaling pathway is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation, and genetic evidence demonstrated that several related protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs) are negative regulators of this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we developed a protein phosphatase profiling strategy to define the substrate preferences of the HAB1 PP2C implicated in ABA signaling and used these data to screen for putative substrates. Interestingly, this analysis designated the activation loop of the ABA activated kinase OST1, related to Snf1 and AMPK kinases, as a putative HAB1 substrate. We experimentally demonstrated that HAB1 dephosphorylates and deactivates OST1 in vitro. Furthermore, HAB1 and the related PP2Cs ABI1 and ABI2 interact with OST1 in vivo, and mutations in the corresponding genes strongly affect OST1 activation by ABA. Our results provide evidence that PP2Cs are directly implicated in the ABA-dependent activation of OST1 and further suggest that the activation mechanism of AMPK/Snf1-related kinases through the inhibition of regulating PP2Cs is conserved from plants to human.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ascreening 3ahumans 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3astress response 3amutation 3adrought 3agenes 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aplant response 3aabscisic acid 3aprotein phosphorylation 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComputational Biology 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0akinases 0aplants1 aRubio, Silvia1 aRodrigues, Americo1 aSirichandra, Caroline1 aBelin, Christophe1 aRobert, Nadia1 aLeung, Jeffrey1 aRodriguez, Pedro L.1 aLaurière, Christiane1 aMerlot, Sylvain0 tplant cell.g2009 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.3170-3184dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.0691793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02277naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245006500176300001800241500002400259520109100283650001701374650001801391650000901409650001601418650001001434650001501444650001201459650003101471650000901502650000901511650002401520650003301544650002401577650002401601650003101625651001001656700002201666773010701688852000901795856003901804655001201843IND4443260220221122092933.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444326022DNAL7 a205645442pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.31842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Ricky W.K.10aSystemic effect of Fructus Psoraleae extract on bone in mice  ap. 1578-1580.  aIncludes references  aFructus Psoraleae extract is used in China for the treatment of bone diseases. The objective of the study was to investigate the systemic effect of Fructus Psoraleae extract consumption on bone histomorphology. Sixteen 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into control and experimental groups. In the control group, eight mice were fed daily with distilled water. In the experimental group, eight mice were fed daily with distilled water mixed with Fructus Psoraleae extract. The mice were kept for 5 weeks and then killed. Using micro-computed tomography, 20 micro-tomographic slices with a separation of 0.25 mm were acquired to cover the proximal end of the left tibia of each mouse. Quantitative morphometry of the bone structure was performed. The results showed that consumption of Fructus Psoraleae extract significantly increased the bone volume/tissue volume ratio by 11.8%. The bone trabeculae increased by 7.1% in thickness so that the bone density was increased. To conclude, Fructus Psoraleae extract taken orally increases bone density and alters bone histomorphology. 3abone density 3abone diseases 3amice 3amorphometry 3atibia 3atomography 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPsoraleaxchemistry 2aTibiaxdrug effects 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 3aChina1 aRabie, A.

Case Summary - A 1.5-year-old female intact mixed breed dog was presented in a comatose state believed to be due to ethanol intoxication. The initial 9 hours of supportive care treatment were complicated by multiple seizures and hypothermia, and resulted in only minimal improvement in the dog's level of consciousness. Hemodialysis was implemented and resulted in rapid clinical recovery, corresponding to a rapid decline in serum ethanol concentration. New or Unique Information Provided - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of using hemodialysis to treat accidental ethanol intoxication in a dog. The patient's initial serum ethanol concentration was higher than those previously reported for cases of accidental ethanol intoxication in dogs, and the serum ethanol concentration was shown to rapidly decline during hemodialysis. Treatment with hemodialysis for severe ethanol intoxication was effective in this case and may be able to decrease morbidity and mortality in some cases. 3acase studies 3aconsciousness 3adog breeds 3adogs 3aethanol 3ahemodialysis 3ahypothermia 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apatients 3apoisoning 3aseizures 2aAlcoholic Intoxicationxtherapyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxchemically inducedxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aEthanolxbloodxpoisoning. 2aFemale 2aRenal Dialysisxveterinary1 aLangston, Cathy E.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.363-368dBlackwell Publishing Incx1479-32617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00652.x 7aarticle01198naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245003500136300001600171520034800187650003100535650002700566650002700593650002000620700002000640773016600660856010900826852000900935655001200944IND60594521020221122092944.0180517e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059452102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoschini, Giancarlo12aA Linear Inverse Demand System  ap. 294-302.  aWe present an inverse demand system that can be estimated in a linear form.

Model results demonstrate that even with concurrent  productivity losses in the major grain producing regions of the world, global warming  will not seriously disrupt world agricultural markets. Country/regional crop yield changes  induce interregional adjustments in production and consumption that serve to buffer the  severity of climate change impacts on world agriculture and result in relatively modest  impacts on world agricultural prices and domestic economies. 3aagricultural prices 3acrop yield 3afood production 3aglobal warming 3amarkets 3amodels1 aReilly, John1 aKane, Sally0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g1992 July, v. 17, no. 1 p.195-204dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/jareonline/archives/17.1%20-%20July%201992/JARE,Jul1992,pp195,Tobey.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245009300132300001600225520084900241650002201090650001101112650001201123650001201135650001101147650001101158650000901169651001801178700001801196773016601214856010901380852000901489655001201498IND60594521120221122065400.0180517e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059452112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjornson, Bruce10aRisk and Return in Agriculture: Evidence from an Explicit-Factor Arbitrage Pricing Model  ap. 232-252.  aThis article develops and estimates an explicit-factor Arbitrage Pricing Theory  (APT) model in an endeavor to uncover (a) the systematic risk properties of  returns to agricultural assets, (b) the relationship between agricultural returns  and returns on comparable-risk nonagricultural assets, and (c) the possible  relevance of agriculture-related risks in general capital markets.

To  offset the tax credits received by imported ethanol, the United States instituted an import  tariff. This study provides insights about the quantitative nature of a U.S. trade policy that  would establish a free-market price for ethanol, given the U.S. ethanol mandate and tax  credit. The theoretical results from a horizontally related ethanol-gasoline partial  equilibrium model show that the United States should provide an import subsidy rather  than impose a tariff. The empirical results quantify that this import subsidy is 9 cents,  instead of a 57 cent import tariff, per gallon of ethanol. 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aimports 3amodels 3aprices 3atariffs 3atax credit 3atrade policy 3aUnited States1 aKuffel, Martin0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2010 Dec., v. 35, no. 3 p.476-488dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/jareonline/archives/35.3%20-%20December%202010/JARE,Dec2010,pp476,Devadoss.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001800192245011200210300001600322500001500338520154500353650002101898650001801919650001801937650001701955650002001972650001701992650001902009650000902028650001402037650002102051650001602072650002102088650002402109650002202133650002502155650001602180650002002196650002002216650002702236650004702263650001202310650004802322650002802370650001802398650002002416650002302436650002302459650002902482650002402511653001702535773007302552852000902625856007902634930003302713945002502746946001302771655001202784IND4362639720221122065346.0040521e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263972DNAL7 a149795632pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.2.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGuevara, V.R.10aUse of nonlinear programming to optimize performance response to energy density in broiler feed formulation  ap. 147-151.  a2019-12-04  aA nonlinear programming optimization model was developed to maximize margin over feed cost in broiler feed formulation and is described in this paper. The model identifies the optimal feed mix that maximizes profit margin. Optimum metabolizable energy level and performance were found by using Excel Solver nonlinear programming. Data from an energy density study with broilers were fitted to quadratic equations to express weight gain, feed consumption, and the objective function income over feed cost in terms of energy density. Nutrient:energy ratio constraints were transformed into equivalent linear constraints. National Research Council nutrient requirements and feeding program were used for examining changes in variables. The nonlinear programming feed formulation method was used to illustrate the effects of changes in different variables on the optimum energy density, performance, and profitability and was compared with conventional linear programming. To demonstrate the capabilities of the model, I determined the impact of variation in prices. Prices for broiler, corn, fish meal, and soybean meal were increased and decreased by 25%. Formulations were identical in all other respects. Energy density, margin, and diet cost changed compared with conventional linear programming formulation. This study suggests that nonlinear programming can be more useful than conventional linear programming to optimize performance response to energy density in broiler feed formulation because an energy level does not need to be set. 3abroiler chickens 3alinear models 3aprofitability 3asoybean meal 3afeed conversion 3ainput prices 3aenergy density 3acorn 3afish meal 3anonlinear models 3afeed intake 3afeed formulation 3aprofit maximization 3acomputer software 3ametabolizable energy 3ainput costs 3abroiler feeding 3adecision making 2aAnimal Feedxeconomics 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aEnergy Intake 2aMeatxeconomics 2aModels, Biological 2aNonlinear Dynamics 2aNutritional Requirements 2aProgramming, Linear 0aoptimization0 tPoultry science.g2004 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.147-151x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.2.1473Available from publisher's Web site  a20040608b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle01876naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245007200137300001600209500002400225520075700249650004001006650002501046650003101071650001201102650001201114650001801126650001201144650001101156650001301167651001801180700002001198700002201218773016601240856011101406852000901517655001201526IND60594524420221122045615.0180517e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059452442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnecheck, Wendy A.10aMarket and Welfare Impacts of COOL on the U.S.-Mexican Tomato Trade  ap. 503-521.  aIncludes references  aA two-country, comparative static partial equilibrium model is used to simulate the ex  ante market and welfare outcomes of U.S. country-of-origin labeling for the U.S.-Mexico  fresh tomato trade.

Fourteen old durum wheat cultivars were analyzed in two field trials to assess the effect of grain number and N absorbed and translocated by the crops on grain protein percentage. The mean grain yield was below 3 t ha⁻¹ and strongly associated with the number of grains m⁻² (GNO) (r = 0.97 ***). Grain yield displayed a low sensitivity to severe terminal stressful conditions due to the ability of the old durum wheat cultivars to maintain high grain weights despite the high temperatures and short time available for grain filling caused by their late anthesis. The N source for the growing grains was mainly dependent on pre-anthesis N uptake, which was positively associated with the total biomass produced by anthesis. The tall cultivars generally left a greater amount of N m⁻² (8–15 g m⁻²) in their straw compared with shorter ones (5–6 g m⁻²). The low and variable GNO modulated the amount of N potentially available for each grain and probably limited the possibility of delivering the large N source to the grains. The large grains played a positive role in determining both grain yield (by compensating for the low GNO) and grain protein percentage, as their high grain filling rate was associated with a high N accumulation rate, and hence with a high grain N content and protein percentage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acrops 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain nitrogen content 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3astraw 3atemperature1 aMefleh, Marina 1 aPruneddu, Giovanni 1 aMotzo, Rosella 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110100423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300001800292520133500310592002801645650000901673650002901682650002101711650001701732650001501749650001401764650001001778650001101788650002201799650002201821650000901843650001201852700001301864700001501877700001501892700001601907700001701923700001401940773012701954856007502081852000902156655001202165IND60794466320221123023416.0220923e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446632DNAL7 a10.1039/d2fo02251f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Can13aAn agar–polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel loaded with tannic acid with efficient hemostatic and antibacterial capacity for wound dressing  ap. 9622-9634.  aRapid hemostasis, antibacterial effect and promotion of wound healing are the most important functions that wound dressings need to have. In this work, we designed and prepared a hydrogel with antibacterial effect, hemostatic ability and wound healing promotion using agar, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and tannic acid (TA). We performed a series of tests to characterize the structure and properties of AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogels. The results showed that the AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogels had good mechanical properties and excellent antibacterial ability as well as good hemocompatibility. The cytotoxicity results showed that the AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogels had good cytocompatibility. And the TA loaded hydrogels also presented some good performances in animal studies. In the liver hemostasis model, the AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogel showed good hemostatic ability. Also, the AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogel was able to promote wound healing in an S. aureus-infected rat wound model. More importantly, our research results demonstrated that compared to other polyphenols (such as proanthocyanidins), TA could better improve the mechanical properties, antibacterial ability and rapid hemostasis of hydrogels, which illustrated the uniqueness of TA. Therefore, the TA loaded hydrogel (AGAR@PVA–TA hydrogel) has the potential to be applied as a wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3acytotoxicity 3ahemostasis 3ahydrogels 3aliver 3amodels 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aproanthocyanidins 3arats 3atannins1 aPeng, Xu1 aXi, Linjie1 aWan, Chang1 aShi, Shubin1 aWang, Yuhang1 aYu, Xixun0 tFood & function.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 18 p.9622-9634dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo02251f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012300170300001600293520139600309592002801705650002401733650002301757650002201780650001501802650002401817650002001841650001901861651001201880653002401892653003601916653001701952653001201969653001501981773010201996856008702098852000902185655001202194IND60550855920221118003757.0190405e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055085592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrillos, Tara10aEconomic vs non-material incentives for participation in an in-kind payments for ecosystem services program in Bolivia  ap. 178-190.  aThis study examines the motivations that drive participation in a compensation program for environmental conservation in Bolivia. Previous research on payments programs suggests that institutions that appeal to both economic and non-material incentives should be encouraged. This program attempts such a strategy, offering in-kind compensation for conservation while simultaneously attempting to engage with environmental values and traditional social norms. I take advantage of a comprehensive household survey conducted prior to the offer of the program and employ means-comparison tests and multi-level regression analysis to compare those who chose to participate with those who did not. My research examines whether motivations for participating in this program reflected purely financial calculations regarding the costs and benefits of the program, or whether non-financial motivations such as environmental or social beliefs and norms played a role as well. I find evidence that the program's effort to engage with social motivations was successful and that social factors, not financial incentives alone, affect participation in the program. Findings also suggest that environmental values did not play a very large role, and that the financial determinants of participation are related mainly to prohibitive costs or barriers to entry, rather than the size of anticipated benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem services 3ahousehold surveys 3amotivation 3aregression analysis 3asocial behavior 3asocial factors 3aBolivia 0aForest conservation 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aSocial norms 0aBolivia 0aIncentives0 tEcological economics.g2017 Jan., v. 131 p.178-190dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001600175245008200191300001400273520169900287592002801986650001602014650003102030650001802061650001002079650003002089650001802119650000902137650001102146650001402157650002102171650003002192650001202222650002702234700002602261700002102287700001602308773014902324856006802473856009902541990002302640852000902663655001202672IND60643243020221122203937.0190510e20100811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064324302DNAL7 a10.3791/20202doi7 aPMC31560062pmcid7 a207369152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRikin, Amir12aA reverse genetic approach to test functional redundancy during embryogenesis  ap. e2020.  aGene function during embryogenesis is typically defined by loss-of-function experiments, for example by targeted mutagenesis (knockout) in the mouse. In the zebrafish model, effective reverse genetic techniques have been developed using microinjection of gene-specific antisense morpholinos. Morpholinos target an mRNA through specific base-pairing and block gene function transiently by inhibiting translation or splicing for several days during embryogenesis (knockdown). However, in vertebrates such as mouse or zebrafish, some gene functions can be obscured by these approaches due to the presence of another gene that compensates for the loss. This is especially true for gene families containing sister genes that are co-expressed in the same developing tissues. In zebrafish, functional compensation can be tested in a relatively high-throughput manner, by co-injection of morpholinos that target knockdown of both genes simultaneously. Likewise, using morpholinos, a genetic interaction between any two genes can be demonstrated by knockdown of both genes together at sub-threshold levels. For example, morpholinos can be titrated such that neither individual knockdown generates a phenotype. If, under these conditions, co-injection of both morpholinos causes a phenotype, a genetic interaction is shown. Here we demonstrate how to show functional redundancy in the context of two related GATA transcription factors. GATA factors are essential for specification of cardiac progenitors, but this is revealed only by the loss of both Gata5 and Gata6. We show how to carry out microinjection experiments, validate the morpholinos, and evaluate the compensated phenotype for cardiogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aGATA transcription factors 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3aphenotype 3areverse genetics 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atissues 3atranslation (genetics)1 aRosenfeld, Gabriel E.1 aMcCartin, Kellie1 aEvans, Todd0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Aug. 11, , no. 42 p.e2020-e2020dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/20203Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2020/a-reverse-genetic-approach-to-test-functional-redundancy-during  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01181naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520027300314592002800587650001700615650001100632650001700643651001400660700001900674773012000693856008100813852000900894655001200903IND60600094020221123030312.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009402DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180201452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaganov, V.

We developed a novel drift tube called a focusing quadrupole ion funnel (FQ-IF) for use in PTR-MS to improve the sensitivity. The FQ-IF consists of 20 layers of stainless steel electrodes, and each layer has 4 quarter rings. The first 6 layers have a constant inner hole diameter of 22 mm; the latter 14 layers taper the inner diameter down to 8 mm. The FQ-IF drift tube can also operate in the direct current (DC) mode (similar to a conventional drift tube) and ion funnel (IF) mode (similar to a conventional ion funnel drift tube) by changing the voltage loading method. The simulation results show that the transmission efficiency of the FQ-IF is significantly improved compared to that of the other two modes. Further experiments show that the product ions of limonene tend to convert into smaller m/z fragment ions at higher voltages for the DC and IF modes. However, unlike the DC and IF modes, the distribution of product ions is stable at higher voltages for the FQ-IF. In other words, a higher RF voltage for the FQ-IF will not increase the collision energy of ions. In addition, the improvements in sensitivity for the FQ-IF range from 13.8 to 87.9 times compared to the DC mode and from 1.7 to 4.8 times compared to the IF mode for the 12 test compounds. The improvements in the limit of detection (LOD) for the FQ-IF range from 2.7 to 35.7 times compared to the DC mode. The FQ-IF provides a valuable reference for improving the sensitivity of PTR-MS and other mass spectrometers.  aPublisher supplied data  a21705152cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21777163cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21876176cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22076190cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a62171433cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019432cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004739  aBJPY2021B08cHefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007121  aYZJJ2022QN45cHefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007121  aYZJJZX202009cHefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007121  a202104d07020003cAnhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100017668  aLHJJ2020006cCenter of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/NA  aLHJJ2020006cSecond Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical Universitydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3aelectric potential difference 3alimonene 3amass spectrometry 3astainless steel1 aZhang, Qiangling1 aLiang, Qu1 aSun, Qin1 aXu, Wei1 aLu, Yan1 aXia, Lei1 aLiu, Yawei1 aZou, Xue1 aHuang, Chaoqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2862-60241 aShen, Chengyin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4297-56961 aChu, Yannan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Sept. 23, v. 94, no. 39 p.13368-13376dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c018933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012400168300001400292520170300306592002802009650002602037650001902063650001602082650002302098650001402121650001502135650001102150650001202161650002302173650002002196650004102216650001302257650001602270650002402286650000702310653002902317653001302346653002702359653001602386653002602402700001402428700002002442700002202462700002002484700002102504700003002525700001902555700002102574700001702595700002002612773017002632856008502802852000902887655001202896IND60527027620221119083629.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Nao12al-Lactic acid production from glycerol coupled with acetic acid metabolism by Enterococcus faecalis without carbon loss  ap. 89-95.  aGlycerol is a by-product in the biodiesel production process and considered as one of the prospective carbon sources for microbial fermentation including lactic acid fermentation, which has received considerable interest due to its potential application. Enterococcus faecalis isolated in our laboratory produced optically pure l-lactic acid from glycerol in the presence of acetic acid. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using [1, 2-¹³C2] acetic acid proved that the E. faecalis strain QU 11 was capable of converting acetic acid to ethanol during lactic acid fermentation of glycerol. This indicated that strain QU 11 restored the redox balance by oxidizing excess NADH though acetic acid metabolism, during ethanol production, which resulted in lactic acid production from glycerol. The effects of pH control and substrate concentration on lactic acid fermentation were also investigated. Glycerol and acetic acid concentrations of 30 g/L and 10 g/L, respectively, were expected to be appropriate for lactic acid fermentation of glycerol by strain QU 11 at a pH of 6.5. Furthermore, fed-batch fermentation with 30 g/L glycerol and 10 g/L acetic acid wholly exhibited the best performance including lactic acid production (55.3 g/L), lactic acid yield (0.991 mol-lactic acid/mol-glycerol), total yield [1.08 mol-(lactic acid and ethanol)]/mol-(glycerol and acetic acid)], and total carbon yield [1.06 C-mol-(lactic acid and ethanol)/C-mol-(glycerol and acetic acid)] of lactic acid and ethanol. In summary, the strain QU 11 successfully produced lactic acid from glycerol with acetic acid metabolism, and an efficient fermentation system was established without carbon loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetic acid 3abatch fermentation 3abiodiesel 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afuel production 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycerol 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3apH 0aLactic acid fermentation 0aGlycerol 0aAcetic acid metabolism 0aCarbon loss 0aEnterococcus faecalis1 aOba, Mana1 aIwamoto, Mariko1 aTashiro, Yukihiro1 aNoguchi, Takuya1 aBonkohara, Kaori1 aAbdel-Rahman, Mohamed Ali1 aZendo, Takeshi1 aShimoda, Mitsuya1 aSakai, Kenji1 aSonomoto, Kenji0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2016 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.89-95dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007400170520110200244592002801346650002501374650001401399650002601413650003101439650001501470650000901485650002101494650001301515650002001528653002801548653002601576653001501602653003401617653002601651700001901677700002001696700001501716700001901731700001901750773011201769856008501881852000901966655001201975IND60687914120221121110834.0200427e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068791412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jongmyeong10aMixed-matrix membrane reactors for the destruction of toxic chemicals  aThe extremely toxic synthetic organophosphates used as pesticides and chemical warfare agents (CWA) are capable of not only directly disrupting biological functions but also causing secondary contamination of water and soil. Among the proposed detoxifying materials, zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for CWA degradation. However, the practical application of MOFs is limited by their intractable powdery form, and requires complex instrumental settings. To address this issue, mixed-matrix membrane reactors (MMR) are developed based on Zr-based MOFs embedded in the porous polymer matrix. Such configurations also enable CWAs flowing through the nanochannels of MMR to easily access the catalysts, which is beneficial for enhancing the CWA degradation. A series of flat MMRs and hollow fiber MMRs containing UiO-66, UiO-66-NH₂, and MOF-808 were evaluated. MMRs containing MOF-808 provided an extremely high conversion of 95% despite short residence times (<10 s) under continuous operation reflecting their promise for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apesticides 3asoil 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aChemical warfare agents 0aMOFs membrane reactor 0aHydrolysis 0aHollow fiber membrane reactor 0aMixed matrix membrane1 aKim, Eun-Young1 aChang, Bong-Jun1 aHan, Mingu1 aLee, Pyung-Soo1 aMoon, Su-Young0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 June 15, v. 605 p.118112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01103naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300001300294520021300307592002800520650002400548650002200572650002300594650000900617773012700626856007500753852000900828655001200837IND60794466420221123024515.0220923e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446642DNAL7 a10.1039/d2fo90065c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Philippa10aExpression of concern: Protective role of air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) of yam family in myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury  ap. 9700.  aExpression of concern for ‘Protective role of air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) of yam family in myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury’ Food Funct., 2010, 1, 278–283, https://doi.org/10.1039/C0FO00048E.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea bulbifera 3aprotective effect 3areperfusion injury 3ayams0 tFood & function.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 18 p.9700-9700dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo90065c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009800170300001800268500001100286520083200297592002801129650001901157650002201176650001701198650001501215650001401230650001201244650001401256650000901270700006001279773014901339856008301488852000901571655001201580IND60733772420221120152103.0211002e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073377242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03752-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulkarni, Aneesha14aThe role of immune dysfunction in obesity-associated cancer risk, progression, and metastasis  ap. 3423-3442.  aReview  aObesity has been linked to an increased risk of and a worse prognosis for several types of cancer.

Here, we review studies examining the impact of obesity-induced immune dysfunction on cancer risk and progression. While the role of adipose tissue inflammation in obesity-associated cancer risk has been well characterized, the effects of obesity on immune cell infiltration and activity within the tumor microenvironment are not well studied. In this review, we aim to highlight the impact of both adipose-mediated inflammatory signaling and intratumoral immunosuppressive signaling in obesity-induced cancer risk, progression, and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammation 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aprognosis 3arisk1 aBowers, Laura W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2124-30070 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 78, no. 7 p.3423-3442dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03752-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013600170300001600306520052100322592002800843650001300871650001100884650001600895651001200911700001500923700001600938773012000954856008101074852000901155655001201164IND60600094120221123030319.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009412DNAL7 a10.1134/S003294521803013X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafrafi-Nouira, S.10aConfirmed occurrence of the Cusk-eel Ophidion barbatum (Osteichthyes: Ophidiidae) from the Coast of Tunisia (Central Mediterranean)  ap. 428-431.  aThis paper reports the second record but also the first substantiated record of cusk-eel Ophidion barbatum (Linnaeus, 1758) from the northern coast of Tunisia, 168 mm in total length and weighing 18.3 g.

If the demand for food continues to increase and is not supported by increasing food production there will also be food insecurity at certain times. The government's policy to overcome this problem is the Acceleration of Food Consumption Diversification (P2KP) and its program namely Sustainable Food House Area (KRPL). The purpose of this study is to analyze household food security using a quantitative aspect approach (TKE and TKP) and quality aspects (PPH score) The results of the study PPH scores achieved by KRPL participating households and not KRPL participants were 86.6 and 75.9, respectively. This value shows the pattern of food consumption that has not varied. However, it can be seen that participating households of KRPL have more food consumption than households not participating in KRPL While the energy consumption and non-participant household protein of KRPL still have not reached the consumption recommendations set by the government, amounting to 1883.5 kcal / capita / day and 49.7 gram / capita / day.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afood consumption 3afood production 3afood security 3afruits 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0akrpl program 0apph score1 aMufaidah, Iid1 aHanani, Nuhfil1 aToiba, Hery0 tHabitat.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 02 p.177-185dUniversity of BrawijayawJournal:27740x2338-20077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.habitat.2022.033.2.183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165300001800287500001100305520144100316592002801757596006901785596005901854596007401913596008301987596007802070596011002148596010202258596009902360650002102459650001902480650001402499650002002513650001602533650001102549650002102560650001402581650002902595700001802624700001602642700001702658700001402675700001202689700005402701773014902755856008302904852000902987655001202996IND60733772520221120152127.0211002e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073377252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03751-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Siyuan14aThe emerging role of long noncoding RNAs in esophageal carcinoma: from underlying mechanisms to clinical implications  ap. 3403-3422.  aReview  aLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a type of transcriptional product more than 200 nucleotides in length, have emerged as crucial regulators in human cancers. Accumulating data have recently indicated relationships between lncRNAs and esophageal carcinoma (EC). Of note, lncRNAs act as decoys/sponges, scaffolds, guides, and signals to regulate the expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressors at epigenetic, post-transcriptional, and protein levels, through which they exert their unique EC-driving or EC-suppressive functions. Moreover, the features of EC-related lncRNAs have been gradually exploited for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in clinical scenarios. LncRNAs have the potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators individually or in combination with other clinical variables. Beyond these, although the time is not yet ripe, therapeutically targeting EC-related lncRNAs via gene editing, antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference, and small molecules is likely one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for the next generation of cancer treatment. Herein, we focus on summarizing EC-driving/suppressive lncRNAs, as well as discussing their different features regarding expression profiles, modes of action, and oncological effects. Moreover, we further discuss current challenges and future developing possibilities of capitalizing on lncRNAs for EC early diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 81970481cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a82000514cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGrant No. 81602627cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aGrant No. 2018HH0150cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province  aGrant No. 2017GH00072cChengdu Science and Technology Bureau Program (CN)  aGrant No. ZYJC18010c1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University  a2020HXFH047c1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University  a2020-025c1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University 3aRNA interference 3acancer therapy 3acarcinoma 3aearly diagnosis 3aepigenetics 3ahumans 3aoligonucleotides 3aoncogenes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYang, Yushang1 aZhou, Yuxin1 aZeng, Xiaoxi1 aXiao Xin,1 aLiu, Bo1 aYuan, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9720-19650 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 78, no. 7 p.3403-3422dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-020-03751-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245004100165300001600206520051600222592002800738650001100766650002100777650000900798650001000807650001800817650002300835650001600858650001100874650001800885700002100903700001800924773012000942856008101062852000901143655001201152IND60600094220221123030202.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009422DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180200912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMochek, A.

We tested the impact of APOE genotype (carriage of E2 and E4 alleles versus E3/E3), determined retrospectively, on plasma lipids, lipoproteins and glucose homeostasis at baseline (n = 469), and on the change in these variables after 24 weeks of dietary intervention (n = 389). At baseline, carriers of E2 (n = 70), E4 (n = 125) and E3/E3 (n = 274) expressed marked differences in total plasma cholesterol (TC, p = 0.001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, p < 0.0001), apolipoprotein B (apo B, p < 0.0001) and total to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TC:HDL-C, p = 0.002), with plasma concentrations decreasing in the order E4 > E3/E3 > E2. Following intervention, there was evidence of a significant diet x genotype interaction with significantly greater decreases in TC (p = 0.02) and apo B (p = 0.006) among carriers of E4 when SFA was replaced with low GI carbohydrate on a lower fat diet (TC &minus;0.28 mmol/L p = 0.03; apo B &minus;0.1 g/L p = 0.02), and a relative increase in TC (in comparison to E3/E3) when SFA was replaced with MUFA and high GI carbohydrates (TC 0.3 mmol/L, p = 0.03). Among carriers of E2 (compared with E3/E3) there was an increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) when SFA was replaced with MUFA and low GI carbohydrates 0.46 mmol/L p = 0.001). There were no significant interactions between APOE genotype and diet for changes in indices of glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, variations in APOE genotype led to differential effects on the lipid response to the replacement of SFA with MUFA and low GI carbohydrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aapolipoprotein B 3ablood lipids 3adiet 3agenotype 3aglucose 3aglycemic index 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3anutritional intervention 3arisk factors 3asaturated fats 3asaturated fatty acids 3atriacylglycerols1 aWalker, Celia  G.1 aJebb, Susan  A.1 aMoore, Carmel1 aFrost, Gary  S.1 aGoff, Louise1 aSanders, Tom  A.

The physiological constraints and demands that regulate appropriate synaptic growth and connectivity are currently poorly understood. In previous work, we identified a Drosophila model of lysosomal storage disease (LSD), spinster (spin), with larval neuromuscular synapse overgrowth. Here we identify a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden in spin that may be attributable to previously identified lipofuscin deposition and lysosomal dysfunction, a cellular hallmark of LSD. Reducing ROS in spin mutants rescues synaptic overgrowth and electrophysiological deficits. Synapse overgrowth was also observed in mutants defective for protection from ROS and animals subjected to excessive ROS. ROS are known to stimulate JNK and fos signaling. Furthermore, JNK and fos in turn are known potent activators of synapse growth and function. Inhibiting JNK and fos activity in spin rescues synapse overgrowth and electrophysiological deficits. Similarly, inhibiting JNK, fos, and jun activity in animals with excessive oxidative stress rescues the overgrowth phenotype. These data suggest that ROS, via activation of the JNK signaling pathway, are a major regulator of synapse overgrowth. In LSD, increased autophagy contributes to lysosomal storage and, presumably, elevated levels of oxidative stress. In support of this suggestion, we report here that impaired autophagy function reverses synaptic overgrowth in spin. Our data describe a previously unexplored link between oxidative stress and synapse overgrowth via the JNK signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aanimals 3aautophagy 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3asynapse1 aJarrett, Helen E.1 aGowers, Kate1 aChalak, Salma1 aBriggs, Laura1 aRobinson, Iain M.1 aSweeney, Sean T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Oct. 18, v. 108, no. 42 p.17521-17526dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10145111083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013900163300001600302520071500318592002801033650001901061650001101080650001101091650002601102650001901128650001101147650001401158650001501172650001701187651000901204651001701213700002001230700002301250700001401273700002001287773012001307856008101427852000901508655001201517IND60600094320221123030234.0180702e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009432DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452180301532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZareian, H.10aComments on the Mond Scraper, Capoeta mandica (Teleostei: Cyprinidae): Re-Description, Molecular Systematics and Distribution Modeling  ap. 283-295.  aCapoeta mandica was originally described as C. barroisi mandica from Mond River, Persian Gulf basin, based on morphological characters and later was considered as a distinct species based on a few small specimens. However, there is still controversial debate about its systematic position and morphological characters. To resolve the issue, new collected specimens from Iranian drainage basins examined morphologically and molecularly. Results revealed that C. mandica is a distinct taxon in the Capoeta trutta group. This taxon confirms the zoogeographical separation of the Persis basin (southern Iran) by the rise in post-Pleistocene sea level, isolating rivers from the Tigris-Euphrates and western basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapoeta trutta 3abasins 3amodels 3amolecular systematics 3aredescriptions 3arivers 3asea level 3awatersheds 3azoogeography 3aIran 3aPersian Gulf1 aEsmaeili, H.

Gonadosomatic Index was significant in all treatments as compared to T2 and T4, in the Intestine Weight Index and Intestine Length Index, all treatments were significantly different from the control. In the Intestine Length (Fish Length) Index, T2 was substantially greater. The current study’s findings imply that oak acorn powder is a viable feed additive, indicating a starting point for additional research into its potential use as an antioxidant and immune booster in various fish species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyprinus carpio 3aQuercus brantii 3aacorns 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adiet 3afeed additives 3afish 3agonadosomatic index 3ahepatosomatic index 3aintestines 3aprotein content 3aproximate composition 3asugars 3aweight gain1 aHassan, Nazenine Othman 1 aAmeen, Hawkar Jaafar Hamad1 aSabri, Hazem Abdulhameed 1 aAhmad, Vian Muhamad 1 aQader, Karzan Omer 1 aHassan, Bakhan Rafiq 1 aHama-Salih, Hevar Aras 1 aMohammed, Hemin Nuraddin 0 tMağallaẗ al-Anbār li-l-ʻulūm al-bayṭariyyaẗ.g2022 June, v. 15, no. 1dCollege of Veterinary Medicine, University of Fallujahx2707-06037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.37940/AJVS.2022.15.1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009800167300001600265520177600281592002802057650002102085650001802106650001002124650002102134650001402155650001402169650000902183650001202192650002002204650001802224653001402242653001802256653001702274653003102291653000802322653002002330700001202350700001702362700001502379700001802394700001902412700001602431700001802447700001902465700005802484773011702542856008702659852000902746655001202755IND60556401220221120104818.0190215e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055640122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2016.09.1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue10aImproved development by melatonin treatment after vitrification of mouse metaphase II oocytes  ap. 335-342.  aThe study was aimed to investigate the effect of melatonin on the development potential of mouse MII oocytes after cryopreservation. Mouse MII oocytes were subjected first to vitrification/warming and 2 h of in vitro culture (phase 1), then to parthenogenetic activation (PA) followed by in vitro culture of parthenogenetic embryos (phase 2). Different concentrations of melatonin (0, 10−9, 10−6 mol/L) were added to the medium during either phase 1, phase 2 or both phases. The fresh oocytes were used as control. When melatonin was used during both phases, 10−9 mol/L melatonin-treated group showed similar rates of cleavage and 4-cell embryo development compared with control, which were significantly higher than those of melatonin-free group, while the rates in either 10−6 mol/L melatonin-treated or melatonin-free groups were significantly lower than that in control. When 10−9 mol/L melatonin was added during either phase 1 or phase 2, both cleavage and 4-cell embryo development rates of either group were significantly lower than those of control. After oocyte vitrification/warming and PA, the ROS levels increased significantly and maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) related genes (Dcp1a, Dcp2, Hspa1a, Eif1ax, Pou5f1, Sox2) expression were disorganized. However, after 10−9 mol/L melatonin supplementation, the ROS levels decreased significantly compared with melatonin-free group, and the gene expressions were almost recovered to normal level of control group. These results demonstrated that 10−9 mol/L melatonin supplementation could increase the developmental potential of vitrified-warmed mouse MII oocytes, which may result from ROS scavenging activities and recovery of normal levels of the expressions of MZT-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryopreservation 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3ain vitro culture 3amelatonin 3ametaphase 3amice 3aoocytes 3aparthenogenesis 3avitrification 0aMelatonin 0aVitrification 0aMouse oocyte 0aParthenogenetic activation 0aROS 0aGene expression1 aLi, Wei1 aMa, Yongshun1 aWang, Dian1 aZhao, Xiaoxue1 aZeng, Changjun1 aZhang, Ming1 aZeng, Xianyin1 aMeng, Qinggang1 aZhou, Guangbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4493-83110 tCryobiology.g2016 Dec., v. 73, no. 3 p.335-342dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2016.09.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245013900170500001400309520111300323592002801436650001401464650001301478650001101491650001301502650002101515650001201536650001601548650001201564650002301576650001001599650001101609650001401620650001301634650001301647650000701660650001701667650001801684650001401702650001101716650001601727650001201743651001201755700001901767700002901786700002801815773012201843856008001965852000902045655001202054IND60724378920221120194631.0210122e20201228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072437892DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110100462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihaescu, Cristina 10aCharacteristics of Phomopsis juglandina (Sacc.)

Höhn., which is the conidial state of Diaporthe juglandina (Fuckel) Nitschke, and the main pathogen causing the dieback of branches and twigs of walnut was recently detected in many orchards from Romania. The symptomatological, morphological, ultrastructural, and cultural characteristics, as well as the pathogenicity of an isolate of this lignicolous fungus, were described and illustrated. The optimum periods for infection, under the conditions prevailing in Southern Romania, mainly occur in the spring (April) and autumn months (late September-beginning of October). Strong inverse correlations (p < 0.001) were found between potential evapotranspiration and lesion lengths on walnut branches in 2019. The pathogen forms two types of phialospores: alpha and beta; the role of beta phialospores is not well known in pathogenesis. In Vitro, the optimal growth temperature of mycelial hyphae was in the range of 22–26 °C, and the optimal pH is 4.4–7. This pathogen should be monitored continuously due to its potential for damaging infestations of intensive plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiaporthe 3aagronomy 3aautumn 3abranches 3aclimatic factors 3aconidia 3acorrelation 3adieback 3aevapotranspiration 3afungi 3ahyphae 3ainfection 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apH 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aspring 3atemperature 3awalnuts 3aRomania1 aDunea, Daniel 1 aBășa, Adrian  Gheorghe1 aFrasin, Loredana  Neagu0 tAgronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110100463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014000173520201300313592002802326650001902354650002002373650001402393650001102407650001602418650002502434650002102459650001102480650002102491650001802512650001802530650001202548650001402560650001502574650001702589650001902606650002002625650001202645651002002657653001702677653002002694653002102714653001502735653001602750653002402766700001902790700002302809700001802832700002602850773011902876856008802995852000903083655001203092IND60772404920221117044131.0221004e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077240492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1548752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Janet R.10aMicroplastics in intertidal water of South Australia and the mussel Mytilus spp.; the contrasting effect of population on concentration  aMicroplastics, plastic particles <5 mm in size, are of global concern as human-caused pollutants in marine and fresh waters, and yet little is known of their distribution, behaviour and ecological impact in the intertidal environment of South Australia. This study confirms for the first time, the presence of microplastic in the South Australian intertidal ecosystem by quantifying the abundance of particles in intertidal water and in the keystone species, the blue mussel, Mytilus spp., an important fisheries species, at ten and six locations respectively, along the South Australian coastline. For a remote region known for its pristine environment, microplastic concentration in intertidal water was found to be low to moderate (mean = 8.21 particles l⁻¹ ± 4.91) relative to global levels and microplastic abundance in mussels (mean = 3.58 ± 8.18 particles individual⁻¹) was within the range also reported globally. Microplastic particles were ubiquitous across sites and bioavailable by size in water (mean = 906.36 μm) and in mussel (mean = 983.29 μm) raising concerns for the health of South Australia's unique coastal ecosystems and for the human food chain. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between human coastal population size and microplastic concentration in intertidal water, irrespective of influences from industry - tourism, fishing and shipping ports. FTIR analysis determined plastic type to include polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), acrylic resin, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and cellulose, suggesting synthetic and semi-synthetic particles from single-use, short-life cycle products, fabrics, ropes and cordage. Our findings shed light on the urgent need to establish the local sources of microplastic pollution in order to assist the community, industry and government to reduce the impact of microplastic on the fragile marine systems within South Australian intertidal waters and on the organisms associated with the human food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3abioavailability 3acellulose 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman food chain 3ahumans 3akeystone species 3alittoral zone 3amicroplastics 3amussels 3apollution 3apolyamides 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apopulation size 3atourism 3aSouth Australia 0aMicroplastic 0aSouth Australia 0aIntertidal water 0aPopulation 0aBlue mussel 0aSingle-use plastics1 aBeaman, Julian1 aKirkbride, K.

The selected elemental composition of the samples was determined by applying the Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique. Several samples obtained from different preliminary treatments of the peeled seeds were examined, such as: (i) floury samples (wild-type) mineralized with the wet method; (ii) the ashes of both AHP and AHH varieties; (iii) the fraction of total inorganic soluble salts (TISS). Furthermore, the hydroalcoholic crude extracts (as a tincture) were obtained according to the official Pharmacopoeia methods, and the relevant results were compared with those of a commercial sample, an herbal product-food supplement of similar characteristics. The main characteristics of this research work underline that the two botanical varieties give different distinctive characters, due to the Fe content (80.05 vs. 1.42 mg/100 g d.s., for AHP and AHH wild-type flour samples, respectively), along with K, Ca, Mn, Ni and Cu, which are more abundant in the AHP samples. Furthermore, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the experimental dataset in order to classify and discriminate the samples, in relation to their similar botanical origin, but different for the color of the bloom. These results can be useful for the traceability of raw materials potentially intended for the production of auxiliary systems of pharmacological interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3aagronomy 3achemical elements 3acolor 3adata collection 3aelemental composition 3aextracts 3aflour 3aflowers 3ahybrids 3aprincipal component analysis 3araw materials 3aresearch 3asampling 3aseeds 3asoluble salts 3aspectroscopy 3atraceability 3avarieties1 aCocchi, Marina 1 aLancellotti, Lisa 1 aMaletti, Laura 1 aMarchetti, Andrea 1 aRoncaglia, Fabrizio 1 aSighinolfi, Simona 1 aTassi, Lorenzo 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110100473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245008900199506007600288520130500364592002801669506003701697650001301734650001401747650002401761650001101785650001501796650001701811650001101828650002201839700001701861700001801878700002401896773012301920856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60650603720221207085950.0190710e20181017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065060372DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101015282doi7 aPMC62128572pmcid7 a303366062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabir, Akbar14aThe Influence of Caffeine Expectancies on Sport, Exercise, and Cognitive Performance  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaffeine (CAF) is widely consumed across sport and exercise for its reputed ergogenic properties, including central nervous stimulation and enhanced muscular force development. However, expectancy and the related psychological permutations that are associated with oral CAF ingestion are generally not considered in most experimental designs and these could be important in understanding if/how CAF elicits an ergogenic effect. The present paper reviews 17 intervention studies across sport, exercise, and cognitive performance. All explore CAF expectancies, in conjunction with/without CAF pharmacology. Thirteen out of 17 studies indicated expectancy effects of varying magnitudes across a range of exercise tasks and cognitive skills inclusive off but not limited to; endurance capacity, weightlifting performance, simple reaction time and memory. Factors, such as motivation, belief, and habitual CAF consumption habits influenced the response. In many instances, these effects were comparable to CAF pharmacology. Given these findings and the lack of consistency in the experimental design, future research acknowledging factors, such as habitual CAF consumption habits, habituated expectations, and the importance of subjective post-hoc analysis will help to advance knowledge within this area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acaffeine 3acognition 3aexperimental design 3amemory 3amotivation 3apharmacology 3asports 3astrength training1 aHooton, Andy1 aTallis, Jason1 aF.

However, the potential effects of quality-changed water on the biostability within DWDS are not well understood, especially after water switching to quality-improved water. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of quality-improved water on DWDS, focusing on the stability of biofilm. The practical aged-pipe was assembled into pipe reactors to simulate the effect of switching to quality-improve water. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration of bulk water in the pipe reactors increased from ∼1.2 ng/L to almost above 5 ng/L when fed water switching to TP 2. Biomass quantified by measuring ATP concentration confirmed that the risk of biofilm release through aged cast-iron (CI) pipe surfaces after water source switching. The changes in water characteristics due to quality-improved water source could cause bacteria release in DWDS at the initial period (at the first 7 days). However, the DWDS can establish the new stable phase after 42 days. Over time, biomass in the bulk water of the distribution system decreased significantly (The ATP concentration in the bulk maintains around 3 ng/L) after 42 days, indicating the improvement of water quality. The biofilm was dominated by bacteria related to iron-cycling process, and at the genus level, Desulfovibrio had the highest relative abundance, however, it decreased significantly (from 48% to 9.3%) after water source switching. And there was a slightly increase in the fraction of iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB) and siderophore-producing bacteria (SPB), but a relatively higher increase in nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB), nitrobacteria (NOB), and iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) was observed. Taken together, these results and the corrosion morphology, indicate that pipe biofilm and corrosion were chemically and microbially stable after re-stability under water source switching. In addition, the bulk water environment showed a marked decrease in selected bacteria at genus level, including pathogenic species, indicating the improvement of quality in drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acast iron 3acorrosion 3amicrobial communities 3apollution 3arisk 3awater distribution 3awater quality 0aWater source switching 0aAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) 0aBiostability 0aCast-iron pipes1 aZhang, Kejia1 aCen, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5839-55091 aZhou, Xinyan1 aXu, Jia1 aWu, Jiajia1 aWu, Xiaogang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 271 p.116293-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1162933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001600271520121100287592002801498650002001526650001401546650002201560650001701582650001001599650001801609650001601627650002401643650002301667653002701690653002401717653001701741653001801758700001701776700005301793773011601846856008601962852000902048655001202057IND60550856620221118003824.0190408e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055085662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariano, M.10aThermal characterization of cellulose nanocrystals isolated from sisal fibers using acid hydrolysis  ap. 454-462.  aBesides interesting properties and potential applications, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) present some limitations which remain a challenge in many application fields. These nanomaterials are sensitive to thermal degradation due to their natural source and surface characteristics, limiting their processing at high temperature. In this study, pristine sisal fibers were bleached using different acid (ABF) and basic (BBF) techniques prior to sulfuric acid hydrolysis under the same conditions. This procedure provided two CNCs with different characteristics (ACNC and BCNC). The compositions of the bleached cellulosic pulps were characterized and was found that ABF and BBF presented different cellulose contents of 61.5 and 72.4% respectively. It clearly impacts the thermal behavior of the obtained nanomaterials, leading BCNC to present a maximum degradation temperature of approximately 100°C higher than ACNC. Other CNC characteristics, such as surface charge, crystallinity and aspect ratio also seem to play an important role in relation to the thermal behavior. A decrease in the stability and the modification of the volatile content and composition were observed during the thermal degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3ananocrystals 3asisal 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal properties 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aThermal degradation 0aSisal fibers 0aNanomaterials1 aCercená, R.1 aSoldi, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4316-36220 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Dec. 30, v. 94 p.454-462dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002100175245004100196300001400237520116500251592002801416650000801444650002401452650002501476650001201501650001101513650001101524650001801535650001701553650002601570650001901596650001401615650002001629650002401649700002101673773014901694856006801843856007001911990002301981852000902004655001202013IND60643243420221122204003.0190510e20100802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064324342DNAL7 a10.3791/20272doi7 aPMC31560072pmcid7 a207298032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunford, Eric A.10aDna stable-isotope probing (dna-sip)  ap. e2027.  aDNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) is a powerful technique for identifying active microorganisms that assimilate particular carbon substrates and nutrients into cellular biomass. As such, this cultivation-independent technique has been an important methodology for assigning metabolic function to the diverse communities inhabiting a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Following the incubation of an environmental sample with stable-isotope labelled compounds, extracted nucleic acid is subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation and subsequent gradient fractionation to separate nucleic acids of differing densities. Purification of DNA from cesium chloride retrieves labelled and unlabelled DNA for subsequent molecular characterization (e.g. fingerprinting, microarrays, clone libraries, metagenomics). This JoVE video protocol provides visual step-by-step explanations of the protocol for density gradient ultracentrifugation, gradient fractionation and recovery of labelled DNA. The protocol also includes sample SIP data and highlights important tips and cautions that must be considered to ensure a successful DNA-SIP analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaquatic environment 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acesium 3afractionation 3ametagenomics 3amicroarray technology 3amicroorganisms 3anutrients 3astable isotopes 3aultracentrifugation1 aNeufeld, Josh D.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Aug. 02, , no. 42 p.e2027-e2027dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/20273Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2027/dna-stable-isotope-probing-dna-sip  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013500166300001600301520146100317592002801778650002801806650002501834650002001859650001801879650001801897650001801915650000901933650001101942650002501953650001401978650001901992650001702011653001302028653001302041653002702054653001902081653003002100653002702130700001702157700001302174700001802187700001902205700001702224700001702241773017202258856008502430852000902515655001202524IND60527028320221119083751.0180904e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huihui10aEnhanced production of secretory glycoprotein VSTM1-v2 with mouse IgGκ signal peptide in optimized HEK293F transient transfection  ap. 133-139.  aVSTM1-v2 is a secretory glycoprotein identified by our laboratory. Our previous study revealed that VSTM1-v2 could promote differentiation and activation of Th17 cells. To explore the role of VSTM1-v2 in the immune system further, a source of abundant high-quality recombinant protein is warranted. However, high-level expression of bioactive VSTM1-v2 is difficult due to its weak secretion capacity. To obtain sufficient recombinant VSTM1-v2, we developed an improved expression and purification system by replacing the native signal peptide with a mouse IgGκ signal peptide that did not alter the protein cleavage site. We also optimized parameters for a transient gene expression system in HEK293F cells suspended in serum-free media with polyethyleneimine. Finally, 3.6 mg/L recombinant VSTM1-v2 protein with N-glycosylation and no less than 95% purity was obtained through one-step purification with Ni affinity chromatography. The final yield after purification was increased by more than 7-fold compared to the yield from our previously reported HEK293T system (from 0.5 mg/L to 3.6 mg/L). More importantly, VSTM1-v2 protein exhibited excellent bioactivity. In conclusion, the improved system is not only a dependable source of abundant bioactive VSTM1-v2 for functional studies but also demonstrates a highly efficient approach for enhancing the production of proteins in a short time period, especially for secretory proteins with poor yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3abioactive properties 3agene expression 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3aimmune system 3amice 3anickel 3arecombinant proteins 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 3atransfection 0aCytokine 0aVSTM1-v2 0aSecretory glycoprotein 0aSignal peptide 0aTransient gene expression 0aTMPP-Ac derivatization1 aZou, Xiajuan1 aLi, Ting1 aWang, Xiaolin1 aYuan, Wanqiong1 aChen, Yingyu1 aHan, Wenling0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2016 Feb., v. 121, no. 2 p.133-139dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010800189300001800297520184800315592002802163650002502191650000802216650001702224650002202241650001502263650001502278650002202293650001602315650001102331650001402342650001202356650001202368650002402380650004002404650001202444650001802456650002502474650002302499650001502522650002102537650001102558650002102569650001902590650002302609651001102632651001502643651001102658651001002669700002402679700001902703700002202722700002102744700002502765700001902790700002102809700001802830700002102848773010402869856005502973852000903028655001203037IND4468108320221119211550.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446810832DNAL7 a219061952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05245.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHEKKALA, EVON13aAn ancient icon reveals new mysteries: mummy DNA resurrects a cryptic species within the Nile crocodile  ap. 4199-4215.  aThe Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an ancient icon of both cultural and scientific interest. The species is emblematic of the great civilizations of the Nile River valley and serves as a model for international wildlife conservation. Despite its familiarity, a centuries‐long dispute over the taxonomic status of the Nile crocodile remains unresolved. This dispute not only confounds our understanding of the origins and biogeography of the ‘true crocodiles’ of the crown genus Crocodylus, but also complicates conservation and management of this commercially valuable species. We have taken a total evidence approach involving phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, as well as karyotype analysis of chromosome number and structure, to assess the monophyletic status of the Nile crocodile. Samples were collected from throughout Africa, covering all major bioregions. We also utilized specimens from museum collections, including mummified crocodiles from the ancient Egyptian temples at Thebes and the Grottes de Samoun, to reconstruct the genetic profiles of extirpated populations. Our analyses reveal a cryptic evolutionary lineage within the Nile crocodile that elucidates the biogeographic history of the genus and clarifies long‐standing arguments over the species’ taxonomic identity and conservation status. An examination of crocodile mummy haplotypes indicates that the cryptic lineage corresponds to an earlier description of C. suchus and suggests that both African Crocodylus lineages historically inhabited the Nile River. Recent survey efforts indicate that C. suchus is declining or extirpated throughout much of its distribution. Without proper recognition of this cryptic species, current sustainable use‐based management policies for the Nile crocodile may do more harm than good.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus niloticus 3aDNA 3abiogeography 3achromosome number 3acrocodiles 3ahaplotypes 3aissues and policy 3akaryotyping 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3avalleys 3awildlife management 2aAlligators and Crocodilesxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Speciation 2aHaplotypes 2aHistory, Ancient 2aHumans 2aMummiesxhistory 2aPhylogeography 2aSequence Alignment 3aAfrica 3aNile River 0aAfrica 0aEgypt1 aSHIRLEY, MATTHEW H.1 aAmato, George,1 aAustin, James D.,1 aCHARTER, SUELLEN1 aTHORBJARNARSON, JOHN1 aVLIET, KENT A.1 aHOUCK, MARLYS L.1 aDeSalle, Rob,1 aBLUM, MICHAEL J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2011 Oct., v. 20, no. 20 p.4199-4215dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05245.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03813naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002900169245012100198300001600319520173900335592002802074650002102102650002102123650001102144650001002155650001002165650002602175650002202201650001302223650001602236650001402252650003702266650001602303650001502319650001402334650001202348650001302360650003902373650007302412650005902485650001102544650002202555650001302577650003102590650004302621650001402664650003002678650004302708650002402751653002102775653001602796653001602812653002102828653002202849653002302871700002002894700002402914773011902938856008503057852000903142655001203151IND50060479920221123034109.0200106e20130323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006047992DNAL7 a232012402pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires-dos-Santos, Teresa10aGenetic diversity and virulence profiles of Escherichia coli causing salpingitis and peritonitis in broiler breeders  ap. 873-880.  aThe genetic relatedness and virulence profiles of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli that caused salpingitis and peritonitis in 68 broiler breeders from 21 Danish farms were determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE), ECOR phylogrouping, and PCR-based virulotyping. Phylogroups A, B1, B2, and D accounted for 19.1%, 5.9%, 52.9%, and 22.1% of the isolates, respectively. Overall, a total of five main MLST-based clonal groups (3–38 isolates) were identified, comprising 85.3% of the isolates. The most common sequence type (ST) was ST95 (n=12), followed by the ST428-, ST23- and ST350-clonal complexes (CCs) (n=8, n=7 and n=6, respectively). The emerging, antimicrobial resistance-associated clones, ST131 and ST648, were represented by five and three isolates, respectively, whereas ST352 and the ST168 CC comprised four isolates each. Phylogroup-B2 isolates showed a greater prevalence of nine virulence genes (P<0.05). One specific clonal group was significantly associated with phylogroup-B2 isolates (P<0.001), and with isolates that induced secondary septicemia (P=0.001). PFGE analysis revealed 12 clusters of genetically related strains (2–12) sampled from unrelated and geographically distant farms, indicating the widespread distribution and recent vertical transmission of particular APEC lineages. Certain lineages showed more diversity, substantiating that long-term, endemic transmission has been maintained. In conclusion, endemic lineages of E. coli that cause salpingitis and peritonitis in broiler breeders, although diverse, tend to be phylogenetically related, and demonstrate conserved virulence genotypes that might be associated with greater pathogenic potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abroiler breeders 3aclones 3afarms 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aperitonitis 3aphylogeny 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asalpingitis 3asepticemia 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMultilocus Sequence Typing 2aPeritonitisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalpingitisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aVirulencexgenetics 0aEscherichia coli 0aSalpingitis 0aPeritonitis 0aBroiler breeders 0aGenetic diversity 0aVirulence profiles1 aBisgaard, Magne1 aChristensen, Henrik0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Mar. 23, v. 162, no. 2-4 p.873-880dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245007900178300001600257520119800273592002801471650002201499650004401521650002801565650001201593650001401605650001401619650002801633650002101661650001101682650001101693650001301704650001701717650001301734650000901747650003301756650002201789650003701811650001801848650001901866653001001885653000801895653000801903653000801911653002001919653001101939653001701950653001401967653001701981700002901998700007002027700003202097700003902129700007102168773011602239856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60550856720221118003848.0190408e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055085672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Nágila Freitas10aFibrous residues of palm oil as a source of green chemical building blocks  ap. 480-489.  aOil palm is an important industrial crop, and is usually harvested to obtain lipids and proteins.

Initially, fibers were acetosolv pulped, resulting in two fractions: a lignin-rich black liquor and cellulose-rich pulp. Lignin was recovered from the black liquor and totally chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching was applied to purify the cellulose. Fibers and biomacromolecules were characterized using several methods including SEM, FEG/SEM, TEM, DRX, GPC, zeta potential, TGA, and FTIR. The pulping-bleaching treatment improved the amount of crystalline cellulose in the pulp, yielding CNC with good thermal stability, a length of 289nm, diameter of 11nm, and an aspect ratio of 26. The lignin presented a high purity, with a syringyl-rich structure and good thermal stability. Such characteristics highlight the potential use of POPMF lignin as a green building-block and POPMF nanocellulose materials as renewable biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomass 3ableaching 3acellulose 3aindustrial applications 3aindustrial crops 3alignin 3alipids 3amesocarp 3ananocrystals 3aproteins 3apulp 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awaste liquors 3azeta potential 0aPOPMF 0aCNC 0aCNF 0aFOP 0aGreen chemistry 0aLignin 0aPlant fibers 0aCellulose 0aAgribusiness1 aPinheiro, José Aurélio1 aBrígida, Ana Iraidy Santa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4687-07361 aMorais, João Paulo Saraiva1 ade Souza Filho, Men de sá Moreira1 ade Freitas Rosa, Morsyleide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5224-97780 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Dec. 30, v. 94 p.480-489dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001900174245008500193300001800278520094500296592002801241650004401269650002501313650001201338650001501350650001901365650001401384650002301398650001001421650002001431650002101451650001201472650003201484650001401516650006701530650002101597650002801618650002401646650005001670653002301720653001301743653002401756653001101780653000901791700001201800700001401812700001301826773007801839856008901917852000902006655001202015IND60112220520221119205904.0160901e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011222052DNAL7 a237734452pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Wen-Jun10aToluene degradation by non-thermal plasma combined with a ferroelectric catalyst  ap. 1390-1395.  aDegradation of toluene in a gas by non-thermal plasma with a ferroelectric catalyst was studied at normal temperature and atmospheric pressure. Spontaneous polarization material (BaTiO3) and photocatalyst (TiO2) were added into plasma system simultively. Toluene degradation efficiency and specific energy density during the discharge process were investigated. Furthermore, byproducts and degradation mechanisms of toluene were also investigated. The toluene degradation efficiency increased when non-thermal plasma technology was combined with the catalyst. The toluene degradation efficiencies of the different catalysts tested were in the following order: BaTiO3/TiO2>BaTiO3>TiO2>no catalyst. A mass ratio of 2.38:1 was optimum for the BaTiO3 and TiO2 catalyst. The outlet gas was analyzed by gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the main compounds detected were CO2, H2O, O3 and benzene ring derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatmospheric pressure 3abenzene 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3agas chromatography 3aozone 3aspecific energy 3atitanium dioxide 3atoluene 2aBarium Compoundsxchemistry 2aCatalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aOzonexchemistry 2aPlasma Gasesxchemistry 2aTitaniumxchemistry 2aToluenexchemistryxisolation & purification. 0aNon-thermal plasma 0aCatalyst 0aToluene degradation 0aBaTiO3 0aTiO21 aMa, Lin1 aLiu, Huan1 aLi, Jian0 tChemosphere.g2013 Aug., v. 92 p.1390-1395dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009600171300001200267520116400279592002801443650002201471650001001493650001301503650001201516650001801528650003301546650001601579650002101595650001301616650001001629650001401639653002601653653002101679653002201700653001901722700002101741773010001762856008101862852000901943655001201952IND60604091820221118104637.0180716e20150920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060409182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicavoli, Joseph J.10aHigh ramp rate thermogravimetric analysis of zirconium(II) hydride and titanium(II) hydride  ap. 1-8.  aZirconium and titanium hydride are utilized in liquid phase metal foam processing techniques. This application results in immediate exposure to molten metal and almost immediate decomposition at high temperatures. Most decomposition characterization techniques utilize slow heating rates and are unable to capture the decomposition behavior of hydrides under foam processing conditions. In order to address this issue a specialized high ramp rate thermogravimetric analyzer was created from a xenon arc image refiner. In addition to thermogravimetry, complimentary techniques including X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize hydride decomposition and compare the results to literature. Hydrides were partially oxidized and separated into particles size ranges to evaluate the influence of these factors on decomposition. Oxidizing treatments were found to decrease decomposition rate only at temperatures below 933K (660°C) while particle size effects appeared to be negligible. Several improvements to the unique TGA apparatus presented in the current work are suggested to allow reliable kinetic modeling and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3afoams 3ahydrides 3aliquids 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium 3axenon 3azirconium 0aThermal decomposition 0aTitanium hydride 0aZirconium hydride 0aMetallic foams1 aSanders, Paul G.0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 616 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245010600197300001800303500002000321520148800341592002801829596007001857596003101927596003101958596006801989596006102057596005402118596006202172650001202234650001902246650001202265650001502277650001302292650001302305650002302318651001202341651001102353651001002364651001102374700001502385700001602400700006602416700005502482700001902537700005502556700001502611700001202626700001602638700001902654700005602673700005802729700001602787700001502803773013202818856007702950852000903027655001203036IND60789547720221117173652.0220821e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078954772DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JF0047022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincent, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9352-816712aA Nonlinear Statistical Model for Extracting a Climatic Signal From Glacier Mass Balance Measurements  ap. 2228-2242.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding changes in glacier mass balances is essential for investigating climate changes. However, glacier‐wide mass balances determined from geodetic observations do not provide a relevant climatic signal as they depend on the dynamic response of the glaciers. In situ point mass balance measurements provide a direct signal but show a strong spatial variability that is difficult to assess from heterogeneous in situ measurements over several decades. To address this issue, we propose a nonlinear statistical model that takes into account the spatial and temporal changes in point mass balances. To test this model, we selected four glaciers in different climatic regimes (France, Bolivia, India, and Norway) for which detailed point annual mass balance measurements were available over a large elevation range. The model extracted a robust and consistent signal for each glacier. We obtained explained variances of 87.5, 90.2, 91.3, and 75.5% on Argentière, Zongo, Chhota Shigri, and Nigardsbreen glaciers, respectively. The standard deviations of the model residuals are close to measurement uncertainties. The model can also be used to detect measurement errors. Combined with geodetic data, this method can provide a consistent glacier‐wide annual mass balance series from a heterogeneous network. This model, available to the whole community, can be used to assess the impact of climate change in different regions of the world from long‐term mass balance series.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNTS‐2016‐01cProgramme National de Télédétection Spatiale  cFrench Space Agency (CNES)  cNorwegian Research Council  aIFA‐14‐EAS‐22cDepartment of Science and Technology (DST)  cInstitut National des Sciences de l'Univers, CNRS (INSU)  cInstitut de Recherche pour le Dévelppement (IRD)  cObservatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble (OSUG) 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageodesy 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aresearch 3astatistical models 3aBolivia 3aFrance 3aIndia 3aNorway1 aSoruco, A.1 aAzam, M.

This equation is modified from the basic thermistor equation by a residual compensation method. The residual compensated equation includes a 2nd order error correction term. This equation is convenient for converting temperature to resistance and vice versa. Calibrations of various thermistors were performed in a high precision temperature bath to test the resistance–temperature relation. The thermistors were calibrated in glass tubes using a reference thermometer. Most calibrations are performed in a temperature span (15–35°C). From the resistance–temperature curves, the fitting function of the basic thermistor equation and the residual compensated equation were evaluated and their fitting errors were compared. Standard fitting errors (1σ) in temperature of the basic equation and the residual compensated basic equation were 8.131mK and 0.151mK respectively. The residual compensated equation showed about 1/54 smaller fitting errors than the basic thermistor equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3atemperature 3athermistors 3athermometers 0aTemperature measurement 0aNTC thermistor 0aCalibration equation 0aR–T relation 0aResidual compensation1 aOh, Se Woon0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 616 p.27-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245013500166500001900301520146400320592002801784650001101812650001301823650001601836650002201852650001601874650002201890650001501912650001801927650001701945650001601962651001301978700002701991700002202018773011902040856007302159852000902232655001202241IND60729508820221119153429.0210228e20210222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072950882DNAL7 a10.3390/w130405582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaweelarp, Sutthipong 10aEvaluation of Groundwater Potential and Safe Yield of Heterogeneous Unconsolidated Aquifers in Chiang Mai Basin, Northern Thailand  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChiang Mai basin has an escalating population growth resulting in high demand for water consumption. Lack of surface water supply in most parts of the basin gives rise to the increasing use of groundwater which leads to a continuous decline in groundwater level in the past decades. This study is the first long-term groundwater monitoring and modeling study that aims at developing a transient, regional groundwater flow model of heterogeneous unconsolidated aquifers based on the MODFLOW program. Long-term groundwater monitoring data from 49 piezometers were used in model calibration and validation. The pilot points technique was used to account for the spatial variability of hydrogeologic parameters of heterogeneous aquifers. The simulation results and statistics showed that most sensitive and significant model parameters were spatially variable hydraulic conductivities and recharge rates. The Chiang Mai basin’s unconsolidated aquifers do not have high potential. The water table and/or potentiometric surface in the southeast and southwest areas of Chiang Mai city were continuously decreasing with no sign of recovery indicating critical groundwater condition and careful management must be considered. Safe yield calculation, based on a 2-m average drawdown threshold, suggested that unconsolidated aquifers of the Chiang Mai basin can sustain overall abstraction rates up to 51.2 Mm³/y or approximately 214% of the current extraction rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3apiezometers 3apopulation growth 3astatistics 3asurface water 3awater supply 3awater table 3aThailand1 aKhebchareon, Morrakot 1 aSaenton, Schradh 0 tWater.g2021 Feb. 22, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130405583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245006900196300001800265500001400283500002000297520221700317592002802534596002502562596003302587650002302620650002202643650001702665650001702682650002602699650001502725650002002740650001502760650001002775650002602785650001502811650002902826650001102855650001302866650001602879650001302895650001702908650001302925700007002938773013603008856007303144852000903217655001203226IND60718307420221119123052.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830742DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.131822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerti, Emilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9286-011X10aMegafauna extinctions have reduced biotic connectivity worldwide  ap. 2131-2142.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Connectivity among ecosystems is necessary to sustain ecological processes that promote biodiversity, community stability and ecosystem resilience, such as organism and nutrient dispersal. Along with human land use and habitat fragmentation, connectivity can also be affected by faunal changes. Here, we address this issue by studying how human‐driven late Quaternary extinctions and extirpations of terrestrial mammals have affected the movement capacity of assemblages, an estimate of the potential connectivity among ecosystems promoted by wildlife. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Late Pleistocene to the Anthropocene. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: All 4,395 (4,073 extant and 322 extinct) terrestrial mammals alive in the Late Pleistocene. METHODS: We combined macroecological estimates of home range size with range maps of current and natural geographical distributions of species to investigate how human pressure has modified natural movement capacity of terrestrial assemblages and how movement capacity will respond to future extinction and rewilding scenarios. RESULTS: Our results showed that 74% of average and 83% of maximum movement capacity of Late Pleistocene mammal assemblages has been lost owing to prehistorical and historical extinctions and extirpations. We also found that movement capacity will decrease further if current extinction trajectories are not averted. However, our results showed that current average and maximum movement capacity can be restored to twice their current values under a full rewilding scenario and that average, but not maximum movement capacity, will increase under a conservative rewilding scenario, that is, without restoring the largest megafauna most likely to cause major human–wildlife conflicts. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Prehistorical and historical losses of megafauna have caused severe decreases in movement capacity of mammal assemblages, hence large reductions in ecosystem connectivity. Reintroductions can partly restore biotic connectivity, especially when the largest megafauna are also restored. However, natural levels of movement capacity cannot be recovered fully without including ecological replacements for extinct species in rewilding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  a16549cVillum Fonden  aCF16‐0005cCarlsbergfondet 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aecological resilience 3aecosystems 3aextinct species 3aextinction 3afauna 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahome range 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ahumans 3aland use 3amethodology 3apressure 3atrajectories 3awildlife1 aSvenning, Jens‐Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3415-08620 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2020 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.2131-2142dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.131823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002400150245008900174300001600263520078700279592002801066650001701094650001501111650001701126650001201143650002301155650001401178650001501192650000801207650001901215650001401234650003101248650001401279650001801293650001601311700002001327700001801347773010001365856008601465852000901551655001201560IND4447185020221120022821.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444718502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivertsen, Agnar H.10aAutomatic freshness assessment of cod (Gadus morhua) fillets by Vis/Nir spectroscopy  ap. 317-323.  aVIS/NIR spectroscopy for differentiating between fresh and frozen-thawed cod fillets and for assessing the freshness as days on ice has been evaluated.

Results show that frozen-thawed cod fillets can be fully separated from fresh fillets using a small subset of wavelengths in the visible region. Freshness as days on ice can be determined with an accuracy of 1.6days on individual fillets.

Electrofishing is a widely used method for sampling fish in small streams, but the potential for detrimental effects call for its careful use. Methods that reduce exposure for individual fish, yet still provide useful abundance estimates, are therefore desirable. Using data from a juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) monitoring program in Idaho, we quantified variation and bias in capture probability from three-pass depletion electrofishing, and evaluated a method for indexing abundance based on single-pass electrofishing. Capture probability varied primarily at the level of sampling visits, with little spatial variation (i.e. at the level of the study sites). Water temperature, channel depth and, to a lesser degree, discharge best described the variation in capture probability between sampling events. We found no effect of previous capture and handling on individual capture probability, and the capture probability did not differ between subyearling and overyearling fish. Finally, a simple mixed-effects model with study site as a random effect, which related first-pass catch to the associated multiple-pass removal estimate, explained 91% of the variation in our data. The main limitation of the approach is that it does not provide error propagation and confidence intervals to the abundance estimates. However, the approach can be useful where multiple depletion electrofishing data exist, and when a single point estimate is sufficient to monitor major population trends in small streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aconfidence interval 3aendangered species 3afish 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amonitoring 3astreams 3awater temperature 3aIdaho 0aendangered species 0afish 0amanagement 0amonitoring 0asurvey1 aKennedy, Brian P.0 tNorthwest science.g2017, v. 91, no. 4 p.344-355dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.091.04043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245010100166300001600267520149000283592002801773650001501801650001001816650001401826650002701840650001801867650001501885650001501900650001401915650001101929650001201940650001301952650003301965650000901998650001002007651001202017700002402029700001702053700002102070700002102091773012702112856004502239852000902284655001202293IND50067175920221120204330.0130615e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006717592DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2012002342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChtourou, Mohamed10aComparative study of olive oil quality from Chemlali Sfax versus Arbequina cultivated in Tunisia  ap. 631-640.  aThe effects of the geographical region on the behavior of the Arbequina olive cultivar (cv) cultivated in the south of Tunisia (in the arid zone of Sfax) was compared to an autochthonous cultivar (Chemlali Sfax). Various olive parameters were analyzed, such as ripening index, pulp/stone ratio, oil contents, and sensory profiles. Most of the quality indices and fatty acid composition showed significant variations among olive cultivars. Arbequina cv is characterized by high oil yield with a less total phenols and pigments content than Chemlali Sfax cv. Cielab spectrophotometer coordinate L*, b*, and a* values show a great difference in olive oil colors. In spite of their low oleic acid contents, autochthonous cultivar presented a higher induction time (6.82 and 2.68 h for Chemlali and Arbequina, respectively) and high contents of phenolic compounds (158.28 and 110.27 mg/kg for Chemlali Sfax and Arbequina, respectively). The most important compounds identified were oleuropein aglycon (45.50 mg/kg), hydroxytyrosol (3.68 mg/kg), 1‐acetoxypinoresinol (6.23 mg/kg) in Chemlali Sfax oil and hydroxytyrosol glucoside (25.15 mg/kg), tyrosol (12.51 mg/kg), and oleuropein aglycon (30.60 mg/kg) in Arbequina oil. Chemlali Sfax also possessed a very bitter taste, whereas the Arbequina had a sweet taste amongst its attributes. The principal component analysis of the results indicated that the geographical region has significantly affected the olive oil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acolor 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3alipid content 3aoleic acid 3aoleuropein 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aphenols 3apigments 3aprincipal component analysis 3apulp 3ataste 3aTunisia1 aGargouri, Boutheina1 aJaber, Hazem1 aAbdelhedi, Ridha1 aBouaziz, Mohamed0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2013 June, v. 115, no. 6 p.631-640dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.201200234  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011300172300001600285500001500301520156300316592002801879650002501907650001601932650002401948650002701972650001501999650001802014650001502032650002502047650001102072650001302083650001102096650002602107650001102133650000902144650001202153650001802165651001102183651001102194653002402205653001102229653001902240653002202259653001702281700002802298700003002326773010402356856008202460852000902542655001202551IND60517206220221123043027.0190728e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051720622DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053130000692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetracca, Lisanne S.10aOccupancy estimation of jaguar Panthera onca to assess the value of east-central Mexico as a jaguar corridor  ap. 133-140.  a2019-12-06  aThe use of wildlife corridors to maintain landscape connectivity has become increasingly relevant to the conservation of wide-ranging species, including the jaguar Panthera onca. Jaguars are particularly threatened in Mexico, where corridor linkages are tenuous as a result of habitat fragmentation. Our study assessed a section of potential corridor south of the Sierra Madre Oriental in eastern Mexico. We conducted 245 interviews with local inhabitants in 140 36-km² sampling units over a 5-month period and compiled detection histories for jaguars and five prey species: collared peccary Pecari tajacu, red brocket deer Mazama americana, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, spotted paca Agouti paca, and nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus. These detection histories were then analysed using site occupancy modelling. Each sampling unit was assigned a probability of habitat use based on (1) the two smaller prey species (paca and armadillo) and (2) at least two of the larger prey species (collared peccary and two deer species) using habitat in that unit. This probability estimate was considered a proxy for the prey base of each sampling unit and therefore the unit's suitability as a jaguar corridor. Although the prey base in some areas appears adequate to support a jaguar population, large-scale development projects and the paucity of jaguar sign are major obstacles to this region's potential as a jaguar corridor. Our results suggest that the eastern coast of Mexico may not be a priority area for range-wide jaguar conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological corridors 3aprobability 3ahabitat preferences 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3alandscapes 3aPecari tajacu 3ainterviews 3adevelopment projects 3amodels 3ahabitats 3acoasts 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aAgouti 3adeer 3aDasypus 3aPanthera onca 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aoccupancy modelling 0ajaguar 0aTayassu tajacu 0awildlife corridor 0aConnectivity1 aRamírez-Bravo, O.

Solutions of 20, 30 and 40%, by weight, of DCP in 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate and cumene were run at different phi factors experiments(1.8>φ>1.1). The results depicted that cumene reduces the severity of the runaway decomposition of DCP, while the phi factor of the experiments showed to have a high influence on the rise of temperature and pressure. Values up to 18 and 27 times higher, respectively, were obtained at same concentration when reducing the phi factor from 1.8 to 1.1. Temperatures and self-heating rates obtained at different phi factor experiments were scaled up to a phi factor equal to 1.0 using the correction method recommended by the Design Institute for Emergency Relief System (DIERS) and developed by Fisher [1]. The results showed that this method works well at low concentrations. However, at the highest concentration, fast heating rates (up to 600°C/min) were observed in the low phi factor equipment. These fast heating rates, most probably caused the equipment to loss its adiabaticity, and the scale up of the temperatures and self-heating rates did not longer give reliable results. This means that the estimation of experimental variables such temperature and rate of temperature rise (used for vent sizing calculations), directly from the data obtained at lab scale, even when using an advance low phi factor equipment, can result in under-conservative design calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acalorimetry 3atemperature 0aRunaway decomposition 0aAdiabatic calorimetry 0aDicumyl peroxide 0aSensitivity analysis 0aFast self-heating rate system 0aPhi factor correction1 aMoreno, Valeria Casson1 aWaldram, Simon P.1 aVéchot, Luc N.1 aMannan, Sam,0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Oct. 10, v. 617 p.28-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245007600199300001800275500002000293520108900313592002801402596009901430596003101529596008901560596009601649596007201745596005901817596005901876596005901935596005901994596005902053596005902112596011102171650002002282650002902302650001502331650001302346650002502359650000802384650001302392650001102405700005802416700005702474700001502531700005702546700005802603700005502661700006102716700005502777700001602832773013202848856007702980852000903057655001203066IND60789548020221123011727.0220821e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078954802DNAL7 a10.1029/2017JF0043332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiangying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8616-431010aImportance of Mountain Glaciers as a Source of Dissolved Organic Carbon  ap. 2123-2134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIce sheets and glaciers have been shown to deliver large amounts of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream aquatic ecosystems, but recent studies may underestimate the release of DOC from mountain glaciers. To date, continuous measurements of DOC from mountain glaciers throughout entire glacier melt season are very limited. Here we present high‐density data on DOC from two Asian mountain glaciers over a full melt season in 2013 and compile a global data set of DOC from 42 mountain glaciers. Based on our study and previously published DOC data, we estimate the storage and release of DOC associated with Asian mountain glaciers to be 8.8 to 13.8 Tg C and 0.19 Tg C/a, respectively. Rough extrapolation of glacier runoff to a global scale suggests that DOC release from mountain glaciers is on the order of 0.8 Tg C/a, which is 1.4 times higher than the most current estimates. The current release of DOC from mountain glaciers is therefore far more significant than previously thought and should be considered in future evaluation of the global carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data  aSKLCS‐ZZ‐2018cthe Independent Program of the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences  a268170cAcademy of Finland  aSKLFSE201411cOpen Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering  aSKLCS‐OP‐2017‐03cOpen Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences  a2018B10214cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a41771040cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41730751cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671053cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91647102cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671071cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41761017cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20145027312cSpecial Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology‐Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering 3adata collection 3adissolved organic carbon 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aglobal carbon budget 3aice 3aresearch 3arunoff1 aDing, Yongjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7237-55791 aXu, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6322-339X1 aHe, Xiaobo1 aHan, Tianding1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4237-90501 aKang, Shichang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2115-90051 aWu, Qingbai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-09751 aMika, Sillanpää1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3247-53371 aYu, Zhongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3471-85771 aLi, Qijiang0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Sept., v. 123, no. 9 p.2123-2134dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JF0043333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167300001800282500001900300520095600319592002801275650002201303650002101325650001501346650002101361650001501382650001101397650001301408650003701421650001601458700005801474700001601532773011301548856008401661852000901745655001201754IND60698086620210903000000.0200609e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069808662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c003752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Luyun10aHigh-Yield Electrochemical Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles by Enzyme-Modified Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes  ap. 6089-6094.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report a novel electrochemical approach for synthesizing colloidal silver in an aqueous phase by a hemoglobin-modified boron-doped diamond electrode. The resulting Ag nanoparticles are within 10 nm in size and highly monodisperse with minimal electrode deposition. We also introduce a method for measuring the yield of synthesized nanoparticles using square-wave voltammetry as an alternative to UV–vis spectroscopy. More than 50% of the transferred electrons contributed directly to the formation of silver nanoparticles. This high yield indicates that such electrochemical synthesis is an efficient one-pot method for producing colloidal silver free of toxic reagents and offers a path toward green metal nanoparticle synthesis in solution. A comparative study using alternative electrodes, modifiers, and surfactants suggests a mechanism for the formation of silver nanoparticles mediated by hemoglobin-modified boron-doped diamond electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrosynthesis 3ananosilver 3asilver 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avoltammetry1 aSantiago, Ibon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2822-98301 aFoord, John0 tLangmuir.g2020 May 14, v. 36, no. 22 p.6089-6094dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c003753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520179200284592002802076650002302104650001002127650001002137650001302147650001202160650001302172650001202185650001302197650001502210650001302225650001102238650001002249651001202259653002102271653001802292653001702310653003002327653002002357653001302377653003602390700002002426700001302446700001602459700001402475773010402489856008202593852000902675655001202684IND60517206420221123043415.0190729e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051720642DNAL7 a10.1017/S003060531200138X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Gerhardt, K.14aThe role of elephant Loxodonta africana pathways as a spatial variable in crop-raiding location  ap. 436-444.  aShort-range elephant Loxodonta africana movements were examined in a heterogeneous landscape mosaic of settlements, crop fields and remnant forest in the Caprivi Strip, Namibia. We explored the penetration of the landscape through the use of permanent pathways and determined the impact of pathway use on crop-raiding location. Pathways were linear, devoid of vegetation and maintained by repeated movement. Functional connectivity of pathways was not species-specific, and pathways were used by various species. Elephants travelled in single file at night and we recorded selective pathway use: females selected pathways away from settlements to access water, whereas males used pathways among settlements to launch crop raids. Proximity of raided fields to the nearest pathway was the only significant spatial variable explaining crop-raiding location. Bulls were responsible for all crop-raiding incidents. We conclude that (1) pathways were the most significant spatial variable influencing which fields were raided, (2) crop-raiding from pathways may maximize foraging efficiency by reducing time spent and distance travelled while foraging, (3) pathways may facilitate penetration of the matrix by connecting predictable resources (crops) with preferred shelter areas, crossing points at roads and preferred drinking spots, and (4) access to the Kwandu River is restricted by settlements, predictably resulting in human–elephant conflict. By highlighting the relevance of pathways for movement of elephants we show that an understanding of the use of pathways is important for land-use planning in conservation landscapes, specifically with regard to human–elephant conflict. We also argue for the need to more fully explore pathway occurrence and use at larger spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxodonta africana 3abulls 3acrops 3adrinking 3afemales 3aforaging 3aforests 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3arivers 3aroads 3aNamibia 0aAfrican elephant 0aCaprivi Strip 0aconnectivity 0ahuman–elephant conflict 0aland-use mosaic 0apathways 0atransfrontier conservation area1 aVan Niekerk, A.1 aKidd, M.1 aSamways, M.1 aHanks, J.0 tOryx.g2014 July, v. 48, no. 3 p.436-444dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003060531200138X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001200283520151900295592002801814650001601842650001301858650001601871650002601887650002101913650001201934650001501946650002101961650001401982650001201996650001102008650001102019650001702030650002602047700001502073773011402088856008102202852000902283655001202292IND60449337720221118044632.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044933772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-015-1998-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeligoz, Ayse10aMorphological, physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress of Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) seedlings  ap. 243.  aIn this study, the effect of irrigation intervals (drought stress) on growth, predawn xylem water potential (Ψ w), the osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψπ ₁₀₀), the osmotic potential at the turgor loss point (Ψπ TLP), osmotic adjustment and osmotic solutes (soluble sugars and proline) of Pinus pinea L. seedlings were examined. An experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions using four watering treatments (control, 7-, 14- and 21-day irrigation intervals) in the first growth season; from mid-July to early November. Results showed that irrigation interval had significant effect on growth characteristics, Ψ w, water relation parameters, and osmotic solutes. The increasing irrigation interval significantly decreased the seedling height, root collar diameter, root, stem and needle dry weight, number of lateral branches, root percentage, root:shoot ratio and diameter:height ratio. Ψ w and total soluble sugars decreased while proline content increased with the increase of drought stress. The Ψπ ₁₀₀ and Ψπ TLP significantly decreased in drought-stressed seedlings compared to control (no stress) seedlings. The results suggest that the impact of drought stress increased with the increase of irrigation interval. Therefore, in the drought-stressed P. pinea seedlings were indicated osmotic adjustment by increasing the proline content and decreasing Ψπ ₁₀₀ and Ψπ TLP during drought stress. Growth decreased under drought stress conditions in P. pinea seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinea 3abranches 3agreenhouses 3airrigation scheduling 3aosmotic pressure 3aproline 3aroot crown 3aroot shoot ratio 3aseedlings 3asolutes 3asugars 3aturgor 3awater stress 3axylem water potential1 aGur, Merve0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2015 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.243-243dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-1998-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013300171300002000304520209300324592002802417650001202445650001902457650002002476650002002496650001802516650001302534650001202547650001702559650001302576650001802589650002902607650002202636650001802658650001602676700005502692700001402747700001702761700001702778700005602795773012202851856008702973852000903060655001203069IND60744697920221120181528.0210716e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074469792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c006472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Cuijiao10aExperimental and Kinetic Study on the Oxidation of Syngas-Ammonia under Both N₂ and CO₂ Atmospheres in a Jet-Stirred Reactor  ap. 11445-11456.  aAlthough syngas combustion has been extensively investigated, previous studies did not systematically examine the fuel-NOₓ formation from ammonia-containing syngas in both N₂ and CO₂ atmospheres. Investigations on syngas-ammonia oxidation are significant for suppressing the fuel-NOₓ emission from the combustion of actual syngas containing NH₃. This study presents new experimental results on syngas-ammonia oxidation under both N₂ and CO₂ atmospheres in a jet-stirred reactor. The effects of CO₂ concentration (XCO₂: 0–60%), temperature (T: 900–1400 K), equivalence ratio (Φ: 0.4–1.65), initial CH₄ concentration (XCH₄: 0–2000 ppm), CO/H₂ ratio, and residence time (τ: 0.001–10 s) are investigated. For the oxidation of syngas-ammonia, the reactant consumption is delayed and more CO is produced in high CO₂ concentration. A critical temperature to obtain the peak N₂O production is found, and it is slightly reduced from 1000 to 950 K with Φ increasing from 0.63 to 1.25. Moreover, the N₂O concentration is basically insensitive to the concentration of CH₄ and the CO/H₂ ratio in syngas. The NO production is enhanced with the increase of T, XCH₄, and the CO/H₂ ratio, while it is reduced with increasing Φ. Interestingly, the high concentration of CO₂ suppresses the fuel-NO formation in fuel-lean conditions, while it significantly enhances the fuel-NO production in fuel-rich conditions. To minimize emissions of NO, N₂O, and CO, it is recommended to operate the reaction at T > 1000 K and simultaneously avoid significantly high temperatures at the equivalence ratio of approximately 0.9, low values of initial CH₄ concentration and the CO/H₂ ratio (e.g., <1), long residence times (τ > 2 s), and high concentrations of CO₂ (XCO₂ > 30%). Furthermore, the numerical simulations agree well with the vast majority of measurements, and the dependence of NO on Φ at XCO₂ = 30% is also well predicted. The present study provides new fundamental understandings of the fuel-NOₓ formation from ammonia-containing syngas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3afuel combustion 3agas emissions 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3areaction kinetics 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aLi, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5359-98411 aWang, Kai1 aShi, Guodong1 aWang, Feifei1 aLiu, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6771-93680 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 July 04, v. 35, no. 14 p.11445-11456dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c006473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010200170300001600272520147400288592002801762650001401790650002001804650001801824650001201842650000901854650001201863650003101875650001501906650001001921650001301931650001501944650001301959651001501972651001001987651001001997651001102007651001302018653003902031653002002070653003002090653002402120700002002144700002002164700002602184700003002210700002102240700002202261773010402283856008202387852000902469655001202478IND60517206520221123043300.0190729e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051720652DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053120014082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimcharoen, Achara10aFemale tiger Panthera tigris home range size and prey abundance: important metrics for management  ap. 370-377.  aTigers Panthera tigris are highly threatened and continue to decline across their entire range. Actions to restore and conserve populations need to be based on science but, in South-east Asia, information on ecology and behaviour of tigers is lacking. This study reports the relationship between the home range size of female tigers and prey abundance, using data from radio-collared tigers in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, and published data from other studies. A total of 11 tigers, four males and seven females, were fitted with global positioning system collars, to estimate home ranges using 95 and 100% minimum convex polygons (MCP). Prey abundance was estimated by faecal accumulation rates. The mean home range size of male tigers was 267 and 294 km² based on 95 and 100% MCPs, respectively; the mean female home range size was 70 and 84 km², respectively. Territories of male and female tigers had little overlap, which indicated both sexes were territorial. Mean densities of the prey species sambar Rusa unicolor, barking deer Muntiacus muntjac and large bovids were 7.5, 3.5 and 3.0 km⁻², respectively. When female home range size and prey abundance were compared at six locations in Thailand, and at other sites in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Russia, a significant negative correlation was found between prey abundance and home range size. Monitoring this relationship can provide managers with metrics for setting conservation goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuntiacus 3aPanthera tigris 3aRusa unicolor 3acollars 3adeer 3afemales 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahome range 3amales 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3awildlife 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 3aNepal 3aRussia 3aThailand 0aHuai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary 0aPanthera tigris 0aprotected area management 0asatellite telemetry1 aSavini, Tommaso1 aGale, George A.1 aSaksit Simčharœ̄n,1 aDuangchantrasiri, Somphot1 aPakpien, Somporn1 aSmith, James L.D.0 tOryx.g2014 July, v. 48, no. 3 p.370-377dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053120014083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012000168520142000288592002801708650002201736650003701758650001101795650001501806650001401821650002301835650001401858650002001872650001801892650004101910650000901951650001301960650001301973650001901986650000702005650001502012650003402027650003302061650001802094650003702112653000802149653001402157653001902171653001202190653002602202700002002228700001102248700001702259700001702276700001802293773011902311856008802430852000902518655001202527IND60659307320221119225012.0191121e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065930732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1339632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gong10aOctadecylamine degradation through catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate by Fe[sbnd]Mn layered double hydroxide  aA kind of heterogeneous catalyst, FeMn layered double hydroxide (Fe-Mn-LDH), was fabricated by coprecipitation process and used as PMS activator to degrade a novel organic pollutant octadecylamine (ODA). And the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), Mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were utilized to characterize the fresh and used Fe-Mn-LDH. After a serious of degradation experiments, it was clearly to see that the activator possessed excellent activation property for PMS and was capable of removing 85% ODA (10 mg·L−1) within 25 min obviously higher than pure PMS. Moreover, the effect of some elements (such as PMS consumption, catalyst consistence and initial pH value), different reaction system and catalyst repeatability on ODA degradation were also explored. And by identification of main radical experiment, SO4— and HO were both confirmed the primary radicals. What's more, extra anion and nature organic matter (NOM) addition experiment displayed that NOM, NO3— and CO32— perform a negative effect on ODA degradation but Cl— could promote it. In addition, repeated experiments and metal leaching after degradation showed good stability of Fe-Mn-LDH. Finally, based on the XPS and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GS-MS) technology, the possible degradation mechanism and pathway were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aamines 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3acoprecipitation 3afree radicals 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3airon 3aleaching 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectrometers 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPMS 0aFe-Mn-LDH 0aOctadecylamine 0aGC–MS 0aMechanism and pathway1 aNengzi, Li-chao1 aLi, Bo1 aGao, Yingjie1 aZhu, Guixian1 aCheng, Xiuwen0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 695 p.133963-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1339633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245008100163300001600244520162200260592002801882650001401910650001401924650001301938650002001951650001101971650001501982650001501997650001402012650001302026650001302039650001002052650001402062650001502076650001402091651001302105651001702118651001202135653001402147653001402161653001902175653001702194700002102211700003202232700002202264773012002286856007702406852000902483655001202492IND60594551920221116173834.0180625s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059455192DNAL7 a10.3955/046.091.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPackila, Mark L.10aLong-Distance Wolverine Dispersal from Wyoming to Historic Range in Colorado  ap. 399-407.  aWolverines (Gulo gulo) within the conterminous U.S. exist as a metapopulation dependent upon individuals dispersing between patches of habitat to persist. Dispersal events can be difficult to document for long-ranging carnivores, but have implications for understanding gene flow and connectivity between both currently occupied and historically occupied habitat. Here, we describe the long-distance dispersal of a subadult, male wolverine (M56) from a reproductive population in northwest Wyoming to northern Colorado where wolverines had been absent for 90 years. M56 was ultimately killed in North Dakota in 2016, the first verified wolverine in that state in over 200 years. Following capture and collaring, we collected aerial VHF telemetry locations as M56 navigated potential barriers, including interstate highways and subdivisions, and travelled extensively outside of primary wolverine habitat through the arid grasslands and shrublands of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion. Straight-line distances for dispersals from Wyoming to Colorado (516 km) and from Colorado to North Dakota (826 km) are the longest straight-line dispersal distances reported for the species at this time. The Wyoming Basin Ecoregion M56 traversed is dominated by sagebrush and topography less rugged than that typical of the high elevation, mountainous habitat wolverines use in the conterminous U.S. This dispersal event offers evidence of connectivity between occupied habitat in Wyoming and unoccupied habitat within the species' historic range in Colorado and provides a detailed account of the path M56 took through atypical habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aGulo gulo 3aaltitude 3aarid grasslands 3abasins 3acarnivores 3aecoregions 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3ahighways 3amales 3amountains 3ashrublands 3atelemetry 3aColorado 3aNorth Dakota 3aWyoming 0awolverine 0adispersal 0ametapopulation 0aconnectivity1 aRiley, Meghan D.1 aSpence, R.

Success of surfactant flooding strongly relies on surfactant loss through its adsorption onto reservoir minerals to ensure maximum transfer to target reservoir. The current study examines the adsorption behavior of saponin natural surfactant onto carbonate rock outcrops. As an environmentally friendly extract from plants, saponins have shown the potential to increase oil recovery, although saponin loss or adsorption on surfaces is yet to be studied. Common synthetic surfactants of various types (i.e., cationic and anionic) and different molecular structures (other nonionic surfactants) have also been studied to provide comparisons to saponin. The surfactant adsorption onto carbonate samples was studied by batch adsorption experiments, with the residual surfactant concentration determined by the surface tension technique. It was found that saponin, a natural nonionic surfactant, adsorbed less than the ionic surfactants, since saponin adsorption is not governed by electrostatic interactions but weaker hydrogen bonding. Such data concludes that saponins are likely to yield less retention than the ionic surfactants, but compared to other nonionic surfactants its retention is greater. This is likely attributed to differing surfactant molecular structures. Due to its branch-like structure with more terminal functional groups, saponin adsorbs more on the rock surface compared to other long-chain nonionic surfactants. The findings of the current study provide a useful guide in surfactant selection for EOR and highlight a potential of natural and environmentally friendly surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbonate rocks 3acarbonates 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3anonionic surfactants 3aoils 3asaponins 3asurface tension 3awettability1 aWathon, Muhammad Hizbul1 aThanasaksukthawee, Vorasate1 aSaul, Alexander1 aTangparitkul, Suparit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4316-33040 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 June 25, v. 35, no. 14 p.11193-11202dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c007213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245008300158300001600241520171800257592002801975650003602003650001502039650001602054650002402070650003802094650002002132650001202152650001002164650001002174650001702184650001902201650001402220650001002234650001502244653003602259653001702295653001302312653001702325653001402342700002102356700001802377700001902395773013702414856007702551852000902628655001202637IND60131776920221119175519.0151127e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013177692DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0046.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHälli, Outi10aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae seroprevalence in farmed wild boars in finland  ap. 813-818.  aThe aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of serum antibodies to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) in Finnish farmed wild boars and to evaluate basic risk factors for seropositivity of the agent. A sampling frame was compiled based on the national record of wild boar farmers (n = 117), and 26 herds were included in the study. Serum samples (n = 206) were obtained from all animals slaughtered from these herds during the 2007–2008 period. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were used to detect the possible presence of antibodies toward 12 serotypes of APP. Altogether, 1,442 analyses were performed, out of which 35 (2.4%) exceeded the positive cut-off value. Correspondingly, 26 of the pigs (12.6%) were found to be seropositive for any serotype of APP. The apparent animal prevalence of the cross-reacting APP serotypes 1, 9, and 11 was 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1–7%); it was 0.5% (CI 0–1%) for serotype 2; 3.4% (CI 1–6%) for serotypes 3, 6, and 8; 7.3% (CI 4–11%) for serotypes 4 and 7; 0.5% (CI 0–1%) for serotype 10; and 1.5% (CI 0–3%) for serotype 12. No antibodies against serotype 5s were detected. The apparent farm prevalence of APP serotypes 1, 9, and 11 was 15.4% (CI 2–29%); that of serotype 2 was 3.8% (CI 0–11%); that of serotypes 3, 6, and 8 was 11.5% (CI 0–24%); that of serotypes 4 and 7 was 34.6% (CI 16–53%); that of serotype 10 was 3.8% (CI 0–11%); and that of serotype 12 was 7.7% (CI 0–18%). In conclusion, the prevalence of serum antibodies to different APP serotypes was low in farmed wild boar. Risk factor analysis did not reveal any significant animal- or herd-level risk factors for seropositivity of the agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afactor analysis 3afarmers 3afarms 3aherds 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3aswine 3awild boars 0aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 0arisk factors 0aserology 0aSus scrofa L 0awild boar1 aAla-Kurikka, Eve1 aWallgren, Per1 aHeinonen, Mari0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 45, no. 4 p.813-818dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2014-0046.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009900168520140100267592002801668650002901696650001701725650002301742650002001765650001901785650001901804650003401823650002101857650001501878650002201893650001601915650001601931650001301947653002801960653001401988653001902002653002102021653002602042700001502068700006002083700001602143700001502159700001702174773011302191856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60723392420221120205957.0210603e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072339242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Leilei10aAugmentation of chloramphenicol degradation by Geobacter-based biocatalysis and electric field  aElectroactive microorganisms and electrochemical technologies have been separately used for environmental remediation such as antibiotics removal, yet the efficiency of coupling these two methods for chlorinated antibiotics removal is poorly known. Here we tested the synergy of Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, an electroactive bacteria, and an electrical field, on chloramphenicol removal. Removal is increased two-fold by increasing the temperature from 30°C to 37°C. The cyclic voltammograms and chronoamperometry tests demonstrated that G. sulfurreducens PCA catalyzed chloramphenicol chemical reduction with electrode as excusive electron donor. A critical voltage, −0.6 to −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, was discovered for chloramphenicol degradation with an increase of removal rate about 2.62-folds, from 31.06% to 81.41%. Combined removal with both G. sulfurreducens PCA and an electrical field increased the apparent rate constant and reached 82.77% removal at −0.5 V. Specially, the combined removal at −0.5 V even presented more robust removal efficiency compared to −0.6 V (78.64%) without G. sulfurreducens PCA. Mass spectrometry of degradation products indicates the reduction of nitro into amine groups, and dechlorination into less toxic compounds. Overall, combined biocatalysis and an electrical field is a promising method to remove antibiotics from polluted environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3abiocatalysis 3achemical reduction 3achloramphenicol 3adechlorination 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amass spectrometry 3aremediation 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aChloramphenicol removal 0aGeobacter 0aElectric filed 0aCritical voltage 0aSynergistic operation1 aLi, Jiajia1 aLichtfouse, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8535-80731 aLi, Zhenkai1 aWang, Quan1 aLiu, Fanghua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 15, v. 410 p.124977-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013800173300001800311500001900329500001100348520255300359592002802912650002002940650001202960650001502972650001502987650000803002650001503010650001603025650001603041650001503057650001803072650001503090650002703105650002403132650001303156650001703169650001203186650001203198650002203210650001403232650001703246650001803263650002003281650001503301650001303316700002203329773013003351856008203481852000903563655001203572IND60699855320221119073947.0200623e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069985532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06691-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Wanderley de,10aMembrane-bound extracellular vesicles secreted by parasitic protozoa: cellular structures involved in the communication between cells  ap. 2005-2023.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe focus of this review is a group of structures/organelles collectively known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are secreted by most, if not all, cells, varying from mammalian cells to protozoa and even bacteria. They vary in size: some are small (100–200 nm) and others are larger (> 200 nm). In protozoa, however, most of them are small or medium in size (200–400 nm). These include vesicles from different origins. We briefly review the biogenesis of this distinct group that includes (a) exosome, which originates from the multivesicular bodies, an important component of the endocytic pathway; (b) ectosome, formed from a budding process that takes place in the plasma membrane of the cells; (c) vesicles released from the cell surface following a process of patching and capping of ligand/receptor complexes; (d) other processes where tubules secreted by the parasite subsequently originate exosome-like structures. Here, special emphasis is given to EVs secreted by parasitic protozoa such as Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Trichomonas, and Giardia. Most of them have been characterized as exosomes that were isolated using several approaches and characterized by electron microscopy, proteomic analysis, and RNA sequencing. The results obtained show clearly that they present several proteins and different types of RNAs. From the functional point of view, it is now clear that the secreted exosomes can be incorporated by the parasite itself as well as by mammalian cells with which they interact. As a consequence, there is interference both with the parasite (induction of differentiation, changes in infectivity, etc.) and with the host cell. Therefore, the EVs constitute a new system of transference of signals among cells. On the other hand, there are suggestions that exosomes may constitute potential biotechnology tools and are important players of what has been designated as nanobiotechnology. They may constitute an important delivery system for gene therapy and molecular-displaying cell regulation capabilities when incorporated into other cells and even by interfering with the exosomal membrane during its biogenesis, targeting the vesicles via specific ligands to different cell types. These vesicles may reach the bloodstream, overflow through intercellular junctions, and even pass through the central nervous system blood barrier. There is evidence that it is possible to interfere with the composition of the exosomes by interfering with multivesicular body biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia 3aLeishmania 3aPlasmodium 3aRNA 3aToxoplasma 3aTrichomonas 3aTrypanosoma 3abiogenesis 3abiotechnology 3ablood flow 3acentral nervous system 3aelectron microscopy 3aexosomes 3agene therapy 3aligands 3amammals 3ananobiotechnology 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apathogenicity 3aplasma membrane 3aproteomics 3aresearch1 aBarrias, Emile S.0 tParasitology research.g2020 July, v. 119, no. 7 p.2005-2023dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06691-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010600163300001200269520161600281592002801897650001801925650001401943650002301957650001301980650001501993650001102008650001702019650001202036650001902048650001202067650002302079650001302102650001402115650001802129650001402147650001902161650001202180650001102192650001802203650002102221653002002242653001302262653001602275653001702291700003902308773011602347856007702463852000902540655001202549IND60594552020221116173548.0180625s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059455202DNAL7 a10.3955/046.092.01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Stephen P.10aLaboratory Evaluation of the Direct Impact of Biochar on Adult Survival of Four Forest Insect Species  ap. 1-8.  aApplication of biochar to managed agricultural and forest ground has been demonstrated to increase soil fertility and productivity and may aid in the retention of H₂O and water-soluble nutrients thereby improving water quality while reducing soil acidity and nutrient leaching. However, there have been few studies that examine potential effects of biochar on insect communities. We examined the direct effects of one formulation of dry biochar on survival of four species of common forest insects: major adult workers of the thatch ants, Formica obscuripes Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae); adult bark beetles, Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and adults of two bark beetle predators, Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Trogossitidae) and Enoclerus sphegeus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Cleridae). There was a significant reduction in survival for three of the four species (F. obscuripes, I. pini and T. chlorodia) when exposed to dry biochar in confined arenas. The decreased survival only occurred when the insects had direct contact with the material. Further, while exposure to all particle sizes significantly decreased survival, the decreased survival was not different among the particle sizes tested (< 150 mm, > 1.0 mm, or a combination of particle sizes). The results demonstrate a potential for negative impacts on multiple insect species following exposure to dry biochar. However, additional work examining insect exposure to the material under field conditions is required to fully understand the potential impacts of biochar on insect populations and communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aEnoclerus 3aFormica obscuripes 3aIps pini 3aTemnochila 3aadults 3abark beetles 3abiochar 3aforest insects 3aforests 3ainsect communities 3aleaching 3anutrients 3aparticle size 3apredators 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3athatch 3awater quality 3awater solubility 0asoil amendments 0atoxicity 0athatch ants 0abark beetles1 aNeto, Valmir Rodriguies de Andrade0 tNorthwest science.g2018, v. 92, no. 1 p.1-8dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.092.01023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012100157300001800278500002000296520158700316592002801903596015201931650002402083650001102107650002002118650002802138650001202166650001302178650001302191650002002204650001602224650001202240650000902252650001202261650002602273650001402299700001902313700005502332700001702387773012802404856007402532852000902606655001202615IND60792643520221118053425.0220908e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079264352DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.132412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarunga, Joan10aHierarchical regulation of Burkholderia glumae type III secretion system by GluR response regulator and Lon protease  ap. 1461-1471.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExpression of type III secretion system (T3SS) genes, which are important for the virulence of phytopathogenic bacteria, is induced in the plant apoplastic environment or artificially amended growth conditions. Wild‐type Burkholderia glumae BGR1, which causes rice panicle blight, induced a hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco plants, whereas the T3SS genes were not significantly expressed in the commonly used hrp induction medium. T3SS gene expression in B. glumae was dependent on HrpB, a well known T3SS gene transcriptional regulator. Here, we report a stepwise mechanism of T3SS gene regulation by the GluR response regulator and Lon protease in addition to HrpB‐mediated control of T3SS genes in B. glumae. The gluR mutant showed no HR in tobacco plants and exhibited attenuated virulence in rice plants. GluR directly activated hrpB expression, indicating that hrpB belongs to the GluR regulon. The lon mutation allowed high expression of the T3SS genes in nutrient‐rich media. Lon directly activated gluR expression but repressed hrpB expression, indicating that Lon acts as a regulator rather than a protease. However, the lon mutant failed to induce an HR and virulence, suggesting that Lon not only acts as a negative regulator, but also has an essential, yet to be determined role for T3SS. Our results demonstrate the involvement of the two‐component system response regulator GluR and Lon in T3SS gene regulation, providing new insight into the complex interplay mechanisms of regulators involved in T3SS gene expression in bacteria–plant interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021R1I1A1A01040314cBasic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of the Education 3aBurkholderia glumae 3ablight 3agene expression 3ahypersensitive response 3amutants 3amutation 3apanicles 3aplant pathology 3aproteinases 3aregulon 3arice 3atobacco 3atranscription factors 3avirulence1 aKang, Yongsung1 aGoo, Eunhye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-56471 aHwang, Ingyu0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2022 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.1461-1471dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.132413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245010500162300001300267500001500280520162700295592002801922650002501950650001701975650002401992650002002016650002602036650001402062650001002076650001102086650002202097650001102119650001402130650001402144650001102158650002102169650001002190650001302200650001502213650001102228650001402239650002102253651001102274653001802285653002302303653001202326653001002338653001502348700001802363700001802381773011702399856007702516852000902593655001202602IND60594552120221116173828.0180625s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059455212DNAL7 a10.3955/046.092.01032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerschuyl, Jake10aPredicting Shrub Biomass and Current Annual Growth from Field Measurements in the Oregon Coast Range  ap. 9-17.  a2019-12-06  aEstimates of plant biomass derived from field measurements can be used to quantify wildlife habitat, fuel loads, net primary production, and nutrient cycling. The difficulty involved with developing species-specific allometric equations for plant biomass results in many studies utilizing estimates of shrub cover instead. We assess whether reasonable predictive equations for shrub biomass can be achieved across a group of six common shrub species growing on recent clearcuts in the Oregon Coast Range. Variables used in the models were total basal area summed across stems, height, and crown area (plan view) using an ellipse formula based on crown length and width measurements. Species-level models had adjusted R² values ranging from 0.76–0.99 for total biomass and current growth. An all-species model had an adjusted R² of 0.93 for total biomass and 0.84 for current growth. The aggregate models applied to the individual species gave similar R² values except for current annual growth of oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor) and vine maple (Acer circinatum). Simpler models based just on crown area or crown area plus height ranged from adjusted R² of 0.63–0.68 for all-species models of total or current biomass. These deciduous shrub biomass models can be used to help estimate forage and cover for birds, ungulates, and other wildlife. Furthermore, these models might prove useful for other plant species growing under similar geographic and climatic conditions; however, caution is warranted as the models should be validated with some destructive plant sampling for other species or use in other regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprimary productivity 3afuel loading 3aHolodiscus discolor 3aAcer circinatum 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aungulates 3astems 3aforage 3awildlife habitats 3acoasts 3aphytomass 3aequations 3amodels 3aclimatic factors 3abirds 3awildlife 3aprediction 3ashrubs 3aallometry 3astand basal area 3aOregon 0aannual growth 0aOregon Coast Range 0abiomass 0ashrub 0abasal area1 aClark, Laurie1 aLoehle, Craig0 tNorthwest science.g2018, v. 92, no. 1 p.9-17dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.092.01033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245012000206500001900326520127800345592002801623650002101651650001501672650000801687650001301695650001201708650002401720653000701744653000701751653000801758653000801766653000701774653000801781653000701789653000801796653000801804653000801812653001801820653003501838653001501873700002101888773011301909856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60723392620221120205921.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072339262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Ruiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3658-625312aA revised definition of dynamic adsorption coefficient for characterizing activated carbon instead of retention bed  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aActivated carbon (AC) retention beds are widely used in nuclear facilities, removing radioactive contaminants from exhaust air. Dynamic adsorption coefficient (DAC) is the core parameter to quantify the performance. Its definition has not been unified and it is affected by the geometry of the retention bed, the presence, the flow rate, and the concentration of adsorbate. So, DAC is currently a parameter characterizing the adsorption performance of the retention bed instead of the AC. In this regard, the definition of DAC should be revised, stripping away the influence of other factors. In this study, a 1D model for the AC column, a 2D model for blank piping, and a mathematical model for retention factor is developed. All are validated with simulations and experiments based on the “pulse dynamic method”. They are used to analyze the factors affecting DAC quantitatively in detail, including the direct effect of blank piping, the indirect effect of blank piping by affecting the pulse height into the column, and the effect of krypton concentration distribution in the column. Finally, an improved definition of DAC characterizing AC instead of retention bed is given. This definition can be used as a reference for scholars who formulate relevant standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aair 3ageometry 3akrypton 3amathematical models 0aAC 0aCf 0aCFD 0aDAC 0aEP 0aMEA 0aRB 0aREF 0aTCD 0aVOF 0aRetention bed 0aDynamic adsorption coefficient 0aDefinition1 aZhang, Zhenzhong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124994-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1249943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245007500180300001600255520113900271592002801410650002301438650000901461650001401470650002501484650001501509650001301524650001801537650001001555650001901565773009801584856005501682852000901737655001201746IND50067177620221122044301.0130615e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006717762DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1467-2960.2001.00057.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreiber, Dorothee K10aCo‐management without involvement: the plight of fishing communities  ap. 376-384.  aThis paper discusses the role of fishing communities in the stewardship of their adjacent fish resources, and the benefits associated with community participation in co‐management. Contrary to the view of most fisheries management agencies, local communities are able to design institutions that can successfully restore equity and limit access to the fishery. The dismissal of local concerns may be at the root of biological and social crises in fisheries, and the privatization of common fishing rights world‐wide through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) is contributing to these problems. Community involvement that is embedded into a network of management at larger spatial scales would allow fishing communities to regain some control over their livelihoods. Meaningful co‐management arrangements must go beyond consultation by redirecting the flow of social and economic benefits from the fishery back into communities. Unless geographically defined communities are allowed to share power and responsibility with government fisheries managers, both fish stocks and fishing as a way of life are in danger of vanishing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3alivelihood 3amanagers 3aprivatization 3aroots 3asocial benefit0 tFish and fisheries.g2001 Dec., v. 2, no. 4 p.376-384dBlackwell Science Ltdx1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-2960.2001.00057.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007200139245015800211300001600369500002000385520180400405592002802209596010002237596008302337596001702420596001902437650001502456650001802471650001302489700002102502700002202523700002202545700002002567700002302587700002902610700002102639773012702660856007402787852000902861655001202870IND60792643720221118053638.0220908e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079264372DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.129472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez de Abechuco, Estibaliz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2606-068810aOne Health Consensus Report Annotation Checklist (OH‐CRAC): A cross‐sector checklist to support harmonized annotation of surveillance data in reports  ap. 606-614.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo facilitate cross‐sector integration of surveillance data it is necessary to improve and harmonize the meta‐information provided in surveillance data reports. Cross‐sector integration of surveillance results in sector‐specific reports is frequently difficult as reports with a focus on a single sector often lack aspects of the relevant meta‐information necessary to clarify the surveillance context. Such reporting deficiencies reduce the value of surveillance reports to the One Health community. The One Health Consensus Report Annotation Checklist (OH‐CRAC), described in this paper along with potential application scenarios, was developed to improve the current practice of annotating data presented in surveillance data reports. It aims to provide guidance to researchers and reporting officers on what meta‐information should be collected and provided to improve the completeness and transparency of surveillance data reports. The OH‐CRAC can be adopted by all One Health‐related sectors and due to its cross‐sector design, it supports the mutual mapping of surveillance meta‐information from sector‐specific surveillance reports on federal, national and international levels. To facilitate the checklist completion, OH‐CRAC is also available as an online resource that allows the collection of surveillance meta‐information in an easy and user‐friendly manner. Completed OH‐CRAC checklists can be attached as annexes to the corresponding surveillance data reports or even to individual data files regardless of the data source. In this way, reports and data become better interpretable, usable and comparable to information from other sectors, improving their value for all surveillance actors and providing a better foundation for advice to risk managers.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Joint Programme One Health EJP, which has received funding from the European Union’s  cHorizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 773830  cHorizon 2020  cEuropean Union 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3azoonoses1 aDórea, Fernanda1 aBuschhardt, Tasja1 aScaccia, Nazareno1 aGünther, Taras1 aFoddai, Alessandro1 aDups‐Bergmann, Johanna1 aFilter, Matthias0 tZoonoses and public health.g2022 Sept., v. 69, no. 6 p.606-614dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.129473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012500176300002000301520153300321592002801854650001501882650001201897650001901909650002501928650001101953650001201964650002301976650000901999700002702008700006402035700005902099700005902158700006102217773012202278856008702400852000902487655001202496IND60744698320221120191730.0210716e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074469832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c008882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavipati, Srikanth10aMonte Carlo Molecular Simulation Study of Carbon Dioxide Sequestration into Dry and Wet Calcite Pores Containing Methane  ap. 11393-11402.  aWe perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to study the adsorption of carbon dioxide in a calcite slit pore. The injection of carbon dioxide is simulated by increasing the chemical potential of carbon dioxide, which allows for an investigation of adsorption under varying carbon dioxide loadings. The study is carried out for three different environments: an empty pore; a pore containing methane; and a pore containing methane with trace amounts of water. We systematically investigate the impact of the presence of these other fluids on carbon dioxide adsorption. We study the influence of carbon dioxide loading on fluid density in the pore and examine individual fluid-density profiles (in the direction normal to the fluid–solid interface). The order of fluid adsorption affinity to the surface is found to be water > carbon dioxide > methane. The interpretation of our results is informed by the examination of free-energy-averaged fluid–substrate potentials, which are computed independently from the simulations. Our observations suggest that ignoring the presence of water could lead to overestimation not only of methane availability but also of carbon dioxide storage capacity in pores, with important consequences in, for example, modeling carbon dioxide sequestration in calcite-rich reservoirs. Ultimately, it is hoped that the molecular-level insights from this study will aid the multiscale modeling of reservoir fluids in the context of enhanced oil recovery and carbon dioxide sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aenergy 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3aoils1 aSantos, Mirella Simoes1 aEconomou, Ioannis G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2409-68311 aGalindo, Amparo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4902-41561 aJackson, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8029-88681 aHaslam, Andrew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8442-119X0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 July 01, v. 35, no. 14 p.11393-11402dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c008883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05088naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245007900201300001800280500001400298500002000312520286700332592002803199596005003227650001703277650001603294650001503310650001703325650001403342650001203356650001603368650001103384650001503395650002003410650001003430650003003440650002703470650000903497650001603506650001203522650001203534650002203546650000903568650001003577650001503587650002303602650001103625650003003636650001203666650002103678650001503699700002103714700002203735700003003757700002403787700002503811700002003836700001803856700002203874700002103896700002403917700001703941700002503958700002203983700002104005700001704026700002104043700002404064773013604088856007304224852000904297655001204306IND60718308320221119123055.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830832DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.131912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClanahan, T.

Without accounting for complex sensitivity responses, simple climate exposure models and associated predictions may lead to poor estimates of future coral survival and lead to policies that fail to identify and implement the most appropriate interventions. To begin filling this gap, we evaluated a number of attributes of coral taxa and communities that are predicted to influence coral resistance to thermal stress over a large geographic range. LOCATION: Western Indo‐Pacific and Central Indo‐Pacific Ocean Realms. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Zooxanthellate Scleractinia – hard corals. METHODS: We evaluated the geographic variability of coral resistance to thermal stress as the ratio of thermal exposure and sensitivity in 12 countries during the 2016 global‐bleaching event. Thermal exposure was estimated by two metrics: (a) historical excess summer heat (cumulative thermal anomaly, CTA), and (b) a multivariate index of sea‐surface temperature (SST), light, and water flow (climate exposure, CE). Sensitivity was estimated for 226 sites using coordinated bleaching observations and underwater surveys of coral communities. We then evaluated coral resistance to thermal stress using 48 generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to compare the potential influences of geography, historical SST variation, coral cover and coral richness. RESULTS: Geographic faunal provinces and ecoregions were the strongest predictors of coral resistance to thermal stress, with sites in the Australian, Indonesian and Fiji‐Caroline Islands coral provinces having higher resistance to thermal stress than Africa‐India and Japan‐Vietnam provinces. Ecoregions also showed strong gradients in resistance with highest resistance to thermal stress in the western Pacific and Coral Triangle and lower resistance in the surrounding ecoregions. A more detailed evaluation of Coral Triangle and non‐Coral Triangle sites found higher resistance to thermal stress within the Coral Triangle, associated with c. 2.5 times more recent historical thermal anomalies and more centralized, warmer, and cool‐water skew SST distributions, than in non‐Coral Triangle sites. Our findings identify the importance of environmental history and geographic context in future predictions of bleaching, and identify some potential drivers of coral resistance to thermal stress. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Simple threshold models of heat stress and coral acclimation are commonly used to predict the future of coral reefs. Here and elsewhere we show that large‐scale responses of coral communities to heat stress are geographically variable and associated with differential environmental stresses and histories.  aPublisher supplied data  cJohn D. and Catherine T.

The interrelation between enthalpy characteristics of l-methionine dissolution (transfer) and the composition of water–organic mixtures was determined. Contributions of the organic solvent properties (molar volume, cohesion energy density, polarity/polarizability, acidity and basicity) to the energy of pairwise interactions of l-methionine – organic solvent were estimated quantitatively by means of a modified Kamlet-Taft equation.

It causes zoonotic disease brucellosis to wide range of animals. Brucella species are highly conserved in nucleotide level. Here, we employed a comparative genomics approach to examine the role of homologous recombination and positive selection in the evolution of Brucella. For the analysis, we have selected 19 complete genomes from 8 species of Brucella. Among the 1599 core genome predicted, 24 genes were showing signals of recombination but no significant breakpoint was found. The analysis revealed that recombination events are less frequent and the impact of recombination occurred is negligible on the evolution of Brucella. This leads to the view that Brucella is clonally evolved. On other hand, 56 genes (3.5 % of core genome) were showing signals of positive selection. Results suggest that natural selection plays an important role in the evolution of Brucella. Some of the genes that are responsible for the pathogenesis of Brucella were found positively selected, presumably due to their role in avoidance of the host immune system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella 3aanimals 3abacteria 3abrucellosis 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahomologous recombination 3aimmune system 3anatural selection 3apathogenesis 3azoonoses1 aSankarasubramanian, Jagadesan1 aSridhar, Jayavel1 aGunasekaran, Paramasamy1 aRajendhran, Jeyaprakash0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 55, no. 4 p.384-391dSpringer Indiax0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-015-0545-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001700168245010300185300001600288500000900304520137200313592002801685650001901713650001901732700001401751773012001765852000901885856009801894655001201992991581462330742620221120143328.0191122e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590693512DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500030004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnott, D.

Thell.) crosses. Both procedures were started from the same selected F₂ plants in each cross. In one procedure, a single seed was taken from each F₂ plant to produce the F₃ generation, the process was repeated for the F₄. The F₅ lines were then produced from the seed of individual F₄ plants (single seed descent method, SSD). In the second procedure, the F₃ lines were yield-tested and a pedigree method followed in the F₃ and F₄ (YT method). Each F₄ line was bulked to provide seed for a yield test in the F₅. The F₆ SSD lines and F₅ YT lines were then compared in yield tests. The mean yield of the YT lines was significantly higher in both crosses, mainly because there were fewer, very low yielding YT lines. The correlations between the F₃ and F₅ yields of the YT lines were significant in both crosses, but were not particularly large (0.29 and 0.14). The yield of the F₅ YT lines, derived from the highest yielding 20% of the F₃ lines, was compared with the highest-yielding 20% of the Fo SSD lines. In each cross, the SSD lines were at least as good as the YT lines. Although selection based on F₃ yields would have had some effect, it is doubtful that it was worth the labor involved. The SSD procedure appears to have considerable merit  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aKumar, J.0 tCrop science.g1975 May, v. 15, no. 3 p.295-299dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500030004x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02070naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008900176300001400265520097900279592002801258650001601286650001101302650002001313650001601333653002501349653002101374653001801395653002001413700002201433700002401455700001401479700002301493773010201516856008101618852000901699655001201708IND60604092920221118104948.0180716e20150920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060409292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParthasarathi, Srividhya10aAnchoring transition driven by short range ordering in calamitic-discotic composites  ap. 61-68.  aWe report investigations at atmospheric as well as elevated pressures on a host calamitic nematic liquid crystal doped with a discotic material exhibiting a novel anchoring transition (ANT), not present in the pure host.

Applied pressure diminishes the tendency for the orientation change thereby enhancing the range of the planar alignment finally annulling ANT. We ascribe the observed features to the competition between the anchoring energy of the aligning surface and the tendency of the structure to be parallel to the surface creating frustration and leading to ANT.

Tapirs are hunted in French Guiana, although a law introduced in 2011 restricts hunting to one animal per person per hunting trip. We carried out camera-trap surveys in the Nouragues Nature Reserve for 4 years, with the goal of estimating tapir densities in undisturbed conditions and determining sustainable harvest levels for tapirs in French Guiana. We analysed our data with a Bayesian spatially explicit capture–recapture model, with parameter sharing across surveys to improve estimates, and used the model to calculate derived parameters such as maximum sustainable harvest levels. Density estimates for all four surveys were similar and the model indicated a difference in encounter rates for the two camera models used but no difference in encounter rates or home range sizes for males and females or between years. Based on the calculated density of 0.32 tapir km⁻² we estimated sustainable harvest levels at 0.009 tapir km⁻². Comparing this value to hunting surveys from 11 sites between 1999 and 2006, we found that hunting levels were unsustainable in at least seven villages. We conclude that even the new restrictive hunting law will not prevent overhunting of tapirs in certain areas and thus stronger regulations are needed. However, because of the remoteness of tapir habitat in many parts of French Guiana tapirs are not immediately threatened in the country as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTapirus terrestris 3aanimals 3acameras 3aconservation areas 3afemales 3afish and wildlife law 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3amales 3amodels 3asurveys 3avillages 3aFrench Guiana 0aAmazonian moist forest 0aBayesian analysis 0acamera traps 0ahunting 0aNouragues Nature Reserve 0aSouth America 0aspatially explicit capture–recapture model1 aHibert, Fabrice1 aDebeir, Laure1 aRichard-Hansen, Cécile,0 tOryx.g2014 July, v. 48, no. 3 p.410-419dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053120016523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016900172300001200341500001900353520146200372592002801834596008301862650001201945650002301957650001201980650001901992651001102011700006402022700003002086700002702116700003302143700003602176700003302212700004502245773015102290856008302441852000902524655001202533IND60699855920221119074017.0200819e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069985592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08421-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTito, Tiago Marques10aAssessment of evapotranspiration estimates based on surface and satellite data and its relationship with El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the Rio de Janeiro State  ap. 449.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe need to validate the quality of evapotranspiration estimates is essential for this parameter which has extended its use. For this, it is necessary to evaluate both new remote sensing products that expand the areas of estimated evapotranspiration and empirical equations that provide estimates with different data requirements. In order to examine this problem, the present study compared the estimates of evapotranspiration obtained by remote sensing of the MOD16A2 product and seven empirical equations with the estimates obtained through the FAO-56 reference method, with data obtained from six meteorological stations in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data cover the period from 2007 to 2013, which contains different phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The methods proposed by Valiantzas were those that obtained the best performances when compared with FAO-56 with R² over 90%. The non-parametric analysis of Mann-Kendall for the six seasons was mostly not significant; only the station of Resende showed a tendency of significant growth during the El Niño episode (Z = 0.283 and p value = 0.050). The mangrove and forest classes were the ones that obtained the highest averages (3.75 mm d⁻¹ and 3.62 mm d⁻¹), where the gradient of evapotranspiration can be observed in the South-Northeast portions. The MOD16A2 orbital product was inferior to the methods that used surface meteorological station data.  aPublisher supplied data  a304966/2017-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aEl Nino 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3aremote sensing 3aBrazil1 aDelgado, Rafael Coll1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3157-22771 ade Carvalho, Daniel Costa1 aTeodoro, Paulo Eduardo1 ade Almeida, Catherine Torres1 ada Silva Junior, Carlos Antonio1 ados Santos, Erleyvaldo Bispo1 ada Silva Júnior, Luiz Augusto Siciliano0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 July, v. 192, no. 7 p.449-449dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08421-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001600292520091400308592002801222650001501250650001601265650001601281650001601297650001201313650001501325650001101340650002001351650001301371650002401384650003301408650001801441650001801459650001601477700001701493700001701510700001701527700001401544700001601558700001801574700001701592700001601609773008401625856008101709852000901790655001201799IND60575079120221119221628.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057507912DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-016-0473-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yonggang10aEstablishment and Application of a Method for Rapid Determination of Total Sugar Content Based on Colorimetric Microplate  ap. 424-431.  aTo obtain maximal linear regression correlation coefficient (R ²) of glucose standard curve determinations, single-factor test and response surface methodology were applied to optimize conditions including reaction time, incubation temperature and phenol concentration.

To overcome the practical issues of current techniques a new experimental method was developed. The system is modelled using two fundamental models and a simplified analytical representation. Pure myristic acid is used for validation and a performance comparison based on time, accuracy and stability. All three approaches perform comparatively well in terms of accuracy with an average prediction error of less than one third of a degree and all thermal properties in line with expectations. The enthalpy model is susceptible to instability while the effective heat capacity method does not show any such behaviour. In addition, due to the choice of a smooth function for the transition from liquid to solid, this method delivers more realistic behaviour. The effective heat capacity method is faster than the enthalpy method by a factor of three, but the analytical approach is the fastest. However for a more robust and comprehensive representation the effective heat capacity method is preferred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aenthalpy 3aheat 3aliquids 3amodels 3amyristic acid 3aphase transition 3aprediction 3athermal properties 0aEffective heat capacity 0aEnthalpy 0aThermal properties0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 616 p.69-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013900162300001600301500002000317520206600337592002802403596013702431650002302568650002302591650001002614650002802624650001502652650001602667650002202683650000902705650002902714650001802743650000902761650001802770650001602788650001402804650002002818650001702838650001002855650001302865651001302878700003102891700002202922700002502944700002402969700002702993700006703020773012703087856007403214852000903288655001203297IND60792644420221118053403.0220908e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079264442DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.129512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhantasup, Kannika10aCross‐sectional risk assessment of zoonotic Streptococcus suis in pork and swine blood in Nakhon Sawan Province in northern Thailand  ap. 625-634.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA cross‐sectional study evaluated the risk of zoonotic Streptococcus suis (S. suis) illness from consuming raw pork and swine blood in Nakhon Sawan Province. A four‐step risk assessment recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission was used to evaluate the risk along the pork supply chain. A total of 480 pork and swine blood samples were collected from the abattoir (n = 120) and retail (n = 360) during December 2020 and January 2021. Streptococcus suis in samples was enumerated using a culture‐based technique and then confirmed by the biochemical and molecular technique. Streptococcus suis was serotyped by matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry. Two positive swine blood samples were contaminated with non‐zoonotic S. suis serotype 23 at retail. In the case of all negative samples, the deterministic prevalence becomes zero and then the risk could not be estimated. Otherwise, the beta probability distribution was used to describe the probabilistic prevalence, while the maximum likelihood estimator was applied to estimate the upper limit of a probability distribution of concentration. The district averages of probabilistic prevalences of zoonotic S. suis in pork products at abattoir and retail were 9.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The district averages of concentrations of zoonotic S. suis in pork and blood samples from abattoir were 6.8 × 10⁻³ cfu/g and 6.83 cfu/ml and in pork and blood samples from retail were 2.3 × 10⁻³ cfu/g and 2.30 cfu/ml, respectively. The overall annual risk estimate per 100,000 population in pork and swine blood from abattoir and retail were 9.8 × 10⁻¹¹, 2.2 × 10⁻⁶, 5.4 × 10⁻¹³, and 8.3 × 10⁻⁸. These risk estimates were negligible (<10⁻⁶) except for the annual risk estimate in swine blood from the abattoir. The results from this cross‐sectional risk assessment should prompt the food safety regulator to cautiously sample by taking into account the duration of sampling and sample size.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordinating Unit for One Health, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health and Thailand MoPH‐U.S.CDC Collaboration 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aStreptococcus suis 3ablood 3across-sectional studies 3adesorption 3afood safety 3amass spectrometry 3apork 3aprobability distribution 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3asample size 3aserotypes 3aslaughterhouses 3asupply chain 3aswine 3azoonoses 3aThailand1 aTungwongjulaniam, Chanatda1 aTheerawat, Ratana1 aLamaisri, Taweeshock1 aPiyalikit, Kanjarat1 aNuengjamnong, Chackrit1 aNuanualsuwan, Suphachai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2790-11000 tZoonoses and public health.g2022 Sept., v. 69, no. 6 p.625-634dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.129513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003600148245009200184300001600276500001900292500001100311520113600322592002801458650002101486650002301507650001501530650001501545650001701560650001201577650001601589650002301605650002701628700002001655700006201675773012201737856008301859852000901942655001201951IND60699856220221119204233.0201024e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069985622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-019-09603-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolívar-Anillo, Hernando José10aEndophytic microorganisms for biocontrol of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea  ap. 721-740.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aBotrytis cinerea is the most widely studied necrotrophic phytopathogenic fungus. It causes economic losses that are difficult to calculate due to the large number of hosts. While there are a wide array of fungicides on the market to control this phytopathogen, they are not considered sustainable in terms of the environment and human health. The search for new alternatives to control this phytopathogen has led to the use of endophytic microorganisms as biological control agents. Endophytic bacteria and endophytic fungi have been isolated from different plant species and some have proven effective in inhibiting B. cinerea. Furthermore, a significant number of fungistatic or fungicidal metabolites which could be used as alternative complementary chemical controls have been isolated from these fungi and bacteria. In this review, in addition to the metabolites which have shown fungicide activity against this phytopathogen, the different genera and species of endophytic bacteria and fungi are also considered. These have been isolated from various plant species and have displayed antagonistic activity against B. cinerea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3abiological control 3aendophytes 3afungicides 3ahuman health 3amarkets 3ametabolites 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant pathogenic fungi1 aGarrido, Carlos1 aCollado, Isidro G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8612-05930 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2020 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.721-740dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-019-09603-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245013800167520184700305592002802152650001402180650001202194650002102206650002402227650001202251650002102263650002702284650002202311650001202333650002302345650001602368650001702384650002202401650001702423650001502440653002402455653002302479653005402502653004902556653002302605700005202628700001302680700001402693773009102707856009002798852000902888655001202897IND60772401920221117045402.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077240192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1344832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Nan10aEnhancing anaerobic methane production in integrated floating-film activated sludge system filled with novel MWCNTs-modified carriers  aConductive materials can enhance anaerobic methane production by accelerating interspecies electron transfer between electroactive bacteria and methanogens. However, the daily loss or less specific surface area of small/big size of conductive materials always limits their application in anaerobic digestion. In this study, the conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (15 wt% and 20 wt%) were mixed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and novel conductive suspended carriers were prepared. Results showed the conductivity of the novel conductive suspended carriers increased by 1–2 orders of magnitude comparing with HDPE carriers, as well as the attached biomass improved from 3.93 g/m² (HDPE carriers) to 5.82 g/m² (15 wt% MWCNTs-modified carriers) and 6.67 g/m² (20 wt% MWCNTs-modified carriers). Integrated floating-film activated sludge (IFFAS) filled with MWCNT-modified carriers showed significant advantages in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (removal efficiency increased by 3.6–37.2%) and methanogenic performance (cumulative methane increased by 12.28–62.91%) compared with the control reactor filled with conventional HDPE carriers when treating sodium propionate wastewater at the organic loading rates (OLR) of 11.3–26.3 kg COD/(m³∙d). SEM images and high-throughput sequencing results proved potential direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) had been established successfully on the MWCNTs-modified carriers. The syntrophic electroactive bacteria (Geobacter, Thauera) and Methanotrix were enriched by 2.28–4.58% and 9.41–16.80% respectively owning to the addition of novel conductive carriers. This study proved IFFAS process filled with novel MWCNTs-modified suspended carriers showed great potential in establishing DIET to enhance anaerobic digestion in practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter 3aThauera 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectron transfer 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apolyethylene 3asodium propionate 3asurface area 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aConductive carrier 0aIntegrated floating-film activated sludge (IFFAS) 0aDirect interspecies electron transfer (DIET) 0aMethane production1 aLiu, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7807-77161 aLi, Qian1 aQuan, Xie0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134483-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1344833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015900156300001800315520120200333592002801535650001701563650002001580650001501600650001701615650002301632650001401655650002001669650002801689650001301717650000901730700001401739700001601753700001701769700002001786700001901806700001701825773012701842856007501969852000902044655001202053IND60794464420221121232109.0220923e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446442DNAL7 a10.1039/d2fo01399a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Peng10aIdentification and analysis of antioxidant peptides from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.

Moench) antioxidant peptides in vitro simulated through continuous gastrointestinal (GI) digestion in comparison with rice (Oryza sativa L.) were identified and functionally analysed. It was demonstrated that the protein digestibility of sorghum and rice increased by 11.27% and 14.10% after GI digestion, respectively. The concentrations of the rice peptides GG14, GG12, SF11, and LQ9 and the sorghum peptide KP9 in the gastrointestinal tract were 0.018, 0.712, 0.548, 0.188, and 0.265 μg mL⁻¹, respectively. An assay of the scavenging ability showed that the sorghum peptide KP9 had the strongest ABTS-scavenging ability, with an IC₅₀ value of 44.44 mg mL⁻¹. The rice peptide LQ9 had the strongest DPPH and OH radical scavenging activity, with IC₅₀ values of 10.41 and 25.78 mg mL⁻¹, respectively. These five selectively synthesized peptides were predicted to be nontoxic and to have good ADMET absorption properties. The results indicated that the sorghum and rice peptides obtained by in vitro digestion were separated and purified with certain antioxidant activities and could be consumed as functional foods to modulate certain chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3adigestible protein 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3agastrointestinal system 3apeptides 3arice1 aLiu, Nian1 aXiu, Yuyang1 aWang, Wenhao1 aWang, Changyuan1 aZhang, Dongjie1 aLi, Zhijiang0 tFood & function.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 18 p.9635-9644dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo01399a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300002000257520146900277592002801746596004601774650001601820650002001836650001801856650002001874650001101894650001301905650002101918650001101939650000901950650001401959650001101973650001101984650003001995650001502025650000902040650001802049650001002067650000902077700002402086700001902110773016902129856008202298852000902380655001202389IND60600091520221120130947.0191026e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1991-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYausheva, Еlena10aIntestinal microbiome of broiler chickens after use of nanoparticles and metal salts  ap. 18109-18120.  aThe research included the study of influence of ultrafine particle preparations (nanoparticles of copper, zinc, iron, CuZn alloy) and metal salts (iron pyrophosphate, copper asparginate, zinc asparginate) on the composition of cecal microbiota of broiler chickens. Before adding the studied nanoparticles and metal salts to the diet, cecal microbiota of broiler chickens was represented by 76% Firmicutes taxon and 16% Bacteroidetes. Numerous among them were the bacteria of the taxa Anaerotruncus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Blautia spp., Alistipes spp., and Bacteroides spp.; they constituted 18, 17, 11, and 6%, respectively. A peculiarity of action of the most analyzed metals in nanoform and in the form of salts was a decrease in the number of phylum Firmicutes bacteria and an increase in the number of microorganisms of the phylum Bacteroidetes. The number of bacteria belonging to the families Ruminococcaceae (III, IV, V, VII, and VIII groups), Bacteroidaceae (in all experimental groups), and Lachnospiraceae (I, IV, V, and VII groups) was registered within the taxa of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. At the same time, in some experimental groups, the number of bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae (II, III, and VIII) decreased in the intestine. The data obtained can be used to assess the possibility of using metal nanoparticles in the poultry diet, as a micronutrient preparation, to correct dysbiosis and to improve the utilization of fodder energy.  aPublisher supplied data  a14-16-00060 PcRussian Science Foundation 3aBacteroides 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactobacillus 3aRuminococcaceae 3aalloys 3abacteria 3abroiler chickens 3acopper 3adiet 3adysbiosis 3aenergy 3aforage 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3airon 3ananoparticles 3asalts 3azinc1 aMiroshnikov, Sergey1 aSizova, Еlena0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 18 p.18109-18120dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1991-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014000167300001600307520204900323592002802372650001002400650001702410650000902427650001302436650002102449650001602470650001502486650001902501650001302520650002302533650002102556650001802577650001302595650002402608650002502632650001902657651001002676700002002686700001902706700002402725700002202749773010302771856008102874852000902955655001202964IND50088821320221120225002.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008882132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-013-0130-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoya, Nair S.10aEffects of plant growth regulators on growth and morphogenesis in tissue culture of Chondracanthus chamissoi (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta)  ap. 819-823.  aChondracanthus chamissoi (C. Agardh) Kützing (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) is an edible species and commercialised for carrageenan production in Chile. Investigations on growth and development are needed to improve its cultivation; therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on its growth and morphogenesis. PGRs tested were two auxins [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)] and one cytokinin (benzylaminopurine (BA)) in concentrations of 0.5, 5.0 and 50.0 μM. These PGRs were added to seawater enriched with half strength of von Stosch solution and were gelled with 0.6 % agar, and treatment control (without PGR addition) was conducted simultaneously. Apical and intercalary segments were used as initial explants. Each treatment was tested with six replicates of five axenic explants, and statistical analyses were performed. After culturing in a solid medium for 10 weeks to induce growth and callus formation, explants were cultured in liquid medium with the same experimental conditions for 10 weeks. Effects of auxins (IAA and 2,4-D) and the cytokinin BA on growth rates of apical segments of C. chamissoi were not significant, while low concentration of IAA stimulated the growth of intercalary segments. On the other hand, high concentrations of BA and IAA stimulated the callus formation in apical and intercalary segments, respectively. In liquid medium, PGR did not have a significant effect on growth rates of apical segments, while 2,4-D in concentrations from 0.5 to 50.0 μM stimulated growth of intercalary segments, and formation of lateral branches was stimulated by low 2,4-D in apical segments. These results suggest that PGRs have a regulatory role on callus formation and growth of specific explants of C. chamissoi. Furthermore, the formation of lateral branches stimulated by auxin could be used for seedling production under controlled conditions and could improve the micropropagation and cultivation of C. chamissoi in the Chilean coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aGigartinales 3aagar 3abranches 3acallus formation 3acarrageenan 3acytokinins 3aedible species 3aexplants 3aindole acetic acid 3amicropropagation 3amorphogenesis 3aseawater 3aseedling production 3astatistical analysis 3atissue culture 3aChile1 aÁvila, Marcela1 aPiel, Maria I.1 aVillanueva, Fabiola1 aAlcapan, Angelica0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.819-823dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0130-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245016500206300001200371506007600383520235600459592002802815596003902843596006302882506003702945650002502982650002203007650001903029650003703048650001903085650001103104650002003115650003903135650001803174650001303192650001703205650001903222650001303241650001603254650002803270650001203298650001803310650001303328700002503341700002703366700002103393700002703414700001803441700006403459773010003523856008203623852000903705655001203714IND60621330520221207093323.0181230e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062133052DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-018-0689-52doi7 aPMC62383032pmcid7 a304420922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCross, Ismael12aA preliminary integrated genetic map distinguishes every chromosome pair and locates essential genes related to abiotic adaptation of Crassostrea angulata/gigas  ap. 104.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The re-sequencing of C. angulata has revealed many polymorphisms in candidate genes related to adaptation to abiotic stress that are not present in C. gigas; these genes, therefore, are probably related to the ability of this oyster to retain high concentrations of toxic heavy metals. There is, in addition, an unresolved controversy as to whether or not C. angulata and C. gigas are the same species or subspecies. Both oysters have 20 metacentric chromosomes of similar size that are morphologically indistinguishable. From a genomic perspective, as a result of the great variation and selection for heterozygotes in C. gigas, the assembly of its draft genome was difficult: it is fragmented in more than seven thousand scaffolds. RESULTS: In this work sixty BAC sequences of C. gigas downloaded from NCBI were assembled in BAC-contigs and assigned to BACs that were used as probes for mFISH in C. angulata and C. gigas. In addition, probes of H3, H4 histone, 18S and 5S rDNA genes were also used. Hence we obtained markers identifying 8 out the 10 chromosomes constituting the karyotype. Chromosomes 1 and 9 can be distinguished morphologically. The bioinformatic analysis carried out with the BAC-contigs annotated 88 genes. As a result, genes associated with abiotic adaptation, such as metallothioneins, have been positioned in the genome. The gene ontology analysis has also shown many molecular functions related to metal ion binding, a phenomenon associated with detoxification processes that are characteristic in oysters. Hence the provisional integrated map obtained in this study is a useful complementary tool for the study of oyster genomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study 8 out of 10 chromosome pairs of Crassostrea angulata/gigas were identified using BAC clones as probes. As a result all chromosomes can now be distinguished. Moreover, FISH showed that H3 and H4 co-localized in two pairs of chromosomes different that those previously escribed. 88 genes were annotated in the BAC-contigs most of them related with Molecular Functions of protein binding, related to the resistance of the species to abiotic stress. An integrated genetic map anchored to the genome has been obtained in which the BAC-contigs structure were not concordant with the gene structure of the C. gigas scaffolds displayed in the Genomicus database.  aPublisher supplied data  aSOE 2/ P1/E287cINTERREG IVB SUDOE  aBIO-219cAgencia de Innovación y Desarrollo de Andalucía0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrassostrea angulata 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aabiotic stress 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abioinformatics 3aclones 3aessential genes 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3aheavy metals 3aheterozygosity 3ahistones 3akaryotyping 3ametacentric chromosomes 3aoysters 3aribosomal DNA 3atoxicity1 aPortela-Bens, Silvia1 aGarcía-Angulo, Aglaya1 aMerlo, Manuel A.1 aRodríguez, María E.,1 aLiehr, Thomas1 aRebordinos, Laureana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6255-94490 tBMC genetics.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.104-104dBioMed CentralwJournal:2166x1471-21567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-018-0689-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001500174245017000189300001800359520124000377592002801617650001301645650001701658650002101675650001301696650001501709650002001724650003101744650001001775650001601785650002401801650001401825650001501839650001801854650001701872650001201889650002101901650004001922650005801962650003402020650006002054650005102114650004702165650003602212650004502248650003102293650004602324650003202370650004102402650005302443653002402496653000702520653001502527653002002542653002102562700002002583700001802603700001702621700001702638700001902655700001902674700002002693773007802713856008902791852000902880655001202889IND60112218120221122055056.0160901e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011221812DNAL7 a237141452pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bo-Mi10aExpression profile analysis of antioxidative stress and developmental pathway genes in the manganese-exposed intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus with 6K oligochip  ap. 1214-1223.  aManganese (Mn) provides one of aquatic pollutants in marine ecosystem. Here we used a 6K oligomicroarray to identify the effect of Mn on transcriptomes in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. A total of 5594 spots were significantly modulated on a 6K oligomicroarray with hierarchical clustering after exposure to Mn over 24h. Of them, 186 and 489 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Particularly, several genes involved in stress, detoxification, and developmental functions were significantly modulated in T. japonicus exposed for 24h. In detail, Mn exposure specifically up-regulated genes that were related to intracellular stress, antioxidant, and detoxification pathways such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and heat shock proteins (hsps), while a majority of downregulated genes was associated with developmental pathways such as cuticle protein, ecdysone receptor, and vitellogenin. These results demonstrated that Mn exposure modulated gene expression in relation to intracellular stress, leading to developmental retardation in the intertidal copepod, T. japonicus, and provide a better understanding of mechanistic molecular studies of Mn-induced cellular damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aantioxidants 3acytochrome P-450 3aecdysone 3aecosystems 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aheat shock proteins 3amanganese 3apollutants 3atranscriptome 3avitellogenin 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aCopepodaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aGlutathione Transferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aManganesexchemistryxtoxicity. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Steroidxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects 2aVitellogeninsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxtoxicity. 0aTigriopus japonicus 0aMn 0aMicroarray 0aGene expression 0aReal-time RT-PCR1 aChoi, Beom-Soon1 aLee, Kyun-Woo1 aKi, Jang-Seu1 aKim, Il-Chan1 aChoi, Ik-Young1 aRhee, Jae-Sung1 aLee, Jae-seong,0 tChemosphere.g2013 Aug., v. 92 p.1214-1223dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01473naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245004100156300001600197500002000213520059100233592002800824650002200852650002000874650001000894650001100904650002200915650001100937773014300948856007101091852000901162655001201171IND60680318420221119182034.0200105e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068031842DNAL7 a10.2307/12409202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhipps, Tim T.10aLand Prices and Farm‐Based Returns  ap. 422-429.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe theoretical and empirical relationship between farm‐based residual returns, the opportunity cost of farmland, and farmland prices is developed. Temporal hypotheses concerning the source of land price movements are tested using a variant of Granger causality. In the aggregate, farmland prices are found to be unidirectionally “caused” by residual farm‐based returns. The findings support the hypothesis that farmland prices are determined mainly within the farm sector and lend credence to the use of extrapolative expectations processes in structural farmland price models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3afarmland values 3afarms 3amodels 3aopportunity costs 3aprices0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1984 Nov., v. 66, no. 4 p.422-429dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12409203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245015400152300001800306520124900324592002801573650001801601650002301619650001701642650001601659650001401675650001501689650001001704650003001714650003101744650002401775650001001799650002401809650001501833650000801848650002001856650001501876700002101891700001701912700001801929700001401947700001801961773012701979856007502106852000902181655001202190IND60794464720221121211621.0220923e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079446472DNAL7 a10.1039/d2fo01547a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yao10aFu brick tea alleviates alcoholic liver injury by modulating the gut microbiota–liver axis and inhibiting the hepatic TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 9391-9406.  aThis study first evaluated the protective effects of Fu brick tea water extracts (FTE) on alcoholic liver injury and its underlying mechanism in C57BL/6J mice. Oral administration of FTE by oral gavage (400 mg per kg bw) for 12 weeks significantly alleviated lipid metabolism disorder, reduced the activities of serum ALT and AST, decreased the expression of the liver CYP2E1 gene, and enhanced the antioxidant capacities of the livers in alcohol-fed mice (p < 0.05). FTE also relieved alcohol-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by promoting the proliferation of probiotics such as Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillus, and subsequently increased the cecal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and decreased the tryptophan content of alcohol-fed mice (p < 0.05). Importantly, FTE was found to improve the alcohol-impaired gut barrier function by up-regulating the expression of the epithelial tight junction protein. Accordingly, FTE decreased the circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and thus inhibited the hepatic TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway to ameliorate alcoholic liver injury. Cumulatively, these findings shed light on the important role of the gut microbiota–liver axis behind the protective efficacy of FTE on alcoholic liver injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aabsorption barrier 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3adysbiosis 3aepithelium 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism disorders 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3aoral administration 3aprobiotics 3atea 3atight junctions 3atryptophan1 aYang, Chengcheng1 aRen, Daoyuan1 aShao, Hongjun1 aZhao, Yan1 aYang, Xingbin0 tFood & function.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 18 p.9391-9406dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo01547a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001800174245010600192300001800298520096700316592002801283650001701311650002001328650001201348650001201360650001301372650001101385650001801396650001401414650000901428650000901437650001101446650001401457650001401471650002101485650001501506650002601521650001101547650001501558650003701573650001101610650001601621650000901637650002901646650002501675650002901700650002601729650002801755650004801783650002301831650003001854650002901884651001001913653001901923653000901942653002701951653002001978653001701998653002102015700001802036700001902054700001402073700001502087700001702102700001502119700002002134700001702154773007802171856008902249852000902338655001202347IND60112218220221122054947.0160901e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011221822DNAL7 a237141512pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Nicola, F.10aImproved biomonitoring of airborne contaminants by combined use of holm oak leaves and epiphytic moss  ap. 1224-1230.  aConcentrations of 12 elements (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn) and 16 EPA-listed PAHs were detected in Quercus ilex leaves and the epiphytic moss Leptodon smithii collected at urban, periurban and extraurban holm oak stands, in two Italian Regions (Campania and Tuscany). Levels of environmental contaminants were generally higher in leaves and moss from urban areas than periurban and extraurban ones and samples from Campania had the highest PAH content. The epiphytic moss accumulated higher concentrations of trace elements than leaves and the latter showed a higher accumulation capability for PAHs, especially for those with low molecular weight. The different bioaccumulation in leaves and moss were explained in terms of their distinctive morphological and ecophysiological characteristics. The combined approach seems a promising tool for the monitoring of a wide range of pollutants in Mediterranean urban and extraurban environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus ilex 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3aecophysiology 3aepiphytes 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3amosses and liverworts 3anickel 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asodium 3aurban areas 3azinc 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aBryopsidaxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aQuercusxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 3aItaly 0aTrace elements 0aPAHs 0aAir pollution gradient 0aBioaccumulation 0aQuercus ilex 0aLeptodon smithii1 aSpagnuolo, V.1 aBaldantoni, D.1 aSessa, L.1 aAlfani, A.1 aBargagli, R.1 aMonaci, F.1 aTerracciano, S.1 aGiordano, S.0 tChemosphere.g2013 Aug., v. 92 p.1224-1230dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245015100173506002800324520199200352592002802344506003702372650001902409650001702428650001102445650001902456650001102475650001802486650002302504650001102527650001602538650002302554650001402577650001102591650001102602650001002613650001002623650001302633650001002646650001002656650001402666651002202680653002402702653003002726653001002756653001602766653002602782653002502808700002802833773011302861856008902974852000903063655001203072IND60791976920221207074453.0220804s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079197692DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.3.37962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWisdom, Joanne10aWhole-vine resources modify within-vine relationships between growth parameters and metabolites in <i>Vitis vinifera</i> L. cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon  aResource is Open Access  aFruit ripening on a perennial tree or vine is typically asynchronous and rarely investigated. In commerce, this is problematic as it impairs sampling to meet commercial maturity and quality standards at harvest. For grapevines, understanding within-grapevine variability in berry maturity will benefit precision management and harvest planning. It is accepted that variation in maturity is approximately equally allocated at the within- and between-vine scale. However, the mechanistic and ecological factors that cause functional variance are poorly understood and rarely documented. This study aimed to identify structural and spatial within-vine attributes associated with berry composition at harvest related to available resources from the whole grapevine. Vegetative and reproductive biomass attributes within- and between-vines were analysed for cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon trained as a cordon, spur-pruned system using a Smart-Dyson trellis in a ‘New World’ industrial-scale vineyard. The vines were located in northern Margaret River, Western Australia. Variability in soluble solids, anthocyanins and phenolics were analysed for clusters and corresponding canopy characteristics. Berry size was the best predictor of variance in maturity among sugar, anthocyanins and phenolics composition within individual vines. Smaller stems or fruit had greater variation in maturity than larger stems or fruit. However, the relationship between whole plant biomass and fruit maturity interacted at different scales; the first report for grapevines. Including different vine-biomass scales helped explain the heteroscedasticity observed when the individual vine effect was excluded from the analysis. These findings suggest that high vigour grapevines could benefit from differential management, regardless of harvest index. Furthermore, these findings may help explain the diversity of response to treatment effects such as cluster or leaf thinning reported previously for perennial fruit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acanopy 3afruit maturity 3afruits 3aharvest index 3aheteroskedasticity 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytomass 3arivers 3asugars 3atrade 3atrees 3avariance 3avigor 3avines 3avineyards 3aWestern Australia 0aResource allocation 0acarbohydrate partitioning 0aberry 0acomposition 0avine-to-vine variance 0awithin-vine variance1 aConsidine, John Anthony0 tOENO One.g2022, v. 56, no. 3dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.3.37963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008300160300001800243520127000261592002801531650002401559650002101583650001201604650001701616650002001633650001801653650001501671650001901686650001601705700001701721700002301738700002301761700002101784700001701805700002601822773012501848856007501973852000902048655001202057IND60795272120221118055226.0221004e20221003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079527212DNAL7 a10.1039/d2gc02460h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfrum, Stefan12aA new strategy to dissolve long-chain surfactants in water at low temperatures  ap. 7675-7681.  aSurfactants find widespread use in daily life for cleaning purposes and form a vital part of many industrial formulations. So far, their application has been limited to amphiphilic structures with relatively short alkyl chains (typically up to C14 or C16) due to the poor solubility of longer-chain homologues under relevant conditions. Here we introduce a concept that eventually allows octadecyl sulfates and carboxylates to be effectively solubilised in water at room temperature. Through synthesis of alkoxylated derivatives of choline – an abundant molecule of natural origin – we have designed a new class of counterions preventing the precipitation of long-chain surfactants, as commonly observed with alkali ions or unmodified choline. The resulting amphiphilic systems show superior properties with respect to surface activity, which directly translates into enhanced cleaning performance in lab-based washing tests. Studies on the cytotoxicity and biodegradability of the alkoxylated choline derivatives highlight their potential for sustainable surfactant development. In the end, our approach could pave the way towards the use of hitherto unleveraged raw material resources in tailoured surfactant formulations for cleaning applications and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiodegradability 3acholine 3acytotoxicity 3agreen chemistry 3araw materials 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asurfactants1 aBraun, Lydia1 aEngelhardt, Nadine1 aEngert, Susanne C.1 aTropsch, Jürgen1 aKunz, Werner1 aKellermeier, Matthias0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 Oct. 3, v. 24, no. 19 p.7675-7681dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2gc02460h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01279naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245001200162300001200174500002000186520050900206592002800715650002400743650001000767650001300777773014300790856007100933852000901004655001201013IND60680318620221119182336.0200105e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068031862DNAL7 a10.2307/12409462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Paul E., Jr.10aErratum  ap. 539.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the February 1984 Journal issue, the last paragraph of Bernard Erven's review of Peter H.

This oxidative dehydration-oxidation and reductive heteroannulation methodology is successfully utilized for the total synthesis of 1-deoxynojirimycin (1b), miglitol (2) and miglustat (3).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3adeoxynojirimycin 3aoxidation 3apalladium 0aDeoxynojirimycin 0aMiglitol 0aMiglustat 0aAlcohol oxidation & oxime dehydration 0aCascade reaction 0aReductive aminative cyclization1 aGajare, Vikas1 aReddy, E.

A simple gravimetric experiment was carried out at a monitoring station located at the exit of a steep, forested Mediterranean watershed in the Eastern Pyrenees. The objective was to describe and quantify, with standardized logs (in shape, structure and constitution), natural degradation of wood in the sea. Results show that the mass decrease of wood logs over time can be described by a sigmoidal curve. The primary process of wood decay observed at the monitoring station was due to the arrival and installation of wood-boring species that consumed more than half of the total wood mass in six months. Surprisingly, in a region where there is little remaining wood marine infrastructure, “shipworms”, i.e. xylophagous bivalves, are responsible for an important part of this wood decay. This suggests that these communities are maintained probably by a frequent supply of a large quantity of riparian wood entering the marine environment adjacent to the watershed. By exploring this direct link between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, our long term objective is to determine how these supplies of terrestrial organic carbon can sustain wood-based marine communities as it is observed in the Mediterranean Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3acarbon 3acoarse woody debris 3adecayed wood 3ainfrastructure 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amonitoring 3aoceans 3awatersheds 3awood logs 3aMediterranean Sea 0aCoarse woody debris 0aDecay dynamics 0aShipworm 0aMediterranean Sea1 aCoston-Guarini, Jennifer1 aGuarini, Jean-Marc1 aFanfard, Sandrine0 tJournal of sea research.g2016 Aug., v. 114 p.22-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245012900206506007600335520148300411592002801894506003701922650001201959650001201971650000901983650001901992650002202011650001002033650002502043650001202068650001302080650002102093650001102114650001802125650002102143650000902164650001102173650002302184650001402207650001302221650001402234700002902248700002002277700001802297700001902315700001902334700001602353700001802369773012302387856007402510852000902584655001202593IND60650601420221207091050.0190710e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065060142DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101015072doi7 aPMC62135242pmcid7 a303265922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanobashvili, Khatia10aMaternal Choline and Betaine Supplementation Modifies the Placental Response to Hyperglycemia in Mice and Human Trophoblasts  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by excessive placental fat and glucose transport, resulting in fetal overgrowth. Earlier we demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation normalizes fetal growth in GDM mice at mid-gestation. In this study, we further assess how choline and its oxidation product betaine influence determinants of placental nutrient transport in GDM mice and human trophoblasts. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet 4 weeks prior to and during pregnancy to induce GDM or fed a control normal fat (NF) diet. The HF mice also received 25 mM choline, 85 mM betaine, or control drinking water. We observed that GDM mice had an expanded placental junctional zone with an increased area of glycogen cells, while the thickness of the placental labyrinth zone was decreased at E17.5 compared to NF control mice (p < 0.05). Choline and betaine supplementation alleviated these morphological changes in GDM placentas. In parallel, both choline and betaine supplementation significantly reduced glucose accretion (p < 0.05) in in vitro assays where the human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells were cultured in high (35.5 mM) or normal (5.5 mM) glucose conditions. Expression of angiogenic genes was minimally altered by choline or betaine supplementation in either model. In conclusion, both choline and betaine modified some but not all determinants of placental transport in response to hyperglycemia in mouse and in vitro human cell line models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abetaine 3acholine 3adiet 3adrinking water 3afetal development 3agenes 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3amodels 3anutrient transport 3aoxidation 3aplacenta 3apregnancy1 aJack-Roberts, Chauntelle1 aBretter, Rachel1 aJones, Naudia1 aAxen, Kathleen1 aSaxena, Anjana1 aBlain, Kali1 aJiang, Xinyin0 tNutrients.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101015073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245006000158300001600218500002000234520067700254592002800931650002700959650001500986650001201001650001301013650001101026700002501037773014301062856007101205852000901276655001201285IND60680318720221119182322.0200105e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068031872DNAL7 a10.2307/12409232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Brian D.10aAnti‐Hoarding Laws: A Stock Condemnation Reconsidered  ap. 447-455.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEconomists have regarded anti‐hoarding laws as irrational reactions to nonexistent monopoly in the storage of grain. This paper shows that anti‐hoarding laws cannot be rationally directed against a monopolistic storer, for he will always store less, not more, than would be stored under competition. But seemingly perverse competitive storage, in the form of excessive stockholding, can arise when a price ceiling distorts the market. Additional public storage exacerbates this perverse private behavior, and may even induce behavior that appears to be active market manipulation. Under such circumstances, anti‐hoarding laws can be desirable second‐best measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aeconomists 3amarkets 3amonopoly 3aprices1 aWilliams, Jeffrey C.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1984 Nov., v. 66, no. 4 p.447-455dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12409233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001900175245008700194300001400281520110300295592002801398650002101426650001901447650001701466650002101483650003401504650001301538650002601551650002001577650001701597650001101614700001301625773014901638856006801787856009801855990002301953852000901976655001201985IND60643242020221121203151.0190510e20100618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064324202DNAL7 a10.3791/20072doi7 aPMC31539042pmcid7 a205672142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaborske, John10aGenome-wide analysis of aminoacylation (charging) levels of trna using microarrays  ap. e2007.  atRNA aminoacylation, or charging, levels can rapidly change within a cell in response to the environment[1]. Changes in tRNA charging levels in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells lead to translational regulation which is a major cellular mechanism of stress response. Familiar examples are the stringent response in E. coli and the Gcn2 stress response pathway in yeast ([2-6]). Recent work in E. coli and S. cerevisiae have shown that tRNA charging patterns are highly dynamic and depends on the type of stress experienced by cells [1, 6, 7]. The highly dynamic, variable nature of tRNA charging makes it essential to determine changes in tRNA charging levels at the genomic scale, in order to fully elucidate cellular response to environmental variations. In this review we present a method for simultaneously measuring the relative charging levels of all tRNAs in S. cerevisiae . While the protocol presented here is for yeast, this protocol has been successfully applied for determining relative charging levels in a wide variety of organisms including E. coli and human cell cultures[7, 8].  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaminoacylation 3acell culture 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3amicroarray technology 3astress response 3atransfer RNA 3ayeasts1 aPan, Tao0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 June 18, , no. 40 p.e2007-e2007dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/20073Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2007/genome-wide-analysis-aminoacylation-charging-levels-trna-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245016700159300001600326520209500342592002802437650003902465650001002504650000802514650002202522650001502544650001002559650002202569650001402591650001402605650003002619650002402649650001402673650001202687650001302699651001102712653001702723653002702740653001702767700002102784700002202805700002302827700002402850700002602874700002002900773008802920856007103008852000903079655001203088IND50072814520221119203735.0140210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007281452DNAL7 a10.1071/WR121522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpyrou, Vassiliki10aEvidence for European brown hare syndrome virus introduction with translocated brown hares (Lepus europaeus): implications for management of restocking operations  ap. 545-551.  aContext Criticisms of wildlife restocking operations typically focus on concerns that translocations can lead to the introduction of pathogens, and risk the integrity of locally adapted genetic diversity. Restocking programs aiming to stabilise population declines of European brown hares using captive-bred individuals have been carried out in several European countries, including Greece. Aims To assess the potential for imported hares to introduce novel strains of European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) during restocking operations, by (1) inferring the origin of wild Greek hares on the basis of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype, (2) screening the hares to detect and characterise EBHSV, and (3) determining whether certain hare origin–EBHSV combinations occur in the wild. Methods RNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses of EBHSV were performed on 53 hares. Diagnostic RFLP markers of the mtDNA were used to infer the origins of sampled hares. Key results Thirty-three hares had ‘typical’ native Greek haplotypes and 20 had mtDNA haplotypes matching those found in imported and released hares. Twelve of the latter and none of the former were positive for EBHSV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that nine virus isolates formed a single genetic lineage distinct from northern–central European ones. Three virus sequences from three imported reared-and-released hares, from Chalkidiki, were closely related to the northern–central European EBHS viruses. Conclusions Alien strains of EBHSV are co-introduced with released captive-bred animals, possibly resulting in negative impacts on populations of Greek hares that have not evolved resistance to these novel virus strains. Implications The identification of these allopatric EBHSV strains has led the authorities to ban captures and transportations of local brown hares for any restocking operation. We consider it imperative to reinforce microbiological and genetic controls before further releases of captive-bred game species in the wild in Greece.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean brown hare syndrome virus 3aLepus 3aRNA 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahares 3amitochondrial DNA 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3ascreening 3aviruses 3awildlife 3aGreece 0adisease risk 0agenetic identification 0atraceability1 aStamatis, Costas1 aBirtsas, Periklis1 aPsychas, Vassilios1 aManolakou, Katerina1 aBillinis, Charalambos1 aMamuris, Zissis0 tWildlife research.g2013, v. 40, no. 7 p.545-551dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR121523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300002000288520155600308592002801864650001601892650001401908650001501922650003101937650001001968650001701978650002201995650001002017650000902027650001702036650001402053650004302067650003102110650005202141650002302193650002702216650003202243651001102275700002102286700002202307700002402329700002202353700002102375700002102396700002002417700002302437700002002460700002202480773016902502856008202671852000902753655001202762IND60600092220221123020254.0191026e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060009222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1985-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Joshua B.10aTransgenic up-regulation of Claudin-6 decreases fine diesel particulate matter (DPM)-induced pulmonary inflammation  ap. 18179-18188.  aClaudin-6 (Cldn6) is a tetraspanin transmembrane protein that contributes to tight junctional complexes and has been implicated in the maintenance of lung epithelial barriers. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that genetic up-regulation of Cldn-6 influences inflammation in mice exposed to short-term environmental diesel particulate matter (DPM). Mice were subjected to ten exposures of nebulized DPM (PM2.5) over a period of 20 days via a nose-only inhalation system (Scireq, Montreal, Canada). Using real-time RT-PCR, we discovered that the Cldn6 gene was up-regulated in control mice exposed to DPM and in lung-specific transgenic mice that up-regulate Cldn-6 (Cldn-6 TG). Interestingly, DPM did not further enhance Cldn-6 expression in Cldn-6 TG mice. DPM caused increased cell diapedesis into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from control mice; however, Cldn-6 TG mice had less total cells and PMNs in BALF following DPM exposure. Because Cldn-6 TG mice had diminished cell diapedesis, other inflammatory intermediates were screened to characterize the impact of increased Cldn-6 on inflammatory signaling. Cytokines that mediate inflammatory responses including TNF-α and IL-1β were differentially regulated in Cldn6 TG mice and controls following DPM exposure. These results demonstrate that epithelial barriers organized by Cldn-6 mediate, at least in part, diesel-induced inflammation. Further work may show that Cldn-6 is a key target in understanding pulmonary epithelial gateways exacerbated by environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3abreathing 3aepithelium 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alungs 3amice 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory tract diseases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransgenic animals 3atransmembrane proteins 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aCanada1 aBodine, Jared S.1 aGassman, Jason R.1 aMuñoz, Samuel Arce1 aMilner, Dallin C.1 aDunaway, Todd M.1 aEgbert, Kaleb M.1 aMonson, Troy D.1 aBroberg, Dallin S.1 aArroyo, Juan A.1 aReynolds, Paul R.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 18 p.18179-18188dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1985-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011700173300001400290520177400304592002802078650001302106650001302119650002202132650002602154650001702180650002002197650002002217650000902237650002802246650001902274650002802293650001902321650001602340650001602356650001302372650001402385653001702399653002802416653001902444700003002463700001802493700002102511700002902532700002202561773011002583856009002693852000902783655001202792IND60550854220221118003831.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055085422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLedesma, Alba10aSeminal plasma proteins interacting with sperm surface revert capacitation indicators in frozen-thawed ram sperm  ap. 35-41.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of interacting seminal plasma proteins (iSPP) obtained by AV or EE on frozen-thawed ram sperm in order to test the hypothesis whether this fraction could be sufficient to emulate the effect of complete seminal plasma (SP). Additionally, we evaluated whether these proteins have a differential effect between spermatozoa from high and low fertility rams and between breeding and non-breeding seasons. We assessed sperm motility, quality parameters (intracellular reactive oxygen species, membrane fluidity, plasma membrane permeability and mitochondrial activity) and capacitation status. The main findings from this work were: i) iSPP had no effect on sperm motility, whereas SP (AV or EE) addition produced the highest values of total motility (74.13±2.99 and 72.27±2.99 for AV and EE, respectively) and progressive motility (64.97±2.64 and 63.73±2.64 for AV and EE, respectively); ii) iSPP had no effect on sperm quality parameters (p>0.05), but whole SP improved all parameters evaluated. Moreover, SP collected by AV yielded significantly higher viability (44.60±2.87) and sperm with stable plasma membrane (44.56±2.49) comparing with the addition of SP collected by EE (35.80±2.47 and 36.67±1.71, respectively); iii) iSPP and SP collected by EE, but not by AV, reverted molecular signals of capacitation as protein tyrosine phosphorylation caused by freezing temperatures; iv) there were no effects of fertility or season in sperm quality parameters evaluated. This study demonstrated that, although the iSPP have a clear decapacitating effect, including the ability to revert cryo-capacitation indicators, they are not sufficient to emulate the effects of complete SP regarding sperm functional parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3afreezing 3amembrane fluidity 3amembrane permeability 3amitochondria 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3arams 3areactive oxygen species 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atemperature 3atyrosine 3aviability 0aCapacitation 0aPost-thaw sperm quality 0aSeminal plasma1 aFernández-Alegre, Estela1 aCano, Adriana1 aHozbor, Federico1 aMartínez-Pastor, Felipe1 aCesari, Andreína0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2016 Oct., v. 173 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245012400168300001800292500000900310520164900319592002801968650003101996650001502027650001502042650001602057650001902073650001102092650001002103650002102113650001302134650001602147650000902163650001402172650001802186650002902204650001302233650002102246650001302267650003502280650003002315651000902345700002102354773013902375852000902514856007902523655001202602IND4444531220221119172925.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444453122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2009.02152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallarino, Antonio P.10aCrop Yield and Soil Phosphorus as Affected by Liquid Swine Manure Phosphorus Application Using Variable-Rate Technology  ap. 2230-2238.  aepub  aSoil-test P (STP) and crop P needs vary within fields and variable-rate technology can be used to apply P more effectively. The objective of this study was to evaluate within a corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation grain yield and STP response to fixed-rate (FR) and variable-rate (VR) liquid swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) manure P application using strip-trials, global positioning systems (GPS), yield monitors, and geographical information systems (GIS). Treatments replicated four or five times were a control and manure P applied with FR or VR once before soybean of two rotation cycles in one field and three cycles in another. Strip width and length were 18.3 m and 605 to 660 m, respectively. Initial soil samples were taken from 0.3-ha cells and post-harvest samples were taken each year by treatment (0.1-ha cells). High N (for corn) and K rates were applied uniformly across all strips. Manure P increased strip-average grain yield (P ≤ 0.05) in eight of nine site-years but yield for FR and VR did not differ. The study of yield responses for field areas with different STP showed that manure P always increased yield with STP very low or low (<16 mg Bray-P₁ kg⁻¹) and only in three site-years with STP optimum (16–20 mg P kg⁻¹). Yield responses differed between FR and VR in very low areas of one site-year, where VR increased corn yield more than FR. The VR method reduced within-field STP variability compared with FR with the exception of only one site-year. Although VR did not increase yield compared with FR, less manure P was applied to high-testing areas and it reduced STP variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3alength 3awidth 3ayield monitoring 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3acorn 3apotassium 3aliquid manure 3afertilizer use reduction 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3asoybeans 3ageographic information systems 3avariable rate application 3aIowa1 aWittry, David J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2010 Nov., v. 74, no. 6 p.2230-2238dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2009.02153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03576naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245012300177506002800300520224300328592002802571506003702599650001102636650001502647650001702662650001402679650001302693650001302706653005002719653002702769653002302796653004402819653006802863700001802931773015302949856009103102852000903193655001203202IND60791977520221207074443.0220831e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079197752DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2022-16-2-82-892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhalnin, Ė.

All target territories within the region were grouped into homogeneous samples according to the minimum criteria variance. An algorithm for the sequence of computational and logical operations was proposed. The territories were assessed according to three uniformity criteria: the minimum sum of ranks for the priority of each basic criterion, the number of priority basic criteria, and the comparative significance of each region production potential. For typical areas, it was proposed to perform computer calculations of technical support options.Results and discussion The calculations were performed for the Central Non-Black Earth Zone of the Russian Federation. The following basic criteria for the production resources of the regions were adopted: the total arable land, the number of tractors, tractor availability and capability, the number of agricultural organizations in the region, the area for sowing grain crops, vegetables, and planting potatoes. The monitoring of the production resources criteria revealed their uneven distribution across the region and the subsequent necessity to identify two or three typical agricultural territories.Conclusions An algorithm was proposed for selecting typical territories and agricultural organizations in the region based on the case of the Central Non-Black Earth Zone of the Russian Federation. Within this zone, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Bryansk, and Yaroslavl regions were identified as typical ones.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aalgorithms 3aarable soils 3acomputers 3atractors 3avariance 0amonitoring of the region production potential 0aagricultural territory 0aranking of regions 0abasic criteria for production resources 0aselection of typical territories and agricultural organizations1 aZubina, V.

The method utilizes the mathematical model of Least Squares 2D image matching and extends it for solving the 3D surface matching problem. The transformation parameters of the search surfaces are estimated with respect to a template surface. The solution is achieved when the sum of the squares of the 3D spatial (Euclidean) distances between the surfaces are minimized. The parameter estimation is achieved using the Generalized Gauss-Markov model. Execution level implementation details are given. Apart from the co-registration of the point clouds generated from spaceborne, airborne and terrestrial sensors and techniques, the proposed method is also useful for change detection, 3D comparison, and quality assessment tasks.

Mature sperm is considered to be transcriptionally and translationally silent and incapable of protein synthesis. Recently, a large number of proteins have been identified in sperm from different species by using the proteomic approaches. Clinically, sperm proteins can be used as markers for male infertility due to different protein profiles identified in sperm from fertile and infertile male animals. Recent evidences have shown that the conditions of sperm preservation in vitro can also change the sperm protein profiles. This paper reviews the recent scientific publications available to address sperm proteome and their relationship with sperm cryopreservation, capacitation, fertilization, and separation of X and Y sperm. Future directions in the application of sperm proteomics to develop or optimize reproductive technologies in mammals are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryopreservation 3amale fertility 3amales 3amammals 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0aSperm proteome 0aProteomic technology 0aSperm cryopreservation 0aFertilization 0aSex control1 aWang, Dong1 aZhou, Xu0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2016 Oct., v. 173 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014800155300001800303520057800321592002800899650002000927650002100947650002100968650002000989650001601009650001101025700001801036700002001054700001901074700001801093700001901111773012501130856007501255852000901330655001201339IND60795272420221118055332.0221004e20221003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079527242DNAL7 a10.1039/d2gc02512d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aElectrochemical synthesis of carbamo(dithioperoxo)thioates through the dehydrogenation coupling of thiols and amines and the insertion of CS₂  ap. 7362-7367.  aA convenient and practical strategy was developed for the synthesis of carbamo(dithioperoxo)thioates through the simple dehydrogenation coupling of thiols and amines and the insertion of CS₂ under mild reaction conditions and in the absence of oxidizing reagents.

Here 2H MAS NMR and IR spectra recorded under carefully selected conditions in 1H-2H exchanged, and re-exchanged, cellulose samples are presented. It is shown here, by a quantitative and robust approach, that only two of the three available hydroxyl groups on the surface of cellulose fibrils are exchanging their hydrogen with the surrounding water molecules. This finding is additionally verified and explained by MD simulations which demonstrate that the 1HO(2) and 1HO(6) hydroxyl groups of the constituting glucose units act as hydrogen-bond donors to water, while the 1HO(3) groups behave exclusively as hydrogen-bond acceptors from water and donate hydrogen to their intra-chain neighbors O(5). We conclude that such a behavior makes the latter hydroxyl group unreactive to hydrogen exchange with water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aCellulose 0aDeuterium exchange 0aHydroxyl groups 0a2H MAS NMR 0aFT-IR 0aMolecular-dynamics simulation1 aBergenstråhle-Wohlert, Malin1 aTerenzi, Camilla1 aSalmén, Lennart,1 aFuró, István0 tCarbohydrate research.g2016 Nov. 03, v. 434 p.136-142dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2016.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168520098300286592002801269650003701297650002501334650001701359650001901376650001501395650001901410650001001429650001701439650001501456650001401471650001901485650002001504653002501524653001401549700005801563700001501621700002001636700001701656700002001673700006001693700002001753773011201773856008501885852000901970655001201979IND60687912420221120084458.0200705e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068791242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1180672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Zi-Ming10aSuperior nanofiltration membranes with gradient cross-linked selective layer fabricated via controlled hydrolysis  aNanofiltration (NF) membranes with both high permeability and salt rejection are in dire need for water treatment. Generally, heat treatment is an essential step for fabricating polyamide NF membranes. Conventional heat treatment in an oven causes membrane pore shrinkage and over cross-linking, which often leads to a severe loss of permeation performance. Herein, we report a single-step method by heat-treating membranes in non-neutral solutions to avoid pore shrinkage and generate graded hydrolysis in membrane selective layer. As confirmed by the XPS result, the polyamide NF membrane fabricated via controlled hydrolysis possesses a gradient cross-linking degree vertically along the membrane surface. This optimal polyamide NF membrane had a superior pure water permeability (PWP) of 27.5 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ and high Na₂SO₄ rejection of 98.5%. Such controlled hydrolysis approach provides novel strategy for fabricating high performance polyamide membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3acrosslinking 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3ananofiltration 3aovens 3apermeability 3apolyamides 3ashrinkage 3asodium sulfate 3awater treatment 0aMembrane preparation 0aPolyamide1 aXu, Zhen-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1436-49271 aZhu, Ka-Ke1 aXue, Shuang-Mei1 aJi, Chen-Hao1 aHuang, Ben-Qing1 aTang, Chuyang Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7932-64621 aTang, Yong-Jian0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 June 01, v. 604 p.118067-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1180673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011400175300001200289520119200301592002801493650001401521650002401535650002401559650001101583650001201594650001801606650001201624650001301636653001301649653002101662653002201683653002101705653002001726653002601746653002501772653002701797653002301824653002401847700002301871700001701894700002001911700002001931773016801951856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60527026120221119083613.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052702612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShompoosang, Sirinan10aNovel process for producing 6-deoxy monosaccharides from l-fucose by coupling and sequential enzymatic method  ap. 1-6.  aWe biosynthesized 6-deoxy-l-talose, 6-deoxy-l-sorbose, 6-deoxy-l-gulose, and 6-deoxy-l-idose, which rarely exist in nature, from l-fucose by coupling and sequential enzymatic reactions. The first product, 6-deoxy-l-talose, was directly produced from l-fucose by the coupling reactions of immobilized d-arabinose isomerase and immobilized l-rhamnose isomerase. In one-pot reactions, the equilibrium ratio of l-fucose, l-fuculose, and 6-deoxy-l-talose was 80:9:11. In contrast, 6-deoxy-l-sorbose, 6-deoxy-l-gulose, and 6-deoxy-l-idose were produced from l-fucose by sequential enzymatic reactions. d-Arabinose isomerase converted l-fucose into l-fuculose with a ratio of 88:12. Purified l-fuculose was further epimerized into 6-deoxy-l-sorbose by d-allulose 3-epimerase with a ratio of 40:60. Finally, purified 6-deoxy-l-sorbose was isomerized into both 6-deoxy-l-gulose with an equilibrium ratio of 40:60 by l-ribose isomerase, and 6-deoxy-l-idose with an equilibrium ratio of 73:27 by d-glucose isomerase. Based on the amount of l-fucose used, the production yields of 6-deoxy-l-talose, 6-deoxy-l-sorbose, 6-deoxy-l-gulose, and 6-deoxy-l-idose were 7.1%, 14%, 2%, and 2.4%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzymatic treatment 3afucose 3aglucose 3aisomerization 3apsicose 3arhamnose 0al-Fucose 0a6-Deoxy-l-talose 0a6-Deoxy-l-sorbose 0a6-Deoxy-l-gulose 0a6-Deoxy-l-idose 0ad-Arabinose isomerase 0al-Rhamnose isomerase 0ad-Allulose 3-epimerase 0al-Ribose isomerase 0ad-Glucose isomerase1 aYoshihara, Akihide1 aUechi, Keiko1 aAsada, Yasuhiko1 aMorimoto, Kenji0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2016 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169300001800301520105200319592002801371650001201399650002401411650001301435650002901448650002301477650001801500650001601518650001201534650001901546650001801565650000901583650003301592653002201625653002301647653002501670653002101695653001701716653002701733700002101760700001901781700002601800700001701826700002101843773013101864856008501995852000902080655001202089IND60530542120221117225842.0160721e20151005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053054212DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b008102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Nripat10aSustainable Processing and Synthesis of Nontoxic and Antibacterial Magnetic Nanocomposite from Spider Silk in Neoteric Solvents  ap. 2575-2581.  aDifferent neoteric solvents (both ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents) were used for the dispersion and preparation of bionanocomposite of spider silk fibers (Crossopriza lyoni). Among these solvents, hydrated tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was found to disperse 7.5 mg mL–¹ of spider silk with nanoscale structural distribution at room temperature. Analyses of the regenerated spider silk from the solution indicated preservation of the chemical structures of the protein blocks in the fibers during the dispersion process. The quaternary ammonium based IL was further used as dispersion media for the fabrication of Fe₃O₄ functionalized bionanocomposite. Attachment of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles on the spider silk surfaces and preservation of the chemical structures of the protein blocks of the spider silk in the composite was also established. The materials generated do not appear to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells in vitro and showed antibacterial properties and thus demonstrate their potential for therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aantibacterial properties 3achemical structure 3aionic liquids 3airon oxides 3amammals 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3asilk 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 0aNeoteric solvents 0aSpider silk fibers 0aNanoscale dispersion 0aBionanocomposite 0aCytotoxicity 0aAntibacterial activity1 aMondal, Dibyendu1 aSharma, Mukesh1 aDevkar, Ranjitsinh

The geologic basins where oil and gas energy exploration is occurring are primarily sagebrush steppe rangelands. Sagebrush steppe habitats may support more than 20 vertebrate species of conservation concern, and for many of these species, information is lacking on the effects of gas energy development. In earlier work, we demonstrated a negative relationship among development density of gas field infrastructure and pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis). We now examine the spatial relationship among gas field infrastructure, pygmy rabbits, and their habitat on four major gas fields in southwest Wyoming. Using data collected from 120 plots over three years (2011–2013) and 2012 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, we evaluated (1) whether well pads are more likely to be located in areas of pygmy rabbit habitat, (2) whether the presence and abundance of pygmy rabbits are related to distance from infrastructure, and, if so, (3) how much of the total surface area on a gas field is affected. Well pads on three gas fields occurred in higher quality pygmy rabbit habitat than did a set of randomly generated points, and the abundance and probability of pygmy rabbits being present were lower within approximately 0.5–1.5 km of the nearest road and 2 km of well pads and utilities. Buffering a digital layer of roads and well pads on one gas field revealed that nearly 82% of the (4417 km²) surface area was within 1 km of infrastructure, and over 95% of the gas field surface area was within 2 km. This need not be the case on future gas fields. Directional and horizontal well drilling technologies now make it possible for gas to be recovered from a greater area per well pad, enabling future gas field developments that require fewer well pads, roads, and pipeline corridors. Such changes would enable increased well pad spacing and provide the opportunity to locate gas field infrastructure in areas of poor quality wildlife habitat, avoid high priority habitat, and conserve a greater amount of on‐field wildlife habitat overall.  aPublisher supplied data  cUS Geological Survey Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative  cRuby Pipeline mitigation funds administered by the Bureau of Land Management 3aArtemisia 3aBrachylagus idahoensis 3abasins 3adata collection 3adrilling 3aenergy 3ahorizontal wells 3aoils 3aplanning 3aprobability 3arabbits 3arangelands 3aroads 3asteppes 3asurface area 3awildlife habitats 3awildlife management 3aWyoming1 aAssal, Timothy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6342-29541 aFreeman, Aaron1 aCarter, Sarah K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3778-86150 tEcosphere.g2020 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.e03230-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009300173300001600266520080700282592002801089650002301117650000901140650001801149650001001167650001401177650001201191650000901203653001301212653001801225653002901243653002201272700002201294700002801316700002301344773010301367856009001470852000901560655001201569IND50070165120221119030020.0190318e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007016512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeres, Helena12aA non-lethal faeces collection method for Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles  ap. 100-102.  aDigestibility studies in Senegalese sole are very scarce due to the difficulty of collecting faeces, which are semi-liquid and therefore dissolve very fast in water. Thus, in this species it is not possible to use sedimentation columns or faeces netting methods for faeces collection. Classical stripping is also not adequate due to the coiled shape of the intestine. Hence, up to now digestibility studies in this species applied the intestine dissection method for faeces collection. To overcome the inconveniences related to this methodology, namely the need to sacrifice animals, in this study we present an adaptation of the stripping method, which combines simultaneous stripping and anal sphincter stimulation and that allows faeces collection of Senegalese sole without sacrificing the animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolea senegalensis 3aanus 3adigestibility 3afeces 3ajuveniles 3anetting 3asole 0aFlatfish 0aDigestibility 0aFaeces collection method 0aMethod validation1 aGuerreiro, Inês,1 aPérez-Jiménez, Amalia1 aOliva-Teles, Aires0 tAquaculture.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 414-415 p.100-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008800174300001600262520098700278592002801265650002601293650001601319650001701335650001101352650002001363650001301383650001501396650002701411650001601438653004201454653001501496653002601511653002501537653002801562653003701590700001701627700002201644773010601666856008701772852000901859655001201868IND60597552420221118124314.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059755242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchmann, Leandro10aComprehensive pulsed electric field (PEF) system analysis for microalgae processing  ap. 268-274.  aPulsed electric field (PEF) is an emerging nonthermal technique with promising applications in microalgae biorefinery concepts. In this work, the flow field in continuous PEF processing and its influencing factors were analyzed and energy input distributions in PEF treatment chambers were investigated. The results were obtained using an interdisciplinary approach that combined multiphysics simulations with ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiling (UVP) and rheological measurements of Arthrospira platensis suspensions as a case study for applications in the biobased industry. UVP enabled non-invasive validation of multiphysics simulations. A. platensis suspensions follow a non-Newtonian, shear-thinning behavior, and measurement data could be fitted with rheological functions, which were used as an input for fluid dynamics simulations. Within the present work, a comprehensive system characterization was achieved that will facilitate research in the field of PEF processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3aindustry 3amicroalgae 3apulsed electric fields 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasonic Doppler velocity profiling 0aMicroalgae 0aArthrospira platensis 0aRheological analysis 0aMultiphysics simulation 0aPulsed electric field processing1 aBloch, Robin1 aMathys, Alexander0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Oct., v. 265 p.268-274dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013200169300001800301520193700319592002802256596004502284650003202329650001202361650001902373650002202392650002002414650001202434650003102446650001502477650001102492650001402503650001002517650001602527650002102543650002002564651001202584700002302596700002002619700002002639700002202659700002202681700002102703700001602724700001802740700001802758773011402776856008102890852000902971655001202980IND60621267620221118105436.0181116e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062126762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-018-1099-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanier, Alicia L.10aFacilitating Integration in Interdisciplinary Research: Lessons from a South Florida Water, Sustainability, and Climate Project  ap. 1025-1037.  aInterdisciplinary research is increasingly called upon to find solutions to complex sustainability problems, yet co-creating usable knowledge can be challenging. This article offers broad lessons for conducting interdisciplinary science from the South Florida Water, Sustainability, and Climate Project (SFWSC), a 5-year project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). The goal was to develop a holistic decision-making framework to improve understanding of the complex natural–social system of South Florida water allocation and its threats from climate change, including sea level rise, using a water resources optimization model as an integration mechanism. The SFWSC project faced several challenges, including uncertainty with tasks, high task interdependence, and ensuring communication among geographically dispersed members. Our hypothesis was that adaptive techniques would help overcome these challenges and maintain scientific rigor as research evolved. By systematically evaluating the interdisciplinary management approach throughout the project, we learned that integration can be supported by a three-pronged approach: (1) Build a well-defined team and leadership structure for collaboration across geographic distance and disciplines, ensuring adequate coordination funding, encouraging cross-pollination, and allowing team structure to adapt; (2) intentionally design a process and structure for facilitating collaboration, creating mechanisms for routine analysis, and incorporating collaboration tools that foster communication; and (3) support integration within the scientific framework, by using a shared research output, and encouraging team members to adapt when facing unanticipated constraints. These lessons contribute to the international body of knowledge on interdisciplinary research and can assist teams attempting to develop sustainable solutions in complex natural–social systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR-1204762cNational Science Foundation 3aNational Science Foundation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3across pollination 3adecision making 3afunding 3ainterdisciplinary research 3aleadership 3amodels 3asea level 3ateams 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3awater resources 3aFlorida1 aDrabik, Jillian R.1 aHeikkila, Tanya1 aBolson, Jessica1 aSukop, Michael C.1 aWatkins, David W.1 aRehage, Jennifer1 aMirchi, Ali1 aEngel, Victor1 aLetson, David0 tEnvironmental management.g2018 Dec., v. 62, no. 6 p.1025-1037dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1099-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008300169300001600252520118900268592002801457650001301485650001101498650002201509650001701531650001701548650002001565650002001585650001101605700002101616773009701637856008601734852000901820655001201829IND60096673820221122095525.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAksoy, Fatih10aPerformance testing of a Fresnel/Stirling micro solar energy conversion system  ap. 629-634.  aIn this study, a beta-type Stirling engine was tested with concentrated solar radiation. The displacer cylinder of the engine was modified by integrating a concentrated solar radiation receiver. Basically, the receiver is a cavity drilled in a separate part mounted on top of the displacer cylinder by screws. Tests were conducted with three cavities made of aluminium, copper and stainless steel. The solar radiation was concentrated by a Fresnel lens with 1.4m² capture area. Among the cavities, the highest performance was provided by aluminium cavity and followed by the stainless steel and copper cavities respectively. The maximum shaft power was observed as 64.4 W at systematic tests conducted with the aluminium cavity. The maximum shaft power corresponded to 218rpm engine speed and 2.82 Nm torque. For this shaft power, the overall conversion efficiency of the system was estimated to be 5.64%. The maximum torque measured with aluminium cavity was 2.93Nm corresponding to 177rpm below which the engine stopped. The Fresnel-lens/Stirling-engine micro power plant established in this investigation was more efficient than the micro power plants presented in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acopper 3aenergy conversion 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3astainless steel 3atorque1 aKarabulut, Halit0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.629-634dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242006300168245006300231300001400294520185000308592002802158650001102186650002002197650001802217650001102235650001902246650001502265650001102280650002702291650001302318650002302331650001502354650001002369650001102379651001302390700001802403700001902421700001902440700002102459700001902480700002202499773010502521856004802626852000902674655001202683IND50066754420221121071924.0130530e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006675442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-013-0186-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozman, Črtomir10aMulti Criteria Assessment of Zero Residue Apple Production10aMulti Criteria Assessment of Zero Residue Apple Production  ap. 51-62.  aDuring the 2008–2010 growing seasons, an alternative ‘zero residue apple production system’ was compared with integrated apple production with cvs ‘Idared’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Jonagold’ and ‘Gala’ in commercial orchards at several locations throughout Slovenia, using data envelopment analysis (DEA), and multi criteria assessment by an analytical hierarchical process (AHP). The principle of the ‘zero residue apple production’ is a combination of integrated (IP) and organic apple production. During the first 3 months of the growing season (1 April–30 June), pesticides used in IP with rapid degradation (8–10 applications) were used to control pests and diseases. During the second part of the season from 1 July to harvest, organic products (6–12 applications) were employed compared with 19–25 applications overall in IP. The goal of the alternative system was to reduce the amount of applied conventional pesticides by 40 % and to minimize pesticide residues in fruits to below the limit of 0.5 % of the legal maximum residue level (MRL) or below the residue concentrations of 0.005–0.01 mg/kg and to retain the high long-term level of yield, fruit quality, and net income per hectare. The number of pesticide residues was reduced from 4.2–5.5 in IP to 1.8–3.4 in zero residue cultivation, while 3 year average yields (class 1 fruit) were 4–9 % lower than in IP. The break even prices ranged from <euro> 0.31 for Idared in IP, <euro> 0.34 for ‘Elstar’ of both production systems to <euro> 0.35/kg for zero residue cultivated ‘Golden Delicious’. Overall, a price increase of just <euro> 0.02/kg for residue free apples would make this new ‘zero residue apple production’ profitable then representing a realistic alternative to the standard integrated apple production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acrop production 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3aincome 3amaximum residue limits 3aorchards 3apesticide residues 3apesticides 3apests 3aprices 3aSlovenia1 aUnuk, Tatjana1 aPažek, Karmen1 aLešnik, Mario1 aPrišenk, Jernej1 aVogrin, Andrej1 aTojnko, Stanislav0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2013 June, v. 55, no. 2 p.51-62dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl29949x0014-03097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-013-0186-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009500178520134700273592002801620650001601648650001301664650001701677650001601694650001601710650001401726650002201740650001601762650001201778650001201790650001501802651001101817700002701828700004101855700002901896700002801925700002901953700003101982700002702013700003202040700002902072700002802101700002902129700003202158700003102190773013302221856008402354852000902438655001202447IND60783911220221121014223.0220726e20220623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078391122DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120709102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPena, Guilherme Ferreira10aMixed Modeling in Genetic Divergence Study of Elite Popcorn Hybrids (Zea mays var. everta)  aPopcorn is a food highly appreciated throughout the world, generating billions of dollars annually just in the North American market alone. Even in the face of the historical superiority of American hybrids, which occupy almost 100% of the grain production fields in Brazil, our researchers have been working to develop cultivars that combine important traits for the crop, such as tolerance to leaf diseases and high rates of grain yield and popping expansion. This work investigated the degree of genetic divergence among 40 diallel hybrids of popcorn, 16 parents and 6 elite controls using mixed models to discriminate superior materials to be adopted in the Brazilian agribusiness. Based on the individual Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) of each of the 15 variables analyzed, the Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic Averages (UPGMA) and Tocher clusters were performed, and the study of Pearson correlation was carried out. The results pointed out that there is genetic variability among the genotypes evaluated and that the best candidates for composing superior genotypes are in the combination between the P10×L77 parents and/or between the P7 and L88 lines. Linear correlations showed that earlier flowering and taller genotypes exhibited an association with materials more tolerant to Exserohilum turcicum intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aExserohilum 3aZea mays 3aagribusiness 3aagriculture 3aarithmetics 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3amarkets 3apopcorn 3aprediction 3aBrazil1 aMafra, Gabrielle Sousa1 ado Amaral Júnior, Antônio Teixeira1 aAlfenas, Rafael Ferreira1 aBhering, Leonardo Lopes1 aSantos, Juliana Saltires1 aKamphorst, Samuel Henrique1 ade Lima, Valter Jário1 ade Oliveira Santos, Talles 1 aBispo, Rosimeire Barboza1 aViana, Flávia Nicácio1 aPereira, Messias Gonzaga1 ade Amaral Gravina, Geraldo 1 aDaher, Rogério Figueiredo0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 June 23, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120709103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009300164500001900257520157300276592002801849650001401877650001701891650002301908650001401931650001001945650002001955650000901975650002101984650001102005650001502016650002102031650001802052650001002070650001102080650001602091650001402107650001002121650001502131650001102146700002102157700002302178773011902201856007702320852000902397655001202406IND60735101220221122220251.0210423e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073510122DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100408262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Marcus 10aComparison of Alkaline/Oxidative and Hydrothermal Extraction of Wheat Bran Arabinoxylans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe bran accounts for approximately 25% of the wheat kernel but is currently only a by-product, used as animal feed. However, due to its high arabinoxylan content it could be a valuable raw material for food production. Arabinoxylans cannot be digested in the human intestine but are intensely studied for their health-beneficial properties. These include glycemic control by formation of a highly viscous gel in the intestine, and hence delaying starch digestion, alongside an increase in short chain fatty acids. To apply sufficient amounts of arabinoxylan for health-beneficial effects, extraction and concentration is required. Alkaline/oxidative conditions are commonly used, but for potential food applications more cost-efficient methods, without hazardous chemicals, are required. Therefore, this study aimed to optimize the conditions for hydrothermal extraction (extraction time and temperature) at laboratory-scale and to compare the results to an established alkaline/oxidative method. The resulting extracts were characterized for yield, purity, arabinoxylan molecular mass, arabinose/xylose ratio, and viscosity to evaluate the quality of the method. For the hydrothermal extraction, an extraction time of 1 h at 160 °C and 6.5 bar gave the best results. However, even these optimized conditions resulted in lower extract purity and severely degraded arabinoxylans. Although further optimization of the hydrothermal process is required, the present work builds an important foundation for the development of an industrial hydrothermal extraction method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3aarabinoxylan 3acost effectiveness 3adigestion 3afeeds 3afood production 3agels 3aglycemic control 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amolecular weight 3araw materials 3aseeds 3astarch 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat bran 3axylose1 aWiege, Berthold 1 aHollmann, Jürgen 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100408263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001600283500001900299520175300318592002802071596006802099596006802167596008302235650001202318650001502330650002002345650001302365650001702378650001602395700001802411700001402429773012402443856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60702385120221119013520.0200718e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05285-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruhua10aRole of the quasi-biennial oscillation in the downward extension of stratospheric northern annular mode anomalies  ap. 595-612.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing the JRA-55 reanalysis datasets and radiosonde observations, the impact of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the downward extension of stratospheric Northern Annular Mode (NAM) signals in its positive and negative phases (positive and negative NAM hereafter) is examined. The results show that the average number of days per month on which stratospheric negative NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere is more than twice as large during the easterly phase of the QBO (EQBO) as those during the westerly phase of the QBO (WQBO). The increasing likelihood of downward extension of stratospheric negative NAM signals during the EQBO is related to three factors: enhanced upward wave-1 fluxes entering the stratosphere, anomalous poleward wave fluxes below 100 hPa and EQBO-induced residual circulation. It is also revealed that the EQBO-induced subtropical tropospheric easterly anomalies lead to positive height anomalies over the subtropical North Atlantic, which are amplified by transient eddies and maintained by convection. These subtropical positive height anomalies further stimulate an anomalous wave train, forcing subpolar positive height anomalies over the Euro-Atlantic sector and enhancing wave 1. Over the Pacific, the EQBO could also induce positive height anomalies in the tropical troposphere, and these anomalies are related to convection and vertical motion. The positive height anomalies can induce anomalous poleward-propagating waves, forcing negative height anomalies over the North Pacific at mid-high latitudes and the enhancing wave 1. Fewer stratospheric positive NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere during the EQBO than during the WQBO, with mechanisms similar to those of negative NAM.  aPublisher supplied data  a41630421cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a91837311cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  alzujbky-2018-ct03cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aclimate 3aconvection 3adata collection 3adynamics 3astratosphere 3atroposphere1 aTian, Wenshou1 aWang, Tao0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Aug., v. 55, no. 3-4 p.595-612dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05285-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012300157300001800280520218800298592002802486650001102514650001102525650001902536650001902555650001902574650001002593650001502603650001202618650001202630650001002642650001102652650001102663650001102674650001602685651001102701700002202712700002702734700002202761700002302783700002502806700002802831700001802859700002802877700002102905773010002926856007303026852000903099655001203108IND60135864920221123005613.0150522e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013586492DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.127572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLara, Mark J.10aPolygonal tundra geomorphological change in response to warming alters future CO2 and CH4 flux on the Barrow Peninsula  ap. 1634-1651.  aThe landscape of the Barrow Peninsula in northern Alaska is thought to have formed over centuries to millennia, and is now dominated by ice‐wedge polygonal tundra that spans drained thaw‐lake basins and interstitial tundra. In nearby tundra regions, studies have identified a rapid increase in thermokarst formation (i.e., pits) over recent decades in response to climate warming, facilitating changes in polygonal tundra geomorphology. We assessed the future impact of 100 years of tundra geomorphic change on peak growing season carbon exchange in response to: (i) landscape succession associated with the thaw‐lake cycle; and (ii) low, moderate, and extreme scenarios of thermokarst pit formation (10%, 30%, and 50%) reported for Alaskan arctic tundra sites. We developed a 30 × 30 m resolution tundra geomorphology map (overall accuracy:75%; Kappa:0.69) for our ~1800 km² study area composed of ten classes; drained slope, high center polygon, flat‐center polygon, low center polygon, coalescent low center polygon, polygon trough, meadow, ponds, rivers, and lakes, to determine their spatial distribution across the Barrow Peninsula. Land‐atmosphere CO₂and CH₄flux data were collected for the summers of 2006–2010 at eighty‐two sites near Barrow, across the mapped classes. The developed geomorphic map was used for the regional assessment of carbon flux. Results indicate (i) at present during peak growing season on the Barrow Peninsula, CO₂uptake occurs at ‐902.3 10⁶gC‐CO₂ day⁻¹(uncertainty using 95% CI is between −438.3 and −1366 10⁶gC‐CO₂ day⁻¹) and CH₄flux at 28.9 10⁶gC‐CH₄ day⁻¹(uncertainty using 95% CI is between 12.9 and 44.9 10⁶gC‐CH₄ day⁻¹), (ii) one century of future landscape change associated with the thaw‐lake cycle only slightly alter CO₂and CH₄exchange, while (iii) moderate increases in thermokarst pits would strengthen both CO₂uptake (−166.9 10⁶gC‐CO₂ day⁻¹) and CH₄flux (2.8 10⁶gC‐CH₄ day⁻¹) with geomorphic change from low to high center polygons, cumulatively resulting in an estimated negative feedback to warming during peak growing season.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3alakes 3alandscapes 3ameadows 3amethane 3aponds 3arivers 3asummer 3atundra 3auncertainty 3aAlaska1 aMcGuire, A.

Intraperitoneal doses of β-glucans in mammals have shown to induce trained immunity, but the training effects of orally administering β-glucans are unknown. Newborn goats are susceptible to infections in the neonatal stage, so the induction of trained immunity could improve animal survival. This study aimed to describe the in vitro effects of immunological training by β-glucan from Debaryomyces hansenii (β-Dh) on caprine monocytes, as well as its in vivo effects using oral doses on newborn goats upon challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hence in vitro, goat monocytes trained with β-Dh up-regulated the gene expression of macrophage surface markers (CD11b and F4/80) whereas enhanced cell survival and high phagocytic ability was found upon LPS challenge. In the in vivo experiment, newborn goats stimulated with two doses (day −7 and - 4) of β-Dh (50 mg/kg) and challenged (day 0) with LPS showed an increase in respiratory burst activity, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα production in plasma, and transcription of the macrophage surface markers. This study has demonstrated for the first time that trained immunity was induced with oral doses of β-glucan upon LPS challenge in mammals using newborn goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3abeta-glucans 3acell viability 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agoats 3ain vivo studies 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aneonates 3aoral administration 3aphagocytosis 3arespiratory burst 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ayeasts 0aRuminant 0aInnate immune memory 0aMarine yeast 0aPolysaccharides 0aPathogen1 aReyes-Becerril, Martha1 aCepeda Palacios, Ramón,1 aAngulo Valdés, Carlos,0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2020 Apr., v. 105 p.103597-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2019.1035973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01414naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010000199300001400299500001100313520051000324592002800834650001400862650001700876650001400893700001800907773012800925856007401053852000901127655001201136IND60788538620221119024951.0220815e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078853862DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.106022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobak, Stephanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3714-962910aTough Pill to Swallow: Postextubation Dysphagia and Nutrition Impact in the Intensive Care Unit  ap. 80-87.  aREVIEW  aMore than 5 million patients are admitted to US intensive care units (ICUs) each year.

Therefore pre-screening for evaluating the extent of a stenosis is critically important before undertaking surgical procedures. This study presents and evaluates the feasibility of implementing a virtual computational hemodynamics platform for clinical use to determine the severity of a stenosis and give guidance for surgical decision making. The virtual platform incorporates high-resolution three-dimensional angiography results with Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling to determine clinically related indicators. This includes wall shear stress (WSS), the spatial and temporal hemodynamic changes of blood flow within patient-specific carotid bifurcations, pressure drop coefficient, and severity stratification. The turn-around time for each computational modeling stage was examined which showed that the total time cost is practical and the proposed hemodynamics evaluation platform is reasonably efficient for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore the virtual platform may be used to detect the hemodynamic consequence of atherogenesis, which can then be addressed and quantified based on the distribution of WSS related flow indicators on the abnormal luminal fractions. Additional functional evidence and data can be used by the overseeing physician to enrich and complement the anatomical information for more in-depth evaluation of stenosis in a reasonable time duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherogenesis 3ablood flow 3acarotid arteries 3adecision making 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3ashear stress 3asurgery1 aInthavong, Kiao1 aTu, Jiyuan0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 43, no. 10 p.1353-1362dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015000165300001600315520099900331592002801330650002401358650002601382650000901408650002501417650001101442650003101453650001901484650001701503650001301520650001701533650001101550653001901561653002401580653001801604653001701622700001401639700001701653700001801670773009901688856005101787852000901838655001201847IND50087055420221118011518.0140412e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008705542DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2012.7305532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, F.10aChanges in the microbiological and physicochemical quality during storage of osmotically dehydrated strawberry jam stabilized with plant extracts  ap. 248-255.  aAntifungal properties of some plant extracts (pomegranate, rosemary, lemon and balsamic lemon) added in the elaboration of jam obtained from osmotically dehydrated strawberry were studied. Lemon extract exhibited the highest antifungal activity against the microbiota present. Subsequently, the effect of the addition of a combination of lemon extract, as antifungal, and pomegranate, as antimicrobial, on the microbiological and physico-chemical properties of this jam was evaluated through storage. The use of plant extracts reduces the microbial charge (aerobic mesophylls, lactic acid bacteria, molds, and yeasts) and is most effective when pomegranate and lemon extracts are used, as these do not cause significant changes in the physicochemical characteristics. Furthermore, adding pomegranate and/or lemon extract improved the consistency of jams during storage.

The study included 1002 centenarians. The diet-related behaviors were assessed using the food frequency questionnaire; nutritional status was determined according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment – short form scale scores. We used logistic regression models to analyze the main dietary risk factors of malnutrition.Of all the centenarians, 94.6% maintained regular meals, 80.4% had three meals a day, 53.4% ate each meal until 80% full, 88.7% ate vegetables daily, and 70% drank one to two cups of water daily. Centenarians ate rice-based staple foods; eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, and poultry were not popular. The main sources of meat were red meat and seafood. None liked fried food, and 19.3% preferred sweet flavors. People with normal nutritional status accounted for 12.3% of the population, whereas those with malnutrition comprised 20.8%. Dietary factors that affected nutritional status included three meals a day (odds ratio [OR], 0.366; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.173–0.778), tea drinking (OR, 0.236; 95% CI, 0.087–0.641), and the frequency of poultry (OR, 0.261; 95% CI, 0.088–0.771), seafood (OR, 0.247; 95% CI, 0.110–0.554), nuts (OR, 0.381; 95% CI, 0.150–0.965), and pastry (OR, 0.219; 95% CI, 0.080–0.600) consumption.This was the first study on the dietary behaviors and nutritional status of centenarians using survey data. We highlighted the factors affecting nutritional status and provided scientific support for dietary strategies that may improve the nutritional status of the elderly population.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afried foods 3amalnutrition 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3apastries 3apeople 3apoultry 3ared meat 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aseafoods 3atea 3aChina 0aDietary behaviors 0aCentenarians 0aHainan 0aNutritional status 0aFull sampled cross-sectional study1 aWang, Shengshu1 aWang, Lili1 aLiu, Guangdong1 aTai, Penggang1 aKou, Fuyin1 aJia, Wangping1 aHan, Ke1 aLiu, Miao1 aHe, Yao0 tNutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 89 p.111228-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1112283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007900159300001400238500002000252520121500272592002801487650001601515650001701531650002101548650002001569650001701589650001901606650002501625650002301650650001701673650001501690650003201705650002201737650000901759700002101768700005901789700001801848700006101866700005801927700002201985710012002007773012802127856007402255852000902329655001202338IND60788538720221119025011.0220815e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078853872DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.105882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, David C.14aThe Use of Visceral Proteins as Nutrition Markers: An ASPEN Position Paper  ap. 22-28.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSerum albumin and prealbumin, well‐known visceral proteins, have traditionally been considered useful biochemical laboratory values in a nutrition assessment. However, recent literature disputes this contention. The aim of this document is to clarify that these proteins characterize inflammation rather than describe nutrition status or protein‐energy malnutrition. Both critical illness and chronic illness are characterized by inflammation and, as such, hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis occurs, resulting in lower serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin. In addition, the redistribution of serum proteins occurs because of an increase in capillary permeability. There is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, however, not between malnutrition and visceral‐protein levels. These proteins correlate well with patients’ risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein‐energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

The response to low and average salinity stress and to a 5 day-long flooding period was analyzed in M. sativa nodulated roots. The two treatments result in a decrease in the biological nitrogen fixation capacity and the energy state (evaluated by the ATP/ADP ratio), and conversely in an increase nitric oxide (NO) production. Under salinity and hypoxia treatments, the use of either sodium tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase (NR), or carboxy-PTIO, a NO scavenger, results in a decrease in NO production and ATP/ADP ratio, meaning that NR-dependent NO production participates to the maintenance of the nodulated roots energy state.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant N° 17G0904cPHC Utique  aGrant N° 17G0904cPHC Utique 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aenergy 3ahypoxia 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen fixation 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium1 aSghaier, Hajer1 aGaitanaros, Allyzée1 aKhadri, Ayda1 aAschi-Smiti, Samira1 aBrouquisse, Renaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7818-96620 tPlanta.g2020 Aug., v. 252, no. 2 p.22-22dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03422-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013000168300001600298520102600314592002801340650001901368650001301387650001201400650001901412650002001431650001901451650002001470650001101490650001301501650003001514650001201544650001201556650001201568650001201580650001601592653003001608653003001638653001201668653002501680653002001705773010601725856008701831852000901918655001201927IND60597553020221119190521.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059755302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jinbo10aBio-oil production from hydrothermal liquefaction of Pteris vittata L.: Effects of operating temperatures and energy recovery  ap. 320-327.  aHyper-accumulator biomass, Pteris vittata L., was hydrothermally converted into bio-oils via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in sub-supercritical water. The distributions and characterizations of various products as well as energy recovery under different temperatures (250–390 °C) were investigated. The highest bio-oil yield of 16.88% was obtained at 350 °C with the hydrothermal conversion of 61.79%, where the bio-oil was dominated by alcohols, esters, phenols, ketones and acidic compounds. The higher heating values of bio-oil were in the range of 19.93–35.45 MJ/kg with a H/C ratio of 1.26–1.46, illustrating its high energy density and potential for use as an ideal liquid fuel. The main gaseous products were CO₂, H₂, CO, and CH₄ with the H₂ yield peaking at 22.94%.

In this study, the perspectives of the farmers in this area were investigated, specifically about reasons for the decrease in yields. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was conducted with 378 pine nut farmers from the Kozak Basin. It was determined that the average age of the farmers is high, their educational achievement level is low, they generally also work in alternative sectors and almost all of them grow pine nuts in their own pine groves. The farmers’ perception of cooperatives was found to be negative. In general, the local people continue to produce pine nuts in their own pine groves, but nearly half of the participants also worked in other sectors to maintain their standard of living. Farmers attribute the low yield in the Kozak Basin to both abiotic and biotic factors. Mining activities, which are increasing, are seen as a threat to the future of production in the area. Also, there is a growing perception of biotic harm, especially from Western Conifer Seed Bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis. Climate change and air pollution are other prominent factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptoglossus occidentalis 3aPinus pinea 3aTurkey (country) 3aacademic achievement 3aagriculture 3aair pollution 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3asurveys 3atrade1 aOkan, Taner 1 aBuğday, Seda Erkan1 aKöse, Coşkun 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 July 21, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120710703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013000157300001800287520119800305592002801503650003401531650001901565650001401584650002301598650003001621650001301651650002001664650001201684650001301696650001401709650001401723650002401737650003701761700002001798700001701818700001601835700001701851700001401868700001701882700001301899700001301912700001801925700001701943700001601960700001501976773012501991856007502116852000902191655001202200IND60786039020221118224544.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078603902DNAL7 a10.1039/d2gc01831d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenhui12aA stable single-atom Zn catalyst synthesized by a ligand-stabilized pyrolysis strategy for selective oxidation of C–H bonds  ap. 6008-6015.  aThe activation of C–H bonds for the synthesis of highly valued chemicals is still a challenging task. Herein, a nitrogen-doped carbon supported single atom Zn catalyst (Zn–N–C) was fabricated via a ligand-stabilized pyrolysis strategy, in which 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) served as a ligand and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) served as a directional 2D-template and a nitrogen source. The results of high-angle annular dark field aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy indicated that Zn species are present as isolated single sites and stabilized by nitrogen in the Zn–N₄ structure. The optimized Zn–N–C-900 catalyst displayed superior catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of C–H bonds. In particular, the Zn–N–C-900 catalyst can be reused fifteen times without obvious decay in either activity or selectivity. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to reveal the reaction mechanism. The results indicated that the high valence ZnO species generated on Zn–N–C-900 were the crucial active centers for the activation of C–H bonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3aligands 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aShang, Ningzhao1 aWang, Junmin1 aNie, Xinhao1 aDu, Congcong1 aZhou, Xin1 aCheng, Xiang1 aGao, Wei1 aLiu, Xue1 aHuang, Jianyu1 aQiao, Yuqing1 aGao, Shutao1 aWang, Chun0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 24, no. 15 p.6008-6015dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2gc01831d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245008600173300001800259520257100277592002802848650001002876650001302886650001102899650001102910650001202921650001302933700002202946700002302968700001902991700002303010773010803033856008803141990002303229852000903252655001203261IND60096173720221119093655.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSotelo, Arturo10aIdentification of epilepsy stages from ECoG using genetic programming classifiers  ap. 1713-1723.  aObjective: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, for which a great deal of research has been devoted to analyze and characterize brain activity during seizures. While this can be done by a human expert, automatic methods still lag behind. This paper analyzes neural activity captured with Electrocorticogram (ECoG), recorded through intracranial implants from Kindling model test subjects. The goal is to automatically identify the main seizure stages: Pre-Ictal, Ictal and Post-Ictal. While visually differentiating each stage can be done by an expert if the complete time-series is available, the goal here is to automatically identify the corresponding stage of short signal segments. Methods and materials: The proposal is to pose the above task as a supervised classification problem and derive a mapping function that classifies each signal segment. Given the complexity of the signal patterns, it is difficult to a priori choose any particular classifier. Therefore, Genetic Programming (GP), a population based meta-heuristic for automatic program induction, is used to automatically search for the mapping functions. Two GP-based classifiers are used and extensively evaluated. The signals from epileptic seizures are obtained using the Kindling model of elicited epilepsy in rodent test subjects, for which a seizure was elicited and recorded on four separate days. Results: Results show that signal segments from a single seizure can be used to derive accurate classifiers that generalize when tested on different signals from the same subject; i.e., GP can automatically produce accurate mapping functions for intra-subject classification. A large number of experiments are performed with the GP classifiers achieving good performance based on standard performance metrics. Moreover, a proof-of-concept real-world prototype is presented, where a GP classifier is transferred and hard-coded on an embedded system using a digital-to-analogue converter and a field programmable gate array, achieving a low average classification error of 14.55%, sensitivity values between 0.65 and 0.97, and specificity values between 0.86 and 0.94. Conclusions: The proposed approach achieves good results for stage identification, particularly when compared with previous works that focus on this task. The results show that the problem of intra-class classification can be solved with a low error, and high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the limitations of the approach are identified and good operating configurations can be proposed based on the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aepilepsy 3ahumans 3amodels 3arodents 3aseizures1 aGuijarro, Enrique1 aTrujillo, Leonardo1 aCoria, Luis N.1 aMartínez, Yuliana0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1713-1723dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010500166300001600271520107900287592002801366650001501394650002401409650002001433650002401453650001701477650001701494650002101511650001101532650001801543650002101561650002401582650001701606650000901623650001501632650002101647653001301668653001001681653000801691653000801699653000801707653000901715653000801724653000801732653000801740653000801748653001301756653000701769653000801776653000801784653000901792653000901801653000801810653000801818653000801826653000801834653000801842653004001850653001701890653001601907653004101923653002001964700001901984700005502003773011202058856008202170852000902252655001202261IND60568161520221122120838.0190415e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056816152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2017.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shang-Ta12aA food-grade self-nanoemulsifying delivery system for enhancing oral bioavailability of ellagic acid  ap. 207-215.  aEllagic acid is known of a predominant bioactive component in pomegranate that possesses broad health benefits, but it has low bioavailability. In this work, we developed a food-grade self-nanoemulsifying system to improve the dissolution and absorption of ellagic acid. Solubility assay and pseudo-ternary phase diagrams revealed suitable components for the formulation. The optimal formulation was composed of polyethylene glycol, polysorbate, caprylic/capric triacylglycerol at the ratio of 45/45/10wt.%. With this optimal formulation and gentle stirring, a fine nanoemulsion was achieved and had mean droplet size of around 120nm. The dissolution of ellagic acid was significantly elevated with the formulation. Rat pharmacokinetics studies showed that ellagic acid was 6.6- and 3.2-fold more bioavailable with the formulation than with aqueous suspensions and pomegranate extract, respectively. The proposed self-nanoemulsifying system to deliver ellagic acid can be a novel strategy for developing products for dietary supplements and functional foods of ellagic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3adietary supplements 3adroplet size 3aellagic acid 3afunctional foods 3amixing 3ananoemulsions 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol 3apomegranates 3arats 3asolubility 3atriacylglycerols 0aGI tract 0aSNEDS 0aTEM 0aEPA 0aDHA 0aTPGS 0aPEG 0aPTA 0aSDS 0aCMC 0aEA-SNEDS 0aDE 0aESI 0aMRM 0aCmax 0aTmax 0aAUC 0aPEO 0aLCT 0aMCT 0aHLB 0aEllagic acid (PubChem CID: 5281855) 0aEllagic acid 0aPomegranate 0aSelf-nanoemulsifying delivery system 0aBioavailability1 aChou, Chien-Te1 aSu, Nan-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1402-73490 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 July, v. 34 p.207-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013600169520136300305592002801668650002501696650002101721650002401742650002301766650001601789650001101805650001401816650001401830651001001844653002101854653002801875653002801903653002401931700002001955700001401975773012001989856008802109852000902197655001202206IND60730110720221119110309.0210918e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073011072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1054972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chang14aThe influence of economic incentives on residents’ intention to participate in online recycling: An experimental study from China  aEconomic incentives have played an essential role in stimulating residents to participate in online recycling, but the internal influence mechanism has not been effectively revealed. This study discusses the influencing mechanisms of non-monetary incentives and monetary incentives on residents’ intention to participate in online recycling through an experimental study based on the S (stimulus) - O (organism) - R (response) model. The results show that both non-monetary incentives and monetary incentives have significant positive effects on residents’ intention to participate in online recycling, and there is no significant difference between them. Perceived value plays a mediating role in the relationship between non-monetary incentives and participation intention and between monetary incentives and participation intention. Temporal distance plays a moderating role in the relationship between non-monetary incentives and perceived value and between monetary incentives and perceived value. Residents’ perceived value of non-monetary incentives is higher in the near future than in the distant future while the perceived value of monetary incentives is higher in the distant future than in the near future. Our results are theoretically important and have implications for the practical development of online recycling platform enterprises.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic factors 3aeconomic incentives 3aeconomic valuation 3aexhibitions 3amodels 3aorganisms 3arecycling 3aChina 0aOnline recycling 0aParticipation intention 0aNon-monetary incentives 0aMonetary incentives1 aZhang, Xiaoying1 aSun, Qiao0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 June, v. 169 p.105497-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1054973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245016000173300001800333520207200351592002802423650002502451650001402476650001702490650001102507650001402518650001902532650002102551650004402572650000702616650001702623650002602640650002502666650001102691700002002702700002102722700002102743773011702764856005502881852000902936655001202945IND4510550920221121033913.0150730e200011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451055092DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01758.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrÃ©, Henrik11aAnovel type of arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase isolated from germinated barley: Analysis of substrate preference and specificity by nanoâprobe NMR  ap. 6633-6641.  aAn arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase was isolated from barley malt. The enzyme preparation, Araâ1, contained two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ââ60 and ââ66âkDa, a pI of 4.55 and almost identical Nâterminal aminoâacid sequences. With pânitrophenyl Î±âlâarabinofuranoside (pNPA) as substrate, Araâ1 exhibited a Km of 0.5âmm and a Vmax of 6.7âÂµmolÂ·minâ1Â·(mg of protein)â1. Maximum activity was displayed at pHâ4.2 and 60âÂ°C, and, under these conditions, the halfâlife of the enzyme was 8âmin. The Araâ1 preparation showed no activity against pânitrophenyl Î±âlâarabinopyranoside or pânitrophenyl Î²âdâxylopyranoside. Substrate preference and specificity were investigated using pure oligosaccharides and analysis by TLC and nanoâprobe NMR. Araâ1 released arabinose from highâmolecularâmass arabinoxylan and arabinoxylanâderived oligosaccharides but was inactive against linear or branchedâchain arabinan. Arabinose was readily released from both singly and doubly substituted xyloâoligosaccharides. Whereas single 2âOâlinked and 3âOâlinked arabinose substituents on nonâreducing terminal xylose were released at similar rates, there was a clear preference for 2âOâlinked arabinose on internal xylose residues. When Araâ1 acted on oligosaccharides with doubly substituted, nonâreducing terminal xylose, the 3âOâlinked arabinose group was preferred as the initial point of attack. Oligosaccharides with doubly substituted internal xylose were poor substrates and no preference could be determined. The enzyme described here is the first reported arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase which is ableÂ toÂ release arabinose from both singly and doubly substituted xylose, and it hydrolyses pânitrophenyl Î±âlâarabinofuranoside at a rate similar to that observed for oligosaccharide substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aarabinose 3aarabinoxylan 3abarley 3ahalf life 3amalting barley 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolypeptides 3asubstrate specificity 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aBroberg, Anders1 aDuus, Jens Ã.1 aThomsen, Karl K.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Nov., v. 267, no. 22 p.6633-6641dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01758.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002000185245013800205300001800343520135800361592002801719596008901747650002301836650001301859650002601872650001401898650001401912650001101926650002101937650002001958650000901978651001801987700001802005773011102023856008202134852000902216655001202225IND60621268320221118045425.0190323e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062126832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-018-1738-42doi7 a10.1007/s00468-018-1738-42chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, G.

Cardinal branch direction significantly influenced both SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions. Leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and their spatial distribution in the crown are important indicators of biological response to changes in growing conditions including light and water availability. Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) is a deciduous coniferous pioneer species in the U.S. Inland Northwest known for its rapid growth, high-quality wood, and ecological importance. Analysis with nonlinear models revealed that SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions differ between cardinal quadrants of juvenile western larch crowns. SLA was significantly higher in the more illuminated, southern side of the crown, and leaf area peaked closer to the stem in the southwest quadrant. Similar to other conifers, horizontal distributions of foliage in western larch also shifted further outward towards the branch tips with increasing depth in the crown. Models developed for horizontal distribution of leaf area and spatial distribution of specific leaf area for western larch may be extended by future researchers to predict its response to environmental variables or management practices.  aPublisher supplied data  aMcIntire-Stennis Program project 1008381cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aLarix occidentalis 3aconifers 3aenvironmental factors 3ajuveniles 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anonlinear models 3apioneer species 3awood 3aUnited States1 aNelson, A.

Evidence indicates volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be released before, during, and after manufacture. The chemical composition of a popular uncured styrene-based CIPP resin was examined, along with the VOCs that remained in the new cured composite. The roles of curing temperature and heating time in waste discharged into the air were examined. Uncured resin contained approximately 39 wt% VOCs. Multiple hazardous air pollutants were present, however, 61 wt% of the uncured resin was not chemically identified. A substantial mass of VOCs (8.87 wt%) was emitted into the air during manufacture, and all cured composites contained about 3 wt% VOCs. Some VOCs were created during manufacture. Curing temperature (65.5–93.3 °C) and heating time (25–100 min) did not cause different composite VOC loadings. High styrene air concentrations inhibited the detection of other VOCs in air. It is estimated that tens of tons of VOCs may be emitted at a single CIPP manufacturing site. Regulators should consider monitoring, and potentially regulating, these growing mobile air pollution and volatile chemical product sources as they are operating in urban and rural areas often in close proximity to residential and commercial buildings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3achemical composition 3amanufacturing 3astyrene 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 3awastes1 aNoh, Yoorae1 aNuruddin, Md1 aBoor, Brandon E.1 aHowarter, John A.1 aYoungblood, Jeffrey P.1 aJafvert, Chad T.1 aWhelton, Andrew J.0 tEnvironmental science.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 22, no. 9 p.1828-1841dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0em00190b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245011100175300001800286520068200304592002800986650001701014650002101031650001101052650001001063650001901073650002101092650002801113700002201141700002601163700001901189700002501208700002001233773010801253856008801361990002301449852000901472655001201481IND60096173920221119093559.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTousheh, Mojtaba10aComputational evaluation on the binding affinity of non-specific lipid-transfer protein-2 with fatty acids  ap. 1732-1738.  aA computational study was carried out to identify the structural determinant controlling the affinity, specificity and binding strength of several saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with Oryza sativa (Indica group) nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2).

This study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of GCM on hepatic steatosis in the setting of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using both cell culture model of OA(oleic acid)/PA(palmitate acid)-induced lipids accumulation and a murine model of hepatic steatosis induced by a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Results showed that GCM was highly effective in removing lipids droplets in both in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that activation of adenosine 5,-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated lipophagy, lipogenesis inhibition and enhanced fatty acid oxidation contributed to the anti-lipogenic effect of GCM. Our findings support a possible usefulness of GCM as a novel agent to mitigate hepatic steatosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aanimal models 3abeta oxidation 3acell culture 3acoumarin 3adiet 3adroplets 3afatty liver 3alicorice 3alipogenesis 3aoleic acid 3apalmitates 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 0aLicorice 0aGlycycoumarin 0aHepatic steatosis 0aLipophagy 0aβ-oxidation 0aLipogenesis1 aSong, Xinhua1 aYin, Shutao1 aFan, Lihong1 aYe, Min1 aHu, Hongbo0 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 July, v. 34 p.277-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014200163300001800305500001900323520133600342592002801678650002001706650001301726650000901739650002101748650001101769650001201780650001801792650003101810650001501841650001601856650001301872650001901885650001501904700002801919700002601947773013201973856007402105852000902179655001202188IND60711476220221120192336.0200928e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071147622DNAL7 a10.1039/d0em00222d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaddela, Naga Raju10aTris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, a pervasive flame retardant: critical perspective on its emissions into the environment and human toxicity  ap. 1809-1827.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRegulations and the voluntary activities of manufacturers have led to a market shift in the use of flame retardants (FRs). Accordingly, organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPFRs) have emerged as a replacement for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). One of the widely used OPFRs is tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), the considerable usage of which has reached 1.0 Mt globally. High concentrations of TCEP in indoor dust (∼2.0 × 10⁵ ng g⁻¹), its detection in nearly all foodstuffs (max. concentration of ∼30–300 ng g⁻¹ or ng L⁻¹), human body burden, and toxicological properties as revealed by meta-analysis make TCEP hard to distinguish from traditional FRs, and this situation requires researchers to rethink whether or not TCEP is an appropriate choice as a new FR. However, there are many unresolved issues, which may impede global health agencies in framing stringent regulations and manufacturers considering the meticulous use of TCEP. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to highlight the factors that influence TCEP emissions from its sources, its bioaccessibility, threat of trophic transfer, and toxicogenomics in order to provide better insight into its emergence as an FR. Finally, remediation strategies for dealing with TCEP emissions, and future research directions are addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiphenyl 3adust 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3amarkets 3ameta-analysis 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3aremediation 3atoxicity 3atoxicogenomics 3atoxicology1 aVenkateswarlu, Kadiyala1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu0 tEnvironmental science.g2020 Sept. 23, v. 22, no. 9 p.1809-1827dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0em00222d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245012400174300001800298520069900316592002801015650001901043650002801062650001101090650002601101650001601127650001501143650001501158700002201173773010801195856008801303990002301391852000901414655001201423IND60096174120221118014744.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaase, Kristina10aPrediction of stress shielding around an orthopedic screw: Using stress and strain energy density as mechanical stimuli  ap. 1748-1757.  aUsing finite element analysis, a parametric study was developed to compare stress and strain energy density (SED), in order to determine which stimuli might be better for predicting stress shielding in bone–screw models.

While small diameter angled threads increased transfer of both stimuli, reducing the screw's elastic modulus resulted in an increased transfer of stress; and unexpected decrease in SED, indicating that SED should be carefully examined in the context of future bone–screw models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy density 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aorthopedics 3aprediction 3aprostheses1 aRouhi, Gholamreza0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1748-1757dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.07.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245009900203300001500302500001100317520079400328592002801122650001101150650002001161650001601181650001801197650001701215650001301232650001701245650001901262650000901281650001501290700003201305700002301337700006101360773012901421856007401550852000901624655001201633IND60788539320221116222147.0220815e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078853932DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.105912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Robert C., II1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6837-198110aSafety, Tolerability, and Outcomes of Enteral Nutrition in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation  ap. 98-104.  aREVIEW  aExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive care system for patients with respiratory or cardiac failure.

However, a decrease in MDA levels after xenobiotic exposure has been also reported, an effect that is mostly attributed to enhanced antioxidant defenses. In this study, we assessed whether pollutant-mediated MDA decrease would be associated with antioxidant enhancement or with its metabolism by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the liver and gills of lambari (Astyanax altiparanae) exposed to diesel oil (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mL/L). MDA levels were decreased in the liver of lambari exposed to diesel. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were unchanged in the liver, while that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was decreased. In contrast, levels of total glutathione (tGSH) and the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) were increased in the liver, which partly support antioxidant protection against lipid peroxidation. More importantly, ALDH activity increased in a concentration-dependent manner, being negatively correlated with MDA levels, indicating MDA metabolism by ALDH. In the gills, diesel exposure increased MDA and lipid hydroperoxide levels, and promoted increases in antioxidant defenses, indicating oxidative stress. Curiously, ALDH activity was undetectable in the gills, supporting the possibility of direct MDA excretion in the water by the gills. Analyses of MDA in the water revealed increased levels of MDA in the aquaria in which the fish were exposed to diesel, compared to control aquaria. A second experiment was carried out in which the fish were intraperitoneally injected with MDA (10 mg/kg) and analyzed after 1, 6, and 12 h. MDA injection caused a time-dependent decrease in hepatic MDA levels, did not alter ALDH, CAT, GPx, and GST activities, and decreased G6PDH activity and tGSH levels. In the gills, MDA injection caused a slight increase in MDA levels after 1 h, but did not alter GPx, G6PDH, and GST activities. MDA injection also enhanced CAT activity and tGSH levels in the gills. MDA concentration in water increased progressively after 1, 6, and 12 h, supporting the hypothesis of direct MDA excretion as an alternative route for MDA elimination in fish. Our results suggest that the decreased MDA levels after exposure of lambari to diesel oil pollutant probably reflects an association between enhanced antioxidant protection, MDA metabolism, and MDA excretion in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstyanax altiparanae 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aaquariums 3acatalase 3adiesel fuel 3aenzyme activity 3aexcretion 3afish 3agills 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid peroxides 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3axenobiotics 0aMalondialdehyde 0aAldehyde dehydrogenase 0aOxidative stress 0aDiesel 0aFish1 aLima, Daína1 ada Silva, Danilo Grünig Humberto1 aAlmeida, Eduardo Alves de,0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 190 p.110107-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1101073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010900167520093700276592002801213650001601241650001501257650001501272650001001287700001601297700001701313700001801330700001501348700001701363700001401380773013301394856008401527852000901611655001201620IND60783912420221121001624.0220726e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078391242DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120708962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yunxiang 10aDesign and Experiment of Symmetrical Spiral Row-Sorting of the Straw Device Based on Kinematics Analysis  aThis paper designed a symmetrical spiral row-sorting of the straw device (SSRSD) under the condition that the no-till anti-blocking knife cut and chopped the straw to guarantee the machine’s passing capacity. The row-sorting blade (RB) of the symmetrical spiral mechanism (SSM) pushed the straw that fell into the straw hopper to the non-sowing area on both sides of the sowing belt and played the role of row-sorting the straw. Based on a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the material-bearing capacity limit of the SSM and the straw mulching quantity (SMQ) in the actual operating area, the critical parameters of the SSM and its value ranges were determined. The results show that the average straw removing rate (SRR) of the no-till planter with the SSRSD was 87.98%, and the passing capacity of the machine was great.

The current study contributes to the development of sustainable alternatives for the use of wastes and the production of biomolecules from algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aalgae 3aarabinose 3alight intensity 3alipid content 3aorganic carbon 3apentoses 3aphotoperiod 3apolyhydroxybutyrate 3aprotein synthesis 3awastes 3axylose 0aBiopolymer 0aChlorella 0aLuminosity 0aPhotoperiod 0aXylose1 aFreitas, B.C.B.1 aMorais, M.G.1 aCosta, J.A.V.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Oct., v. 265 p.456-463dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245017700212520114200389592002801531650002701559650002401586650001301610650001901623650001301642650001701655650001001672650001001682650001201692650002301704650001801727650001801745650001401763653001501777653003001792653001401822700002401836700001601860700001601876700001401892773014101906856008402047852000902131655001202140IND60679626220221120185623.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067962622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2019.1014052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevilla-Navarro, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2354-980010aSalmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis specific bacteriophages isolated form poultry faeces as a complementary tool for cleaning and disinfection against Salmonella  aSalmonellosis represents an important public health concern. Several authors point out the inefficiency of the cleaning and disinfection protocols to remove the bacteria from the field. For this reason, innovative techniques, as bacteriophages, could be implemented to control the bacteria. The main objectives of this study were to assess the effect of bacteriophages against Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis on farm surfaces, and to evaluate bacteriophage procedure application as sanitiser against Salmonella in field conditions. Thus, most prevalent serovars in poultry production were selected (Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis) to contaminate farm facilities. Then, two specific bacteriophages isolated from poultry faeces were applied against them. Results showed Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Enteritidis decreased of 4.55 log₁₀CFU/mL and 3.85 log₁₀CFU/mL, respectively; the maximum reduction in Salmonella was the 5ᵗʰ day, after 10⁸ PFU/mL and 10³ PFU/mL bacteriophage application. These results highlight bacteriophages as a promising tool together with cleaning and disinfection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Infantis 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acleaning 3adisinfection 3afarms 3afeces 3apoultry 3apoultry production 3apublic health 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 0aSalmonella 0aCleaning and disinfection 0aSanitiser1 aCatalá-Gregori, P.1 aGarcía, C.1 aCortés, V.1 aMarin, C.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2020 Feb., v. 68 p.101405-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2019.1014053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008100174520171200255592002801967650001701995650002702012650001502039650001702054650001202071650001702083650001102100651001202111653002402123653002202147653002602169653002502195700001902220700005802239700002002297773012002317856008802437852000902525655001202534IND60730111220221119110353.0210918e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073011122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1055152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicuno, Caterina10aFlows of post-consumer plastic packaging in Germany: An MFA-aided case study  aThis study aims at defining the current state-of-affairs of the German post-consumer plastic packaging (PCPP) sector. By the use of the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) tool, a comprehensive investigation of the currently available PCPP waste collection and treatment system is conducted, which enables understanding the intrinsic inefficiencies of the waste value chain. The analysis utilises primary data (by conducting manual sorting activities) as well as secondary data (literature-based). Sorting has been performed taking into consideration the plastic packaging applications and material composition, polymer types, and moisture and dirt.Results show that the per capita generation of PCPP waste is 26.3 kg ± 3.0% in the year 2017 in Germany. The separate collection efficiency is 74.8% ± 2.9%, considering all separate collection systems (i.e. deposit system for PET bottles and Dual System). The study confirms that most of the material losses occur at the sorting stage mostly as a result of the complex packaging designs, where a combination of different materials is common practise. Overall, the net material recycling rate is 26.4% ± 1.3%, calculated on the basis of the net generated waste and excluding the potential recycling of the mixed polyolefin stream. If recycled material from mixed polyolefins is included, this figure increases to 37.8% ± 2.0%.The maximisation of the PCPP re-circulation potential requires collaborative policies addressing all the stakeholders in the value chain, starting from producers (product design), followed by the consumer (responsible and correct disposal), then the sorting facilities (by utilising state-of-the-art technologies and targeted sorting).  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3amaterial flow analysis 3apolyolefin 3astakeholders 3astreams 3asupply chain 3awastes 3aGermany 0aPost-consumer waste 0aPlastic packaging 0aPlastic waste sorting 0aMechanical recycling1 aAlassali, Ayah1 aChong, Zhi Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2506-00291 aKuchta, Kerstin0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 June, v. 169 p.105515-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1055153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012900170300001600299520153800315592002801853650002601881650001301907650002001920650000901940650002101949650002301970650002201993650002102015650002702036650002602063650002102089650001302110650002602123650001902149650001502168650001702183650002102200650002202221650002002243650001702263650002502280653001902305653002102324653002202345653001802367700002502385700002202410700001902432773011302451856008302564852000902647655001202656IND60526282920221120131605.0190403e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToureiro, Célia10aIrrigation management with remote sensing: Evaluating irrigation requirement for maize under Mediterranean climate condition  ap. 211-220.  aWater use control methods and water resources planning are of high priority. In irrigated agriculture, the right way to save water is to increase water use efficiency through better management. The present work validates procedures and methodologies using remote sensing to determine the water availability in the soil at each moment, giving the opportunity for the application of the water depth strictly necessary to optimise crop growth (optimum irrigation timing and irrigation amount). The analysis is applied to the Irrigation District of Divor, Évora, using 7 experimental plots, which are areas irrigated by centre-pivot systems, cultivated to maize. Data were determined from images of the cultivated surface obtained by satellite and integrated with atmosphere and crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress in the vegetation—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kc, and Kcb. Therefore, evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated and used to calculate crop water requirement, together with the opportunity and the amount of irrigation water to allocate. Although remote sensing data available from satellite imagery presented some practical constraints, the study could contribute to the validation of a new methodology that can be used for irrigation management of a large irrigated area, easier and at lower costs than the traditional FAO recommended crop coefficients method. The remote sensing based methodology can also contribute to significant saves of irrigation water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aZea mays 3acontrol methods 3acorn 3acrop coefficient 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3airrigation requirement 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aplanning 3aplant available water 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3avegetation index 3awater requirement 3awater resources 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aRemote sensing 0aVegetation Index 0aCrop coefficients 0aWater balance1 aSerralheiro, Ricardo1 aShahidian, Shakib1 aSousa, Adélia0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Apr., v. 184 p.211-220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009700175300001800272520068700290592002800977650001501005650002701020650001301047650001101060650001101071650001301082650001301095700002101108700002601129700002001155700002301175773010801198856008801306990002301394852000901417655001201426IND60096174320221119093304.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHocepied, Gatien10aEarly detection of epileptic seizures based on parameter identification of neural mass model  ap. 1773-1782.  aPhysiologically based models are attractive for seizure detection, as their parameters can be explicitly related to neurological mechanisms.

For this reason, numerous water temperature models have been developed in recent years. In this paper, a k‐nearest neighbour model (KNN) is proposed and validated to simulate and eventually produce a one‐day forecast of mean water temperature on the Moisie River, a watercourse with an important salmon population in eastern Canada. Numerous KNN model configurations were compared by selecting different attributes and testing different weight combinations for neighbours. It was found that the best model uses attributes that include water temperature from the two previous days and an indicator of seasonality (day of the year) to select nearest neighbours. Three neighbours were used to calculate the estimated temperature, and the weighting combination that yielded the best results was an equal weight on all three nearest neighbours. This nonparametric model provided lower Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE = 1·57 °C), Higher Nash coefficient (NTD = 0·93) and lower Relative Bias (RB = − 1·5%) than a nonlinear regression model (RMSE = 2·45 °C, NTD = 0·83, RB = − 3%). The k‐nearest neighbour model appears to be a promising tool to simulate of forecast water temperature where long time series are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrochemistry 3anonlinear models 3ariver water 3arivers 3asalmon 3astreams 3atime series analysis 3awater temperature 3aCanada1 aOuarda, Taha B.

In Brazil, charcoal production can be a complementary climate change mitigation alternative to recycling. This study has assessed CO₂ abatement potentials and costs in a low-carbon (LC) scenario for the Brazilian steel industry based on two circular bioeconomy-based options. For this purpose, Brazilian steel production was forecasted up to 2050 through an econometric model. The technical amount of scrap and the economic feasibility of charcoal have been estimated to determine the penetration of LC strategies. In addition, an uncertainty analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo method. For the median value in the simulation, we found that crude steel production will emit 64 MtCO₂ in 2050. A recycling share of 36% of the total steel production could reduce these emissions by 20%, and 86% of the remaining blast furnace production could be based on charcoal, improving the total abatement by 65%. The weighted average cost of the LC scenario is -$1/tCO₂ for the median value in the simulation, but positive values have been found in 45% of the simulations. Charcoal presents higher abatement costs but less uncertainty than recycling. Such strategies can significantly reduce Brazilian steelmaking emissions, postponing other emerging or more expensive alternatives. Nevertheless, economic policies are needed due to additional costs of charcoal, in conjunction with law enforcement to ensure sustainable charcoal production, and regulations are needed to improve logistics and scrap market disparities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abioeconomics 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acharcoal 3acircular economy 3aclimate change 3aeconomic feasibility 3afurnaces 3aindustry 3alaw enforcement 3amarkets 3asteel 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3aBrazil 0aSteel circularity 0aLow carbon scenario 0aMarginal abatement costs 0aSteel recycling 0aCharcoal-fueled blast furnace1 aPacca, Sérgio A.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 June, v. 169 p.105517-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1055173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010700160300001200267520184700279592002802126596002102154596002102175596003202196596005802228596002502286596002902311596003402340650001602374650002102390650001002411650001102421650002202432650001802454650002902472700002402501700002002525700002102545700003002566700002302596700001702619700002902636700002202665700005602687773014702743856008302890852000902973655001202982IND60786039720221118224448.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078603972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04497-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Li10aMyocardin regulates exon usage in smooth muscle cells through induction of splicing regulatory factors  ap. 459.  aDifferentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) depends on serum response factor (SRF) and its co-activator myocardin (MYOCD). The role of MYOCD for the SMC program of gene transcription is well established. In contrast, the role of MYOCD in control of SMC-specific alternative exon usage, including exon splicing, has not been explored. In the current work we identified four splicing factors (MBNL1, RBPMS, RBPMS2, and RBFOX2) that correlate with MYOCD across human SMC tissues. Forced expression of MYOCD family members in human coronary artery SMCs in vitro upregulated expression of these splicing factors. For global profiling of transcript diversity, we performed RNA-sequencing after MYOCD transduction. We analyzed alternative transcripts with three different methods. Exon-based analysis identified 1637 features with differential exon usage. For example, usage of 3´ exons in MYLK that encode telokin increased relative to 5´ exons, as did the 17 kDa telokin to 130 kDa MYLK protein ratio. Dedicated event-based analysis identified 239 MYOCD-driven splicing events. Events involving MBNL1, MCAM, and ACTN1 were among the most prominent, and this was confirmed using variant-specific PCR analyses. In support of a role for RBPMS and RBFOX2 in MYOCD-driven splicing we found enrichment of their binding motifs around differentially spliced exons. Moreover, knockdown of either RBPMS or RBFOX2 antagonized splicing events stimulated by MYOCD, including those involving ACTN1, VCL, and MBNL1. Supporting an in vivo role of MYOCD-SRF-driven splicing, we demonstrate altered Rbpms expression and splicing in inducible and SMC-specific Srf knockout mice. We conclude that MYOCD-SRF, in part via RBPMS and RBFOX2, induce a program of differential exon usage and alternative splicing as part of the broader program of SMC differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020–00908cVR  a2018–02635cVR  a20200222cHjärt-Lungfonden  aF 2022/207cKungliga Fysiografiska Sällskapet i Lund  aR01 HL142971-A1cNIH  aBX004443cVA MERIT award  a209368/Z/17/ZcWellcome Trust 3ablood serum 3acoronary vessels 3aexons 3ahumans 3asequence analysis 3asmooth muscle 3atranscription (genetics)1 aKryvokhyzha, Dmytro1 aRippe, Catarina1 aJacob, Aishwarya1 aBorreguero-Muñoz, Andrea1 aStenkula, Karin G.1 aHansson, Ola1 aSmith, Christopher W.

Antral follicle count (AFC) and reproductive tract scores (RTS) can be used to estimate fertility in beef heifers, but the genetic mechanisms influencing variation in these measures are not well understood. Two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted to identify the significant loci associated with these traits. In total, 293 crossbred beef heifers were genotyped on the Bovine GGP 50K chip and genotypes were imputed to 836,121 markers. A GWAS was performed with the AFC phenotype for 217 heifers with a multi-locus mixed model, conducted using the year, age at time of sampling and principal component analysis groupings as the covariates. The RTS GWAS was performed with 289 heifers using an additive correlation/trend test comparing prepubertal to pubertal heifers. The loci on chromosomes 2, 3 and 23 were significant in the AFC GWAS and the loci on chromosomes 2, 8, 10 and 11 were significant in the RTS GWAS. The significant region on chromosome 2 was similar between both analyses. These regions contained genes associated with cell proliferation, transcription, apoptosis and development. This study proposes candidate genes for beef cattle fertility, although future research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3acell proliferation 3acrossbreds 3agenotyping 3aovarian follicles 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 3apuberty 3astatistical models1 aMurdoch, Gordon  K.1 aRowan, Troy  N.1 aDavenport, Kimberly M.,1 aBecker, Gabrielle  M.1 aHall, John B.,1 aMurdoch, Brenda  M.0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 02, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245008500168500001900253520110100272592002801373650001601401650003101417650001101448650001301459650002201472650002901494650001301523700002401536700002301560700002801583700002501611773011901636856007701755852000901832655001201841IND60729296820221117223230.0210228e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072929682DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTost, Amalie  Scheel14aThe PSY Peptide Family—Expression, Modification and Physiological Implications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSmall post-translationally modified peptides are gaining increasing attention as important signaling molecules in plant development. In the family of plant peptides containing tyrosine sulfation (PSYs), only PSY1 has been characterized at the mature level as an 18-amino-acid peptide, carrying one sulfated tyrosine, and involved in cell elongation. This review presents seven additional homologs in Arabidopsis all sharing high conservation in the active peptide domain, and it shows that PSY peptides are found in all higher plants and mosses. It is proposed that all eight PSY homologs are post-translationally modified to carry a sulfated tyrosine and that subtilisin-like subtilases (SBTs) are involved in the processing of PSY propeptides. The PSY peptides show differential expression patterns indicating that they serve several distinct functions in plant development. PSY peptides seem to be at least partly regulated at the transcriptional level, as their expression is greatly influenced by developmental factors. Finally, a model including a receptor in addition to PSY1R is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3agene expression regulation 3amodels 3apeptides 3aplant development 3atranscription (genetics) 3atyrosine1 aKristensen, Astrid 1 aOlsen, Lene  Irene1 aAxelsen, Kristian  Buhl1 aFuglsang, Anja  Thoe0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 02, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245008800205300001600293506007600309520168700385592002802072506003702100650001302137650001302150650001502163650001602178650001102194650001702205650001002222650001202232650001302244650001102257650001402268653002002282653001402302653001902316653001202335653002402347700001802371700001702389700002002406700001802426700002402444700002002468700001902488773009402507856007402601852000902675655001202684IND60117806220221207064621.0141126s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011780622DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0112doi7 aPMC39420242pmcid7 a244434192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakrzewski, Anne-C.10aEarly Divergence, Broad Distribution, and High Diversity of Animal Chitin Synthases  ap. 316-325.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEven though chitin is one of the most abundant biopolymers in nature, current knowledge on chitin formation is largely based only on data from fungi and insects. This study reveals unanticipated broad taxonomic distribution and extensive diversification of chitin synthases (CSs) in Metazoa, shedding new light on the relevance of chitin in animals and suggesting unforeseen complexity of chitin synthesis in many groups. We uncovered robust orthologs to insect type CSs in several representatives of deuterostomes, which generally are not thought to possess chitin. This suggests a broader distribution and function of chitin in this branch of the animal kingdom. We characterize a new CS type present not only in basal metazoans such as sponges and cnidarians but also in several bilaterian representatives. The most extensive diversification of CSs took place during emergence of lophotrochozoans, the third large group of protostomes next to arthropods and nematodes, resulting in coexistence of up to ten CS paralogs in molluscs. Independent fusion to different kinds of myosin motor domains in fungi and lophotrochozoans points toward high relevance of CS interaction with the cytoskeleton for fine-tuned chitin secretion. Given the fundamental role that chitin plays in the morphology of many animals, the here presented CS diversification reveals many evolutionary complexities. Our findings strongly suggest a very broad and multifarious occurrence of chitin and question an ancestral role as cuticular component. The molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of animal chitin synthesis are most likely far more complex and diverse than existing data from insects suggest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCnidaria 3aNematoda 3aarthropods 3abiopolymers 3achitin 3acytoskeleton 3afungi 3ainsects 3amolluscs 3amyosin 3asecretion 0achitin synthase 0aevolution 0aLophotrochozoa 0aMetazoa 0amyosin motor domain1 aWeigert, Anne1 aHelm, Conrad1 aAdamski, Marcin1 aAdamska, Maja1 aBleidorn, Christoph1 aRaible, Florian1 aHausen, Harald0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014, v. 6, no. 2 p.316-325dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001500183245011600198300001800314506007600332520135000408592002801758506003701786650002501823650002201848650001801870650002101888650002201909650001201931650001701943650001901960650001201979650002301991650002502014650005802039650004802097650002302145650004502168650005002213650002802263650003402291650003902325650002202364650001302386650004102399650003302440650004302473650003302516650003602549650002602585650006402611650003702675650002102712700002302733700001902756700001802775700002302793700002202816700002602838700002002864773010902884856008202993852000903075655001203084IND4468712020221207064750.0120502e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446871202DNAL7 a220284602pmid7 aPMC32291532pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.111.0890032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Youli10aUV-C–Irradiated Arabidopsis and Tobacco Emit Volatiles That Trigger Genomic Instability in Neighboring Plants  ap. 3842-3852.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have previously shown that local exposure of plants to stress results in a systemic increase in genome instability. Here, we show that UV-C–irradiated plants produce a volatile signal that triggers an increase in genome instability in neighboring nonirradiated Arabidopsis thaliana plants. This volatile signal is interspecific, as UV-C–irradiated Arabidopsis plants transmit genome destabilization to naive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants and vice versa. We report that plants exposed to the volatile hormones methyl salicylate (MeSA) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) exhibit a similar level of genome destabilization as UV-C–irradiated plants. We also found that irradiated Arabidopsis plants produce MeSA and MeJA. The analysis of mutants impaired in the synthesis and/or response to salicylic acid (SA) and/or jasmonic acid showed that at least one other volatile compound besides MeSA and MeJA can communicate interplant genome instability. The NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (npr1) mutant, defective in SA signaling, is impaired in both the production and the perception of the volatile signals, demonstrating a key role for NPR1 as a central regulator of genome stability. Finally, various forms of stress resulting in the formation of necrotic lesions also generate a volatile signal that leads to genomic instability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3ajasmonic acid 3amethyl jasmonate 3amethyl salicylate 3amutants 3aplant stress 3asalicylic acid 3atobacco 3avolatile compounds 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteins 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aGenomic Instabilityxgenetics 2aHomologous Recombinationxgenetics 2aMembrane Proteins 2aMutation 2aOxylipinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSalicylatesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aStress, Physiological 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effectsxvirology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxphysiology 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aDanna, Cristian H.1 aZemp, Franz J.1 aTitov, Viktor1 aCiftci, Ozan Nazim1 aPrzybylski, Roman1 aAusubel, Frederick M.1 aKovalchuk, Igor0 tplant cell.g2011 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.3842-3852dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.0890033Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013100170300001800301520100400319592002801323650001401351650002101365650001301386650001601399650002601415650001101441650002101452650002101473650001301494650001301507650001901520650001601539650001401555653002401569653002601593653003101619653002201650700001501672700002901687773013801716856005101854852000901905655001201914IND50076258420221121150921.0140410e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007625842DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.7016902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Amjad A.10aNitrate Dynamic in a Tropical Mollisol Amended with Organic Manures, Planted with Sweet Corn, and Monitored with SPAD Readings  ap. 2274-2288.  aTwo field experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of relative chlorophyll content (RCC) in sweet corn leaves as an indicator of nitrate concentration in soil.

The objective of this study was to compile some epidemiological features on equine piroplasmids from the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal wetland through the evaluation of the patterns of T. equi and B. caballi infections in different groups of horses; identification of the tick species that infest horses; and to study phylogenetic relationships among Theileria equi 18S rRNA gene sequences. During October 2015, blood and serum samples were collected from 170 horses in four different categories. Ticks, after identification, had their hemolymph and eggs examined for the presence of piroplasmid sporokinets. Also we searched parasites in the peripheral blood smears of the investigated horses. The number of red blood cells (RBCs) and the packed cell volume (PCV) ​​were determined to test for anemia in the infected animals, and exposure to B. caballi and T. equi was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. “Catch all primers” based on 18S rRNA gene were used in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to detect equine piroplasmids, followed by three nested PCRs for the phylogenetic analysis. The serological results showed that 61.8% and 52.9% of the horses sampled were exposed to T. equi and B. caballi, respectively. Piroplasmid DNA was detected in 43.5% of the horses analyzed. Our sequencing revealed 98–100% identity with some sequences previously published in GenBank for T. equi, and microheterogeneity among others. We found that 51.2% of the animals sampled were infested with Dermacentor nitens, Amblyomma sculptum, and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, singly or co-infested. Since positive and negative animals presented similar RBC and PCV values, and no sporokinets were found on blood smears, hemolymph and eggs of the ticks collected, we suggest that infected equines can act as asymptomatic carriers for piroplasmosis in the studied region. Our results together showed the enzootic characteristic of equine piroplasmids in Pantanal region highlighting the importance of using different methods for detection these parasites. Moreover, breeding mares and foals should be monitored since they displayed the greatest occurrences for molecular test (59.0% and 86.1% respectively) and tick infestations (87.2% and 63.9% respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma sculptum 3aAnocentor nitens 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aTheileria equi 3aanemia 3ababesiosis 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3acarrier state 3acattle 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3aenzootic diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aerythrocytes 3afoals 3agenes 3ahematocrit 3ahemolymph 3amares 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aranching 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atick infestations 3aticks 3awetlands 3aPantanal 0aBabesia caballi 0aPCR 0aELISA1 aAndré, Marcos R.1 aGonçalves, Luiz R.1 aFreschi, Carla R.1 aSantos, Filipe M.1 ade Oliveira, Carina E.1 aPiranda, Eliane M.1 ade Andrade, Gisele B.1 aMacedo, Gabriel C.1 aMachado, Rosangela Z.1 aHerrera, Heitor M.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2019 Apr., v. 10, no. 3 p.714-721dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245015400184300001600338500001500354520169000369592002802059650002602087650001802113650000902131650002202140650001302162650001602175650002302191650000902214650003002223650002002253650001402273650002902287650001502316650002002331650001402351650001602365650001602381650001102397650001102408650004002419650003002459650002102489650002802510650006502538650003202603650002002635650006402655653001502719653002402734700002102758700001802779773008502797856004802882852000902930655001202939IND4476609320221116140857.0120308e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447660932DNAL7 a216955772pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-011-0392-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvelin, Heikham10aContribution of Glomus intraradices inoculation to nutrient acquisition and mitigation of ionic imbalance in NaCl-stressed Trigonella foenum-graecum   ap. 203-217.  a2019-12-05  aThe study aimed to investigate the effects of an AM fungus (Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith) on mineral acquisition in fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) plants under different levels of salinity. Mycorrhizal (M) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) fenugreek plants were subjected to four levels of NaCl salinity (0, 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl). Plant tissues were analyzed for different mineral nutrients. Leaf senescence (chlorophyll concentration and membrane permeability) and lipid peroxidation were also assessed. Under salt stress, M plants showed better growth, lower leaf senescence, and decreased lipid peroxidation as compared to NM plants. Salt stress adversely affected root nodulation and uptake of NPK. This effect was attenuated in mycorrhizal plants. Presence of the AM fungus prevented excess uptake of Na+ with increase in NaCl in the soil. It also imparted a regulatory effect on the translocation of Na+ ions to shoots thereby maintaining lower Na+ shoot:root ratios as compared to NM plants. Mycorrhizal colonization helped the host plant to overcome Na+-induced Ca2+ and K+ deficiencies. M plants maintained favorable K+:Na+, Ca2+:Na+, and Ca2+:Mg2+ ratios in their tissues. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Zn2+ decreased with increase in intensity of salinity stress. However, at each NaCl level, M plants had higher concentration of Cu, Fe, Mn2+, and Zn2+ as compared to NM plants. M plants showed reduced electrolyte leakage in leaves as compared to NM plants. The study suggests that AM fungi contribute to alleviation of salt stress by mitigation of NaCl-induced ionic imbalance thus maintaining a favorable nutrient profile and integrity of the plasma membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3amembrane permeability 3aplant tissues 3aions 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asalinity 3ahost plants 3alipid peroxidation 3asoil 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3asodium chloride 3afenugreek 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3anodulation 3aplasma membrane 3anutrients 3achlorophyll 3asalt stress 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aAgricultural Inoculantsxphysiology 2aGlomeromycotaxphysiology 2aIonsxmetabolism 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTrigonellaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 0asenescence 0aGlomus intraradices1 aGiri, Bhoopander1 aKapoor, Rupam0 tMycorrhiza.g2012 Apr., v. 22, no. 3 p.203-217dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-011-0392-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006600152245010800218520231300326592002802639650002102667650002002688650001102708650001602719650001602735650002102751650002002772650001302792650001102805650001502816650001202831650001202843650002302855650001302878650001402891650002102905653002002926653001602946653000902962653002202971653003302993653002603026700005803052773011703110856008703227852000903314655001203323IND60694898320221121174451.0200607e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069489832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2020.1050092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahamtani, Fernanda M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4439-973314aThe effect of qualitative feed restriction in broiler breeder pullets on fear and motivation to explore  aRestrictively fed broiler breeders are known to have increased motivation to explore and reduced fearfulness because hunger increases the motivation to search for and to acquire food, forcing the birds to face and engage with aversive stimuli that they would otherwise avoid. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of four dietary treatments on the level of fear and motivation to explore during rearing. In total, 1200 female breeder chicks of the genotype Ross 308 were housed in 24 pens, six pens of 50 birds per treatment. The treatments were: 1) standard feed (Control), 2) feed containing insoluble fibres (Insoluble), 3) feed containing a mix of both insoluble and soluble fibres (Mixed) and 4) standard feed supplemented with maize silage (Roughage). The treatments followed a qualitative restriction feeding strategy meant to allow the birds to consume larger portions of feed, increasing feeding time and reducing hunger and frustration. A novel object (NO) test was performed in the home pens at 6, 13 and 18 weeks of age. The test was performed two times at each age: 1 h before feeding and 5 h after feeding. In addition, at 7 weeks of age, 12 birds from each pen from all treatment groups were subjected to a tonic immobility (TI) test. We hypothesised that the Control birds would be less fearful in the TI test and keep a shorter distance to the NO than the treatment birds. For the NO test, there was an effect of the interaction between treatment and time of day on the likelihood of the birds to approach the NO at all ages (P ≤ 0.0001). At 13 weeks of age, in the afternoon, birds from the Mixed treatment were more likely to approach the NO compared to the birds from the Insoluble and Roughage treatments (P = 0.003) and tended to be more likely to approach than Control birds (P = 0.009). This suggests that the Mixed birds were in a hungrier state at that moment and therefore more willing to approach a NO than the birds fed the other dietary treatments. There was no effect of treatment on the latency to touch the NO or on the TI test. The results show minimal effects of the three qualitative dietary treatments on fearfulness and motivation to explore in female broiler breeders during rearing and, therefore, do not provide evidence of decreased sensation of hunger.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler breeders 3abroiler feeding 3achicks 3acorn silage 3afearfulness 3afeed supplements 3afeeding methods 3agenotype 3ahunger 3amotivation 3apullets 3arearing 3arestricted feeding 3aroughage 3asensation 3atonic immobility 0aBroiler breeder 0aExploration 0aFear 0aNovel object test 0aQualitative feed restriction 0aTonic immobility test1 aRiber, Anja B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8644-34560 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2020 July, v. 228 p.105009-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2020.1050093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245014900201300001600350506007600366520134200442592002801784506003701812650001501849650001801864650001301882650000801895650002001903650002301923650002101946650001801967650001001985650001701995650002502012650002502037650001402062653001402076653002102090653001502111653001802126700002002144700002002164700002002184700002202204700002302226700002302249700002102272700002202293700001802315773009402333856007402427852000902501655001202510IND60117806620221207070849.0141126s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011780662DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0152doi7 aPMC39420252pmcid7 a244489822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamikawa, Ryoma10aGene Content Evolution in Discobid Mitochondria Deduced from the Phylogenetic Position and Complete Mitochondrial Genome of Tsukubamonas globosa  ap. 306-315.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe unicellular eukaryotic assemblage Discoba (Excavata) comprises four lineages: the Heterolobosea, Euglenozoa, Jakobida, and Tsukubamonadida. Discoba has been considered as a key assemblage for understanding the early evolution of mitochondrial (mt) genomes, as jakobids retain the most gene-rich (i.e., primitive) genomes compared with any other eukaryotes determined to date. However, to date, mt genome sequences have been completed for only a few groups within Discoba, including jakobids, two closely related heteroloboseans, and kinetoplastid euglenozoans. The Tsukubamonadida is the least studied lineage, as the order was only recently established with the description of a sole representative species, Tsukubamonas globosa. The evolutionary relationship between T. globosa and other discobids has yet to be resolved, and no mt genome data are available for this particular organism. Here, we use a “phylogenomic” approach to resolve the relationship between T. globosa, heteroloboseans, euglenozoans, and jakobids. In addition, we have characterized the mt genome of T. globosa (48,463 bp in length), which encodes 52 putative protein-coding and 29 RNA genes. By mapping the gene repertoires of discobid mt genomes onto the well-resolved Discoba tree, we model gene loss events during the evolution of discobid mt genomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuglenozoa 3aHeterolobosea 3aJakobida 3aRNA 3aTsukubamonadida 3achromosome mapping 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene deletion 3agenes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 0agene loss 0agenome reduction 0aorganelles 0aphylogenomics1 aKolisko, Martin1 aNishimura, Yuki1 aYabuki, Akinori1 aBrown, Matthew W.1 aIshikawa, Sohta A.1 aIshida, Ken-ichiro1 aRoger, Andrew J.1 aHashimoto, Tetsuo1 aInagaki, Yuji0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014, v. 6, no. 2 p.306-315dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245009900157300001400256520185500270592002802125650001302153650001402166650001502180650001402195650001402209650001302223650001302236650001602249650001402265650001202279650002702291650002102318650002802339650001602367650001402383650002602397650000902423650001802432650001202450650001902462650001402481650001202495653003102507653001502538653001402553653002302567653002302590653003302613653001402646653002702660700001402687700002102701773010002722856007102822852000902893655001202902IND60629615220221119091335.0190131s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961522DNAL7 a10.1071/SR173002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElephant, D. E.10aAccounting for potassium reserves and fixation in developing sugarcane fertiliser requirements  ap. 66-74.  aKnowledge gaps exist in the literature regarding inclusion of reserve-potassium (K) and K fixation when formulating K fertiliser requirements for sugarcane. This study investigated the levels of reserve-K and K fixation in the soils of the South African sugar industry, as well as their potential impacts on K requirements for crop growth. The investigation involved 113 topsoil (0–20cm) samples, which included Acrisols, Arenosols, Ferralsols, Fluvisols, Leptosols, Luvisols, Nitisols, Plinthisols, and Vertisols. The release of K from the non-exchangeable reserves was measured using 1.0M boiling HNO3 minus exchangeable K, and was termed reserve-K. The capacity of the soil to fix added K was estimated through medium-term incubations and termed the K requirement factor (KRF, the amount of fertiliser K required to raise exchangeable K by a single unit). Both reserve-K and KRF varied widely across all soils and within soil types. Furthermore, there were also wide variations in the relationship between reserve-K and K fixation capacity. Soils were grouped according to their varying levels of reserve-K and K fixation, with a view to improve the reliability of fertiliser K recommendations. Soils with a combination of high to very high reserve-K and low K fixation capacity are of particular concern because of the risk of luxury uptake of K resulting in reduced sucrose recovery, whereas soils with low to medium reserve-K and high K fixation may maintain inadequate supplies of K for crop growth. In this study, the introduction of reserve-K and KRF in fertiliser K recommendations resulted in significant reductions in average K requirements across all soils. These findings point to a need to re-evaluate the basis upon which K soil testing is conducted, as well as current approaches to the development of fertiliser K recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrisols 3aArenosols 3aFerralsols 3aFluvisols 3aLeptosols 3aLuvisols 3aNitisols 3aPlinthosols 3aVertisols 3aboiling 3aexchangeable potassium 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizer requirements 3anitric acid 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3arisk 3asoil analysis 3asucrose 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3atopsoil 0afertiliser recommendations 0aK fixation 0aK testing 0apotassium dynamics 0apotassium fixation 0apotassium requirement factor 0areserve-K 0asoil potassium testing1 aMiles, N.1 aMuchaonyerwa, P.0 tSoil research.g2019, v. 57, no. 1 p.66-74dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44751x1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR173003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03854naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018900170300001300359520226400372592002802636650000902664650001102673650001302684650001002697650001602707650001202723650001202735650001002747650001202757650002702769650001202796650002502808650001002833650001102843650001602854650001702870650002702887650001002914650001402924651001002938651002102948651001702969700001902986700001803005700002203023700002003045700001503065700002103080773010403101856008603205852000903291655001203300IND60087518020221120134345.0141102e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008751802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2011.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaik, In Sung10aLeaf beds in the Early Miocene lacustrine deposits of the Geumgwangdong Formation, Korea: Occurrence, plant–insect interaction records, taphonomy and palaeoenvironmental implications  ap. 1-14.  aOccurrence, preservation and evidence of plant–insect interactions in the leaf deposits of the early Miocene Geumgwangdong Formation are described, and the taphonomy and palaeoenvironmental implications are interpreted. The Geumgwangdong leaf beds are tuffaceous lacustrine deposits consisting mainly of thin-bedded sediments, including shale. Deposition was dominated through the vertical aggradation of fine-grained sediments by suspension sedimentation, rather than by the fluvial deposition of coarse-grained sediments. The majority of the fossil leaves were preserved by compression rather than merely preserved as impressions. The Geumgwangdong leaf deposits can be characterised as a wind-transported, dysaerobic, deep-water, lake taphofacies with some influence of water-transport. The fossil flora of the Geumgwandong Formation consists of 64 taxa belonging to 27 families and 43 genera. The dominant taxa were Metasequoia, Fagus, Betula, Quercus, Acer, Zelkova, and Leguminosae, which is comparable to the Early Miocene cool–temperate Aniai-type Flora of north-east Japan. The similarity between the lake settings of the Geumgwangdong Formation and the Aniai Coal-bearing Formation might have been a factor in the development of similar plant–fossil assemblages. Although traces of insect damage in the fossil leaves of the Geumgwangdong Formation were commonly observed, more than 90% of the damaged leaves showed a low level of diversity and degree of insect damage (<10%), which is indicative of a cool–temperate palaeoclimatic condition. Despite latitudinal differences and geographic separation, the development of similar floras in the Geumgwangdong Formation of south-east Korea and the Aniai Coal-bearing Formation of north-east Japan during the early Miocene could have been influenced by the incipient NW–SE sea-floor spreading that resulted in the opening of the East Sea (Sea of Japan), which might have enabled floral migration between the two regions. This study provides useful data for understanding not only the taphonomy and palaeoenviroments of the leaf deposits, but also the spatial development of the flora resulting from palaeogeographic changes driven by tectonic movement during the early Miocene in Far East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aBetula 3aFabaceae 3aFagus 3aMetasequoia 3aQuercus 3aZelkova 3aflora 3afossils 3ageographical variation 3ainsects 3alacustrine sediments 3alakes 3aleaves 3apaleobotany 3aplant damage 3aplant-insect relations 3ashale 3atectonics 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aSea of Japan1 aKim, Hyun-Joo,1 aKim, Kyungsik1 aJeong, Eun-Kyoung1 aKang, Hee Cheol1 aLee, Ho Il1 aUemura, Kazuhiko0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 170 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009800205300001600303500001100319520128400330592002801614596011101642596010701753650002401860650002001884650001201904650002201916650002101938650001201959650002201971650003501993650002102028650002502049650002202074651001102096700006002107700006202167773010302229856008302332852000902415655001202424IND60767413320221120205724.0220216e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076741332DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-021-01615-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiebel, Malin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3149-208210aConservation perspectives of small-scale private forest owners in Europe: A systematic review  ap. 836-848.  aReview  aPrivate forest owners are the main forest ownership group within Europe, and important conservation values have been found on their land. Yet, small plot sizes, societal heterogeneity, and structural changes impede developing and implementing effective conservation programs in private forests. We present a systematic literature review focusing on small-scale private forest owners and their perspectives on nature conservation by synthesizing research approaches, social-ecological drivers, and policy recommendations. Conservation perspectives were positively related to female gender, higher levels of education, formalized forest management, an active relation to the forest, and ecological values of the property. In contrast, high age, rural orientation, economic forest management factors, large parcel size, and economic and sentimental property values negatively influenced conservation perspectives. Applying a natural resource conflict management framework, we synthesized recommendations covering three dimensions: substance, procedure, relationship. Considering perspectives of small-scale private forest owners in current forestry decision-making has great potential to strengthen sustainable forest management that integrates nature conservation and resource use.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKZ 22001218cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft via Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe  a22023218cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft via Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe 3aconflict management 3adecision making 3afemales 3aforest management 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3anatural resources conservation 3aprivate forestry 3asustainable forestry 3asystematic review 3aEurope1 aMölder, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2842-80441 aPlieninger, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1478-25870 tAmbio.g2022 Apr., v. 51, no. 4 p.836-848dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01615-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245014100158300001400299520185000313592002802163650001802191650003102209650001602240650001302256650002802269650001802297650002402315650001502339650001302354650001202367650003102379650001102410650002002421650002202441650002102463650002002484650001502504650003102519650001402550650001602564650000902580650002102589650003302610651001002643653001202653653001302665653001502678653001902693653001902712653004802731700002402779700002802803700001702831700003202848773010002880856007102980852000903051655001203060IND60629615420221119091402.0190131s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961542DNAL7 a10.1071/SR180962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuchane, Mary N.10aImpact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and earthworms on soil aggregate stability, glomalin, and performance of pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan  ap. 53-65.  aEarthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) modify soil physical and chemical properties. However, little is known about how their interactions affect water-stable aggregation, glomalin and crop performance. A greenhouse experiment was run for 9 months to test the effects of earthworms (endogeic, Pontoscolex corethrurus; and epigeic, Dichogaster bolaui) and AMF (none, Glomus etunicatum and Scutellospora verrucosa) on water-stable aggregation, glomalin levels in aggregate size classes and crop performance. The test crop was pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.). The soil material used for the experiment was a humic nitisol from central Kenya mixed with sand (ratio 1:1). Grass residue (equivalent to 20tha-1) was placed on top. The AMF root colonisation and external hyphal length, water-stable macroaggregates and microaggregates, total and easily-extractable glomalin in aggregate size classes, plant biomass and plant N and P uptake were measured. Earthworms were a major source of variation for soil aggregation, glomalin content and crop performance. The epigeic earthworms (D. bolaui) increased the amount of water-stable macroaggregates (by 10%) and glomalin in microaggregates and improved crop (growth and biomass) performance. The endogeic earthworms (P. corethrurus) reduced external hyphal length, root colonisation and crop performance but had no effect on water-stable aggregates and glomalin levels in in aggregate size classes. A significant AMF×earthworm interaction was observed for plant biomass and concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The AMF species together with epigeic earthworms increased plant biomass and N and P concentrations. Our results contribute to the understanding of interactions between AMF and earthworms in relation to soil aggregation, plant productivity and nutrient uptake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aClaroideoglomus etunicatum 3aDichogaster 3aNitisols 3aPontoscolex corethrurus 3aScutellospora 3aaggregate stability 3aearthworms 3aglomalin 3agrasses 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahyphae 3amicroaggregates 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytomass 3apigeon peas 3asand 3asoil aggregation 3awater stable soil aggregates 3aKenya 0aepigeic 0aendogeic 0asoil biota 0asoil fertility 0asoil structure 0aintegrated soil fertility management (ISFM)1 aPulleman, Mirjam M.1 aVanlauwe, B.q(Bernard)1 aJefwa, Joyce1 aKuyper, Th.

High Resolution Melting (HRM) curve profiles and sequencing analysis (V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) were used respectively for the differentiation and identification of the collected isolates from six time intervals (day 0, 4, 8, 12, 14 and 16) while fish were stored in ice. HRM analysis differentiated the unknown microbiota in ten groups (208 isolates) and in two single isolates based on their HRM curve profiles. The isolates with HRM profiles which were >91% similar within each group were found to belong to the same species using sequencing analysis. Thus, the ten groups consist of representatives of Psychrobacter glacincola, Ps. alimentarius, Ps. cryohalolentis, Ps. maritimus, Ps. fozii, Pseudomonas sp., Paeniglutamicibacter sp., Carnobacterium sp., Leucobacter aridicolis and Bacillus thuringiensis. Based on this approach, Ps. cryohalolentis was found to be the most dominant phylotype at the beginning of fish shelf-life compared to other species. The abundance of this bacterium decreased throughout storage, while Ps. glacincola increased and dominated at the time of the sensory minimum acceptability (day 14) and rejection (day 16). To conclude, HRM could be used for the rapid determination of sea bass microbiota, using the representatives of each group as reference bacterial strains, in order for scientists to solve rapidly stakeholders problems related with microbial quality or safety of fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCarnobacterium 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aLeucobacter 3aPseudomonas 3aPsychrobacter glacincola 3aPsychrobacter maritimus 3aaquaculture 3abass 3acold storage 3aice 3amelting 3amicrobiological quality 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylotype 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ashelf life 3astakeholders 0aFish 0aSea bass 0aAquaculture 0aHRM 0aSSOs 0aMicrobiota 0aSpoilage1 aParlapani, Foteini F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3905-58561 aBosmali, Irene1 aMadesis, Panagiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1447-35141 aBoziaris, Ioannis S.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Aug. 16, v. 327 p.108658-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1086583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170300001600290520131900306592002801625650002301653650001501676650002401691650001201715650001201727650001101739650001201750650001601762650001401778650000901792650002001801651001401821700002701835700001901862700002101881773008901902856008601991990002302077852000902100655001202109IND60092023520221120072141.0141103e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea, Erica10aThermal comfort in forested urban canyons of low building density. An assessment for the city of Mendoza, Argentina  ap. 219-230.  aThis research has established the degree of comfort achieved in road channels of Mendoza Metropolitan Area (AMM), in Argentina. They present different widths (16 m, 20 m and 30 m) with low building density and they are forested with First (Platanus acerifolia) and Second (Morus alba and Fraxinus excelsior) Magnitude species. The methodology is based on the selection of cases, the experimental observation and the assessment of thermal comfort condition by applying the COMFA method. The energy budget evaluation shows that the road channels forested with Platanus acerifolia -whose green structure is characterized for continuous tunnel over street and sidewalk-, has the best behavior. Nevertheless taking into account the urban problems of the city under study, it is necessary to settle the comfort conditions with the possibility of nocturnal cooling. During the daytime the solar radiation control is a key to getting comfort conditions. During the nighttime, sky vision is needed for radiative cooling. In addition, the forest structure combined with the urban morphology increase soil roughness and reduces the convective cooling. Therefore it is necessary to encourage those combinations of forest structure and urban morphologies that benefit both processes in order to reduce the urban heat island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aMorus alba 3aPlatanus acerifolia 3acanyons 3acooling 3aenergy 3aforests 3aheat island 3aroughness 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3aArgentina1 aRuiz, María Angélica1 aCanton, Alicia1 aLesino, Graciela0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Dec., v. 58 p.219-230dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009400170520124100264592002801505650001301533650002201546650001001568650001401578650001401592650002601606650002601632650001201658650001501670650001301685650001301698650001101711650001701722650001101739650001701750700002001767700002301787700002001810773012201830856008001952852000902032655001202041IND60707768420221116210704.0200821e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070776842DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100811062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarzecka, Krystyna 10aTotal and True Protein Content in Potato Tubers Depending on Herbicides and Biostimulants  aThe aim of the study was to determine the effect of herbicides and herbicides used with biostimulants on the content of total and true protein in potato tubers. The three-year field experiment was carried out using the random two-way split-plot arrangement in three repetitions. The examined factors were: I—three cultivars of potato: Bartek, Gawin, Honorata; II—five method applications of herbicides and herbicides with biostimulants: 1. Control—mechanical weeding, 2.

Sencor 70 WG + Asahi SL (metribuzin and sodium p-nitrophenolate, sodium o-nitrophenolate, sodium 5-nitroguolacolate). On the plots sprayed with herbicides and herbicides mixed with biostimulants, a significant increase in the content of total and true proteins and the share of true protein in total protein in relation to tubers harvested from the control object was found. Genetic features of cultivars determined the content of total and true protein in potato tubers. The highest total and true protein was accumulated by tubers of the Bartek cultivar, and the least by the Honorata cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalgae 3aclomazone 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3aherbicide application 3alinuron 3ametribuzin 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3asodium 3atrue protein 3atubers 3aweed control1 aGugała, Marek 1 aMystkowska, Iwona 1 aSikorska, Anna 0 tAgronomy.g2020 July 30, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100811063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014100164300001200305500001900317520158800336592002801924596007001952596009302022650001902115650001702134650001702151650001102168650002302179650001202202650001002214650001102224650002702235650001502262650001302277650001702290650002002307650000902327700001702336700001602353700001602369700001802385700001602403700001602419700005502435700005502490773011002545856008302655852000902738655001202747IND60736045320221122035931.0210514e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073604532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-021-03618-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenwen10aGenome-wide identification of B-box proteins and VvBBX44 involved in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in grape (Vitis vinifera L.)  ap. 114.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Genome-wide identification, analysis and functional characterization of an unreported VvBBX gene showed a response to light and positive correlation with anthocyanin content, but also inhibition of light-induced anthocyanin synthesis. B-box (BBX) proteins are a class of zinc (Zn) finger transcription factors or regulators characterized by the presence of one or two BBX domains and play important roles in plant growth and development. However, the BBX genes' potential functions are insufficiently characterized in grape, a globally popular berry with high economic value. Here, 25 BBX family genes including a novel member (assigned VvBBX44) were identified genome widely in grape. The expression level of these VvBBXs were analyzed in ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ (V. vinifera) stem, flower, leaf, tendril, petiole, and developing berries. The expression of VvBBX44 increased in developing ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ berries. Its expression was inhibited in ‘Jingxiu’ and ‘Muscat Hamburg’ berry skin without sunlight. Furthermore, overexpression of VvBBX44 decreased the expression of LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (VvHY5) and UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (VvUFGT), and reduced the anthocyanin content in grape calli. Our results suggest that VvBBX44 may play an important role in grape berry coloring by directly repressing VvHY5 expression. This study provides new insights into the potential role of VvBBXs in berry development and light response and contributes to the understanding on the regulation mechanism of VvBBX44 in anthocyanin biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000200cKey Technologies Research and Development Program  a151111KYSB20170032cBureau of International Cooperation, The Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acallus 3aeconomic valuation 3aflowers 3agenes 3agrapes 3agrowth and development 3ahypocotyls 3apetioles 3aplant growth 3asolar radiation 3azinc1 aTang, Renkun1 aZhang, Yuyu1 aLiu, Xianju1 aGao, Yingying1 aDai, Zhanwu1 aLi, Shaohua1 aWu, Benhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6798-59031 aWang, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5973-60530 tPlanta.g2021 May, v. 253, no. 5 p.114-114dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-021-03618-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245011600202300001600318500001500334506007600349520179200425592002802217506003702245650001402282650001102296650001402307650002302321650002002344650000902364650001202373650001302385653001502398653001202413653001602425653001202441653001002453653001102463653002502474700002102499700001602520700001902536700002502555773009402580856007402674852000902748655001202757IND60117807020221207065527.0141126s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011780702DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0192doi7 aPMC39420322pmcid7 a244825332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeumann, Lisa C.14aThe Imprinted NPAP1 Gene in the Prader–Willi Syndrome Region Belongs to a POM121-Related Family of Retrogenes  ap. 344-351.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have recently shown that the human Nuclear pore-associated protein (NPAP1)/C15orf2 gene encodes a nuclear pore-associated protein. This gene is one of several paternally expressed imprinted genes in the genomic region 15q11q13. Because the Prader–Willi syndrome is known to be caused by the loss of function of paternally expressed genes in 15q11q13, a phenotypic contribution of NPAP1 cannot be excluded. NPAP1 appears to be under strong positive Darwinian selection in primates, suggesting an important function in primate biology. Interestingly, however, in contrast to all other protein-coding genes in 15q11q13, NPAP1 has no ortholog in the mouse. Our investigation of the evolutionary origin of NPAP1 showed that the gene is specific to primate species and absent from the 15q11q13-orthologous regions in all nonprimate mammals. However, we identified a group of paralogous genes, which we call NPAP1L, in all placental mammals except rodents. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NPAP1, NPAP1L, and another group of genes (UPF0607), which is also restricted to primates, are closely related to the vertebrate transmembrane nucleoporin gene POM121, although they lack the transmembrane domain. These three newly identified groups of genes all lack conserved introns, and hence, are likely retrogenes. We hypothesize that, in the common ancestor of placentals, the POM121 gene retrotransposed and gave rise to an NPAP1-ancestral retrogene NPAP1L/NPAP1/UPF0607. Our results suggest that the nuclear pore-associated gene NPAP1 originates from the vertebrate nucleoporin gene POM121 and—after several steps of retrotransposition and duplication—has been subjected to genomic imprinting and positive selection after integration into the imprinted SNRPN-UBE3A chromosomal domain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphenotype 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3agenomic imprinting 3agene expression 3amice 3aintrons 3aPrimates 0aimprinting 0aUPF0607 0anucleoporin 0aC15orf2 0agenes 0aNPAP1L 0anuclear pore complex1 aFeiner, Nathalie1 aMeyer, Axel1 aBuiting, Karin1 aHorsthemke, Bernhard0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014, v. 6, no. 2 p.344-351dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245015900159300001400318520180700332592002802139650001202167650001302179650002302192650001802215650001302233650001502246650001802261650002902279650001302308650000702321650002402328650001302352650001402365650000902379653001502388653001302403653002902416653001302445653001902458700002202477700001602499700002102515773010002536856007102636852000902707655001202716IND60629615720221119091255.0190131s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961572DNAL7 a10.1071/SR182112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanke, Chelsea K.10aBiochemical effects of banding limit the benefits of nitrification inhibition and controlled-release technology in the fertosphere of high N-input systems  ap. 28-40.  aEnhanced efficiency fertilisers (EEFs) may have an important role in improving nitrogen (N) use efficiency in agricultural systems. The performance of EEFs when applied by broadcasting and incorporation is well documented; however, little information is available for sub-surface banded N-fertiliser. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of EEFs within the fertosphere in several soils. This was determined by: (i) establishing the key chemical effects and N-transformation activity within a urea band, and (ii) contrasting these findings with nitrification inhibitor (NI)-coated urea and a controlled-release polymer-coated urea (PCU). A 112-day incubation experiment was conducted with the EEFs band-applied in three contrasting soils with a history of sugarcane production. In standard urea and NI-urea treated soils, the pH within the fertosphere significantly increased to a maximum of ~pH 9.2–9.3. Alkaline conditions and high ammonium concentrations promoted elevated aqueous ammonia concentrations, resulting in complete nitrification inhibition. The PCU granules released ~40% of total urea content within 14 days, followed by subsequent release at significantly lower rates. The initial rapid urea release was attributed to damaged polymer coats, while close proximity of neighbouring granules within the band may have contributed to the subsequent slower release phase through reduced concentration gradients and restricted diffusion from granules. Variation between soils suggests that soil properties such as clay content and pH buffer capacity may influence urea hydrolysis, but not nitrification. These results suggest that both NI and controlled-release technology may not have the expected impacts on N transformations and availability when applied in a concentrated band.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abuffering capacity 3aclay fraction 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3apH 3apolymer-coated urea 3apolymers 3asugarcane 3aurea 0afertiliser 0anitrogen 0anitrification inhibitors 0apolymers 0asoil fertility1 aFujinuma, Ryosuke1 aMoody, Phil1 aBell, Michael J.0 tSoil research.g2019, v. 57, no. 1 p.28-40dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44751x1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR182113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009800159500002000257520103800277592002801315596011501343650001201458650001601470650001801486650001201504650001001516650001001526650001401536650003001550650003001580650004501610650001801655650002301673650001901696650003801715651001001753700002101763700005401784773011601838856007301954852000902027655001202036IND60708991520221119170624.0200902e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070899152DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.126192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zheng‐Nan10aCampsisgrandiflora as a new host species harbouring two novel 16SrI subgroups of phytoplasmas  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn September 2019, two diseased plants of Campsis grandiflora showing the main symptom of witches' ‐broom (CgWB) were found in a nursery garden in Yangling, Shaanxi province, China. Partial 16S ribosomal RNA (F2nR2 region) and ribosomal protein (rp) genes of phytoplasmas were generated from the symptomatic plants by PCR amplification, and phytoplasma bodies were observed in the sieve tube elements of the CgWB samples under a transmission electron microscope, indicating phytoplasma infection in the two CgWB plants. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the F2nR2 region and similarity coefficient results suggested that the two associated phytoplasmas belong to two novel subgroups of 16SrI (aster yellows) group, designated as AK and AL. On the reconstructed phylogenetic trees based on F2nR2 regions and rp genes of phytoplasmas, respectively, the CgWB‐associated phytoplasmas clustered together with members of 16SrI subgroups. This was the first record of phytoplasmas infecting C. grandiflora worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aNDYB2018‐3cResearch Start‐up Funds for High‐level Researchers of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University 3aCampsis 3aPhytoplasma 3aaster yellows 3agardens 3agenes 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3asieve elements 3atransmission electron microscopes 3aChina1 aSun, Ping‐Ping1 aZhang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-952X0 tForest pathology.g2020 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.e12619-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.126193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04059naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012400165500001900289520242400308592002802732650001702760650001302777650003002790650002202820650001302842650002302855650001402878650001402892650001902906650002102925650001602946651001002962653002402972653002802996653002503024653001703049653003003066653004303096700001503139700005403154700001803208700002103226700001603247700001903263700005403282773011203336856008403448852000903532655001203541IND60731549620221120142746.0210603e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073154962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e015432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Danfeng10aPhylogenetic conservatism of fruit development time in Chinese angiosperms and the phylogenetic and climatic correlates  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDocumenting the patterns and drivers of functional trait distributions at large spatial scales is key to our fundamental understanding of the composition of plant assemblages. However, phylogeographic patterns of fruit development time (FDT, the difference between flowering and fruiting dates) have remained unstudied. Here we compiled reproductive phenology (flowering and fruiting time) and species distribution data for 6838 angiosperm species in China to explore whether FDT is more phylogenetically conserved as latitude and elevation increase, whether the phylogenetic signal of FDT correlates with phylogenetic structure and potential climatic drivers across China, and whether the environmental determinants of phylogenetic signal of FDT differ between herbaceous and woody species.ChinaWe divided China into 268 200 × 200 km grid cells and calculated the phylogenetic signals of FDT in each grid cell using pagel’s λ. We then regressed the phylogenetic signals of FDT as a function of either latitude or elevation, individually. We examined the relationship between phylogenetic signals of FDT and climate variables using both ordinary and spatial linear regressions. We also examined the relationship between the phylogenetic signal of FDT and either net relatedness index (NRI) or clade age of each grid-cell.We found that phylogenetic signals in FDT increased as elevation and latitude increased. The Pagel’s λ of FDT was negatively correlated with clade age but positively correlated with NRI. Precipitation in the wettest quarter was the primary variable affecting the phylogenetic signal for herbaceous species, while minimum temperature of the coldest month and temperature seasonality were the two most important climatic factors for woody species.Strength of phylogenetic conservatism of FDT is greater at higher latitudes and elevations. The latitudinal and elevational patterns, where mean clade age of species lowers as temperature decreases, and angiosperm assemblages tend to be more phylogenetically clustered at higher elevations and higher latitudes, could be explained by the Tropical Niche Conservatism hypothesis. The phylogenetic signals of herbs and of woody plants are triggered by different climatic drivers. Our findings have important implications for the study of large-scale geographical gradients in plant species richness, phylogenetic diversity and community assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3afruiting 3ageographical distribution 3aherbaceous plants 3alatitude 3aniche conservatism 3aphenology 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3aChina 0aFruit ripening time 0aFunctional biogeography 0aLatitudinal gradient 0aMacroecology 0aPhylogenetic conservatism 0aTropical Niche Conservatism hypothesis1 aDu, Yanjun1 aXu, Wubing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6566-44521 aPeng, Danxiao1 aPrimack, Richard1 aChen, Guoke1 aMao, Ling Feng1 aMa, Keping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9112-53400 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 June, v. 27 p.e01543-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e015433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245010800205300001600313506007600329520167900405592002802084506003702112650001702149650002002166650002702186650002802213650002102241650000902262650002502271650000902296650001102305650001202316650001002328650001202338650002002350650001602370650001702386650001702403650001502420650001302435650001602448651001802464653002502482653002502507653001702532653001902549653003002568700002702598700003002625700001702655700001902672700002502691773009402716856007402810852000902884655001202893IND60117807320221207070818.0141126s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011780732DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0252doi7 aPMC39420372pmcid7 a245040872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, Andreanna J.10aPolar Bears Exhibit Genome-Wide Signatures of Bioenergetic Adaptation to Life in the Arctic Environment  ap. 433-450.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolar bears (Ursus maritimus) face extremely cold temperatures and periods of fasting, which might result in more severe energetic challenges than those experienced by their sister species, the brown bear (U. arctos). We have examined the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of polar and brown bears to investigate whether polar bears demonstrate lineage-specific signals of molecular adaptation in genes associated with cellular respiration/energy production. We observed increased evolutionary rates in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene in polar but not brown bears. An amino acid substitution occurred near the interaction site with a nuclear-encoded subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex and was predicted to lead to a functional change, although the significance of this remains unclear. The nuclear genomes of brown and polar bears demonstrate different adaptations related to cellular respiration. Analyses of the genomes of brown bears exhibited substitutions that may alter the function of proteins that regulate glucose uptake, which could be beneficial when feeding on carbohydrate-dominated diets during hyperphagia, followed by fasting during hibernation. In polar bears, genes demonstrating signatures of functional divergence and those potentially under positive selection were enriched in functions related to production of nitric oxide (NO), which can regulate energy production in several different ways. This suggests that polar bears may be able to fine-tune intracellular levels of NO as an adaptive response to control trade-offs between energy production in the form of adenosine triphosphate versus generation of heat (thermogenesis).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUrsus arctos 3aUrsus maritimus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid substitution 3acell respiration 3acold 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiet 3aenergy 3afasting 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheat production 3ahibernation 3amitochondria 3anitric oxide 3aovereating 3aproteins 3atemperature 3aArctic region 0acellular respiration 0amitochondrial genome 0anitric oxide 0anuclear genome 0aoxidative phosphorylation1 aBedoya-Reina, Oscar C.1 aCarretero-Paulet, Lorenzo1 aMiller, Webb1 aRode, Karyn D.1 aLindqvist, Charlotte0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014, v. 6, no. 2 p.433-450dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009600163300001400259520063000273592002800903650001800931650001100949650001000960650001300970650003100983650001101014650001401025651002801039651001101067653001801078653001101096653001301107653001401120653001401134700001701148700002201165700002301187700002001210773010001230856007901330852000901409655001201418IND60629618320221119091437.0190219e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961832DNAL7 a10.1515/acro-2018-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiterák, Ivan10aOccurrence of Red Kites Milvus milvus in Serbia based on birds tracked by telemetry devices  ap. 27-32.  aA total of 13 Red Kites Milvus milvus fitted with GPS/GSM telemetry loggers in central Europe were tracked in Serbia from 10 July 2014 until 31 March 2018.

It is possible that Red Kites occur in Serbia more often than formerly, and this could in future result in this threatened European raptor’s more frequently wintering and breeding within the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMilvus milvus 3aautumn 3abirds 3abreeding 3aglobal positioning systems 3aspring 3atelemetry 3aCentral European region 3aSerbia 0aMilvus milvus 0araptor 0avagrancy 0amigration 0apoisoning1 aRaab, Rainer1 aVyhnal, Stanislav1 aSpakovszky, Péter1 aSteindl, Jochen0 tAcrocephalus.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 39, no. 176-177 p.27-32dSciendowJournal:2023x0351-28517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/acro-2018-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245005300175300001600228520122400244592002801468650003001496650001101526650001801537650001401555650001301569650002301582650001401605650002301619650002501642650001901667650001001686650000901696650001201705773008901717856008601806990002301892852000901915655001201924IND60092024020221120072234.0141103e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco-Torgal, F.10aIndoor radon: An overview on a perennial problem  ap. 270-277.  aAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) radon constitutes the second cause of lung cancer in the general population, the first being smoking. In addition health investigations also show that children are more susceptible than adults to ionizing radiation. In the past, it was accepted that only radon concentrations above 400 Bq/m³ could constitute a health risk, however, recent epidemiological findings demonstrate lung cancer risk from exposure to indoor radon at levels in the order of 100 Bq/m³. Furthermore, lung cancer aggravates based on the accumulated inhaled dose and, according to WHO, there is no lower radon level below which the risk from exposure disappears. Nevertheless, some surveys show that the majority of the public seems to consider the health risks involved in radon exposure as being negligible. To make things worse, only a few countries require the use of protection measures for buildings located in radon affected areas. This paper reviews literature on radon as a source of indoor air contamination. It covers recent legislation, building protecting measures and their cost-effectiveness. It also covers the case of radon emissions from construction and decorative materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aair pollution 3abuildings 3achildren 3acost effectiveness 3aemissions 3aionizing radiation 3alaws and regulations 3alung neoplasms 3aradon 3arisk 3asurveys0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Dec., v. 58 p.270-277dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.08.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009700168300001400265520080600279592002801085650001801113650002101131650002101152650000901173650001201182650000901194650001801203650001201221650001301233650001801246650000901264650001201273650001801285650001201303650001001315650001001325650001601335650001001351651001301361653000901374653002101383653001701404653001801421700002001439700002101459700002101480700002201501773010001523856007901623852000901702655001201711IND60629618520221119091410.0190219e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961852DNAL7 a10.1515/acro-2018-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanžekovič, Franc10aDiet of Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus in the urban environment of Maribor (NE Slovenia)  ap. 39-43.  aThe article presents dietary habits of the Peregrine Falcon in the urban environment of Maribor.

In October 2015, prey remnants were collected after the nesting in and around the nest built on top of the grain storage silo. Prey remnants, mostly bones and feathers, were sorted into body parts: skull with the beak, wings, and legs. Wings were the most numerous remnants with 41.7%, followed by legs and skulls with 28.1% each. In total, 96 units of prey were found, belonging to five different species of birds. The number of specimens and biomass was dominated by Feral Pigeons Columba livia domestica with 64.6% in number and 89.5% in prey biomass.

These samples may have TKN contents ranging from less than 100 ppb to as high as percentage levels. However, the DTM procedure generally leads to a very low throughput because it is labor intensive and time-consuming. At the current practical quantitation limit (PQL) of 300 ppb established at the Feed and Environmental (FEW) Laboratory, University of Georgia, the DTM procedure is less applicable to low TKN surface water samples. In this study, we therefore compared the performance of diffusion conductivity method (DCM) and colorimetric method (CM) with DTM in measuring NH₄-N in the TKN digests of 29 different samples representing surface waters, lagoons, manures, poultry litters, and environmental wastes. Acceptable accuracy and precision were achieved for various QC samples by all three methods. For widely different sample matrices and TKN contents, the NH₄-N in the TKN digests measured by DCM and CM both agreed well with that measured by DTM. However, the linear working range of CM is limited within 0.2 to 5.0 ppm, whereas DCM is linear at a wider range of 0.01 to 2000 ppm. With DCM, the PQL of TKN is at 13 ppb, much less than the 300 ppb in DTM and 520 ppb in CM. Both DCM and CM require increasing the pH of the working TKN digest to a highly alkaline range. To meet such pH requirement, the minimum dilution need for DCM is twofold, where as that CM is fourfold. Because of greater mandatory dilution requirement coupled with a greater PQL, CM may often fail to measure NH₄-N in the working TKN digest of some low TKN surface water samples. On the other hand, with some environmental waste samples containing TKN at percentage level, CM would require multistep dilution of the digests prior to measurement, thus allowing dilution-related error as well as requiring additional labor. In contrast, DCM can measure both low TKN surface waters and high TKN environmental wastes without any major limitations. Moreover, DCM may work well without any adjustment of sample background in the calibration standards. Thus DCM appears to be an attractive alternative to the labor-intensive and time-consuming DTM for measuring NH₄-N in the TKN digests of various kinds of agricultural and environmental samples in the analytical services laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acolorimetry 3alabor 3apH 3apoultry 3asurface water 3awastes 0aColorimetric method 0adiffusion–conductivity method 0adistillation–titration method 0atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen1 aSonon, Leticia1 aKissel, David E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 43, no. 18 p.2323-2341dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.708081  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009700169300001400266520129500280592002801575650001101603650001201614650001101626650002401637650002501661650002401686650002001710650001101730651001001741700002101751700002301772773008701795856008601882990002301968852000901991655001202000IND60092024420221120072256.0141103e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Xinzhi10aOptimization of passive design measures for residential buildings in different Chinese areas  ap. 46-57.  aPassive design, which has strong dependency of climate and areas, is the most economical effective strategy for reducing energy consumption inside residential buildings. A total of 25 representative cities of China were selected for optimum analysis. This paper presents an approach in which the orthogonal method and the listing method are integrated to explore how energy consumption is minimized in residential buildings by optimizing 7 passive design measures for each city: wall thickness (WT), roof insulation thickness (RIT), external wall insulation thickness (EWIT), window orientation (WO), window-wall ratio (WWR), glazing type (GT), and sunroom depth/overhang depth (SD/OD). With the optimization, the passive design could reduce annual thermal load of building considerably, even could replace air-condition systems in winter for the areas with high solar radiation such as Lhasa. The results reveal that neighbor cities have the same optimal combinations and the similar effects of energy-saving measures. A total of 7 passive design zones were summarized in a map. The architect could be guided in his choice of appropriate passive measures directly from the map or handling of exact passive design by the optimal approach proposed in this paper for different areas in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3ainsulating materials 3aresidential housing 3asolar radiation 3awinter 3aChina1 aAkashi, Yasunori1 aSumiyoshi, Daisuke0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Dec., v. 58 p.46-57dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245010100219500001900320520116000339592002801499650002601527650001201553650001501565650001201580650001201592650001501604650001101619650002901630650002301659650001601682650001501698650001301713650001801726650001301744650002301757650001401780650002501794650001101819651001101830653000801841653001901849653002401868653001101892700007401903700002701977700006902004700006902073700007302142700006902215700005002284700007502334773011702409856008202526852000902608655001202617IND60731550220221117212921.0210428e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073155022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1014702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Carvalho, Arminda Moreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4854-579010aN2O emissions from sugarcane fields under contrasting watering regimes in the Brazilian savannah  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBioethanol and other sugarcane by-products, such as the bagasse, are responsible for approximately 12% of Brazil’s total energy generation. This crop is expanding in the Central-Western Region of Brazil, within the Brazilian savannah biome (Cerrado). It is strongly associated with the use of mineral and/or organic fertilizers and irrigation practices due to drought period during winter. However, higher soil moisture content (due to rain or irrigation) and nitrogen (N) application increase nitrous oxide (N₂O) emission, which is one of the main greenhouse gases from the agricultural sector. This study aimed to evaluate soil N₂O fluxes in sugarcane under field conditions with contrasting water regimes in the Cerrado region of Brazil. Due to watering regimes, based on different crop evapotranspiration demand, it was possible to establish adequate water-use efficiency technologies. Increases in watering regimes did not increase N₂O emissions compared to “rescue irrigation”, commonly used by farmers in the region. However, higher yields were obtained from the higher watering regime (T75%) compared to the farmers’ common practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abagasse 3abioethanol 3acerrado 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental technology 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouses 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asavannas 3asoil water content 3asugarcane 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3aBrazil 0aN2O 0aGreenhouse gas 0aNitrogen fertilizer 0aOxisol1 ade Oliveira, Alexsandra Duarte1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4849-03981 aCoser, Thais Rodrigues1 ade Sousa, Thais Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3097-85661 ade Lima, Cristiane Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6405-03441 aRamos, Maria Lucrécia Gerosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4516-73521 aMalaquias, Juaci Vitória1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6720-96241 aGonçalves, Adriano Dicesar Martins de Araujo1 aRibeiro Júnior, Walter Quadros1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9948-55780 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 May, v. 22 p.101470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1014703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245006500159500001900224520127800243592002801521650001401549650001001563650002501573650001601598650002101614650002201635650003001657650000901687650001201696650001401708650002001722650001001742700002001752700001801772700001901790700001901809773011901828856007701947852000902024655001202033IND60729293520221117223325.0210228e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072929352DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120201882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yalun 10aCdx2 Regulates Intestinal EphrinB1 through the Notch Pathway  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe majority of colorectal cancers harbor loss-of-function mutations in APC, a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling, leading to intestinal polyps that are predisposed to malignant progression. Comparable murine APC alleles also evoke intestinal polyps, which are typically confined to the small intestine and proximal colon, but do not progress to carcinoma in the absence of additional mutations. The Cdx transcription factors Cdx1 and Cdx2 are essential for homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, and loss of Cdx2 has been associated with more aggressive subtypes of colorectal cancer in the human population. Consistent with this, concomitant loss of Cdx1 and Cdx2 in a murine APC mutant background leads to an increase in polyps throughout the intestinal tract. These polyps also exhibit a villous phenotype associated with the loss of EphrinB1. However, the basis for these outcomes is poorly understood. To further explore this, we modeled Cdx2 loss in SW480 colorectal cancer cells. We found that Cdx2 impacted Notch signaling in SW480 cells, and that EphrinB1 is a Notch target gene.

Since no transporter for nicotine has been identified in microorganisms, we investigated whether NdpT is responsible for nicotine transport. ndpT was induced by nicotine, and gene knockout and complementation studies clearly indicated that ndpT is essential for the catabolism of nicotine in strain TY. NdpT-GFP was located at the periphery of the cells, suggesting that NdpT is a membrane protein. Uptake assays with L-[¹⁴C] nicotine illustrated that nicotine uptake in strain TY is mediated by a constitutively synthesized permease with a Kₘ of 0.362 ± 0.07 μM and a Vₘₐₓ of 0.762 ± 0.068 μmol min⁻¹ (mg cell dry weight)⁻¹ and that ndpT may play a role in nicotine exclusion. Hence, we consider NdpT a nicotine catabolism-related protein.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 41721001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31422003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31170115cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aSphingomonas 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3agene targeting 3agenes 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3anicotine 3anitrogen 3aradionuclides1 aZhu, Panpan1 aZhang, Ying1 aSun, Kaikai1 aLu, Zhenmei0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Dec., v. 102, no. 23 p.10171-10181dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9371-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009600206300001700302500001900319520172100338592002802059650003002087650001202117650001902129650001302148651001902161700001702180700002302197700002402220700002202244700006202266773012502328856008202453852000902535655001202544IND60702382820221119012910.0200718e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05309-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgega, Obed M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4314-696910aHeavy precipitation events over East Africa in a changing climate: results from CORDEX RCMs  ap. 993-1009.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study assesses the performance of 24 model runs from five COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models (RCMs) in simulating East Africa’s spatio-temporal precipitation characteristics using a set of eight descriptors: consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), simple precipitation intensity index (SDII), mean daily annual (pr_ANN), seasonal (pr_MAM and pr_OND) precipitation, and representatives of heavy precipitation (90p) and very intense precipitation (99p) events. Relatively better performing RCM runs are then used to assess projected precipitation changes (for the period 2071–2099 relative to 1977–2005) over the study domain under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The performance of RCMs is found to be descriptor and scope specific. Overall, RCA4 (r1i1p1) forced by CNRM-CERFACS-CNRM-CM5 and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, REMO2009 (r1i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, and RCA4 (r2i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR emerge as the top four RCM runs. We show that an ensemble mean of the top four model runs outperforms an ensemble mean of 24 model simulations and ensemble means for all runs in an RCM. Our analysis of projections shows a reduction (increase) in mean daily precipitation for MAM(OND), an increase(decrease) in CDD(CWD) events, and a general increase in SDII and the width of the right tail of the precipitation distribution (99p–90p). An increase in SDII and 99p–90p implies a possibility of occurrence of heavy and extreme precipitation incidences by the end of the twenty-first century. Our findings provide important information to support the region’s climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adynamics 3aEastern Africa1 aKoske, James1 aKung’u, James B.1 aScoccimarro, Enrico1 aEndris, Hussen S.1 aMistry, Malcolm N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3345-61970 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Aug., v. 55, no. 3-4 p.993-1009dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05309-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011400162500001900276506002800295506003200323520103500355592002801390596004501418506003701463650002801500650001701528650002601545650001201571650001701583650001101600650004401611650002001655700001801675700002401693773011901717856007701836903002201913852000901935655001201944IND60735099320221207113216.0210423e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073509932DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100408072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasas, Morgan 10aApplication of NMR and Chemometrics for the Profiling and Classification of Ale and Lager American Craft Beer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aIn this paper, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics were applied for the discrimination of ale and lager craft American beers. A modified pulse sequence that allows the efficient suppression of the water and ethanol peaks was used to achieve high-quality spectra with minimal sample preparation. The initial chemometrics analysis generated models of low predictive power, indicating the high variability in the groups. Due to this variability, we tested the effect of various data pretreatment and chemometrics approaches to improve the model’s performance. Spectral alignment was found to improve the classification significantly, while the type of normalization also played an important role. NMR combined with statistical and machine-learning techniques such as orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest was able to discriminate between ale and lager beers, thus providing an important tool for the quality control and analysis of these products.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartificial intelligence 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aethanol 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquality control1 aTang, Fenfen 1 aHatzakis, Emmanuel 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 09, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100408073Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245011400175300001500289520216600304592002802470650001902498650001502517650001402532650001402546650001902560650002602579650001802605650002002623650001402643650001202657650000902669650001502678650002302693650002002716650002202736650001002758650001902768650001402787650002002801651001002821653001402831653002402845653001202869653002302881653002502904653002302929700002902952700002702981700002603008700002403034700002103058700003203079773011403111856008303225852000903308655001203317IND60526280020221120131432.0190403e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCancela, Javier José10aEffects of climate variability on irrigation scheduling in white varieties of Vitis vinifera (L.) of NW Spain  ap. 99-109.  aInter-annual climate variability, mainly rainfall temporal distribution, is a critical factor for scheduling irrigation. In order to efficiently manage precision irrigation systems for Vitis vinifera (L.), their effects on plant physiology, and vineyard soils, together with yield and quality parameters, need to be understood. The current study was conducted on two grapevine cultivars from Galicia (NW-Spain), cv. ‘Albariño’ and ‘Godello’, during 2012–2014, in two different Designations of Origin (DO): Rías Baixas and Valdeorras. The treatments were rainfed (R) and surface drip irrigation (DI) in DO Rías Baixas, adding subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) in DO Valdeorras, with four replicates (7 plants each). Irrigation was triggered at fruit set, when midday stem water potential (Ψstem) dropped to −0.5MPa, and stopped 15 days before harvest in DO Valdeorras; but it was managed by the vinegrower in DO Rías Baixas. Different bioclimatic indices were calculated to characterize each season and location. Soil water content and Ψstem were periodically measured to assess vineyard water status. Yield and juice quality attributes were determined. Water productivity indices were calculated to compare locations and cultivars. Differences between DOs were observed regarding bioclimatic indices, which indicated temperate and very cool nights for cv. ‘Godello’. In the case of ‘Albariño’, warmer nights were observed. In DO Valdeorras, the differences between treatments in Ψstem were never higher than −0.19MPa; whereas they were almost null in DO Rías Baixas. Yield parameters showed a worse overall productive performance for the R treatment, with lower yields in 2012 and 2013. Qualitative parameters were stable over the three growing seasons studied. Adjusting irrigation schedules for a given season using Ψstem measurements and considering the phenological stage of the vine might help to obtain homogeneous harvests, both in yield and quality. Water productivity indices related with grape yield and pruning weight showed that, in a temperate climate, vegetative growth has an important weight in vineyard water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afruit set 3agrowing season 3airrigation scheduling 3ajuice quality 3amicroirrigation 3aphenology 3apruning 3arain 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atemperate zones 3avegetative growth 3avines 3avineyard soils 3avineyards 3awater potential 3aSpain 0aAlbariño 0aBioclimatic indices 0aGodello 0aSoil water content 0aStem water potential 0aWater productivity1 aTrigo-Córdoba, Emiliano1 aMartínez, Emma María1 aRey, Benjamín Jesús1 aBouzas-Cid, Yolanda1 aFandiño, María1 aMirás-Avalos, José Manuel0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 May 31, v. 170 p.99-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011800179300001600297520192700313592002802240650001502268650001202283650001102295650001002306650000902316650001602325700001802341773009702359856008602456852000902542655001202551IND60096672220221121225846.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostowski, Wojciech J.10aComparative evaluation of a natural gas expansion plant integrated with an IC engine and an organic Rankine cycle  ap. 509-516.  aThe aim of the paper is to propose and evaluate an innovative exergy recovery system for natural gas expansion, based on the integration of an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and to compare it with other alternatives. Natural gas expansion plants are a substantial improvement to the conventional gas pressure reduction stations, based on the throttling process, since the available physical exergy of pressurized gas is converted into mechanical energy by means of an expansion machine (turbine or piston expander) instead of being lost in the throttling process. However, due to the hydrate formation problem the gas has to be pre-heated prior to the expansion, which diminishes the system performance. An efficient method for performing this pre-heating is by the proposed system that comprises an ICE and an ORC: Pre-heating of natural gas is carried out partially directly by the co-generation module, via the engine cooling cycle, and partially indirectly, by means of the engine exhaust gases, which supply heat for the ORC, while the ORC condenser is connected with the lowest stage of natural gas pre-heating. Other alternatives are the use of an ICE without ORC, the use of a boiler, and even expansion in a throttling valve. The paper evaluates the performance of the aforementioned four configurations by means of both energy and exergy analysis. Several alternative performance indicators have been defined, calculated and discussed. Sources of irreversibilities have been identified by means of exergy analysis methodology. The fuel-product approach was used to define the exergy efficiency. Except for the reference system with a throttling valve, the analyzed systems achieve favourable values of exergy efficiency (up to 52.6%), and outstanding performance ratios (0.69–0.77), relating the energy fluxes of generated work to the fuel locally combusted in the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acooling 3aexergy 3agases 3aheat 3anatural gas1 aUsón, Sergio0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.509-516dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010900164300001800273500002000291520117500311592002801486650002001514650001801534650001801552650001401570650001401584650001501598650000901613700002201622700006201644700001901706700006501725773013201790856007401922852000901996655001202005IND60788536920221119024926.0220815e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078853692DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.104732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalooeifard, Razieh10aDose‐Response Meta‐Analysis of the Impact of Body Mass Index on Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit  ap. 1010-1020.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Both low and high body mass index (BMI) are associated with mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although many studies have been done to determine the relationship between BMI and risk of mortality in the ICU, their results were inconsistent. This study aimed to conduct a dose‐response meta‐analysis of published observational studies to assess the effect of BMI on the risk of mortality in patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify articles up to May 2019. A total of 31 relevant articles, with 238,961 patients and a follow‐up period of 1 month to 11 years, were analyzed. RESULTS: Linear analysis showed a 0.6% decrease in mortality rate per unit (kg/m²) increase in BMI (odds ratio: 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99). In addition, nonlinear analysis showed a decrease in risk of mortality for a BMI of 35 (P < .001) and then increased the risk of mortality with a BMI > 35 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This dose‐response meta‐analysis revealed that a BMI ≤ 35 can be a protective agent against mortality, but a BMI > 35 is a life‐threatening factor in patients admitted to the ICU.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3adose response 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3anutrition 3aodds ratio 3arisk1 aDjafarian, Kurosh1 aSafabakhsh, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4947-20121 aRahmani, Jamal1 aShab‐Bidar, Sakineh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0167-71740 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2020 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1010-1020dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.104733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011100167300001400278520134700292592002801639650000801667650002101675650001401696650001501710650002201725650000901747650001801756700001801774700001401792773009501806856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60096672320221120182839.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao10aPerformance comparison of liquid desiccant air handling processes from the perspective of match properties  ap. 51-60.  aThe energy consumption of air-conditioning systems represents a large part of the entire building energy consumption in non-residential buildings. Heat pump-driven liquid desiccant (HPLD) systems have become more and more popular because of their high energy efficiency, and there are many different ways to utilize the condensing heat in this type of air handling device. In the present study, the match properties of the heat and mass transfer processes in the air–desiccant system varying with the inlet air states are investigated, and the unmatched coefficient based on entransy dissipation is adopted to evaluate the performance of HPLD systems. It is demonstrated that the unmatched coefficient of the process along the iso-concentration line is much lower than that along the isenthalpic line. A higher unmatched coefficient means a higher heat or mass transfer resistance caused by the unmatched flow rates or parameters. The HPLD system in which solution is heated for regeneration (Basic Type II) performs much better than the system in which regeneration air is heated (Basic Type I). The unmatched coefficients of the condenser and regenerator decrease from 2.70 and 1.34, respectively, in Basic Type I, to 1.07 and 1.05, respectively, in Basic Type II. Moreover, COPₛyₛ is significantly improved, rising from 1.83 to 4.17.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3abuildings 3adesiccants 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3amass transfer1 aLiu, Xiao-Hua1 aJiang, Yi0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.51-60dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245010800205300001800313500002000331520179200351592002802143596009502171650002202266650002002288650002302308650001402331650001502345650001402360650002002374650001702394650001502411650001202426650001602438700002402454700002602478700002502504700001802529700002602547773013202573856007402705852000902779655001202788IND60788537020221119024759.0220815e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078853702DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.104952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellini, Sarah Gunnell1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6755-620110aCurrent Practices Using Pediatric Malnutrition Indicators: A Survey of Dietitians Working in Pediatrics  ap. 1080-1086.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In 2014, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommended indicators to identify malnutrition in children aged 1 month to 18 years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate current practices and the effectiveness of the consensus statement–recommended pediatric malnutrition indicators. METHODS: A cross‐sectional electronic survey link was posted in the Pediatric Nutrition Practice Group (subscribers = 3160) and Clinical Nutrition Management Practice Group's Pediatric Subunit (subscribers = 177) community discussion boards. Additionally, flyers with the survey link were distributed to registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) currently working in pediatrics at the 2018 Food & Nutrition Conference & Expo. Frequencies described participant characteristics, awareness of indicators, and use of indicators. Researchers used the Fisher exact test to determine associations between categorical variables. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty‐one surveys were included in data analysis. A majority of RDNs (88.6%) reported they knew the indicators existed and considered themselves knowledgeable about the indicators. Weight loss was the most frequently used indicator, with 224 RDNs (80%) reporting use as often or always. Mid‐upper arm circumference (MUAC) was the least used indicator with only 68 RDNs (25%) using it often or always. Most RDNs (71.5%) reported that their facility used International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes to document malnutrition. CONCLUSION: RDNs working with pediatric populations consistently use the recommended malnutrition indicators; however, further education is needed on the appropriate use of MUAC and length/height per age as malnutrition indicators.  aPublisher supplied data  aCollege of Life Science Start‐up GrantcBrigham Young University College of Life Science 3aarm circumference 3achild nutrition 3aclinical nutrition 3adietetics 3adietitians 3aeducation 3aenteral feeding 3amalnutrition 3apediatrics 3asurveys 3aweight loss1 aBecker, Patricia J.1 aCarney, Liesje Nieman1 aGreen Corkins, Kelly1 aMedico, Tegan1 aVan Poots, Holly Anne0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2020 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1080-1086dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.104953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011500166300001800281520086200299592002801161650002301189650001301212650002801225650001701253650002201270650001501292650003401307650001401341653001201355653001301367653002301380653001901403653004501422700002201467700001901489700001401508700001401522700001601536700002201552700002101574700002101595700001601616700001201632700001601644700001501660700002001675700001301695700001801708700001201726700001601738700002101754700001901775773009801794856008401892852000901976655001201985IND60730108620221116192946.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073010862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guo-Hua10aDipylidium caninum draft genome - a new resource for comparative genomic and genetic explorations of flatworms  ap. 1272-1280.  aHere, we present a draft genome of the tapeworm Dipylidium caninum (family Dipylidiidae) and compare it with other cestode genomes.

Predicting the relationships between global change and native faunas requires a quantitative toolkit that effectively links the timing and magnitude of extreme events to variation in species abundances. Here, we examine how discharge anomalies – unexpected floods and droughts – determine covariation in abundance of native and non‐native fish species in a highly variable desert river in Arizona. We quantified stochastic variation in discharge using Fourier analyses on >15 000 daily observations. We subsequently coupled maximum annual spectral anomalies with a 15‐year time series of fish abundances (1994–2008), using Multivariate Autoregressive State‐Space (MARSS) models. Abiotic drivers (discharge anomalies) were paramount in determining long‐term fish abundances, whereas biotic drivers (species interactions) played only a secondary role. As predicted, anomalous droughts reduced the abundances of native species, while floods increased them. However, in contrast to previous studies, we observed that the non‐native assemblage was surprisingly unresponsive to extreme events. Biological trait analyses showed that functional uniqueness was higher in native than in non‐native fishes. We also found that discharge anomalies influenced diversity patterns at the meta‐community level, with nestedness increasing after anomalous droughts due to the differential impairment of native species. Overall, our results advance the notion that discharge variation is key in determining community trajectories in the long term, predicting the persistence of native fauna even in the face of invasion. We suggest this variation, rather than biotic interactions, may commonly underlie covariation between native and non‐native faunas, especially in highly variable environments. If droughts become increasingly severe due to climate change, and floods increasingly muted due to regulation, fish assemblages in desert rivers may become taxonomically and functionally impoverished and dominated by non‐native taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afauna 3afish 3afloods 3aindigenous species 3ainterspecific variation 3aintroduced species 3amodels 3anestedness 3aprediction 3arivers 3atime series analysis 3aArizona1 aHolmes, Elizabeth E.1 aRinne, John N.1 aSabo, John L.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.1482-1496dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.127803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008400158300001800242520186200260592002802122650001202150650001702162650001502179650001902194650001502213650001102228650002202239650001502261650002202276650001602298650001902314650001702333700001402350773010002364856007302464852000902537655001202546IND60135863520221116223601.0150522e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013586352DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.128252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurrini, Tabea12aA landscape ecology approach identifies important drivers of urban biodiversity  ap. 1652-1667.  aCities are growing rapidly worldwide, yet a mechanistic understanding of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity is lacking. We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500‐m scale and patch isolation at the 100‐m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro‐ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aCicadellidae 3aColeoptera 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3acities 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aurbanization1 aKnop, Eva0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.1652-1667dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.128253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010400178300001600282520141200298592002801710650002401738650002201762650001801784650002401802650002101826700002201847700003201869773009701901856008601998852000902084655001202093IND60096672620221120182856.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLesage, Frédéric J.12aA study on heat transfer enhancement using flow channel inserts for thermoelectric power generation  ap. 532-541.  aThermoelectric power production has many potential applications that range from microelectronics heat management to large scale industrial waste-heat recovery. A low thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the current state of the art prevents wide spread use of thermoelectric modules. The difficulties lie in material conversion efficiency, module design, and thermal system management. The present study investigates thermoelectric power improvement due to heat transfer enhancement at the channel walls of a liquid-to-liquid thermoelectric generator brought upon by flow turbulating inserts. Care is taken to measure the adverse pressure drop due to the presence of flow impeding obstacles in order to measure the net thermoelectric power enhancement relative to an absence of inserts. The results illustrate the power enhancement performance of three different geometric forms fitted into the channels of a thermoelectric generator. Spiral inserts are shown to offer a minimal improvement in thermoelectric power production whereas inserts with protruding panels are shown to be the most effective. Measurements of the thermal enhancement factor which represents the ratio of heat flux into heat flux out of a channel and numerical simulations of the internal flow velocity field attribute the thermal enhancement resulting in the thermoelectric power improvement to thermal and velocity field synergy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric generators 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3apower generation1 aSempels, Éric V.1 aLalande-Bertrand, Nathaniel0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.532-541dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012700169520106700296592002801363650002601391650001501417650001401432650001301446650002001459650002401479650001301503650002401516650001701540650001401557653002701571653002801598653003201626653002301658700002001681700002201701700002201723700002301745700002201768700002601790700006001816773010801876856008601984852000902070655001202079IND60679624120221120185734.0200121e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067962412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1157852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShankar, Shiv10aDevelopment of support based on chitosan and cellulose nanocrystals for the immobilization of anti-Shiga toxin 2B antibody  aThis work describes the development of membrane based on chitosan (CHI), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and glycerol (GLY), and optimization of the formulation for immobilization of monoclonal anti-Shiga toxin 2B antibody (mAnti-stx2B-Ab) for E. coli O157:H7 detection. The effect of CHI deacetylation degree & viscosity, CNCs and GLY concentrations on Anti-stx2B-Ab immobilization efficiency was evaluated. Fractional factorial and Box-Behnken designs were applied to screen the effects of compounds interactions and optimize their concentrations for detection of Anti-stx2B-Ab. The results demonstrated that the use of 0.6 % (w/v) CNCs improved significantly the Anti-stx2B-Ab immobilization and the level of signal detection. The detection limit of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by developed optimized membrane is 1 log CFU/mL. The time needed for detection of E. coli O157:H7 was only 4 h of enrichment compared to 24 h with conventional methods.

This study analyzed whether and how various factors related to farm or farmers’ characteristics influence the adoption intensity of sustainable agriculture practices. We used a negative binomial regression model to fit the data collected from a mail survey of farmers in Kentucky, USA. Our results showed that the adoption intensity of sustainable agriculture practices varied significantly among agricultural districts in Kentucky. Farmers who grew row crops, had irrigation facilities, and were in favor of crop diversification were significantly more likely than their respective counterparts to adopt more sustainable agriculture practices. Similarly, having a college education and participating in the Tobacco Buyout Program also positively and significantly affected the intensity of adopting sustainable agriculture practices among Kentucky farmers. In contrast, a lack of adequate knowledge about sustainable farming and an unfamiliarity with technology significantly and negatively related to less adoption of sustainable agriculture practices.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-6800621865.cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3adata collection 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahigher education 3airrigation 3aregression analysis 3arowcrops 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3atobacco 3aKentucky1 aGyawali, Buddhi R.1 aPaudel, Krishna P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9780-55201 aPoudyal, Neelam C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1230-06791 aSimon, Marion F.1 aDasgupta, Siddhartha1 aAntonious, George0 tEnvironmental management.g2018 Dec., v. 62, no. 6 p.1060-1072dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1109-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008700202300001800289506007600307520025200383520158800635592002802223506003702251650002002288650002002308650001002328650001102338650001102349650002902360700002102389700001502410700001902425773011502444856007702559852000902636655001202645IND60172087720221207144448.0150602e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017208772DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2538072doi7 aPMC43781602pmcid7 a256673142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearce, Simon10aFlowerNet: A Gene Expression Correlation Network for Anther and Pollen Development  ap. 1717-1730.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA network model of global transcriptional interactions, based on clustering of transcriptionally correlated genes using publicly available floral gene expression data sets, provides a community resource for studies of reproductive gene expression.  aFloral formation, in particular anther and pollen development, is a complex biological process with critical importance for seed set and for targeted plant breeding. Many key transcription factors regulating this process have been identified; however, their direct role remains largely unknown. Using publicly available gene expression data from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), focusing on those studies that analyze stamen-, pollen-, or flower-specific expression, we generated a network model of the global transcriptional interactions (FlowerNet). FlowerNet highlights clusters of genes that are transcriptionally coregulated and therefore likely to have interacting roles. Focusing on four clusters, and using a number of data sets not included in the generation of FlowerNet, we show that there is a close correlation in how the genes are expressed across a variety of conditions, including male-sterile mutants. This highlights the important role that FlowerNet can play in identifying new players in anther and pollen development. However, due to the use of general floral expression data in FlowerNet, it also has broad application in the characterization of genes associated with all aspects of floral development and reproduction. To aid the dissection of genes of interest, we have made FlowerNet available as a community resource ( http://www.cpib.ac.uk/anther ). For this resource, we also have generated plots showing anther/flower expression from a variety of experiments: These are normalized together where possible to allow further dissection of the resource.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agenes 3amodels 3apollen 3atranscription (genetics)1 aFerguson, Alison1 aKing, John1 aWilson, Zoe A.0 tPlant physiology.g2015 Apr., v. 167, no. 4 p.1717-1730dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2538073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245016400164500001900328520243000347592002802777650001902805650001802824650001102842650002102853650001102874650001102885650001602896650001002912650001302922650004302935650001702978650002902995650001803024700002203042773011903064856007703183852000903260655001203269IND60729294420221117223153.0210228e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072929442DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120201962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Julie A.,10aExpression Signatures of microRNAs and Their Targeted Pathways in the Adipose Tissue of Chickens during the Transition from Embryonic to Post-Hatch Development  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the chick transitions from embryonic to post-hatching life, its metabolism must quickly undergo a dramatic switch in its major energy source. The chick embryo derives most of its energy from the yolk, a lipid-rich/carbohydrate-poor source. Upon hatching, the chick’s metabolism must then be able to utilize a lipid-poor/carbohydrate-rich source (feed) as its main form of energy. We recently found that a number of hepatically-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) help facilitate this shift in metabolic processes in the chick liver, the main site of lipogenesis. While adipose tissue was initially thought to mainly serve as a lipid storage site, it is now known to carry many metabolic, endocrine, and immunological functions. Therefore, it would be expected that adipose tissue is also an important factor in the metabolic switch. To that end, we used next generation sequencing (NGS) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to generate miRNome and transcriptome signatures of the adipose tissue during the transition from late embryonic to early post-hatch development. As adipose tissue is well known to produce inflammatory and other immune factors, we used SPF white leghorns to generate the initial miRNome and transcriptome signatures to minimize complications from external factors (e.g., pathogenic infections) and ensure the identification of bona fide switch-associated miRNAs and transcripts. We then examined their expression signatures in the adipose tissue of broilers (Ross 708). Using E18 embryos as representative of pre-switching metabolism and D3 chicks as a representative of post-switching metabolism, we identified a group of miRNAs which work concordantly to regulate a diverse but interconnected group of developmental, immune and metabolic processes in the adipose tissue during the metabolic switch. Network mapping suggests that during the first days post-hatch, despite the consumption of feed, the chick is still heavily reliant upon adipose tissue lipid stores for energy production, and is not yet efficiently using their new energy source for de novo lipid storage. A number of core master regulatory pathways including, circadian rhythm transcriptional regulation and growth hormone (GH) signaling, likely work in concert with miRNAs to maintain an essential balance between adipogenic, lipolytic, developmental, and immunological processes in the adipose tissue during the metabolic switch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3achick embryos 3achicks 3acircadian rhythm 3aenergy 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asomatotropin 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aLiu, Hsiao-Ching 0 tGenes.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120201963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016100164520098800325592002801313650002101341650002001362650001501382650002901397650001901426653000801445653000801453653003901461653003701500653001801537653002901555653002301584653003601607700001601643700001201659700002201671700001601693700005401709773012401763856008301887852000901970655001201979IND60730109220221116193514.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073010922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ailing10aProduction mechanism of semicarbazide from protein in Chinese softshell turtles at different drying temperatures based on TMT-tagged quantitative proteomics  aTo investigate the production mechanism of semicarbazide from protein in Chinese softshell turtles at different drying temperatures, the tandem mass tags -tagged protein quantification technique and tandem mass spectrometry were used to screen the differentially abundant proteins of Chinese softshell turtles. Results showed that the protein content in the shells showed a decreasing trend with the increase of drying temperature, and the difference between the protein contents at 70 ℃ and 100 ℃ was significant (p < 0.05). It was found that 13 differentially abundant proteins were significantly correlated with the change in the amount of semicarbazide. As the drying temperature increased, semicarbazide was generated when the target differential abundance proteins were decomposed with the increase of thermal energy. These results provide a basis for more accurate detection of semicarbazide content in crustacean-based aquatic products from the perspective of proteomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood composition 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athermal energy 0aTMT 0aMRM 0aUntargeted quantitative proteomics 0aTargeted quantitative proteomics 0aSemicarbazide 0aChinese softshell turtle 0aDrying temperature 0aDifferentially abundant protein1 aChen, Yilin1 aNi, Zan1 aZhang, Chongsheng1 aCao, Minjie1 aCai, Luyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3996-15650 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 June, v. 99 p.103872-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013300167300001600300500001500316520108300331592002801414650001601442650001201458650001101470650002401481650002201505650001401527650001401541651001001555653002501565700001601590700001401606700001901620700001201639773009701651856008601748852000901834655001201843IND60096673020221122061648.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Shilei10aInvestigation and analysis on the energy consumption of starred hotel buildings in Hainan Province, the tropical region of China  ap. 570-580.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reported a study of energy consumption of 27 starred hotels in Hainan Province.

Eighteen potential independent significant factors were selected to analyze energy utilization indicators (EUIs) and the climate adjusted energy utilization indicators (EUIcₗₜ) were calculated by using the degree-day method. Then, multiple regression analysis between EUIcₗₜ and continuous scale factors was applied to establish the normalization EUI data model and results indicated that the electricity percentage, number of guestrooms and equivalent guestrooms are the key points influencing total energy efficiency of hotels. Lastly, on the basis of multi-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the EUIₙₒᵣₘ and categorical factors of the sampled hotel buildings, double glazing window is the significant factor that influences the total unit energy consumption greatly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3atropics 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aenergy efficiency 3abuildings 3aheat sums 3aChina 0aanalysis of variance1 aWei, Shasha1 aZhang, Ke1 aKong, Xiangfei1 aWu, Wei0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.570-580dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014200164300001600306500001900322520163000341592002801971596005301999596008002052650001202132650001302144650001502157650001102172700001802183700001402201773012402215856008202339852000902421655001202430IND60702384120221120050925.0200718e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-020-05284-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaohan10aInvestigation of the effect of the time step on the physics–dynamics interaction in CAM5 using an idealized tropical cyclone experiment  ap. 665-680.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo understand the effect of the time step on the physics–dynamics interaction in a model, we used an idealized tropical cyclone test to evaluate the sensitivities to the physics time step in the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5). The investigated time steps were 450, 900 and 1800 s at a resolution of 1°, and 225, 450, 900 and 1800 s at a resolution of 0.25° in the corresponding ensemble simulations. We found that the intensity and precipitation of the simulated tropical cyclone and the physics parameterizations are fairly sensitive to the time step. These sensitivities are affected by the dynamical core and the physics–dynamics coupling strategy and vary with the horizontal resolution. In low-resolution runs, the intensity of the simulated tropical cyclone varies little with physics time step in the finite volume (FV) dynamical core, but it tends to weaken with decreasing time steps in the spectral element (SE) dynamical core. The horizontal circulation of the tropical cyclone in both the FV and SE simulations increases as the length of the time step decreases in high-resolution runs, where large-scale condensation dominates. The sensitivities in the physical parameterizations to time step play an important role in regulating the impact of time step on the physics–dynamics interaction, especially in high-resolution simulations. Compared with the sequential coupling approach (ftype1) with a sudden adjustment at each physics time step in the SE core, the dribbling coupling strategy (ftype0) that adjusts the state more gradually weakens the effect of the physical parameterizations.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC150700cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2019Y002cChinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences Research Project Funds 3aclimate 3adynamics 3ahurricanes 3amodels1 aPeng, Xindong1 aZhang, Yi0 tClimate dynamics.g2020 Aug., v. 55, no. 3-4 p.665-680dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05284-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169520106100281592002801342650001501370650000901385650001001394650002101404650001401425650002401439650001501463650000901478650002201487650002201509650001301531650001601544650002201560650002101582650001401603653001801617653002101635653003501656653002601691700001601717700001701733700001901750700001801769700005601787773010801843856008601951852000902037655001202046IND60679624520221120185539.0200121e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067962452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1157902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huijing10aExtraction of sulfated agar from Gracilaria lemaneiformis using hydrogen peroxide-assisted enzymatic method  aIn this study, an eco-friendly extraction method was explored to obtain high sulfate content agar and repair the deficiency of enzymatic extraction by taking full advantage of H₂O₂. The sulfate content of EHA (H₂O₂-assisted enzymatic extracted agar) reached 3.56 %, which is significantly higher than that of traditional alkali-extracted agar (AA, 1.8 %). Moreover, EHA exhibited lower viscosity (9.4 cP), which improved 26.6 % and 14 % of filtration and gel dehydration rates than EA (enzymatic extracted agar), respectively. Additionally, the physicochemical properties of the agars were evaluated and compared. Among these agars, EHA showed some favorable properties, such as high yield (16.08 %) and low dissolution temperature (88.9 °C). The surface of algae became smoother after treatment with H₂O₂ due to effective degradation of cellulose. Besides, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that EHA preserved a great amount of sulfate, while thermogravimetric analysis suggested that the thermal stability of EA and EHA both decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilaria 3aagar 3aalgae 3aalkali treatment 3acellulose 3aenzymatic treatment 3afiltration 3agels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amass spectrometry 3asulfates 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity 0aSulfated agar 0aEnzymatic method 0aH2O2-assisted enzymatic method 0aAgar characterization1 aXiao, Qiong1 aWeng, Huifen1 aZhang, Yonghui1 aYang, Qiuming1 aXiao, Anfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0327-88600 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 232 p.115790-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1157903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009800169300001600267520103400283592002801317650001601345650001501361650000901376650001201385650001601397650002001413650001201433650001301445650001501458650001401473650001901487773010901506856004801615852000901663655001201672IND50067439220221122080156.0130628e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006743922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-013-0447-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakamatsu, Susumu10aMolecular phylogeny reveals phenotypic evolution of powdery mildews (Erysiphales, Ascomycota)  ap. 218-226.  aPowdery mildew fungi, comprising 16 genera and ca. 900 species, are exclusively obligate biotrophs of plants. Although several publications have addressed the phylogeny and evolution of powdery mildews based on morphology and host relationships, this review focuses on the evolution of several phenotypic characters based on molecular phylogeny: (1) morphology of appendages; (2) mycelium, ectoparasitic or endoparasitic; (3) number of asci per chasmothecium (fruiting body of powdery mildews), e.g., one to several; (4) conidiogenesis, conidia catenescent (i.e., maturing in chains: Euoidium-type) or maturing one at a time (Pseudoidium-type). Putative ancestral features of the powdery mildews are described as follows. In teleomorphs, large-sized chasmothecia, containing many 8-spored asci, had many appendages with uncinate-circinate apices, arising around the supraequatorial part of chasmothecia. In anamorphs, conidia were produced in chains (Euoidium-type) without distinct fibrosin bodies. Parasitism was ectoparasitic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErysiphales 3aappendages 3aasci 3aconidia 3aconidiation 3afruiting bodies 3amildews 3amycelium 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3apowdery mildew0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2013 July, v. 79, no. 4 p.218-226dSpringer-Verlagx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-013-0447-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100005800185245009000243300001800333520171500351592002802066596004302094650001502137650002302152650002502175650001202200650002502212650001102237650001302248650001502261650001302276650001902289650002302308650001302331650001502344650001602359650001702375650002302392650001702415651001602432651002302448651001802471700002402489700002102513700002102534773011402555856008102669852000902750655001202759IND60621267020221118105455.0181116e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062126702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-018-1102-x2doi7 a10.1007/s00267-018-1102-x2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDucey, Mark J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2027-118814aThe Influence of Human Demography on Land Cover Change in the Great Lakes States, USA  ap. 1089-1107.  aThe Great Lakes region contains productive agricultural and forest lands, but it is also highly urbanized, with 32 of its 52 million residents living in nine large metropolitan areas. Urbanization of undeveloped areas may adversely affect the productivity of agricultural and forest lands, and the provision of ecosystem services. We combine demographic and remote sensing data to evaluate land cover change in the region using a two-phase statistical modeling approach that predicts the incidence and extent of land cover change for each of the region’s 10,579 county subdivisions. Observed patterns are spatially uneven, and the probability of land cover change is influenced by current land use, human habitation, industry, and demographic change. Pseudo R² values varied from 0.053 to 0.338 for the first-phase logistic models predicting the presence of land cover change; second-stage beta models predicting the rate of change were more reliable, with pseudo R² ranging from 0.225 to 0.675. Overall, changes from agriculture or greenspace to development were much more predictable than changes from agriculture to greenspace or vice versa, and demographic variables were much more important in models predicting change to development. Although models successfully predicted the general location of land cover change, and models from before the Great Recession were useful for predicting the location but not the amount of change during the recession, fine-grained prediction remained challenging. Understanding where future changes are most probable can inform planning and policy-making, which may reduce the impact of development on resource production, environmental health, and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data  a14-JV-11242309080cU.S. Forest Service 3ademography 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental health 3aforests 3agreen infrastructure 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aland cover 3aland use 3alogit analysis 3ametropolitan areas 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aspatial data 3astatistical models 3aurbanization 3aGreat Lakes 3aGreat Lakes region 3aUnited States1 aJohnson, Kenneth M.1 aBelair, Ethan P.1 aCook, Barbara D.0 tEnvironmental management.g2018 Dec., v. 62, no. 6 p.1089-1107dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1102-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245015800206520107100364592002801435650001701463650001601480650002101496650001301517650001101530650002601541650002201567650001701589650002601606650001201632650001001644650001301654653002201667653001101689653003301700653001701733653002101750653002601771653004501797700006901842700002601911700002701937773012401964856008302088852000902171655001202180IND60730109420221116193519.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073010942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrata, Rafaela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7419-919610aSimultaneous determination of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone in baby foods available in the Brazilian market  aA liquid chromatography-diode array detection (LC-DAD) method is described for the simultaneous quantification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) in different types of baby foods.

Firstly, the high-efficient synergistic catalysis from metal-Mo monomer and Lewis & Bronsted acid-sites significantly improved transalkylation, attributed to a surface behavior (involving hydrogen spillover) may producing the active hydrogen-species which markedly enhance the proton-transfer efficiency in this proton-acid catalytic reaction. Secondly, the hydrogenation & subsequent ring-opening etc. side-reactions of naphthalene series and the formation of multi-alkylnaphthalene byproducts were almost completely suppressed due to both the passivation of the external surface of catalyst and the transition-state shape-selectivity & the diffusion-constraint effect inside pores. Besides, both the reasonable catalytic-hydrogenation (from metal-Mo monomer) immediately converting light olefins (from dealkylation) into alkanes and the transition-state shape-selectivity suppressing the formation of larger-molecular multi-alkylnaphthalenes in channels, effectively prevented from the coking-deactivation of catalyst. As a result, the 2-MN conversion of above 75.3% and the 2,6-DMN yield of above 9.7% were obtained during the 50 h on-stream reaction. Our work may provide a promising model for rationally designing the elegant catalyst for a complicated conversion reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adealkylation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3anaphthalene 3asilica 0a2,6-DMN 0aTransalkylation 0aC10 aromatics 0aMultifunctional catalyst 0aSynergistic catalysis 0aShape-selectivity1 aGong, Qing1 aLian, Hua1 aDing, Linfang1 aHu, Zhonghua1 aZhu, Zhirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9901-10890 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Oct., v. 378 p.144-152dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014000162506011700302506007600419520103500495592002801530506003701558650002101595650001801616650001701634650002501651650003001676650001201706650001401718650002601732650001901758650001701777651001001794653002701804653002501831653001701856653002101873653001301894653001101907653000801918653001001926653000801936653000801944653000801952653001201960653000701972653001001979653000801989653000801997653000802005653000802013653000902021653001002030653001002040653001002050653000802060653000802068653001002076653000802086653000802094653000702102653000702109653001102116653001002127653000902137653000802146653000802154653000802162653000702170653000802177653000802185653000702193653000702200653001102207653001102218653001002229653002002239653001102259700001502270700001602285700001502301700001802316700001602334700001702350700001302367700001902380773011202399856008202511852000902593655001202602IND60781929020221207082227.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078192902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2022.1051682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Bo-sai10aAnti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects of Moringa oleifera seeds on renal injury diabetic induced by streptozotocin  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam (MO) in India have various biological properties, such as anti-hyperglycemia, anti-fibrosis, and anti-oxidant. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious complications in diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of renal protection of MO seeds in DN is unclear. In this study, the DN rat model was generated by a single streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneal injection, which was used to explore the renal dysfunction effects of MO seeds. Pathological examination of diabetic kidney exhibited a significant change in glomerular and tubular structures. MO seeds treatment in DN rats attenuated these changes dose-dependently. MO seeds could exert anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis and anti-oxidative effects by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB and TGFβ1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways, and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, finally effectively attenuate renal injury of DN. And 4000 mg/kg MO seeds have the similar level of therapeutic effect as clinical doses of metformin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMoringa oleifera 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aintraperitoneal injection 3akidneys 3ametformin 3arenoprotective effect 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics 3aIndia 0aMoringa oleifera seeds 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress 0aFibrosis 0aα-SMA 0aALT 0aANOVA 0aAST 0aBUN 0aCAT 0aDCFH-DA 0aDN 0aELISA 0aESI 0aFBG 0aGPx 0aH&E 0aHO-1 0aIKKβ 0aKeap1 0aLC-MS 0aLSD 0aMAP 0aMCP-1 0aMDA 0aMET 0aMO 0aMS 0aNF-κB 0aNOX-4 0aNrf2 0aPBS 0aROS 0aSCr 0aSD 0aSOD 0aSTZ 0aTC 0aTG 0aTGF-β 0aTNF-α 0aT-SOD 0aUHPLC–QTOF-MS 0aVCAM-11 aWang, Xiao1 aZhang, Ying1 aGao, Cheng1 aWu, Cheng-kai1 aGuo, Si-rui1 aGu, Yan-ting1 aLi, Qing1 aWang, Jia-hong0 tJournal of functional foods.g2022 Aug., v. 95 p.105168-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2022.1051683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245009900209300001400308500001500322520112600337592002801463650001501491650001001506650001101516650001501527650003001542650001301572650002601585650002101611650001301632650001101645650001001656650001101666650002401677650002001701650001101721650001401732650002301746651001001769653001401779653001101793653001401804653002601818653002301844700002501867700002201892700003001914700006001944700001902004700002102023700006102044773013202105856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60550772920221120145228.0190416e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055077292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2016.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVannini, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4318-908810aDoes Gnomoniopsis castanea contribute to the natural biological control of chestnut gall wasp?  ap. 44-52.  a2019-12-06  aGnomoniopsis castanea has been reported as the causal agent of necrosis of chestnut wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) galls. The fungus is frequently observed on galls in chestnut stands infested by the insect in Italy. In the present study the impact of gall necrosis and the dynamic of its development have been studied in mature and young Castanea sativa stands in Central Italy during spring and early summer, before the D. kuriphilus adult flies. Results suggest that gall necrosis develops from resident endophytic inoculum of G. castanea. During the 2 y of monitoring, no differences were found in incidence and severity of the disease. Gall necrosis increased exponentially during the season, reaching 75,4% of galls totally necrotized in the investigated site in mid July. Gall necrosis was shown to have a severe impact on D. kuriphilus vitality, mostly impacting the adults inside the galls. Gall necrosis by G. castanea appears to efficiently control gall wasp in chestnut stands, although the high virulence of the fungus to chestnut fruits precludes its use as biocontrol agent in biological control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendophytes 3agalls 3afruits 3amonitoring 3abiological control agents 3anecrosis 3aDryocosmus kuriphilus 3adisease severity 3ainoculum 3aspring 3afungi 3asummer 3ainsect infestations 3aCastanea sativa 3aimagos 3avirulence 3abiological control 3aItaly 0aGall wasp 0aadults 0aEndophyte 0aGnomoniopsis castanea 0aBiological control1 aVettraino, AnnaMaria1 aMartignoni, Diana1 aMorales-Rodriguez, Carmen1 aContarini, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8348-29701 aCaccia, Romina1 aPaparatti, Bruno1 aSperanza, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0106-39380 tFungal biology.g2017 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.44-52dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2016.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002500153245012500178300001400303520146800317592002801785650001101813650001401824650002701838650001201865650001301877650002601890650002801916650002001944650001101964650001101975650001101986700001801997700002402015700002202039700002202061700002102083700002102104700002302125773010102148856008902249852000902338655001202347IND4448477720221117225009.0150812e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444847772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Francesco, Serena14aThe effect of season on oocyte quality and developmental competence in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis)  ap. 48-53.  aAt Italian latitudes, buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a seasonally polyestrous species, showing an improved reproductive efficiency when daylight decreases (autumn). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the season on buffalo oocyte recovery rate, on oocyte quality, assessed on morphological basis, and developmental competence after in vitro fertilization. For this purpose, buffalo ovaries were collected from a local abattoir and the oocytes obtained by aspirating the follicles were evaluated, classified and, if considered of good quality, devolved to the different procedures of IVEP. In general, no differences were found in terms of oocyte recovery per ovary among seasons, but interestingly, the percentage of small oocytes was higher (P<0.05) during spring and summer (0.9±0.1 and 0.9±0.2) compared to autumn and winter (0.3±0.1 and 0.2±0.1). Both cleavage and embryo rate increased during the period from October to December (71.7±3.1 and 26.5±2.1, respectively) compared to the period from April to June (58.0±2.4 and 18.8±1.6, respectively), thus reflecting the in vivo reproductive behavior. Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that transferrable embryos were produced in vitro, even during the unfavorable season, but with decreased efficiency. In conclusion, these results suggest to avoid the oocyte collection during spring when planning OPU trials in order to save resources and improve the benefits/costs ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abuffaloes 3ain vitro fertilization 3aoocytes 3aplanning 3areproductive behavior 3areproductive efficiency 3aslaughterhouses 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter1 aBoccia, Lucia1 aCampanile, Giuseppe1 aDi Palo, Rossella1 aVecchio, Domenico1 aNeglia, Gianluca1 aZicarelli, Luigi1 aGasparrini, Bianca0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2011 Jan., v. 123, no. 1-2 p.48-53dElsevier B.V.x0378-43207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245013200219300001600351506007600367520124100443592002801684506003701712650002101749650002101770650001201791650002901803650001201832650002101844650001101865650002501876650001501901650002201916651001101938700002201949700002301971700002201994700003302016773008402049856008102133852000902214655001202223IND60518200220221207141110.0160408e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051820022DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-015-0761-62doi7 aPMC48247092pmcid7 a267439102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Gabriela M.

Such studies have proven helpful in increasing the knowledge of the history of a landscape, recognizing past formations and projecting its future. Our research objective was to determine how a landscape dominated by the palm tree Attalea speciosa, a species of ecological, economic, and cultural importance, has been changing over time by synthesizing and comparing historical documents and local perceptions. This study was conducted in Araripe Environmental Protection Area, Northeast Region, Brazil. To understand local landscape change, we interviewed active harvesters in four communities in which A. speciosa use has been documented. Historical documents were evaluated as a complement to the interview data. According to local informants, areas previously used for cultivation and animal husbandry that were abandoned or decimated by droughts in the region may have fostered the expansion of a monodominant A. speciosa forest. Furthermore, other forms of landscape management resulting from human population growth may also have affected the current and past distribution of this forest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAttalea speciosa 3aanimal husbandry 3adrought 3aenvironmental protection 3aforests 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3apopulation growth 3aBrazil1 aRamos, Marcelo A.1 aAraújo, Elcida L.1 aBaldauf, Cristina1 aAlbuquerque, Ulysses Paulino0 tAmbio.g2016 May, v. 45, no. 4 p.458-467dSpringer Netherlandsx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-015-0761-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245009500132300001400227500001400241520095700255592002801212650002401240650001601264650001201280650001001292650001401302650001601316650001801332650001001350650001701360650001601377650003101393650001301424650001501437650001101452650000901463650001401472650001101486653002501497700001701522700002101539773015401560852000901714655001201723IND60716888420221119184809.0201107e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071688842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Pratibha10aPhysico-chemical properties of six varieties of taro (Colocasia esculenta l.

R.10aSelection in a fluctuating environment leads to decreased genetic variation and facilitates the evolution of phenotypic plasticity  ap. 1275-1290.  aChanges in the environment are expected to induce changes in the quantitative genetic variation, which influences the ability of a population to adapt to environmental change. Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but fluctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a split‐brood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental fluctuations. Our study highlights that environmental fluctuations should be considered when investigating the response of a population to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aenvironmental exposure 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic plasticity 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgenetics. 2aBiological Evolution 2aEnvironment 2aGenetic Variation1 aBJÖRKLUND, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2012 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.1275-1290dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02512.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245016900200506007600369520142500445592002801870506003701898650002101935650002201956650003901978650002002017650002402037650001702061650001502078650002902093650001602122650002002138650003102158650001002189650003202199650001302231650001102244650002202255650001602277700001402293700001602307773011802323856007702441852000902518655001202527IND60649008420221207132901.0190702e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900842DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100503442doi7 aPMC65625892pmcid7 a310677972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuyan 10aDNA Methylation Analysis of the <i>Citrullus lanatus</i> Response to <i>Cucumber Green</i> <i>Mottle Mosaic Virus</i> Infection by Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark associated with plant immunity, but little is known about its roles in viral infection of watermelon. We carried out whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of watermelon leaves at 0 h (ck), 48 h, and 25 days post-inoculation with Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV). The number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) increased during CGMMV infection and 2788 DMR-associated genes (DMGs) were screened out among three libraries. Most DMRs and DMGs were obtained under the CHH context. These DMGs were significantly enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of secondary biosynthesis and metabolism, plant&ndash;pathogen interactions, Toll-like receptor signaling, and ABC transporters. Additionally, DMGs encoding PR1a, CaMs, calcium-binding protein, RIN4, BAK1, WRKYs, RBOHs, STKs, and RLPs/RLKs were involved in the watermelon&ndash;CGMMV interaction and signaling. The association between DNA methylation and gene expression was analyzed by RNA-seq and no clear relationship was detected. Moreover, downregulation of genes in the RdDM pathway suggested the reduced RdDM-directed CHH methylation plays an important role in antiviral defense in watermelon. Our findings provide genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of watermelon and will aid in revealing the molecular mechanism in response to CGMMV infection at the methylation level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aCucumber green mottle mosaic virus 3aDNA methylation 3aToll-like receptors 3abiosynthesis 3abisulfites 3acalcium-binding proteins 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3asequence analysis 3awatermelons1 aFan, Min 1 aHe, Yanjun 0 tGenes.g2019 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100503443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300001600289520107400305592002801379650001101407650001401418650001001432650002101442650001401463650001501477650001901492650001401511650001501525650002401540650002101564700001901585700002001604700001401624700001701638700001701655700001501672773013901687856007401826852000901900655001201909IND60626995420221120192950.0190128e20190116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062699542DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb02573h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xuan10aCarbon-mediated synthesis of shape-controllable manganese phosphate as nanozymes for modulation of superoxide anions in HeLa cells  ap. 401-407.  aTransition metal phosphates have shown great potential as nanozymes for selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but its application has been hindered by the complicated synthesis and difficulty in shape and size control. Herein, we present a facile method to fabricate transition metal phosphates by using hollow carbon structures as substrates. Manganese phosphate is a typical Nanozyme used in this design and the shape and size of the Mnₓ(PO₄)y layer can be efficiently controlled by altering the carbon substrates. Characterization demonstrated that Mnₓ(PO₄)y layer modified hollow carbon sphere (Mn-MPSA-HCS) and hollow carbon cubic (Mn-MPSA-HCC) were successfully prepared and used as nanozymes for superoxide detection. The established electrochemical sensor was employed in the online monitoring of drug stimulated superoxide anions released from cancer cells. This method can be adapted as a general way to prepare transition metal phosphate layers with various controllable shapes and sizes as nanozymes for different uses in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemistry 3adrugs 3ahuman cell lines 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphates 3asensors (equipment) 3asuperoxide anion1 aWang, Zhenxing1 aZhang, Huanhuan1 aLi, Yufei1 aChen, Kaicha1 aZhao, Hongli1 aLan, Minbo0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 3 p.401-407dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb02573h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245018300164300001600347520080200363592002801165650003401193650003001227650002701257650001701284650001801301650001001319653001301329653002401342653002601366653001301392653001201405700001501417700001301432700001701445700001401462700001701476700001501493700001601508700001401524773007601538856008401614852000901698655001201707IND60552212920221120173306.0161020e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055221292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Chao10aIdentification of multiple peptides with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities from skin and its secretions of Hylarana taipehensis, Amolops lifanensis, and Amolops granulosus  ap. 192-201.  aAmphibian skin and its secretions contain many kinds of peptides with different bioactivities.

Saba and Baoshan pigs without saddleback were located in the high-altitude area of Yunnan Province, while Tunchang and Ding&rsquo;an pigs with saddleback were located in the low-altitude area of Hainan Province. Although these pigs are different in appearance, the underlying genetic differences have not been investigated. In this study, based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of 124 samples, both the cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) and the fixation index (F<inf>ST</inf>) statistic were used to identify potential signatures of selection in these pig breeds. We found nine potential signatures of selection detected simultaneously by two methods, annotated 22 genes in Hainan pigs, when Baoshan pigs were used as the reference group. In addition, eleven potential signatures of selection detected simultaneously by two methods, annotated 24 genes in Hainan pigs compared with Saba pigs. These candidate genes were most enriched in GO: 0048015~phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling and ssc00604: Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis&mdash;ganglio series. These selection signatures were likely to overlap with quantitative trait loci associated with meat quality traits. Furthermore, one potential selection signature, which was associated with different coat color, was detected in Hainan pigs. These results contribute to a better understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of South China indigenous pigs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3aindigenous species 3ameat quality 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 3aswine breeds 3aChina1 aHuang, Shuwen 1 aChen, Zitao 1 aTeng, Jinyan 1 aMa, Yunlong 1 aYuan, Xiaolong 1 aChen, Zanmou 1 aZhang, Hao 1 aLi, Jiaqi 1 aZhang, Zhe 0 tGenes.g2019 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100503463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009300166300001600259520110200275592002801377650002401405650001401429650002301443650002101466650001301487650001301500650001201513650001301525650001101538650001401549650001701563653002601580653003401606653002401640653002101664653001801685700001801703700001401721700001601735700001601751700001901767700001701786700005601803773010201859856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60662805020221118134817.0191024e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066280502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yanfeng10aπ–π interaction effect in insertion polymerization with α-Diimine palladium systems  ap. 184-191.  aControl of branching densities of polyolefins by polymerization conditions is a great challenge in the field of α-diimine palladium catalyzed olefin (co)polymerization. In this contribution, a series of acenaphthene-based highly sterically hindered α-diimine ligands bearing bulky diarylmethyl moiety and corresponding palladium catalysts have been designed, synthesized, characterized and investigated for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with several polar monomers. The π-π interaction between the acenaphthene moiety and the phenyl of diarylmethyl moiety was observed. It was suggested that this π-π interaction could freeze the N-aryl-bond rotation at room temperature, resulting in the enhanced axial steric bulk as well as the low branching densities of the polyethylene products. In contrast, at high temperature, the π-π interaction was weaken and resulted in significantly increased branching densities of polyethylene products, indicating branching densities of polyolefins are adjustable within a wide range by polymerization conditions using this catalytic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopolymerization 3aethylene 3afreezing 3aligands 3amoieties 3aolefin 3apalladium 3apolyethylene 0aOlefin polymerization 0aα-diimine palladium catalyst 0aπ–π interaction 0aCopolymerization 0aPolar monomer1 aLi, Shuaikang1 aTan, Chen1 aKong, Wenyu1 aXu, Guoyong1 aZhang, Shaojie1 aLiu, Binyuan1 aDai, Shengyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4110-76910 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Oct., v. 378 p.184-191dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245007300160300001600233500001900249520162700268592002801895650001801923650001301941650001701954650001301971650001201984650001801996650001802014650001402032651001202046653001702058653002502075653002302100653002002123653002002143700001802163700001802181700002502199700002402224700002702248700001602275700002402291700002302315700001802338700002002356773011002376856007702486852000902563655001202572IND60680109020221119062455.0200104e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068010902DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2019-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayda, Yuriy10aSeed orchards in Ukraine: past, present and prospects for the future  ap. 284-298.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe seed orchards (SO) serve possibilities to collect seeds from the selected genotypes or to create artificial population throughout the controlled crossing of the target genotypes. Therefore, the seed material obtained from the clonal and seedling seed orchards offers unique opportunity to improve the genetic value of seeds. Thus, the seed orchards are considered as an important part of the forest seed base being the key object for both modern forestry and forestry research. This paper outlines the forest breeding activities associated with the seed production in the seed orchards in Ukraine over the last 70 years. During this period, the different aspects related to the establishment and management of the seed orchard were studied. In these processes, many failures had occurred, their causes and consequences were described. These main breeding activities were reported considering plain and mountain regions of Ukraine as well as specific aspects of the reproduction of the main forest tree species. As of 2019, the total area of the clonal seed orchards (CSO) reached 1040.3 ha, while seedling seed orchards (SSO) only 273.7 ha. The results of research on the growth, reproductive development, the morphology of the plus trees clones in the SO were generalized. The article on the current problems and challenges for Ukrainian forestry mainly related to forest tree breeding and there was also focus on forest seed industry. For the main forest trees species (Scots pine, English oak and other), targeted breeding programs should be developed. It is relevant to create the genetic bank of the forest seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3acrossing 3aforest trees 3aforestry 3aforests 3aseed industry 3aseed orchards 3aseedlings 3aUkraine 0aseed orchard 0aforest seed material 0aUkrainian forestry 0aforest breeding 0aseed production1 aLos, Svitlana1 aYatsyk, Roman1 aTereshchenko, Larisa1 aShlonchak, Grygoriy1 aMytrochenko, Valentyna1 aNeyko, Ihor1 aSamodai, Viacheslav1 aSmashnyuk, Ludmila1 aKlisz, Marcin1 aMohytych, Vasyl0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 61, no. 4 p.284-298dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2019-00283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002800167245013600195300001600331520132600347592002801673650001301701650002101714650001901735650001101754650001601765650001001781650003501791650000901826650002201835650001901857650001201876650001901888650001301907650001501920650003901935650005201974650002002026650001502046650002102061650001102082650002602093650002502119650004602144650001802190650002202208650001602230650004002246650003302286650002102319650003002340650002602370700001902396700002602415700001702441700001902458773008102477856008202558852000902640655001202649IND60099006820221119091101.0141105e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009900682DNAL7 a230065862pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrivastava, Alok Kumar10aalr0882 encoding a hypothetical protein of Anabaena PCC7120 protects Escherichia coli from nutrient starvation and abiotic stresses  ap. 248-255.  aThis study is the first to demonstrate cloning of alr0882, a hypothetical protein gene of Anabaena PCC7120, its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli strain LN29MG1655 (∆uspA::Kan) and functional complementation of abiotic stress tolerance of E. coli UspA. The recombinant vector pGEX-5X-2-alr0882 was used to transform ∆uspA E. coli strain. The IPTG induced expression of a 56.6kDa GST fusion protein was visualized on SDS–PAGE and attested by immunoblotting. E. coli ∆uspA strain harboring pGEX-5X-2-alr0882 when grown under carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur limitation and abiotic stresses e.g. nalidixic acid, cycloserine, CdCl₂, H₂O₂, UV-B, phenazine methosulphate (PMS), dinitrophenol (DNP), NaCl, heat, carbofuron and CuCl₂ demonstrated about 22.6–51.6% increase in growth over the cells transformed with empty vector. Expression of alr0882 gene in mutant E. coli as measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at different time points under selected treatments reaffirmed its role in tolerance against stresses employed in this study. Thus the results of this study vividly demonstrated that the novel protein alr0882, although appreciably different from the known UspA of E. coli, offers tolerance to abiotic stresses hence holds potential for the development of transgenic cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aEscherichia coli 3aabiotic stress 3acarbon 3acycloserine 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheat 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoblotting 3amutants 3analidixic acid 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asodium chloride 3astarvation 3astress tolerance 3asulfur 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnabaenaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aDNA Primers 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aStress, Physiological1 aPandey, Sarita1 aSingh, Prashant Kumar1 aRai, Snigdha1 aRai, Lal Chand0 tGene.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 511, no. 2 p.248-255dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245012800204506007600332520162300408592002802031506003702059650001202096650001502108650002502123650002402148650002202172650001002194650001502204650001502219650001702234650002302251650001502274650001302289650003002302650001402332650004502346650000902391650003502400650001402435650001002449700001602459700001802475700001902493700002002512700001902532700001802551700001902569773011802588856007702706852000902783655001202792IND60649008720221207134808.0190702e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900872DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100503472doi7 aPMC65629802pmcid7 a310678182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Han  Sung10aAssociation Study between the Polymorphisms of Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) Genes and Idiopathic Recurrent Pregnancy Loss  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) refers to two or more consecutive pregnancy losses. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of women experience RPL. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that play important roles in providing a safe and conducive environment for the stable development of the fetus. In this case-control study, we evaluated the associations between RPL and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP-8 and MMP-27. We recruited 375 Korean women with a history of RPL and 240 ethnically-matched healthy parous controls, and we performed genotyping for the MMP-8 rs2509013 C>T, MMP-8 rs11225395 G>A, and MMP-27 rs3809017 T>C polymorphisms. All SNPs were genotyped via the polymerase chain reaction&ndash;restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. In the genotype frequency analyses, the TT genotype of the MMP-8 rs2509013 C>T (age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.415; 95% confidence interval, 0.257&ndash;0.671; P = 0.0003) and TC genotype of MMP-27 rs3809017 T>C (age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.681; 95% confidence interval, 0.483&ndash;0.961; P = 0.029) were associated with decreased RPL susceptibility. Moreover, these trends were maintained in the haplotype and genotype combination analyses. Interestingly, amongst the RPL patients, higher levels of homocysteine (P = 0.042) and uric acid (P = 0.046) were associated with MMP-27 rs3809017 T>C. In conclusion, the two polymorphisms of MMP-8 and MMP-27 were significantly associated with RPL risk, both individually and in combination. Therefore, these two polymorphisms are potential biomarkers for RPL susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKoreans 3abiomarkers 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3afetal development 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3ahomocysteine 3ametalloproteinases 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apregnancy 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3auric acid 3awomen1 aKo, Ki  Han1 aKim, Jung  Oh1 aAn, Hui  Jeong1 aKim, Young  Ran1 aKim, Ji  Hyang1 aLee, Woo  Sik1 aKim, Nam  Keun0 tGenes.g2019 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100503473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245009200198506007600290520147300366592002801839506003701867650001101904650001001915650001101925650001001936650001501946650002501961650001001986650002101996650001202017700001502029700001802044700001702062700001302079700001602092700001902108700001802127700001902145773011802164856007702282852000902359655001202368IND60649008820221207134804.0190702e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900882DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100503482doi7 aPMC65625362pmcid7 a310678202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Yu 10aIdentification and Conservation Analysis of <i>Cis</i>-Regulatory Elements in Pig Liver  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe liver plays a key role in metabolism and affects pig production. However, the functional annotation of noncoding regions of the pig liver remains poorly understood. We revealed the landscape of cis-regulatory elements and their functional characterization in pig liver. We identified 102,373 cis-regulatory elements in the pig liver, including enhancers, promoters, super-enhancers, and broad H3K4me3 domains, and highlighted 26 core transcription regulatory factors in the pig liver as well. We found similarity of cis-regulatory elements among those of pigs, humans, and cattle. Despite the low proportion of functionally conserved enhancers (~30%) between pig and human liver tissue, ~78% of the pig liver enhancer orthologues sequence could play an enhancer role in other human tissues. Additionally, we observed that the ratio of consistent super-enhancer-associated genes was significantly higher than the ratio of functionally conserved super-enhancers. Approximately 54% of the core regulation factors driven by super-enhancers were consistent across the liver from these three species. Our pig liver annotation and functional characterization studies provide a system and resource for noncoding annotation for future gene regulatory studies in pigs. Furthermore, our study also showed the high level functional conservation of cis-regulatory elements in mammals; it also improved our understanding of regulation function of mammal cis-regulatory elements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acattle 3agenes 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametabolism 3aregulatory sequences 3aswine 3aswine production 3atissues1 aZhang, Lu 1 aHu, Mingyang 1 aXu, Yueyuan 1 aHou, Ye 1 aLi, Xinyun 1 aZhao, Shuhong 1 aZhao, Yunxia 1 aLi, Changchun 0 tGenes.g2019 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100503483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169520187600290592002802166650001602194650001402210650001202224650001602236650002502252650001602277650002502293650002902318650002702347650002002374650001802394650001502412650001302427650002602440650002802466650001502494653001502509653002502524653001602549653001202565653001402577653001302591700002602604773011802630856008202748852000902830655001202839IND60734979520221121032751.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073497952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagappan, Senthil10aInvestigation of four microalgae in nitrogen deficient synthetic wastewater for biorefinery based biofuel production  aMicroalgae are a possible source of biofuel, but no commercial development has yet been developed. Possible approaches to improve economic feasibility involve increasing lipid content and the usage of biorefinery in microalgae. In this regard, the nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater was fed to four microalgae to increase the lipid and carbohydrate content. In conjunction, changes in the amount of biorefinery components, including proteins and pigments, during nitrogen synthetic wastewater feeding have also been reported. The study revealed that both lipids and carbohydrates increased as much as 2 and 1.5 times in selected microalgae after 20 days of nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater relative to nitrogen sufficient conditions, respectively. In particular, after 20 days of exposure to nitrogen deficient synthetic wastewater, the highest Lipid content of 40% was displayed by Desmodesmus sp. The same species had also shown an increased carbohydrate content of 18.3%. Carotenoids was retained in Desmodemsus sp. (0.03%) through nitrogen deficiency, but were shown to be reduced in three other algae. Analysis of the FAME profile of four nitrogen-deficient microalgae indicated that lipid was promising for biodiesel production as it showed an increase in saturated fatty acid content and a decrease in unsaturated fatty acid content. However, during nitrogen insufficiency, unavoidable side reactions involving reductions in protein levels, chlorophylls (a and b type) and biomass were observed in all four microalgae. But 23.3% protein was found in Desmodesmus sp. at end of 20th day of nitrogen deprivation The study showed that feeding of nitrogen-deficient-synthetic wastewater raised the lipid and carbohydrate content and maintained carotenoids in selected microalgae. Above said approach is possibly a low cost economical option for biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesmodesmus 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acarbohydrate content 3acarotenoids 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenvironmental technology 3afatty acid composition 3afuel production 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3asaturated fatty acids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3awastewater 0aMicroalgae 0aNitrogen deprivation 0aBiorefinery 0aBiofuel 0aBiodiesel 0aPigments1 aKumar, Gopalakrishnan0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101572-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011600165300001200281520180400293592002802097650002402125650002502149650001202174650001102186650001302197650001502210650001402225650002002239650001202259650001002271650001502281650002002296650002202316650003002338650001402368650002702382650002502409650001402434651001002448700001802458773014402476856008202620852000902702655001202711IND60611683020221121232811.0180913e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061168302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-018-2524-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Garima10aPopulation structure and virulence analysis of Alternaria carthami isolates of India using ISSR and SSR markers  ap. 140.  aAlternaria leaf spot caused by Alternaria carthami is one of the most devastating diseases of safflower. Diversity among 95 isolates of A. carthami was determined using virulence assays, enzyme assays, dominant (ISSR) and co-dominant (SSR) markers. Collections and isolations were made from three major safflower producing states of India. The virulence assays categorised the population into four groups based on level of virulence. Estimation of activities of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDE) yielded concurrent results to virulence assays with maximum CWDE activities in most virulent group. Eighteen ISSR primers were used and 23 polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed to assess the genetic diversity and determine the population structure of A. carthami. Analysis of ISSR profiles revealed high genetic diversity (Nei’s Genetic diversity index; h = 0.36). Microsatellite markers produced a total of 56 alleles with an average of 2.43 alleles per microsatellite marker and Nei’s genetic diversity index as h = 0.43. Unweighted Neighbor-joining and population structure analysis using both the marker systems differently arranged the isolates into three clusters. Distance analysis of the marker profiles provided no evidence for geographical clustering of isolates, indicating that isolates are randomly spread across India, signifying high potential of the fungus to adapt to diverse regions. Microsatellite markers clustered the isolates in consonance to the virulence groups in the dendrogram. This implies that the fungus has a high potential to adapt to resistant cultivars or fungicides. The information can aid in the breeding and deployment of A. carthami resistant varieties, and in early blight disease management in all safflower growing regions of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria carthami 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aalleles 3ablight 3abreeding 3acell walls 3acultivars 3adisease control 3aenzymes 3afungi 3afungicides 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3aleaf spot 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3avirulence 3aIndia1 aKapoor, Rupam0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Sept., v. 34, no. 9 p.140-140dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-018-2524-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013700157300001800294520159800312592002801910650001601938650000901954650002801963650001701991650001402008650001502022650001102037650000902048650002002057650001002077650001402087650001002101650000902111650001502120650001602135650001302151650001802164650002202182650001302204650002402217650000902241651001002250653002402260653002102284653002502305653001302330700001602343700001402359700001502373700001702388700002002405700001902425700001602444773015402460856007802614852000902692655001202701IND60631105620221121210142.0190219e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063110562DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-136172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lu10aIdentification and proteolytic activity quantification of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from different raw milks at storage temperatures  ap. 2897-2905.  aCommercial milk products worldwide come not only from cows, but also from goats, buffaloes, camels, and yaks. Milk from non-bovine animals is important culturally and economically. Pseudomonas spp. are frequently linked to milk spoilage under storage temperatures. The objectives of this study were to identify Pseudomonas spp. isolated from goat, buffalo, camel, and yak milks, and to measure proteolytic activity of Pseudomonas spp. under different storage temperatures. Raw milk samples of goat (n = 50), buffalo (n = 25), camel (n = 25), and yak (n = 25) were collected from 5 provinces in China. Pseudomonas spp. were analyzed by Pseudomonas-specific 16S, universal 16S rRNA, and rpoB gene sequence analyses. Proteolytic activity on milk agar, quantification via the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid assay at 2°C, 4°C, 7°C, 10°C and 25°C, as well as alkaline peptidase gene (aprX) identification were performed to ascertain the proteolytic activity of these isolates. Pseudomonas spp. were found in 46 samples out of total 125 samples. A total of 67 Pseudomonas spp. were identified. Of Pseudomonas isolates, we obtained extracellular peptidase activity in 7 (10.4%) at 2°C, 17 (25.4%) at 4°C, 24 (35.8%) at 7°C, 39 (58.2%) at 10°C, and 41 (61.2%) at 25°C. The results revealed that a wide diversity of Pseudomonas spp. were present in different non-bovine raw milks, with the ability to produce peptidases at storage temperatures. However, proteolytic activity varied widely among the peptidase-positive isolates.

Snowmelt favors the areal recharge of the system. This process is reflected in the large proportion of groundwater flowing through the connected porosity structure of the karst aquifer, which amounts the 75% of the total system water discharge. From the perspective of water resources recovery, the water capacity of the fissured-porous zone (matrix) represents 99% of the total karst system storage. The volume associated to the karst conduits is very small. The estimated mean travel times are 9 days for conduits and 475 days for connected porosity. These short travel times reveal high vulnerability of the karst system to pollutants in broad sense and a great impact of climate change on the associated water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleogene period 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironment 3aeosin 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3alimestone 3anational parks 3aporosity 3asnowmelt 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awater table 3aSpain 0aWater isotopes 0aDye tracers 0aTransit time 0aRecharge 0aAlpine karst hydrology 0aParque Nacional de Ordesa y Monte Perdido1 aGonzález-Ramón, A.1 aMartos-Rosillo, S.1 aHeredia, J.1 aHerrera, C.1 aUrrutia, J.1 aCaballero, Y.1 aZabaleta, A.1 aAntigüedad, I.1 aCustodio, E.1 aLambán, L.J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 748 p.141363-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1413633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015200164300001800316520153100334592002801865650001501893650001101908650001901919650001601938650001201954650001701966650001101983650001201994650001702006650002902023650001202052650001402064650002602078650001902104650001902123650002702142650002202169650000902191650001102200653001102211653002402222653002902246653002602275700001902301700001802320700002802338700001702366773015402383856007802537852000902615655001202624IND60631105720221121173946.0190219e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063110572DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-137742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisner, Derrick10aFermentation and distillation of cheese whey: Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions and water use in the production of whey spirits and white whiskey  ap. 2963-2973.  aWhey disposal can be both an environmental and economic challenge for artisanal creameries. Lactose in whey can be fermented to produce ethanol and subsequently distilled. The objective of this study was to use a process-based life cycle analysis to compare carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions and water usage associated with the artisanal or craft production of clear, unaged spirits using whey or malted barley as fermentation substrate. Differences in production were assessed based on key process differences: energy used, water used, distillation by-product disposal, and mass of CO2 produced during fermentation. For this study, whey was assumed removed from the artisanal creamery waste stream. Quantifiable differences were evaluated per 750-mL (45% alcohol by volume) functional unit and expressed as mass-equivalent CO2 emissions (kg of CO2e) and mass of water (kg) used. The CO2e emissions and water usage were quantified using published data, thermodynamic calculations, and mass-balance calculations for a hypothetical distillation system. The process-based life cycle analysis estimated that distillation of fermented whey reduced overall CO2e emissions by 8.4 kg per functional unit and required 0.44 kg less water added into the production process compared with production of a similar clear, unaged spirit using malted barley as substrate. Our preliminary analysis suggests that conversion to distilled whey spirit is a more environmentally responsible approach compared with landfill disposal of whey.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acheese whey 3adairies 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afermentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alactose 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3amalting barley 3athermodynamics 3atraditional technology 3awater utilization 3awhey 3awhisky 0acarbon 0alife cycle analysis 0aartisanal creamery waste 0adistilled whey spirit1 aShayevitz, Avi1 aHaapala, Karl1 aMeunier-Goddik, Lisbeth1 aHughes, Paul0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Apr., v. 101, no. 4 p.2963-2973dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-137743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01264naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009500207300001300302500002200315520009400337592002800431650002200459650001900481651001100500700002100511700002400532700002800556700002000584700002100604700001900625700003000644700002200674773011600696856008100812852000900893655001200902IND60611683220221121232816.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061168322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-018-1596-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanneste, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5296-917X10aCorrection to: Impact of climate change on alpine vegetation of mountain summits in Norway  ap. 1081.  aPublished Erratum  aThe article, Impact of climate change on alpine vegetation of mountain summits in Norway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine vegetation 3aclimate change 3aNorway1 aMichelsen, Ottar1 aGraae, Bente Jessen1 aKyrkjeeide, Magni Olsen1 aHolien, Håkon,1 aHassel, Kristian1 aLindmo, Sigrid1 aKapás, Rozália Erzsebet1 aDe Frenne, Pieter0 tEcological research.g2018 Sept., v. 33, no. 5 p.1081-1081dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-018-1596-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007100167300001700238500001500255520183400270592002802104650000902132650002202141650001902163650001302182650001502195650001602210650001302226650000902239650000902248650001302257650002002270651001402290651001802304651002302322653001402345700002102359700002002380700002302400773010602423856004802529852000902577655001202586IND4470902120221117231907.0120516e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447090212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-012-0521-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuedel, Burton C.14aThe effects of suspended sediment on walleye (Sander vitreus) eggs  ap. 995-1003.  a2019-12-06  aPURPOSE: Sediment resuspension is among the most widely cited concerns that lead to restricted dredging timeframes. Protection of fish species is a primary concern regarding the effects of dredging operations, yet experimental data establishing thresholds for uncontaminated suspended sediment effects are largely lacking. We conducted research to determine suspended sediment effects on walleye (Sander vitreus) egg hatching success and gross morphology following exposures mimicking sediment resuspension during dredging operations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly spawned eggs of northern and southern walleye strains were continuously exposed for 3 days to suspended sediment concentrations of 0, 100, 250, and 500 mg l−1, using sediment from Maumee Bay, OH, USA. These concentrations spanned the range measured in the vicinity of dredging operations in the Western Basin of Lake Erie. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Northern and southern strain egg hatching rates were 53% and 39% of exposed eggs and 82% and 74% of viable eggs exposed, which are within reported ranges for this species. Data indicated no statistically significant effects of suspended sediment on hatching success. Gross morphological observations of exposed fry yielded no evidence of detrimental effects. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results indicated that walleye eggs are relatively tolerant to exposures likely to be encountered at dredging projects as performed in the Great Lakes region. Our results suggest that, given detailed knowledge of dredging project site-specific conditions and the mode of dredging to be used, better informed decisions can be made regarding adequate protective management practices. In many cases, flexibility could be given to the dredging contractor while maintaining a very low probability of risk to walleye spawning habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3adredged materials 3aSander vitreus 3aspawning 3awatersheds 3acontractors 3ahatching 3afish 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3adecision making 3aLake Erie 3aUnited States 3aGreat Lakes region 0asediments1 aLutz, Charles H.1 aClarke, Joan U.1 aClarke, Douglas G.0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.995-1003dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0521-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245013100158520098300289592002801272650001601300650001501316650001501331650002201346650003101368650002901399650001401428650001901442650001301461650002401474650001901498650000701517650002301524650001601547653001401563653002401577653000801601653001701609653002101626700001401647700001601661700001301677700001601690700001701706773011801723856008201841852000901923655001201932IND60734979820221121024220.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073497982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo, Le12aA novel adsorbent Auricularia Auricular for the removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution: Isotherm and kinetics studies  aIn this paper, two kinds of Auricularia Auricular (edible fungi, AA) were used as the adsorbent on the adsorption of methylene blue (MB). The effects of pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, ionic strength, temperature and the characterization of adsorbents were carried out. The mathematical model fitting of the adsorption isotherm process and adsorption kinetics was investigated. The results showed that under the condition of dye concentration of 25 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 0.8 g/L, pH of 7.0, temperature of 25 °C and adsorption time of 60 min, AA had a pretty adsorption capacity with MB. The adsorption behavior of MB conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir isotherm adsorption equation could better describe the adsorption of MB by AA. The saturated adsorption capacity of MB onto AA-1 and AA-2 were 208.33 mg/g and 263.16 mg/g, respectively.

This represents the 15th endemic species occurring in Refugio de Vida Silvestre Texíguat, one of the richest herpetofaunal sites in Honduras, itself being the country with the highest degree of herpetofaunal endemism in Central America. We name this new species in honor of a Honduran conservationist slain in fighting against illegal logging, highlighting the sacrifices of rural activists in battling these issues and the critical importance of conservation in these areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aViperidae 3acolor 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3anew species 3aCosta Rica 3aHonduras 3aPanama 0aBothriechis guifarroi sp. n. 0aBothriechis lateralis 0aBothriechis marchi 0aCentral America 0aconservation 0acryptic species 0aendemic 0aPico Bonito National Park 0aTexíguat Wildlife Refuge1 aMedina-Flores, Melissa1 aWilson, Larry David1 aJadin, Robert C.1 aAustin, James D.0 tZooKeys.g2013 May 13, v. 298 p.77-106dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.298.48343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04237naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024001900135024002200154024003800176040001800214100002800232245013200260300001800392506007600410506003100486520154500517592002802062596007502090596008302165596006802248596009102316596004902407506003702456650001402493650001502507650002002522650001102542650002302553650002202576650001502598650001802613650002602631650001602657650000902673650002402682650002402706650001402730650001402744650001702758650002902775650001802804653001402822653001802836653001102854653001302865653001502878653001702893700002202910700002202932700002202954700002202976700002202998700002003020700002203040700001803062700002403080700002203104700002803126700002003154700002203174700001903196773012203215856008503337852000903422655001203431IND60612203420221215142548.0200517e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061220342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.07.0072chorus7 a300535992pmid7 aPMC61809052pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsden, Christopher E.10aEffects of diets enriched in linoleic acid and its peroxidation products on brain fatty acids, oxylipins, and aldehydes in mice  ap. 1206-1213.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aLinoleic acid (LA) is abundant in modern industrialized diets. Oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) and reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), are present in heated vegetable oils and can be endogenously synthesized following consumption of dietary LA. OXLAMs have been implicated in cerebellar degeneration in chicks; 4-HNE is linked to neurodegenerative conditions in mammals. It unknown whether increasing dietary LA or OXLAMs alters the levels of oxidized fatty acids (oxylipins), precursor fatty acids, or 4-HNE in mammalian brain.To determine the effects of increases in dietary OXLAMs and dietary LA, on levels of fatty acids, oxylipins, and 4-HNE in mouse brain tissues.Mice (n = 8 per group) were fed one of three controlled diets for 8 weeks: (1) a low LA diet, (2) a high LA diet, or (3) the low LA diet with added OXLAMs. Brain fatty acids, oxylipins, and 4-HNE were quantified in mouse cerebellum and cerebral cortex by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and immunoblot, respectively.Increasing dietary LA significantly increased omega-6 fatty acids, decreased omega-3 fatty acids, and increased OXLAMs in brain. Dietary OXLAMs had minimal effect on oxidized lipids but did decrease both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Neither dietary LA nor OXLAMs altered 4-HNE levels.Brain fatty acids are modulated by both dietary LA and OXLAMs, while brain OXLAMs are regulated by endogenous synthesis from LA, rather than incorporation of preformed OXLAMs.  aPublisher supplied data  cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Institute on Agingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000049  cNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholismdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000027  cNational Health and Medical Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaldehydes 3acerebellum 3acerebral cortex 3achicks 3agas chromatography 3aindustrialization 3aionization 3alinoleic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amice 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aoxidation 3aoxylipins 3aperoxidation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avegetable oil 0aOxylipins 0aLinoleic acid 0aOXLAMs 0aCerebrum 0aCerebellum 0aPeroxidation1 aHennebelle, Marie1 aSchuster, Susanne1 aKeyes, Gregory S.1 aJohnson, Casey D.1 aKirpich, Irina A.1 aDahlen, Jeff E.1 aHorowitz, Mark S.1 aZamora, Daisy1 aFeldstein, Ariel E.1 aMcClain, Craig J.1 aMuhlhausler, Beverly S.1 aMakrides, Maria1 aGibson, Robert A.1 aTaha, Ameer Y.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Oct., v. 1863, no. 10 p.1206-1213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01253naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245007000168300001300238520029000251592002800541650001500569650001200584650001600596651001400612653001600626653003400642653000900676653002200685700003800707773009200745856008100837852000900918655001200927IND60699235520221120021923.0210117e20130514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069923552DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.299.49702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamasaki, Takeshi14aThe genus Myrmarachne (Araneae, Salticidae) in Flores, Indonesia  ap. 1-20.  aTwo new species of the genus Myrmarachne are described (Myrmarachne acutidens sp. n., Myrmarachne epigealis sp. n.), and Myrmarachne macrognatha and Myrmarachne melanocephala are redescribed from Flores specimens.

However, the research progress of soil MPs is restricted by the inherent technical inconformity and difficulties in analyzing particles in complex matrices. Here, we reviewed a selection of papers and then extrapolated a tentative standardized method for such analyses. The multiple sources of soil MPs in soil need to be quantified. Global monitoring data of soil MPs is far from sufficient. The interaction between MPs and different properties and environmental factors controls the migration and retention of MPs in soil. The migration behavior and key mechanisms of MPs in real-world environments remain to be determined. The presence of MPs threatens soil microbial-plant-animal ecosystem function and health, and may enter the human body through the food chain, although the extent of these hazards is currently debated. In particular, attention should be paid to the potential transport and ecotoxicological mechanisms of contaminants derived and adsorptive from MPs and of harmful microorganisms (such as pathogens) attached as biofilms. Although there exist preliminary studies on soil MPs, it is urgent to consider the diversity of MPs as a suite of contaminants and to systematically understand the sources, flux and effects of these artificial pollutants in time and space from the perspective of plastic environmental cycle. More comprehensive quantification of their environmental fate is undertaken to identify risks to global human and ecological systems. From the perspective of controlling soil MP pollution, the responsibility assignment of government manage-producer-consumer system and the strategy of remediation should be implemented. This review is helpful for providing an important roadmap and inspiration for the research methods and framework of soil MPs and facilitates the development of waste management and remediation strategies for regional soil MP contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3aecological function 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental fate 3afood chain 3ahumans 3amicroplastics 3amigratory behavior 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3asoil 3awaste management 0aMicroplastics pollution 0aSoil health 0aStandardized method 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aControl strategy1 aWang, Junxiao1 aZou, Mengmeng1 aJia, Zhenyi1 aZhou, Shenglu1 aLi, Yan0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 748 p.141368-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1413683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014800171300001600319520166900335592002802004650002202032650001702054650002302071650002602094650002202120650001602142650002202158650001802180650001102198650001402209650000702223650001102230650000902241650001402250650001102264650002202275650001002297650002002307650001802327651001302345653002902358653001202387653001602399653002402415653001102439653001102450700001702461700001702478700001402495700001602509700002002525700002202545700002002567700001702587700002602604700002002630773009102650856009002741852000902831655001202840IND60612948420221121052157.0200712e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuís, A.T.10aApplication of fuzzy logic tools for the biogeochemical characterisation of (un)contaminated waters from Aljustrel mining area (South Portugal)  ap. 736-744.  aAljustrel mining area (South Portugal) belongs to the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB). It is classified of high environmental risk due to its large tailings and to the Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) affected waters, generated by sulphides' oxidation. Integrating biological parameters (for the first time) in the input data matrix of the software PreFuRGe, allowed a better discrimination of the diatoms' responses to the stimuli caused by the hydrochemical changes imposed by the processes affecting water quality. Each hydrochemical scenario, was modeled by imposing maximum and minimum limits for each antecedent, according to the conditions imposed by the consequent, which in this case were the number of diatom species and pH. Thus, PreFuRGe evidenced some qualitative aspects that could not be achieved by classic statistics. pH appeared as the main discriminator of diversity and diatom species composition, nevertheless and due to the complex environment under study other chemical interactions must be considered: (a) AMD waters, with extremely low pH values, but also with extremely high hydrogeochemical complexity, represented by a mixture of metals, do not allow to associate, unequivocally, the reduction in diatom diversity to pH, but also to high metal (loid)s concentrations; (b) in the most alkaline waters, with higher abundance of diatom species, average to high concentrations of Na and Cl (due to Cenozoic sediments) do not seem to affect diatom diversity. This methodology proved to be an efficient tool to establish, for the first time, cause-effect relationships, improving the comprehension between biological (diatoms) and hydrochemical parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCenozoic era 3aacid mine drainage 3achemical interactions 3acomputer software 3afuzzy logic 3ahydrogeochemistry 3amine tailings 3amining 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyrite 3arisk 3asediments 3asodium 3aspecies diversity 3awater 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aPortugal 0aAcid Mine Drainage (AMD) 0aDiatoms 0aFuzzy Logic 0aIberian Pyrite Belt 0aLow pH 0aMetals1 aGrande, J.A.1 aDavila, J.M.1 aAroba, J.1 aDurães, N.1 aAlmeida, S.F.P.1 ade la Torre, M.L.1 aSarmiento, A.M.1 aFortes, J.C.1 aFerreira da Silva, E.1 aSantisteban, M.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 211 p.736-744dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010700165300001400272520103600286592002801322650001501350650001901365650002001384650002101404650001501425650001801440650001401458650001201472650002101484653001901505653001501524653003201539653002501571653002201596700002301618700002301641700002701664700002501691773010901716856008301825852000901908655001201917IND60553548020221119064513.0180831e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055354802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReta, Nekane10aPorous silicon membrane-modified electrodes for label-free voltammetric detection of MS2 bacteriophage  ap. 47-53.  aA proof of concept for the label-free detection of bacteriophage MS2, a model indicator of microbiological contamination, is validated in this work as a porous silicon (pSi) membrane-based electrochemical biosensor. PSi membranes were used to afford nanochannel architectures. The sensing mechanism was based on the nanochannel blockage caused by MS2 binding to immobilized capture antibodies. This blockage was quantified by measuring the oxidation current of the electroactive species reaching the electrode surface, by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The immunosensor showed a limit of detection of 6pfu/mL in buffer, allowing the detection of MS2 to levels commonly found in real-world applications, and proved to be unaffected by matrix effects when analyzing MS2 in reservoir water. This platform enables the straightforward, direct and sensitive detection of a broad range of target analytes and constitutes a promising approach towards the development of portable electronic point of sample analysis devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abacteriophages 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aimmunosensors 3aoxidation 3asilicon 3awater reservoirs 0aPorous silicon 0aLabel free 0aElectrochemical immunoassay 0aNanochannel blockage 0aMS2 bacteriophage1 aMichelmore, Andrew1 aSaint, Christopher1 aPrieto-Simón, Beatriz1 aVoelcker, Nicolas H.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 June 15, v. 80 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012400162300001800286500002000304520167900324592002802003650001502031650001202046650001402058650001102072650000902083650001702092650001102109650001302120650001102133650003002144650001402174650001402188650001502202650001102217650001102228650001002239650001102249700002502260700002402285700002102309700002202330773011902352856007302471852000902544655001202553IND60593941120221119154756.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059394112DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.145542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitney, Thomas D.10aSelectivity underlies the dissociation between seasonal prey availability and prey consumption in a generalist predator  ap. 1739-1748.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGeneralist predators are capable of selective foraging, but are predicted to feed in close proportion to prey availability to maximize energetic intake especially when overall prey availability is low. By extension, they are also expected to feed in a more frequency‐dependent manner during winter compared to the more favourable foraging conditions during spring, summer and fall seasons. For 18 months, we observed the foraging patterns of forest‐dwelling wolf spiders from the genus Schizocosa (Araneae: Lycosidae) using PCR‐based gut‐content analysis and simultaneously monitored the activity densities of two common prey: springtails (Collembola) and flies (Diptera). Rates of prey detection within spider guts relative to rates of prey collected in traps were estimated using Roualdes’ cₛₜ model and compared using various linear contrasts to make inferences pertaining to seasonal prey selectivity. Results indicated spiders foraged selectively over the course of the study, contrary to predictions derived from optimal foraging theory. Even during winter, with overall low prey densities, the relative rates of predation compared to available prey differed significantly over time and by prey group. Moreover, these spiders appeared to diversify their diets; the least abundant prey group was consistently overrepresented in the diet within a given season. We suggest that foraging in generalist predators is not necessarily restricted to frequency dependency during winter. In fact, foraging motives other than energy maximization, such as a more nutrient‐focused strategy, may also be optimal for generalist predators during prey‐scarce winters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aDiptera 3aLycosidae 3aautumn 3adiet 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aforaging 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3aspring 3asummer 3atraps 3awinter1 aSitvarin, Michael I.1 aRoualdes, Edward A.1 aBonner, Simon J.1 aHarwood, James D.0 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Apr., v. 27, no. 7 p.1739-1748dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.145543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014000171520142200311592002801733650002501761650001301786650001701799650001701816650001701833650001801850650000701868650001901875650002501894650001601919653001301935653001801948653002001966653003501986653001702021700002602038773012202064856008102186852000902267655001202276IND60719321420221117231829.0211030e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071932142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1105942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuengdech, Anchalee10aApplication of catechin nanoencapsulation with enhanced antioxidant activity in high pressure processed catechin-fortified coconut milk  aThe efficiency of ultrasonic nanoemulsion to improve physical stability and antioxidant activity of catechins when exposed to stress conditions imitating food process was investigated. The catechin nanoemulsions (CaNE) were fabricated using ultrasonication and subjected to different stress conditions including pH (2–8), ionic strengths (200–1000 mmol/L NaCl) and temperatures (pasteurization, sterilization, and high pressure processing; HPP). Physical stability (droplet size and polydispersity index; PDI) and antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP values) of the CaNE were investigated during storage at 4 °C for 28 days. The developed CaNE showed good physical stability at various pH (2–8) and ionic strengths (200–600 mmol/L NaCl), whereas DPPH and FRAP values of the CaNE significantly decreased at pH > 6 and NaCl > 600 mmol/L. Pasteurization and sterilization induced an increase in droplet size and a decrease in antioxidant activity, whereas HPP had no effect on the CaNE. The efficiency of nanoemulsion to stabilize catechins in a high pressure processed catechin-fortified coconut milk (HPP-CM-CaNE) was investigated in comparison to HPP-CM and HPP-CM containing catechin solution (HPP-CM-Ca) during storage at 4 °C. The decrease in pH and antioxidant activity of HPP-CM-CaNE was less than those of HPP-CM-Ca, indicating that the nanoemulsion could enhance catechin stability in HPP-CM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acatechin 3acoconut milk 3adroplet size 3ananocapsules 3ananoemulsions 3apH 3apasteurization 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aCatechin 0aNanoemulsions 0aUltrasonication 0aHigh pressure processing (HPP) 0aCoconut milk1 aUbonrat Siripatrawan,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Apr., v. 140 p.110594-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1105943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010700164520124000271592002801511650003701539650001501576650001501591650001201606650002301618650003101641650002901672650002101701650001301722650002001735653003301755653001501788653001201803700001601815700001801831700005501849773011801904856008202022852000902104655001202113IND60734980120221121055341.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073498012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Yinhao10aAmide-functionalized graphene-assembled monoliths with high adsorption capacity of Cd[formula omitted]  aThree-dimensional graphene-assembled monoliths (GAs) are emerging materials used in supercapacitors, catalysis, etc. However, GAs prepared by mainstream reduction methods (reduced GAs, RGAs) have fewer functional groups and display poor adsorption capacity of heavy metals. In this paper, we developed a new method of preparing amide-functionalized GAs (AGAs) with high degree of modification by the reaction of carboxyl-functionalized graphene oxides and ethylenediamine. AGAs contained multiple functional groups and exhibited dendritic structure at micron scale. Benefiting from these properties, the maximum adsorption capacities Cd2+ on AGAs at T = 303 K were about 56.6 mg/g, which was twice that of RGAs and higher than that of graphene (∼10 mg/g) and biochar (∼18 mg/g) at the same conditions. By calculating the Gibbs free energies (ΔG), the adsorption of Cd2+ on AGAs was proved a spontaneous process, while the adsorption of Cd2+ on RGAs was not spontaneous X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that AGAs contained more adsorption sites and Cd2+ adsorbed on AGAs through coordination bond. Thus, AGAs exhibited good application potentials as adsorbents for the removal of Cd2+ from contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenvironmental technology 3aethylenediamines 3agraphene 3awater pollution 0aGraphene-assembled monoliths 0aAdsorption 0aCadmium1 aWang, Yaqin1 aZhu, Xianfang1 aJi, Guodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0195-23670 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101580-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245020400170300001600374520138300390592002801773650001601801650001301817650002501830650002301855650001001878650001901888650001401907650001401921650001801935650001501953650001701968650002501985650001002010651001002020653001502030653003902045653001802084653001902102653003802121700001502159700001702174700001802191700001702209773009102226856009002317852000902407655001202416IND60612948620221121041833.0200712e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rong10aPhthalates in soft glass (a soft transparent PVC plastic sheet used extensively in household and public place in developing countries in recent years): Implication for oral exposure to young children  ap. 861-866.  aIt has been several years that a soft transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic sheet, commonly known as “soft glass”, or “crystal plate” in China and other developing countries, has quietly and gradually found extensive applications. This material has widely replaced cloth and glass as table cover in household and office, and replaced cloth as door drape in public place in China. In this study, the concentration of plasticizer used in soft glass and the migration of the plasticizer from soft glass to olive oil and porcine skin during contact were determined. The oral exposure of young children to the plasticizer from soft glass was estimated for the first time. Two exposure routes, one via ingestion of contaminated food, the other via mouthing of contaminated hand, were considered. It is found that Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the major plasticizer used in soft glass, which could leach out of the material and migrate easily to the olive oil and porcine skin during contact. A rough estimation of oral exposure for young children to DEHP from soft glass was 126 μg/person/d, which would be converted to 12.6 μg/kg bw/d and 7.9 μg/kg bw/d, for body weight of 10 kg and 16 kg, respectively. The estimated exposure dosages would not pose immediate health hazard to the children. The implications of these dosages were also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3achildren 3adeveloping countries 3afood contamination 3aglass 3ahealth hazards 3aingestion 3aolive oil 3aoral exposure 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aswine 3aChina 0aSoft glass 0aSoft transparent PVC plastic sheet 0aOral exposure 0aYoung children 0adi(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)1 aWang, Qing1 aMa, Chenghui1 aLi, Shengjiao1 aHan, Runping0 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 211 p.861-866dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001200265520115000277592002801427650001201455650001301467650001101480650002001491650001701511650001501528650001801543650001101561650001401572650000701586650001601593650003701609650001501646650000901661653002101670653001801691653001701709653001701726653001901743653001301762700002001775773007801795856008401873852000901957655001201966IND60545243420221119221340.0170719e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054524342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderon, Blanca10aHeavy metal release due to aging effect during zero valent iron nanoparticles remediation  ap. 1-9.  aZero valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) represent a promising agent for environmental remediation. Nevertheless, their application presents some limitations regarding their rapid oxidation and aggregation in the media. The aim of this study was to determine the effect that nZVI aging has in heavy metal remediation in water. Contaminants studied were Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu and Cr, which are typical elements found in ground and wastewater. Results show a high contaminant removal capacity by the nZVI in the first 2 h of reaction. Nevertheless, for longer reaction times, some of the metal ions that had already been adsorbed in the nZVI were delivered to the water. Cd and Ni show the maximum delivery percentages (65 and 27% respectively after 21 days of contact time). The starting delivery time was shortened when applying lower nZVI amounts. No re-dissolution of Cr was observed in any circumstance because it was the only element incorporated into the nanoparticles core, as TEM images showed. Contaminant release from nZVI is probably due to nanoparticles oxidation caused by aging, which produced a pH decrease and nZVI surface crystallization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acrystallization 3aheavy metals 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3aremediation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 3azinc 0aZero-valent iron 0aNanoparticles 0aHeavy metals 0aAging effect 0aImmobilization 0aDelivery1 aFullana, Andres0 tWater research.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 83 p.1-9dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011500173300001300288520171100301592002802012650001302040650001702053650000902070650001002079650002102089650001302110650001202123650002702135650001702162653001302179653002102192653002102213653001302234653002302247700002102270773013102291856008602422852000902508655001202517IND60552760820221120064821.0161021e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055276082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.05.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurger, Stefanie10aInfluence of the polymer size on depletion attraction—induced gel and glass transitions of microgel colloids  ap. 6-15.  aIn previous work of our group on the re-entrant melting of colloidal glasses we observed an unexpectedly huge re-entry region for a binary system of 1:50 crosslinked polystyrene (PS) microgel spheres when a depletion attraction range ξ=Rg,polymer/Rcolloid=0.08 was induced by non-adsorbing (free) PS chains. To investigate whether this fluid region can even be increased by reducing polymer size and therefore the attraction range as predicted by mode coupling theory (MCT), we studied an almost identical system. It consists of a binary 1:50 PS microgel mixture (Rh,L=105.8nm, Rh,S=82.9nm; Γ=Rh,S/Rh,L=0.85) with a reduced attraction range of ξ=0.059 by use of an appropriate free PS polymer (Mw=79,600g/mol, Rg,polymer=9.18nm). Here the glass transition is shifted from ϕg=0.577 to higher values, allowing for fluid states up to volume fractions of ϕ=0.715. This is significantly higher than the maximum fluid state of ϕ=0.69 reached for ξ=0.08. Tentatively correcting for osmotic deswelling these volume fractions reduce to 0.673 and 0.66, respectively. This is in qualitative agreement with MCT, but in quantitative disagreement because the theory predicts a shift of only a few percent. Such fluid states beyond the maximum amorphous packing of hard spheres (ϕrcp∼0.64) do not occur for PMMA colloids and 1:10 crosslinked PS microgel spheres that can both be considered as hard spheres. Thus, we tentatively attribute the observation of fluid states at such high volume fractions to a combination of the slight softness of the 1:50 microgels, leading to osmotic deswelling and particle deformability. In addition, polydispersity and polymer non-ideality effects should be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acrosslinking 3agels 3aglass 3aglass transition 3ahardness 3amelting 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolystyrenes 0aColloids 0aDepletion effect 0aGlass transition 0aMicrogel 0aRe-entrant melting1 aBartsch, Eckhard0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 442 p.6-15dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.05.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001600265520155300281592002801834650001701862650003001879650002201909650001501931650000901946650001301955653003001968653002301998653001802021653002902039700002502068773008202093856008402175852000902259655001202268IND60545243520221119221327.0170719e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054524352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.06.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Kendra I.10aComparative decay of Catellicoccus marimmalium and enterococci in beach sand and seawater  ap. 377-384.  aMost studies characterize microbial source tracking (MST) target performance using sensitivity and specificity metrics.

The decay rates of CAT and ENT measured by culture (cENT) and QPCR (tENT) were compared in sand and seawater laboratory microcosms under environmentally relevant conditions (subject to tidal wetting versus no wetting in sand, and sunlit versus dark conditions in seawater). Bacterial targets were more persistent in beach sand than in seawater with decay rates on the order of 0.01–0.1 per day and 1 to 10 per day, respectively. Targets were more persistent in unwetted compared to wetted sand, and dark compared to sunlit seawater. During the first 8 days of the sand experiment, the decay rate k of CAT was greater than that of cENT. The decay rates of CAT, tENT, and cENT were similar in sand after day 8 and in dark seawater. In sunlit seawater, the decay rates were different between targets with kcENT > kCAT > ktENT. The decay rates presented here are useful for fate and transport models and also inform the use of MST marker concentrations to infer ENT sources in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3afate and transport models 3aindicator species 3apollutants 3asand 3aseawater 0aMicrobial source tracking 0aRecreational water 0aBathing water 0aFecal indicator bacteria1 aBoehm, Alexandria B.0 tWater research.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 83 p.377-384dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.06.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014200164300001300306520135200319592002801671650002101699650002701720650002601747650003101773650002701804650001301831650001501844650001301859650001301872650002001885650001501905650001001920650002401930650001401954650001801968650001401986650002302000653002702023653002402050653002702074653002002101700002102121700001402142700001302156700002302169773010802192856008302300852000902383655001202392IND60553548420221119064642.0180831e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055354842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaobo10aBiosensors based on modularly designed synthetic peptides for recognition, detection and live/dead differentiation of pathogenic bacteria  ap. 9-16.  aRapid and sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens is critical for assessing public health, food and environmental safety. We report the use of modularly designed and site-specifically oriented synthetic antimicrobial peptides (sAMPs) as novel recognition agents enabling detection and quantification of bacterial pathogens. The oriented assembly of the synthetic peptides on electrode surfaces through an engineered cysteine residue coupled with impedimetric detection facilitated rapid and sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens with a detection limit of 10²CFU/mL for four bacterial strains including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). The approach enabled differentiation between live and dead bacteria. The fabrication of the sAMPs functionalized surface and the importance of the sAMPs orientation for providing optimum recognition and detection ability against pathogens are discussed. The proposed methodology provides a universal platform for the detection of bacterial pathogens based on engineered peptides, as alternative to the most commonly used immunological and gene based assays. The method can also be used to fabricate antimicrobial coatings and surfaces for inactivation and screening of viable bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3acoatings 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3agenes 3amicrobial detection 3apathogens 3apublic health 3ascreening 3asynthetic peptides 0aImpedimetric biosensor 0aPathogenic bacteria 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aLive/dead assay1 aMarrakchi, Mouna1 aXu, Dawei1 aDong, He1 aAndreescu, Silvana0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 June 15, v. 80 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170520193000309592002802239650002502267650002702292650001502319650001902334650001602353650001702369650001802386650001402404653002202418653001902440653001002459653001802469653004402487700001902531700002002550700002102570700002402591700001902615700001702634700001702651700001402668700001802682700002002700700006302720700001802783700001902801773009302820856008602913852000902999655001203008IND60722495920221120062624.0210812e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072249592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e058802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaitō, Akira,10aFlow cytometry detection of cell type-specific expression of programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) in colorectal cancer specimens  aPD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy is now widely used for the treatment of advanced malignancies. Although PD-L1 is known to be expressed by various host cells as well as tumor cells, the role of PD-L1 on non-malignant cells and its clinical significance is unknown. We evaluated cell type-specific expression of PD-L1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens using multicolor flow cytometry.Single cell suspensions were made from 21 surgically resected CRC specimens, and immunostained with various mAbs conjugated with different fluorescent dyes. Tumor cells, stromal cells, and immune cells were identified as CD326(+), CD90(+) and CD45(+) phenotype, respectively. CD11b(+) myeloid cells, CD19(+) B cells and CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells were also stained in different samples, and their frequencies in the total cell population and the ratio of PD-L1(+) cells to each phenotype were determined.PD-L1 was expressed by all the cell types. The ratio of PD-L1(+) cells to CD326(+) tumor cells was 19.1% ± 14.0%, lower than those for CD90(+) stromal cells (39.6% ± 16.0%) and CD11b(+) myeloid cells (31.9% ± 14.3%). The ratio of PD-L1(+) cells in tumor cells correlated strongly with the ratio in stromal cells, while only weakly with that in myeloid cells. Tumor cells were divided into two populations by CD326 expression levels, and the PD-L1 positive ratios were inversely correlated with the rate of CD326 highly expressing cells as well as mean fluorescein intensity of CD326 in tumor cells, while positively correlated with the frequencies of stromal cells or myeloid cells in CRC.PD-L1 is differentially expressed on various cell types in CRC. PD-L1 on tumor cells may be upregulated together with CD326 downregulation in the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Quantification of cell type-specific expression of PD-L1 using multicolor flow cytometry may provide useful information for the immunotherapy of solid tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adeath domain receptors 3aepithelium 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3aimmunotherapy 3aphenotype 0aColorectal cancer 0aFlow cytometry 0aPD-L1 0aCD326 (EpCAM) 0aEpithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)1 aTojo, Mineyuki1 aKumagai, Yūko,1 aOhzawa, Hideyuki1 aYamaguchi, Hironori1 aMiyato, Hideyo1 aSadatomo, Ai1 aNaoi, Daishi1 aOta, Gaku1 aKoinuma, Koji1 aHorie, Hisanaga1 aLefor, Alan Kawarai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6673-56301 aSata, Naohiro1 aKitayama, Joji0 tHeliyon.g2021 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.e05880-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e058803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014200170520182300312592002802135650001902163650002502182650001802207650001002225650001502235650001302250650001902263650001502282650001602297650002202313650001402335650001202349650001402361650001802375653001802393653001902411653003102430653002502461653002502486653001002511653001702521700001802538700006702556773009302623856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60722496120221120062640.0210812e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072249612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e058822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZzaman, Wahidu10aApplication of immersion pre-treatments and drying temperatures to improve the comprehensive quality of pineapple (Ananas comosus) slices  aDrying of pineapple slices combined with different pre-treatments was done to reduce various adverse changes by adding satisfactory value. Process optimization was done by dipping the pineapple slices in four different solutions (1% trehalose, 2% NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 10% fructose) before drying. The effects of different pre-treatments and drying temperatures of 50, 55, and 60 °C with a constant 30% relative humidity (RH) were optimized based on the quality attributes, drying time and microbial load of dried pineapple slices. The optimal drying temperature was 55 °C using 1% trehalose pre-treatments based on the physical and biochemical properties. The reconstituted dried pineapples implied at this condition, contributed to the better structure preservation as indicated by the lower shrinkage (0.21) and the higher Coefficient of Rehydration (0.941), and rehydration ratio (6.840). On the other hand, the retention of color, vitamin C, B vitamins, and antioxidant activity of the samples were decreased by increasing drying time and temperatures. The highest Total Phenolic Content (121.02 mg GAE/100g), Total Flavonoid Content (8.72 mg QE/100g), and DPPH radical scavenging activity (7.22 EC₅₀ g/100g) were found at 60 °C drying temperature with 10% fructose pretreatment's samples. The lowest drying time required was 7.64 h using 2% NaCl pre-treatment at 60 °C, considering the time required to reach 20% moisture content in the dried product at 30% RH. Based on the reported results, it is concluded that 1% trehalose at 50 °C can be used to develop high quality pineapple snacks, which maintained the maximum desired physicochemical and nutritious properties. This study could play an essential role in meeting the emerging demand of developing good quality nutritious dried pineapple snacks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnanas comosus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acolor 3aflavonoids 3afructose 3amicrobial load 3apineapples 3arehydration 3arelative humidity 3ashrinkage 3asucrose 3atrehalose 3awater content 0aPre-treatment 0aHot air drying 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aRehydration capacity 0aShrinkage evaluation 0aColor 0aAntioxidants1 aBiswas, Rahul1 aHossain, Mohammad Afzal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9577-92770 tHeliyon.g2021 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.e05882-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e058823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010800171300001400279506002800293520106100321592002801382506003701410650002201447651001001469651001101479651001201490651001001502651001301512651001301525651001001538653001901548653001701567653001101584653001901595653001201614773011701626856008301743852000901826655001201835IND60784882120221207071005.0220623e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078488212DNAL7 a10.26480/esp.01.2021.10.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnan, Haidar Salim10aPaleobiogeography of some egyptian and pakistanian benthic foraminiferal species in the northern tethys  ap. 10-15.  aResource is Open Access  aTwenty-one benthic foraminiferal species were originally erected from the Southern Tethys, 13 species from Egypt, and 8 species from Pakistan.

Most of the parameters were significantly influenced by cultivar, season, and their interaction effects, with cultivar variance being predominant. Wide ranges of concentration among the 37 cultivars were observed. The average concentration of bound type was 661 μg g⁻¹ of dm, making up 97.5% of the phenolic acid determined with ferulic accounting for 70.7% of it, while free type made up only 2.5% of the phenolic acid determined with syringic accounting for 44.7% of it. Bound type was the predominant source to the grain phenolic acid concentrations determined. There were highly significant and positive correlations between bound ferulic concentration and total bound phenolic acid concentration, and between free syringic concentration and total free phenolic acid concentration. Cultivars Liangxing 66 and Zhongmai 895 were stable in concentration of components of phenolic acids across seasons, with high values of free and bound phenolic acids indicating they could be selected as parents in wheat breeding for health beneficial phenolic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acultivars 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aparents 3aphenolic acids 3avariance 3awinter wheat1 aWang, Lan1 aYao, Yang1 aYan, Jun1 aHe, Zhonghu0 tJournal of cereal science.g2012 Nov., v. 56, no. 3 p.629-635dElsevier Ltdx0733-52107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011900162300001600281520074800297592002801045650002201073650001101095650001301106650001101119650000901130650001201139650001301151653001801164653001201182653002501194653002701219653003201246700001601278700001701294700002001311700001901331700001801350700002001368773011901388856007801507852000901585655001201594IND60522500920221119132940.0190128e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052250092DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2015-00412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gao-Feng10aSynthesis and structural characterization of a novel copper(II)/lead(II) heterometallic organic–inorganic hybrid  ap. 617-623.  aA new copper(II)/lead(II) complex [(terpy)₃CuPb₅Br₁₂] (1) (terpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) has been synthesized and characterized by IR, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

These bromoplumbate(II) clusters are connected by (terpy)₂Cu₂Br₄ units along the crystallographic b axis and by PbBr₆ units along the a axis, thereby forming an extended sheet structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3abromides 3acopper 3alead 3aligands 3anitrogen 0abromoplumbate 0acluster 0acoordination polymer 0aheterometallic complex 0aorganic–inorganic hybrids1 aZhang, Xiao1 aSun, Shu-Wen1 aYao, Chen-Zhong1 aLiu, Zhao-Rong1 aWang, Yu-Chun1 aLiu, Yuan-Zhong0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2015 Sept. 1, v. 70, no. 9 p.617-623dDe GruyterwJournal:23182x1865-71177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2015-00413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245009800167500001900265520107000284592002801354650001301382650003401395650002301429650002501452650001501477650002001492650003001512650001001542650001801552650001901570651001801589700002401607700002501631700002301656773011901679856007301798852000901871655001201880IND60726448020221117225905.0210205e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072644802DNAL7 a10.3390/w130302642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriscoll, Stephanie  C.10aPresence of Microplastics in the Food Web of the Largest High-Elevation Lake in North America  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroplastics have been documented in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. However, few studies have investigated microplastics in freshwater fish diets. In this study, water samples and three trophic levels of a freshwater food web were investigated for microplastic presence: amphipods (Gammarus lacustris), Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Microplastics and other anthropogenic materials were documented in water samples, amphipods, and fish, then confirmed using FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) and Raman spectroscopy. Our findings confirmed the presence of microplastics and other anthropogenic materials in three trophic levels of a freshwater food web in a high-elevation lake in a national park, which corroborates recent studies implicating the global distribution of microplastics. This study further illustrates the need for global action regarding the appropriate manufacturing, use, and disposal of plastics to minimize the effects of plastics on the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus 3aOncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ageographical distribution 3alakes 3amicroplastics 3anational parks 3aNorth America1 aGlassic, Hayley  C.1 aGuy, Christopher S.,1 aKoel, Todd Marvin,0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130302643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245008400170300001600254520176100270592002802031650002102059650001002080650001702090650001102107650001002118650002102128650003802149650001702187650002302204650002302227650001002250650000902260650002002269650001102289650001302300650003802313650003702351650001902388653001302407653002502420653001302445653001202458653001102470700005502481700002402536700001602560700005702576773009102633856009002724852000902814655001202823IND60612949120221121231049.0200712e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xinjin10aFluoride altered rat's blood testis barrier by affecting the F-actin via IL-1α  ap. 826-833.  aFluoride is known to affect the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the testis. Most of the recent literatures cited that cytokines regulate the blood-testis-barrier (BTB). However, the involvement of cytokines in the fluoride induced toxicity in BTB remains unclear. In order to study this, 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were taken and randomly divided into 5 groups which included four fluoride groups exposed to 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L NaF in distilled water and one positive control group. On the 29th day of fluoride exposure, the positive control group rats were administered 0.1% CaCl₂ solution. Biotin tracer technology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were applied to evaluate the function and ultra-structure of BTB. The expression levels of the BTB associated proteins, actin relative protein 3 (Arp3), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α), and transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-β3) were determined using Western blotting and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) respectively, meanwhile the actin filament (F-actin) was detected by fluorescent phalloidin conjugates. Our results revealed that the function and the ultra-structure of BTB in all the fluoride treated groups were damaged with a concomitant significant decreases in basal ectoplasmic specialization (basal ES), associated protein β-catenin, and F-actin. Moreover, Arp3 levels were significantly increased in 50 and 100 mg/L NaF groups. Meanwhile, IL-1α significantly increased in all the fluoride treated groups. In summary, we concluded that an increase in IL-1α induced by NaF significantly decreased the expression of F-actin and the organization of F-actin highly branched, which might facilitate the BTB's functional and ultra-structural variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3abeta catenin 3abiotin 3ablood 3acalcium chloride 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3arats 3asodium fluoride 3atestes 3atoxicity 3atransforming growth factor beta 3 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aFluoride 0aBlood-testis barrier 0aCytokine 0aF-actin 0aIL-1α1 aSun, Zilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4907-72711 aManthari, Ram Kumar1 aWu, Panhong1 aWang, Jundong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-03470 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 211 p.826-833dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245017700214300002000391500001900411520110400430592002801534650001801562650002501580650001501605650001401620650001001634650001301644650002301657650002201680650001401702650002001716650001901736650001701755700001501772700002101787700001401808700002001822700001701842700001401859700002101873700002001894700005601914700001901970700002401989700001802013773013102031856008402162852000902246655001202255IND60705384520221119194004.0200804e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070538452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c018762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Richard Y.-C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7172-110X10aIntegrated Approach for Characterizing Bispecific Antibody/Antigens Complexes and Mapping Binding Epitopes with SEC/MALS, Native Mass Spectrometry, and Protein Footprinting  ap. 10709-10716.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBispecific antibodies (BsAbs), with a unique mechanism of recognizing two different epitopes or antigens, have shown potential in various therapeutic areas. Molecular characterization of BsAbs’ epitopes not only allows for detailed understanding of their mechanism of actions but also guides the design and selection of drug candidate molecules. In this study, we illustrate the practical utility of an integrated approach, including size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering and native mass spectrometry (MS) for the biophysical characterization of complex formation of a BsAb with two target antigens, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). MS-based protein footprinting strategies, including hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins, and carboxyl group footprinting with glycine ethyl ester, were further applied to determine BsAb’s binding epitopes. This combination approach provides molecular details on the binding mechanisms of BsAb to the two distinct antigens with rapid output and high resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibodies 3adeuterium 3adrugs 3aepitopes 3agel chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apeptide mapping 3aphotochemistry 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Feng1 aWheeler, Matthew1 aWang, Yun1 aLangish, Robert1 aChau, Bryant1 aDong, Jia1 aMorishige, Winse1 aBezman, Natalie1 aStrop, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8695-577X1 aRajpal, Arvind1 aOlafur Gudmundsson,1 aChen, Guodong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 July 08, v. 92, no. 15 p.10709-10716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c018763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016700169300001600336500001500352520081900367592002801186650001801214650000901232650001501241650003101256650001901287650001001306650001001316650001401326650001101340650002501351650001501376650001701391653001701408700001701425700002401442700002401466700002001490773009701510856008101607852000901688655001201697IND60112836020221121013319.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011283602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2012.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽilić, Slađana10aDistributions of phenolic compounds, yellow pigments and oxidative enzymes in wheat grains and their relation to antioxidant capacity of bran and debranned flour  ap. 652-658.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study, the distribution of phenolic compounds and yellow pigments in wheat grains and their relation to the total antioxidant capacity of bran and debranned flour was investigated. Yellow pigments, the activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POX) enzymes were also determined. The bran fraction was found to contain significantly higher concentrations of phenolic acids, flavonoids and yellow pigments. The LOX activity was concentrated in endosperm and embryo, while the POX activity mostly concentrated in the bran fraction. The results suggest that the bran fraction of wheat would potentially provide naturally occurring antioxidants. From the health benefit point of view, a small level of bran incorporation to bread can be recommended to increase dietary fibre and phytonutrients in the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary fiber 3abran 3aflavonoids 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aphenolic acids 3awheat 3aflour 3aendosperm 3abreads 3aantioxidant activity 3aperoxidase 3aantioxidants 0alipoxygenase1 aSerpen, Arda1 aAkıllıoğlu, Gül1 aJanković, Marijana1 aGökmen, Vural,0 tJournal of cereal science.g2012 Nov., v. 56, no. 3 p.652-658dElsevier Ltdx0733-52107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2012.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245006800185300001400253520073300267592002801000650000801028650002501036650001601061650001601077650001401093650001601107650001101123650003201134650002001166650001601186650004501202650001201247650001401259650002901273650002601302650002601328650003101354650001701385650001101402650003201413650003701445700002001482700002301502700001401525700002501539700002001564700002301584773007801607856008201685852000901767655001201776IND60098924520221120033245.0141105e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009892452DNAL7 a220014062pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Kenta10aAcetylation of Prrp K150 regulates the subcellular localization  ap. 13-19.  aPosttranslational modifications of proteins have profound effects on many aspects of their function and have received much attention due to the importance of these processes in epigenetic regulation. In this study, we report that deleted azoospermia associated protein 1 (DAZAP1)/proline-rich RNA binding protein (Prrp), a multifunctional RNA binding protein which is essential for spermatogenesis and normal cell growth, is acetylated at Lysine 150 within its RNA binding domain. The acetylation is predominantly observed in nuclear Prrp, and the nonacetylated form is in cytoplasm. Considering that Prrp is a shuttling protein, we suggest that the acetylation cycle at Prrp K150 regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport in cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aacetylation 3acell growth 3acytoplasm 3aepigenetics 3alysine 3anucleocytoplasmic transport 3aspermatogenesis 2aAcetylation 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleusxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aCOS Cells 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aDactinomycinxpharmacology 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism1 aSuzuki, Atsushi1 aKagatsume, Satoshi1 aOno, Mana1 aMatsuzawa, Katsuhiko1 aTaguchi, Yusuke1 aKurihara, Yasuyuki0 tGene.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 491, no. 1 p.13-19dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166520123900256592002801495650001601523650001101539650001201550650001901562650002001581650001201601650001301613650002001626650002001646650001301666650001401679650002001693653000901713653001201722653001701734653005501751653002601806653001301832700002301845700002001868700001901888700002901907700003201936700002101968700002101989700003002010773009402040856008202134852000902216655001202225IND60734981320221121093249.0210806e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073498132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1070632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuche, Patrice10aMilk microfiltration process dataset annotated from a collection of scientific papers  aMilk microfiltration process plays a key role in the dairy industry. Crossflow microfiltration of skimmed milk using a membrane with 0.1 µm mean pore size is widely used to fractionate the two main groups of dairy proteins: casein micelles (~150 nm) and serum proteins (~2-15 nm). Retentate, containing mainly casein micelles, is generally used to enrich vat milk for cheese making. Permeate, containing serum proteins, lactose and minerals, is usually ultrafiltered in order to produce protein-rich concentrate with a high nutritional value dedicated to specific populations such as infants and seniors. The great interest in these protein fractions explains the increasing number of microfiltration equipments in the dairy industry.

However, many questions central to understanding the role of microbes in ecology are still open. Here, we analyze the relationship between lake microbiomes and the lakes' land cover. By applying machine learning methods, we quantify the covariance between land cover categories and the microbial community composition recorded in the largest amplicon sequencing dataset of European lakes available to date. Our results show that the aggregation of environmental features or microbial taxa before analysis can obscure ecologically relevant patterns. We observe a comparatively high covariation of the lakes' microbial community with herbaceous and open spaces surrounding the lake; nevertheless, the microbial covariation with land cover categories is generally lower than the covariation with physico-chemical parameters. Combining land cover and physico-chemical bioindicators identified from the same amplicon sequencing dataset, we develop analytical data structures that facilitate insights into the ecology of the lake microbiome. Among these, a list of the environmental parameters sorted by the number of microbial bioindicators we have identified for them points towards apparent environmental drivers of the lake microbial community composition, such as the altitude, conductivity, and area covered herbaceous vegetation surrounding the lake. Furthermore, the response map, a similarity matrix calculated from the Jaccard similarity of the environmental parameters' lists of bioindicators, allows us to study the ecosystem's structure from the standpoint of the microbiome. More specifically, we identify multiple clusters of highly similar and possibly functionally linked ecological parameters, including one that highlights the importance of the calcium-bicarbonate equilibrium for lake ecology. Taken together, we demonstrate the use of machine learning approaches in studying the interplay between microbial diversity and environmental factors and introduce novel approaches to integrate environmental molecular diversity into monitoring and water quality assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acommunity structure 3acovariance 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3alakes 3aland cover 3alimnology 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3avegetation 3awater quality 0aMicrobial ecology 0aMachine learning 0aBioindicators 0aLake ecology1 aSchenk, Jan Philip1 aDreßler, Hagen1 aBeisser, Daniela1 aHattab, Georges1 aBoenigk, Jens1 aHeider, Dominik0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 15, v. 825 p.153732-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245009300156520108300249592002801332650004101360650001301401650001101414650002401425650002401449650001001473651001201483700002001495700003901515700002001554773011801574856007201692852000901764655001201773IND60653129020221119113137.0190714e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065312902DNAL7 a10.3390/w80301042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalaoun, Omar10aImpact of Demographic Growth on Seawater Intrusion: Case of the Tripoli Aquifer, Lebanon  aWater resources in Mediterranean coastal aquifers are subject to overexploitation leading to an increase in seawater intrusion. Based on the United Nations Environment Program, “UNEP” 75% of people in the world will live in coastal cities by 2020. This is having a major impact on the salinization process. This paper deals with the impact of demographic evolution on seawater intrusion and considers the case of the lower Tripoli aquifer in Lebanon. A numerical model based on the sharp interface approach is implemented using “Freefem++” to access the seawater intrusion. The model is verified against an analytic and a numerical solution. It is calibrated and validated against hydraulic head observations (RMSD = 0.819 m). Then several scenarios of pumping are applied based on available demographic growth rates to quantify the impact on seawater intrusion. The projection scenarios show that if the current pumping rates are maintained while maintaining the demographic evolution, the pumping wells will be salinized within 2 decades in the highly populated areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Environment Programme 3aaquifers 3acities 3amathematical models 3asaltwater intrusion 3awells 3aLebanon1 aAl Bitar, Ahmad1 aGastellu-Etchegorry, Jean-Philippe1 aJazar, Mustapha0 tWater.g2016 Mar. 16, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w80301043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001600279520084400295592002801139650002001167650001401187650000901201650002101210650001201231650002901243650001201272653001101284653001501295653001901310700001801329773012501347856008201472852000901554655001201563IND60550770120221122061012.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055077012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jvc.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, R.A.10aAlternative methods for the measurement of the minimal ductal diameter of a patent ductus arteriosus in a dog  ap. 372-376.  aA two and half–year-old, 24 kg, spayed female German Shepherd was presented for evaluation of a suspected patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Transthoracic echocardiographic examination confirmed a left to right shunting PDA. Closure of the PDA was recommended, and the owners elected to have minimally invasive transcatheter closure of the PDA performed. Standard ductal angiography failed to provide adequate measurements of the minimal ductal diameter (MDD). Alternative methods of measuring the MDD using an angiography catheter and a balloon catheter were performed. The PDA was occluded using an Amplatz® Canine Ductal Occluder without complication. Further evaluation of these techniques is needed to determine the accuracy, overall clinical efficacy, and safety of using alternative methods for the measurement of the MDD of a PDA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGerman Shepherd 3acatheters 3adogs 3aechocardiography 3afemales 3apatent ductus arteriosus 3aspaying 0aCanine 0aCongenital 0aInterventional1 aOlivier, N.B.0 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.372-376dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002600167245010000193300001400293520187000307592002802177650000802205650003202213650002002245650001102265650001502276650001802291650001102309650002102320650001602341650002802357650001802385650001402403650002002417650001702437650001102454650004202465650002602507650002302533650003002556650004202586650002202628650003402650700002302684700002502707700003002732700002302762700002402785700002102809773007902830856008202909852000902991655001203000IND60099004420221119091322.0141105e20121210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009900442DNAL7 a229824122pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandrova, Elena A.10aSense transcripts originated from an internal part of the human retrotransposon LINE-1 5′ UTR  ap. 46-53.  aL1 (LINE-1) is one of the most abundant families of human transposable elements. Full-length human L1 has an ~900bp long 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) which harbors an internal promoter for the RNA polymerase II. It is generally accepted that the first 100bp of the 5′ UTR function as a “minimal promoter” which directs transcription of the entire LINE-1 unit from the extreme 5′ terminus. We re-investigated promoter activities of the different DNA fragments that cover the whole L1 5′ UTR in cultured human cells by using the luciferase reporter system. Analysis of both mRNA expression and luciferase activity levels indicated that the very important region for the effective transcription is located within the internal part of the L1 5′ UTR between nucleotide positions +390 and +526. 5′ RACE analysis revealed that in the context of the complete 5′ UTR, this part drives mRNA synthesis both from the canonical 5′-terminal transcription start site (TSS) and from within the internal region. In the absence of the first 100bp, the L1 5′ UTR efficiently directed transcription from aberrant TSSs located within its 3′ proximal part or the ORF1. Finally, we analyzed transcripts originated from endogenous (genomic) L1 elements and identified two novel TSSs located at positions +525 and +570. We propose a model in which the internal part (390–526) of the L1 5′ UTR plays a key role for recruitment of transcription initiation complex, which then may be either positioned onto the 5′ terminally located “minimal promoter”, or used proximately to direct 5′ truncated RNA copy. Intriguingly, this internal regulatory element substantially overlaps with the region of the L1 5′ UTR that is known to drive transcription in the opposite direction suggesting the existence of a common core for the bidirectional transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aretrotransposons 3atransposons 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aGenes, Reporter 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aLong Interspersed Nucleotide Elements 2aLuciferasesxgenetics 2aModels, Biological 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Deletion 2aTranscription Initiation Site1 aOlovnikov, Ivan A.1 aMalakhova, Galina V.1 aZabolotneva, Anastasia A.1 aSuntsova, Maria V.1 aDmitriev, Sergey E.1 aBuzdin, Anton A.0 tGene.g2012 Dec. 10, v. 511, no. 1 p.46-53dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002800191245013700219500002200356506007600378520177800454592002802232506003702260650002302297650001102320650002002331650002202351650001302373650001902386650003502405650002702440650001202467650001302479650002602492650001602518650001102534650002102545650001102566650001402577650001902591650002402610650000902634650001302643650002902656650001002685653001302695653001202708653001702720653001702737700002202754700001702776700002102793700002102814700002002835700002102855700002002876700002602896773009202922856008503014852000903099655001203108IND60662802320221207141113.0190906e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066280232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1087192doi7 aPMC69481812pmcid7 a316270272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkoski, Jacqueline M.10aPrenatal phenol and paraben exposures in relation to child neurodevelopment including autism spectrum disorders in the MARBLES study  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnvironmental phenols and parabens are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with the potential to affect child neurodevelopment including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Our aim was to assess whether exposure to environmental phenols and parabens during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of clinical ASD or other nontypical development (non-TD).This study included mother-child pairs (N = 207) from the Markers of Autism Risks in Babies – Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) Cohort Study with urinary phenol and paraben metabolites analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) from repeated pregnancy urine samples. Because family recurrence risks in siblings are about 20%, MARBLES enrolls pregnant women who already had a child with ASD. Children were clinically assessed at 3 years of age and classified into 3 outcome categories: ASD, non-TD, or typically developing (TD). Single analyte analyses were conducted with trinomial logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was used to test for mixture effects.Regression models were adjusted for pre-pregnancy body mass index, prenatal vitamin use (yes/no), homeowner status (yes/no), birth year, and child's sex. In single chemical analyses phenol exposures were not significantly associated with child's diagnosis. Mixture analyses using trinomial WQS regression showed a significantly increased risk of non-TD compared to TD (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.56, 1.60) with overall greater prenatal phenol and paraben metabolites mixture. Results for ASD also showed an increased risk, but it was not significant.This is the first study to provide evidence that pregnancy environmental phenol exposures may increase the risk for non-TD in a high-risk population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aat-risk population 3aautism 3abody mass index 3achemical analysis 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental exposure 3ainfants 3alearning 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aneurodevelopment 3aphenol 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asiblings 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aParabens 0aPhenols 0aEpidemiology 0aCohort study1 aBusgang, Stefanie1 aBixby, Moira1 aBennett, Deborah1 aSchmidt, Rebecca1 aBarr, Dana Boyd1 aPanuwet, Parinya1 aGennings, Chris1 aHertz-Picciotto, Irva0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Sept. 02, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1087193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007600174300001400250520126400264592002801528650002101556650002001577650001201597650002301609650002801632650001901660650001301679650001401692650002201706650003701728653000901765653002001774653001201794653003201806653001901838653002501857653001001882653000901892653000901901653000801910653000901918653001301927653000801940700002301948773007401971856008402045852000902129655001202138IND60552210420221123032504.0161020e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055221042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, Abhisek10aDimethyl sulphoxide and Ca2+ stimulate assembly of Vibrio cholerae FtsZ  ap. 64-75.  aWe cloned, overexpressed and purified Vibrio cholerae FtsZ protein for the first time. We used several complementary techniques to probe and compare the comparative assembly properties of recombinant Vibrio cholerae FtsZ (VcFtsZ) and Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). We observed that VcFtsZ polymerized at a slower rate than EcFtsZ and interestingly its polymerization was highly dependent on the presence of Ca2+ ion. Furthermore, DMSO specifically modulated the polymerization of VcFtsZ, promoted polymer bundling and increased the stability of the VcFtsZ protofilaments. Whereas DMSO showed no significant stimulatory effect on the assembly and bundling of EcFtsZ. Transmission electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that in presence of 8% DMSO the average thickness of the VcFtsZ polymers were increased significantly. DMSO specifically stabilized the VcFtsZ polymers against dilution induced disassembly and it reduced the GTPase activity of VcFtsZ. These results collectively suggested that despite lot of sequence homology, the assembly of VcFtsZ and EcFtsZ are differently regulated processes. We expect to use this knowledge of assembly properties of VcFtsZ for screening of small molecules against VcFtsZ for development of anti-cholera agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio cholerae 3acalcium 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascreening 3asequence homology 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aFtsZ 0aVibrio cholerae 0aCloning 0aExpression and purification 0aPolymerization 0aCalcium ion and DMSO 0aPIPES 0aIPTG 0aEGTA 0aGTP 0aPMSF 0aNi2+-NTA 0aBSA1 aChakrabarti, Gopal0 tBiochimie.g2014 Oct., v. 105 p.64-75dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167300001400258520121800272592002801490650002101518650002201539650002901561650002401590650002601614650002601640650002701666650001301693650001701706650001901723650001601742650001501758650001001773650001501783650001401798650001101812650001901823650001401842653001601856653002401872653002701896653002101923653000801944653000801952653000801960653000801968653001401976653000801990653000701998653000702005653000702012653000902019653000702028700001802035773007402053856008402127852000902211655001202220IND60552210520221123032455.0161020e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055221052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hyemin10aAntifungal activity and pore-forming mechanism of astacidin 1 against Candida albicans  ap. 58-63.  aIn a previous report, a novel antibacterial peptide astacidin 1 (FKVQNQHGQVVKIFHH) was isolated from hemocyanin of the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. In this study, the antifungal activity and mechanism of astacidin 1 were evaluated. Astacidin 1 exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Trichosporon beigelii, Malassezia furfur, and Trichophyton rubrum. Also, astacidin 1 had fungal cell selectivity in human erythrocytes without causing hemolysis. To understand the antifungal mechanism, membrane studies were done against C. albicans and T. beigelii. Flow cytometric analysis and K+ measurement showed membrane damage, resulting in membrane permeabilization and K+ release-induced membrane depolarization. Furthermore, the calcein leakage from liposomes mimicking C. albicans membrane demonstrated that the membrane-active action was driven by pore-forming mechanism. Live cell imaging using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans of various sizes suggested that the radii of pores formed in the C. albicans membrane were 1.4–2.3 nm. Therefore, the present study suggests that astacidin 1 exerts its antifungal effect by damaging the fungal membrane via pore formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aMalassezia furfur 3aPacifastacus leniusculus 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aTrichosporon beigelii 3aantifungal properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acrayfish 3aerythrocytes 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescein 3afreshwater 3afungi 3ahemocyanin 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3apotassium 0aAstacidin 1 0aAntifungal activity 0aPore-forming mechanism 0aCandida albicans 0aDMF 0aTFA 0aMIC 0aPBS 0aDiBAC4(3) 0aLUV 0aPC 0aPE 0aPI 0aFITC 0aFD1 aLee, Dong Gun0 tBiochimie.g2014 Oct., v. 105 p.58-63dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010900156520182000265592002802085650002902113650001502142650001202157650001502169650002402184650002202208650001002230650001102240650002002251650001302271650000902284650002402293650001102317650001102328650001502339650001302354650001402367651002002381700001802401773012002419856007302539852000902612655001202621IND60649006220221120155843.0190702e20190624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900622DNAL7 a10.3390/f100605242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yang 10aDrivers of Wildfire Occurrence Patterns in the Inland Riverine Environment of New South Wales, Australia  aIn the inland riverine environment of Australia, wildfires not only threaten human life and cause economic loss but also make distinctive impacts on the ecosystem (e.g., injuring or killing fire-sensitive wetland species such as the river red gum). Understanding the drivers of wildfire occurrence patterns in this particular environment is vital for fire-risk reduction and ecologically sustainable management. This study investigated patterns and driving factors of wildfire occurrence over the years from 2001 to 2016 and across the New South Wales side of the Riverina bioregion. Descriptive analyses were conducted for fires of different causes and that burned different vegetation types. Logistic regression models were developed by incorporating factors that provide information on weather, climate, fuel, topography and ignition sources. Analyses revealed that most fires occurred in summer, with human-caused fires primarily in spring and summer, and natural fires in summer. Summer was the most fire-prone season in forested wetlands, whereas fires in drylands mostly occurred during spring and summer. Fire probabilities were higher under severe weather conditions, in areas with higher annual rainfall, in forested wetlands and in areas with intermediate inundation frequencies. Special attention needs to be paid to the effects of vegetation type and inundation frequency on fire occurrence. Weather, climate&amp;fuel and ignition sources were comparably important in explaining human-caused fire occurrence, whereas weather was more important than climate&amp;fuel in explaining natural fire occurrence. Understandings obtained from this study can potentially support the planning of fire and forest management, as well as to supplement the relatively scarce knowledge on riverine wildfire occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3afinancial economics 3aforest management 3afuels 3ahumans 3alowland forests 3aplanning 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aspring 3asummer 3atopography 3awetlands 3awildfires 3aNew South Wales1 aLim, Samsung 0 tForests.g2019 June 24, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100605243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245020500181500002200386520159400408592002802002650002202030650001002052650002002062650001102082650002302093650003802116650002002154650001002174650002102184650002102205650001902226650001902245650001802264650001802282650001802300650001802318650001802336650002202354650001102376650002102387650002702408650001702435650004302452650005202495650003602547653002902583653002302612653001402635653001702649700003102666700002902697700003402726700002702760700003202787700003202819773009802851856008602949852000903035655001203044IND60662802620221118135214.0190906e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066280262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2019.1077552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContreras-Ochoa, Carla O.10aExcreted and secreted products (72/60 kDa) from Haemonchus placei larvae induce in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and activate the expression of cytokines and FCεR1A receptor  aPre-press version  aThe aim of the present study was to assess the expression of cytokines and FCεR1A receptor stimulated by Haemonchus placei larval excretory and secretory (ES) products associated with the pathogenesis in calves. Bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in in vitro assays with H. placei L4 ES product at 8, 12, 16 and 24 h. ES products were collected in in vitro assays at 48 h with molecular weight of 72/60 kDa and isoelectric point of 7.2 pI. Specific IgG for infected and control calves, positive and negative, were employed to recognise H. placei larval ES products by indirect ELISA, showing a mean of 1.8, 0.83 and 0.28 OD, respectively, (p ≤ 0.001). The quantification of relative gene expression was performed using a set of cytokines (IL-2, IFNγ, TGFβ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-13), FCεR1A receptor and housekeeping (GAPDH, β-actin and β-2-microglobulin) by RT-qPCR. An early increased expression, 2.2- to 3.4-fold change, of IL-2 (p ≤ 0.001), IL-5 and TGFβ (p ≥ 0.05) was determined, followed by TGFβ (30.7 and 14.14), IL-8 (102.8 and 1504.4) and IL-10 (60.4 and 1.7) (p ≤ 0.05) after 12 and 16 h, respectively, and reducing the expression level at 24 h. In addition, IL-6, IL-13 and FCεR1A receptor also displayed mild expression level, 2.1 – to 7.60-fold change, at 24 h (p ≥ 0.05). We conclude that ES products of 72/60 kDa collected in vitro from H. placei larvae are recognised by infected hosts and have the ability to induce diverse immune factors to modulate the nematode damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus placei 3aactin 3aanimal diseases 3acalves 3acell proliferation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3ahosts 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ain vitro studies 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3aisoelectric point 3alarvae 3amolecular weight 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aHaemonchus placei larvae 0aSecretory products 0aCytokines 0aIgE receptor1 aLagunas-Martínez, Alfredo1 aReyes-Guerrero, David E.1 aBautista-García, Génesis A.1 aTello-López, Angel T.1 aGonzález-Garduño, Roberto1 aLópez-Arellano, Ma Eugenia0 tExperimental parasitology.g2019 Sept. 02, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2019.1077553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245011800201300001800319500001100337506007600348520100400424592002801428596005901456596005901515596005901574596005901633596005901692596006201751596006201813596006201875596006201937596006301999596006302062596006302125596009702188506003702285650001902322650002902341650001602370650001902386650001902405650001402424650001302438650001702451650001402468650002402482700001702506700001802523700001802541700001702559700001702576700001602593700001902609700001502628700001102643773015002654856008202804852000902886655001202895IND60674043020221207104915.0191023e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067404302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03222-12doi7 aPMC68035692pmcid7 a313092492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Ke10aLong non-coding RNA PVT1 interacts with MYC and its downstream molecules to synergistically promote tumorigenesis  ap. 4275-4289.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNumerous studies have shown that non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in the development and progression of various tumor cells. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) mainly encodes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and is located on chromosome 8q24.21, which constitutes a fragile site for genetic aberrations. PVT1 is well-known for its interaction with its neighbor MYC, which is a qualified oncogene that plays a vital role in tumorigenesis. In the past several decades, increasing attention has been paid to the interaction mechanism between PVT1 and MYC, which will benefit the clinical treatment and prognosis of patients. In this review, we summarize the coamplification of PVT1 and MYC in cancer, the positive feedback mechanism, and the latest promoter competition mechanism of PVT1 and MYC, as well as how PVT1 participates in the downstream signaling pathway of c-Myc by regulating key molecules. We also briefly describe the treatment prospects and research directions of PVT1 and MYC.  aPublisher supplied data  a81572787cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81672683cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81672993cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81772928cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81872278cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016JC2035cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2017SK2105cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2018JJ3704cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2018JJ3815cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2018SK21210cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2018SK21211cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2019JJ50354cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a111 Project, No. 111-2-12cOverseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3aplasmacytoma 3aprognosis 3asignal transduction1 aWang, Shufei1 aZhang, Yazhuo1 aXia, Mengfang1 aMo, Yongzhen1 aLi, Xiaoling1 aLi, Guiyuan1 aZeng, Zhaoyang1 aXiong, Wei1 aHe, Yi0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 Nov., v. 76, no. 21 p.4275-4289dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03222-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017200168520135900340592002801699650001901727650002301746650002201769650001001791650001601801650002401817650003201841650004301873650001801916650001301934651001001947700002201957700002101979700001902000700002802019700003402047700002602081700001702107700002202124773012302146856008202269852000902351655001202360IND60784170320221118181545.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078417032DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110707872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZulantay, Inés 10aDiscrete Typing Units of Trypanosoma cruzi Identified by Real-Time PCR in Peripheral Blood and Dejections of Triatoma infestans Used in Xenodiagnosis Descriptive Study  aChagas disease (ChD) is a vector zoonosis native to the American continent caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi; the biological vectors are multiple species of hematophagous insects of the family Triatominae. A relevant aspect in the host–parasite relationship is the identification of the various genotypes of T. cruzi called discrete typing units (DTU) that circulate in mammals and vectors. In Chile, it has been described that the DTUs TcI, TcII, TcV, and TcVI circulate in infected humans, vectors, and wild animals. Identifying DTUs has acquired clinical importance, since it has been suggested that different genotypes could cause distinct pathologies, circulate in different geographical areas, and present different sensitivities to trypanocidal drugs. In this study, circulating T. cruzi DTUs in peripheral blood and Triatoma infestans dejections used in xenodiagnosis (XD) were amplified by qPCR in 14 Chilean patients with chronic ChD from highly endemic areas. More positive samples were detected by XD compared to peripheral blood samples, and 64.28% of the cases were simple infections and 35.72% mixed, with a statistically significant difference in the frequency of TcV DTU. This study would suggest that T. infestans from Chile is more competent to amplify one DTU over others, probably due to a process of co-evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma infestans 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ablood 3acoevolution 3adescriptive studies 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3axenodiagnosis 3azoonoses 3aChile1 aMuñoz, Gabriela 1 aLiempi, Daniela 1 aRozas, Tamara 1 aManneschi, María José1 aMuñoz-San Martín, Catalina 1 aBotto-Mahan, Carezza 1 aApt, Werner 1 aCabrera, Gonzalo 0 tPathogens.g2022 July 12, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110707873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007900163520118800242592002801430650001601458650002801474650001401502650001101516650002601527650002301553650001501576650001601591650000901607700001701616700002101633700002501654700001901679700002201698773012001720856007301840852000901913655001201922IND60649006320221120155857.0190702e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064900632DNAL7 a10.3390/f100605252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangová, Nadežda 10aConstruction of Wood-Based Lamella for Increased Load on Seating Furniture  aThe research on population shows that the count of overweight people has been constantly growing. Therefore, designing and modifying utility items, e.g., furniture should be brought into focus. Indeed, furniture function and safety is associated with the weight of a user. Current processes and standards dealing with the design of seating furniture do not meet the requirements of overweight users. The research is aimed at designing flexible chairs consisting of lamellae using the finite element method (FEM). Three types of glued lamellae based on wood with different number of layers and thickness were made and subsequently, their mechanical properties were tested. Values for modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture were used to determine stress and deformation applying the FEM method for modelling flexible chairs. In this research, the methodology for evaluating the ultimate state of flexible chairs used to analyse deformation and stability was defined. The analysis confirms that several designed constructions meet the requirements of actual standards (valid for the weight of a user up to 110 kg) but fail to meet the requirements for weight gain of a population.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3afurniture 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3aoverweight 3aweight gain 3awood1 aRéh, Roman 1 aIgaz, Rastislav 1 aKrišťák, Ľuboš 1 aHitka, Miloš 1 aJoščák, Pavol 0 tForests.g2019 June 25, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100605253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015300163300001600316520120900332592002801541650002101569650002001590650002501610650002201635650001201657650001201669650002201681650001301703650002501716650002501741700001901766700002001785700002001805700002001825773010001845856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60518198120221118004443.0160408e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051819812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2039-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wooho10aRecombinant production of a shell matrix protein in Escherichia coli and its application to the biomimetic synthesis of spherulitic calcite crystals  ap. 809-816.  aOBJECTIVES: To overcome the limited production capability of shell matrix proteins and efficiently conduct in vitro CaCO₃ biomineralization studies, a putative recombinant shell matrix protein was prepared and characterized. RESULTS: A glycine-rich protein (GRP_BA) was found in Pinctada fucata as a putative shell matrix protein (NCBI reference sequence; BAA20465). It was genetically redesigned for the production in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was obtained in a 400 ml shake-flask culture at approx. 30 mg l⁻¹ with a purity of >95 %. It efficiently formed a complex with Ca²⁺. Ca²⁺-induced agglomeration was like other calcification-related proteins. Spherulitic calcite micro-particles, 20–30 µm diam. with rosette- and sphere-like structures were synthesized in the presence of the recombinant shell protein, which could be formed by stacking and/or aggregation of calcite nanograins and the bound protein. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant production of a shell matrix protein could overcome potential difficulties associated with the limited amount of protein available for biomineralization studies and provide opportunities to fabricate biominerals in practical aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPinctada fucata 3abiomimetic synthesis 3abiomineralization 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acrystals 3aglycine (amino acid) 3arecombinant proteins1 aBahn, So Yeong1 aCha, Hyung Joon1 aPack, Seung Pil1 aChoi, Yoo Seong0 tBiotechnology letters.g2016 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.809-816dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2039-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009600160500001900256520128000275592002801555650001601583650001701599650001201616650001001628650001201638650002101650700002101671700002401692773012801716856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60738917620221119220738.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073891762DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131020102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoiha, Johanna 14aThe Hidden Cairns—A Case Study of Drone-Based ALS as an Archaeological Site Survey Method  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConducting archaeological site surveys is time consuming, and large sites may have many small features or structures that are difficult to locate and interpret. Vegetation cover and dense forest hide small structures, like cairns, while at the same time forest cover can cause problems for LiDAR tools. In this case study, drone-based ALS (airborne laser scanning) was tested as an archaeological site survey tool. The research site was complex and located partially in a forested area, which made it possible to evaluate how forest cover affects data. The survey methods used were rather simple: visual analysis, point density calculations in the forest area, and, for site interpretation purposes, digitizing observations and viewshed analysis. Using straightforward methods allowed us to evaluate the minimum time and skills needed for this type of survey. Drone-based ALS provided good results and increased knowledge of the site and its structures. Estimates of the number of cairns interpreted as graves more than doubled as a result of the high-accuracy ALS data. Based on the results of this study, drone-based ALS could be a suitable high-accuracy survey method for large archaeological sites. However, forest cover affects the accuracy, and more research is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acase studies 3aforests 3alidar 3asurveys 3avegetation cover1 aHeinaro, Einari 1 aHolopainen, Markus 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 20, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131020103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006900158500001900227520127300246592002801519650000801547650001501555650001501570650002901585650001101614650001101625650001501636651002101651700001901672700002001691700002001711700002001731773012801751856007401879852000901953655001201962IND60738917720221119220720.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073891772DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131020112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sehwan 10aImprovement of GPR-Based Rebar Diameter Estimation Using YOLO-v3  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the frequency of earthquakes has increased in Korea in recent years, designing earthquake-resistant facilities has been increasingly emphasized. Structures constructed with rebars are vulnerable to shaking, which reduces their seismic performance and may result in damage to human life and property. Because the construction of facilities requires the maintenance of sub-constructions, such as by cutting rebars or compensating for missing rebars, information on rebar diameter is required. In this study, the YOLO-v3 algorithm, which has the fastest object recognition performance, was applied to the structural correction data, and a basic experiment was conducted in the air to predict the diameter of rebars in a facility, in real time based on ground-penetrating radar data. The reason for using the YOLO-v3 algorithm is that in the case of GPR data that change slightly according to the diameter of the reinforcing bar, it is difficult to discriminate with the naked eye, and the result may change depending on the inspector. The model achieved a higher accuracy than conventional rebar detection and diameter prediction methods. In addition, the possibility of real-time rebar diameter prediction during construction, using the proposed method, was verified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3ageophysics 3aground-penetrating radar 3ahumans 3amodels 3aprediction 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Jinpyung 1 aJeon, Kyoyoung 1 aKim, Junkyeong 1 aPark, Seunghee 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 20, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131020113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002000157245008500177300001800262520110500280592002801385650002101413650001401434650001001448650002701458650001401485650002601499650002501525650003901550650002801589650001001617650002401627700002001651773012401671856003901795852000901834655001201843IND50059085020221117225013.0121011e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005908502DNAL7 a227605802pmid7 a10.1002/etc.19322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Eva M.10aUnderstanding the atmospheric measurement and behavior of perfluorooctanoic acid  ap. 2041-2046.  aThe recently reported quantification of the atmospheric sampling artifact for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was applied to existing gas and particle concentration measurements. Specifically, gas phase concentrations were increased by a factor of 3.5 and particle‐bound concentrations by a factor of 0.1. The correlation constants in two particle–gas partition coefficient (KQA) estimation equations were determined for multiple studies with and without correcting for the sampling artifact. Correction for the sampling artifact gave correlation constants with improved agreement to those reported for other neutral organic contaminants, thus supporting the application of the suggested correction factors for perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Applying the corrected correlation constant to a recent multimedia modeling study improved model agreement with corrected, reported, atmospheric concentrations. This work confirms that there is sufficient partitioning to the gas phase to support the long‐range atmospheric transport of PFOA. Environ. Toxicol.

Herein, we developed a novel 3D ternary hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of Fe₂O₃ strongly coupled with Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂ grown on commercial Ni foam (denoted as Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂/NF) through a thermal phosphorization reaction. In this 3D hybrid structure, the Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂ nanoparticles with a length of ∼300 nm and width of ∼200 nm are homogeneously grown on the surface of 3D Ni foam. Owing to the synergistic effect between Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂/NF and their strong coupling effect, the 3D Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂/NF hybrid achieves a superior electrocatalytic OER performance at ultra-high current densities in alkaline electrolyte. High catalytic current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm⁻² are reached by applying only potentials of 1.57 and 1.60 V, respectively, which are almost the lowest potentials among all previously reported transition metal (Ni and Fe) based phosphide and phosphate electrocatalysts, and even better than that of the benchmark Ir/C catalyst (1.64 and >1.8 V at 100 and 500 mA cm⁻²). In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the NiOOH and FeOOH species were the real active phases in Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂/NF during the OER process. A two-electrode electrolyzer with Fe₂O₃@Ni₂P/Ni(PO₃)₂/NF delivers a cell voltage of 1.93, 2.48, and 3.02 V at 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm⁻² for overall-water-splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aferric oxide 3afoams 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3aphosphates 3aphosphides 3asynergism1 aPan, Zhiyan1 aLei, Chaojun1 aJin, Yangjun1 aYang, Bin1 aLi, Zhongjian1 aZhang, Xingwang1 aLei, Lecheng1 aYuan, Chris1 aHou, Yang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 7, no. 3 p.965-971dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta11223a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245012400210300001500334506007600349520129900425592002801724506003701752650001401789650001601803650001301819650000901832650001901841653001801860653001401878653001701892653001701909653001801926653002201944700006301966700002002029700002802049773007502077856008402152852000902236655001202245IND60552211020221207092433.0161020e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055221102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0192doi7 aPMC41635222pmcid7 a250142472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Genea10aSphingolipids and ceramides of mouse aqueous humor: Comparative profiles from normotensive and hypertensive DBA/2J mice  ap. 99-109.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo identify the sphingolipid and ceramide species and their quantitative differences between normotensive and hypertensive intraocular pressure states in DBA/2J mouse aqueous humor (AH).Normotensive and hypertensive AH was sampled from mice by paracentesis. Lipid extraction was performed using modifications of the Bligh and Dyer method. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford colorimetric assay. Sphingolipids and ceramides were identified and subjected to ratiometric quantification using appropriate class specific lipid standards on a TSQ Quantum Access Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.The comparative profiles of normotensive and hypertensive DBA/2J mouse AH showed several species of sphingomyelin, sphingoid base, sphingoid base-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramides common between them. A number of unique lipids in each of the above lipid classes were also identified in normotensive AH that were absent in hypertensive AH and vice versa.A number of sphingolipid and ceramide species were found to be uniquely present in normotensive, but absent in hypertensive AH and vice versa. Further pursuit of these findings is likely to contribute towards expanding our understanding of the molecular changes associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aceramides 3acolorimetry 3aglaucoma 3amice 3asphingomyelins 0aSphingolipids 0aCeramides 0aNormotensive 0aHypertensive 0aAqueous humor 0aMass spectrometry1 aAribindi, Katyayini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8945-05711 aGuerra, Yenifer1 aBhattacharya, Sanjoy K.0 tBiochimie.g2014 Oct., v. 105 p.99-109dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001600173245014800189300001600337520172300353592002802076650002702104650001502131650001302146650002502159650003002184650002002214650001802234650001602252650001002268650005502278650001802333650002202351650005102373650006302424650001102487650005302498650005502551650001902606651001202625651001202637700002002649700002602669700002102695773010702716856005502823852000902878655001202887IND50064712520221117224937.0130408e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006471252DNAL7 a235516532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00444.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardy, Rose10aMontana Primary Care Providers’ Access to and Satisfaction With Pediatric Specialists When Caring for Children With Special Health Care Needs  ap. 224-232.  aPurpose: Primary care providers (PCPs) of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) in rural areas face challenges in accessing specialty care to support a patient‐centered medical home. This study assessed the practice characteristics and attitudes regarding pediatric specialty care among Montana PCPs of CSHCN. Methods: We surveyed 433 Montana PCPs identified through a statewide registry. Demographic and practice information was collected, including the proportion of time spent on CSHCN care coordination. A 5‐point Likert scale was used to calculate mean need scores for each pediatric specialty, access to these specialties, and barriers to care. Results were analyzed separately for pediatricians and family physicians, as well as rural and urban providers, using λ2, t tests, and Mann‐Whitney tests. Results: Of the PCPs surveyed, 386 had a valid address and were currently practicing in Montana, 112 (29%) responded, and 91 provided care to CSHCN (averaged 29% of time spent in CSHCN care coordination). Child psychiatry (4.1) and developmental/behavioral pediatrics (3.7) were identified as the most needed specialties, yet they scored lowest in access to care (2.2 and 2.6, respectively). The most important rated specialist characteristics were quality (4.1), availability (3.5), and communication skills (2.8). Among the top barriers to care, lack of appropriate specialists was identified by 82% of PCPs. Conclusions: Specialty care delivery for CSHCN in rural areas such as Montana should focus on matching availability with the identified need for specialty services, and ensuring that systems of communication between PCPs and specialists support the care coordination function of PCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achild care 3achildren 3acommunication skills 3acommunications technology 3ahealth services 3apediatricians 3arural areas 2aChild 2aChild Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical data 2aCommunication 2aConsumer Behavior 2aDisabled Childrenxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Services Accessibilityxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aPrimary Health Carexstatistics & numerical data 2aRural Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical data 2aSpecialization 3aMontana 0aMontana1 aVivier, Patrick1 aRivara, Frederick P.,1 aMelzer, Sandford0 tJournal of rural health.g2013 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.224-232dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00444.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245013100184300001400315500001500329520169800344592002802042650001902070650001402089650002102103650002402124650001002148650002002158650001302178650001902191650002502210650003102235650001102266650002602277650001802303650002102321650001302342650004202355650001702397650002002414650002802434650001702462650001802479650002602497650002802523650001702551650003702568650003602605650003102641650004002672650003902712650003202751650003802783650003802821653001002859700001802869700001802887700001802905700001902923773007902942856008203021852000903103655001203112IND60099005120221119091154.0141105e20121210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009900512DNAL7 a230000162pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sunil10aDifferentially expressed transcripts from leaf and root tissue of Chlorophytum borivilianum: A plant with high medicinal value  ap. 79-87.  a2019-12-06  aChlorophytum borivilianum is one of the important medicinal plants used for treating different health problems such as diabetes, arthritis, physical weakness, etc. Saponins present in C. borivilianum are the primary source of its significant medicinal properties and are synthesized by mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways in plants. However, the biosynthesis of these compounds at molecular level is not studied in C. borivilianum. Cloning and sequencing of genes involved in metabolic processes are prerequisite to study the gene expression, their regulation and genetic engineering experiments. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide a quick insight into various genes and their tissue specific expression. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed using mRNA from leaf and root tissues of C. borivilianum. High quality non‐redundant 506 and 303 ESTs were generated from leaf and root specific libraries respectively. These sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics tools and grouped into different categories based on their similarity and cellular functions such as photosynthesis, metabolism, transcription factors, cell signaling, defense, stress response etc. ESTs also showed similarity with genes involved in saponins biosynthesis such as squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, cytochrome p450, glycosyltransferase, etc. Semi-quantitative analysis of some of the ESTs involved in saponins biosynthesis confirmed their differential regulation in leaves and roots. These ESTs will provide an efficient resource to accelerate gene discovery in C. borivilianum and will help in determining promising targets for genetic engineering of saponins pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3aarthritis 3amedicinal plants 3agenetic engineering 3aroots 3agene expression 3asaponins 3aphotosynthesis 3amedicinal properties 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3acytochrome P-450 3adiabetes 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3abiosynthesis 3astress response 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aChlorophytum 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenes, Plant 2aLiliaceaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMevalonic Acidxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Medicinalxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaponinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0agenes1 aKalra, Shikha1 aKumar, Sanjay1 aKaur, Jagdeep1 aKashmir Singh,0 tGene.g2012 Dec. 10, v. 511, no. 1 p.79-87dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008000163300001200243520173300255592002801988650002902016650000902045650001102054650001202065650001402077650001102091650001902102650001702121650003302138650003302171650002302204650000902227650001902236650001802255651001002273700002602283700002002309700002402329700001602353700002202369773013202391856008102523852000902604655001202613IND60518198520221118004342.0160507e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051819852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5279-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGune, Minal10aRock magnetic finger-printing of soil from a coal-fired thermal power plant  ap. 272.  aWe present seasonal rock magnetic data for 48 surficial soil samples collected seasonally around a coal-fired thermal power plant on the southwest coast of India to demonstrate how fly ash from the power plant is transported both spatially and seasonally. Sampling was carried out during pre-monsoon (March), early-monsoon (June), monsoon (September) and post-monsoon (December) seasons. Low- and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility (χₗf and χₕf), frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), χfd %, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), “hard” IRM (HIRM), saturation IRM (SIRM) and inter-parametric ratios were determined for the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on limited number of samples. NOAA HYSPLIT MODEL backward trajectory analysis and principal component analysis were carried out on the data. Fly ash samples exhibit an average HIRM value (400.07 × 10⁻⁵ Am² kg⁻¹) that is comparable to that of soil samples. The pre- and post-monsoon samples show a consistent reduction in the concentration of magnetically “hard” minerals with increasing distance from the power plant. These data suggest that fly ash has indeed been transported from the power plant to the sampling locations. Hence, HIRM may perhaps be used as a proxy for tracking fly ash from coal-fired thermal power plants. Seasonal data show that the distribution of fly ash to the surrounding areas is minimum during monsoons. They also point to the dominance of SP magnetite in early-monsoon season, whereas magnetic depletion is documented in the monsoon season. This seasonal difference is attributable to both pedogenesis and anthropogenic activity i.e. operation of the thermal power plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoal 3acoasts 3afly ash 3amagnetite 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3apower plants 3aprincipal component analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3asoil formation 3asoil sampling 3aIndia1 aHarshavardhana, B.

The airborne experiments of a scale prototype of China’s planned spaceborne IPDA LIDAR was implemented in 2019. A problem with data inversion caused by the detector module nonlinearity was found. Through many experiments, the amplifier circuit board (ACB) of the detector module was proved to be the main factor causing the nonlinearity. Through amplifier circuit optimization, the original bandwidth of the ACB was changed to 1 MHz by using a fifth-order active filter. Compared with the original version, the linearity of optimized ACB is improved from 42.6% to 0.0747%. The optimized ACB was produced and its linearity was verified by experiments. In addition, the output waveform of the optimized ACB changes significantly, which will affect the random error (RE) of the optimized IPDA LIDAR system. Through the performance simulation, the RE of more than 90% of the global area is less than 0.728 ppm. Finally, the transfer model of the detector module was given, which will be helpful for the further optimization of the CO₂ column-averaged dry-air mixing ratio (XCO₂) inversion algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3alidar 3amodels 3aprototypes 3aChina1 aYang, Juxin 1 aZhang, Xiaoxi 1 aLiu, Jiqiao 1 aZhu, Xiaopeng 1 aZang, Huaguo 1 aXia, Tengteng 1 aFan, Chuncan 1 aChen, Xiao 1 aSun, Yanguang 1 aHou, Xia 1 aChen, Weibiao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 20, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131020073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001400299500001500313520144900328592002801777650001501805650001201820650001101832650001301843650001501856650001701871650001501888650001901903650001901922650002201941653003101963653001901994653002002013653001302033653000802046653001802054653001302072653001502085700001602100700001602116700001902132700001802151700001402169700001502183700001302198773007402211856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60552211320221123042331.0161020e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055221132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Huiyu10aOverexpression of Lewis y antigen promotes human epididymis protein 4-mediated invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells  ap. 91-98.  a2019-12-06  aTo study Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) surface fucosylation and to determine the effects and significance of Lewis y antigen on HE4-mediated invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, we investigated four types of ovarian cancer cells and found that six fucosylated antigens (Lewis y, Lewis x, Lewis a, Lewis b, sLewis a, and sLewis x) were identified on HE4 in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, modification of the type II sugar chain (Lewis y, Lewis x, and sLewis x) was significantly higher than the type I sugar chain (Lewis a, Lewis b, sLewis a) of the lactose series. To confirm the effects of Lewis y antigen on HE4-mediated invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, the CaoV-3 cells with high Lewis y antigen on the HE4 surface and ES-2 cells, with high Lewis x antigen but low Lewis y antigen, were investigated. We found that the expression levels of HE4 and Lewis y increased in both cell lines while the level of Lewis x didn't have any change after transfection. Furthermore, the high expression of Lewis y antigen significantly enhanced the HE4-mediated invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. The invasion and metastasis capacities were significantly decreased after Lewis y antibody blocking. This study demonstrates that overexpression of the Lewis y antigen on HE4 promotes ovarian cancer cell invasion and metastasis, which is likely to be used as a target for the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepididymis 3alactose 3ahumans 3aantigens 3aantibodies 3atransfection 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aanimal ovaries 3aovarian neoplasms 0aHuman epididymis protein 4 0aOvarian cancer 0aLewis y antigen 0aInvasion 0aHE4 0acell invasion 0asLewis a 0aMetastasis1 aHu, Zhenhua1 aTan, Mingzi1 aZhu, Liancheng1 aLiu, Juanjuan1 aLiu, Dawo1 aYan, Limei1 aLin, Bei0 tBiochimie.g2014 Oct., v. 105 p.91-98dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007400164300001800238500001100256520142600267592002801693596005901721596005901780596008701839650000801926650003201934650002501966650002001991650001902011650002102030650001702051650001002068650001202078650001802090650001302108650002402121650001602145650002302161650002902184650002602213700001302239700001502252700005602267773015002323856008202473852000902555655001202564IND60674043820221119144706.0191023e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067404382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03216-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Junyun10aGuidance of circular RNAs to proteins’ behavior as binding partners  ap. 4233-4243.  aReview  aCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded and covalently closed back-splicing products of pre-mRNAs. They can be derived from exons, introns, or exons with intron retained between exons of transcripts, as well as antisense transcripts. CircRNAs have been reported to function as microRNA sponges, regulate gene transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II, and modulate the splicing or stability of mRNA. However, emerging studies demonstrate that they affect the behavior of proteins via direct interactions with them. Here, we summarize that by binding directly with proteins; circRNAs can facilitate their nuclear or cytoplasmic localizations, regulate their functions or stability, promote or inhibit the interactions between them, or influence the interactions between them and DNA. Furthermore, these circRNA-binding proteins contain transcription factors, RNA processing proteins, proteases, and some other RNA-binding proteins. As a consequence, circRNAs are involved in the regulation of multiple physiological or pathological processes, including tumorigenesis, atherosclerosis, wound repair, cardiac senescence, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, and so forth. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to further explore more types of proteins that interact with circRNAs, which would be helpful in revealing other unknown biological functions of circRNAs that guide the variation in behavior of cellular proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  a81772552cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81572714cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a531118010140cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aatherosclerosis 3acarcinogenesis 3achemical bonding 3acircular RNA 3aexons 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3amyocardial ischemia 3aproteinases 3areperfusion injury 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aLiu, Hui1 aLuan, Siyu1 aLi, Zhaoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1502-40270 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 Nov., v. 76, no. 21 p.4233-4243dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03216-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04039naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245012700185300001600312520143900328592002801767650002501795650002701820650002801847650001501875650003701890650001601927650001901943650001601962650002201978650001302000650001402013650001402027650004402041650003902085650006302124650004802187650003202235650003502267650003302302650005202335650002902387650005302416650004202469650003802511650002002549650004902569650003902618650002302657650004702680650003502727650001402762650003402776650003602810650002902846650005302875700001502928700001702943700002102960700001402981700002202995700002103017700002003038700001303058700002103071700001303092773010003105856005503205852000903260655001203269IND4469080320221117224933.0120320e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446908032DNAL7 a223562822pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04070.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wei14aThe Arabidopsis J‐protein AtDjB1 facilitates thermotolerance by protecting cells against heat‐induced oxidative damage  ap. 364-378.  a• AtDjB1 belongs to the J‐protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its biological functions in plants are largely unknown. • In this study, we examined the roles of AtDjB1 in resisting heat and oxidative stresses in A. thaliana using reverse genetic analysis. • AtDjB1 knockout plants (atj1‐1) were more sensitive to heat stress than wildtype plants, and displayed decreased concentrations of ascorbate (ASC), and increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxidative products after heat shock. Application of H2O2 accelerated cell death and decreased seedling viability in atj1‐1. Exogenous ASC conferred much greater thermotolerance in atj1‐1 than in wildtype plants, suggesting that a lower concentration of ASC in atj1‐1 could be responsible for the increased concentration of H2O2 and decreased thermotolerance. Furthermore, AtDjB1 was found to localize to mitochondria, directly interact with a mitochondrial heat‐shock protein 70 (mtHSC70‐1), and stimulate ATPase activity of mtHSC70‐1. AtDjB1 knockout led to the accumulation of cellular ATP and decreased seedling respiration, indicating that AtDjB1 modulated the ASC concentration probably through affecting the function of mitochondria. • Taken together, these results suggest that AtDjB1 plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis, and facilitates thermotolerance by protecting cells against heat‐induced oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acell death 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aproteins 3aseedlings 3aviability 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aCell Respirationxdrug effects 2aCytoprotectionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aHSP40 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHeat-Shock Responsexdrug effects 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOrgan Specificityxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPhenotype 2aProtein Bindingxdrug effects 2aProtein Transportxdrug effects 2aSeedlingsxdrug effects. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aZhou, Ting1 aLi, Mi‐Xin1 aZhao, Chun‐Lan1 aJia, Ning1 aWang, Xing‐Xing1 aSun, Yong‐Zhen1 aLi, Guo‐Liang1 aXu, Meng1 aZhou, Ren‐Gang1 aLi, Bing0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Apr., v. 194, no. 2 p.364-378dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04070.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007300165520180000238592002802038650002502066650001202091650002402103650001302127650001302140650001302153650001502166650001402181650001402195650001402209650001402223650001602237650001302253651001002266700002002276700002002296700002102316700002002337700002202357773012302379856008202502852000902584655001202593IND60784171220221120134107.0220726e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078417122DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110707942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlai, Shweta 10aCharacterization of Bordetella pertussis Strains Isolated from India  aDespite high level vaccination and the availability of two different types of vaccines, whole cell (wP) and acellular vaccines (aP), the resurgence of pertussis has been reported in many countries. Antigenic variation within circulating and vaccine strains is the most documented reason reported for the resurgence of pertussis. Research on genetic divergence among circulating and vaccine strains has largely been reported in countries using aP vaccines. There are inadequate data available for antigenic variation in B. pertussis from wP-using countries. India has used wP for more than 40 years in their primary immunization program. The present study reports five clinical isolates of B. pertussis from samples of pediatric patients with pertussis symptoms observed in India. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of clinical isolates were performed by serotyping, genotyping, whole genome analyses and comparative genomics. All clinical isolates showed serotype 1, 2 and 3 based on the presence of fimbriae 2 and 3. Genotyping showed genetic similarities in allele types for five aP genes within vaccine strains and clinical isolates reported from India. The presence of the ptxP3 genotype was observed in two out of five clinical isolates. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for clinical isolates using the hybrid strategy of combining Illumina (short reads) and oxford nanopore (long reads) sequencing strategies. Clinical isolates (n = 5) and vaccine strains (n = 7) genomes of B. pertussis from India were compared with 744 B. pertussis closed genomes available in the public databases. The phylogenomic comparison of B. pertussis genomes reported from India will be advantageous in better understanding pertussis resurgence reported globally with respect to pathogen adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aalleles 3aantigenic variation 3afimbriae 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ananopores 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aIndia1 aGautam, Manish 1 aPalkar, Sonali 1 aOswal, Jitendra 1 aGairola, Sunil 1 aDhotre, Dhiraj P.0 tPathogens.g2022 July 14, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110707943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245014600176520166900322592002801991650002002019650001302039650002002052650001502072650001602087650001702103650001602120650002002136650002402156650001302180650001802193650001402211650003002225650001102255650002602266650002002292650001502312651001602327653001602343653002802359653001202387653004102399653002802440653001002468700002402478700001802502700002102520700001602541773011902557856008802676852000902764655001202773IND60767094520221120104637.0220606e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076709452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaryab, Abdulhalim10aDetermining nitrate pollution sources in the Kabul Plain aquifer (Afghanistan) using stable isotopes and Bayesian stable isotope mixing model  aThe Kabul urban aquifer (Afghanistan), which is the main source of drinking water for Kabul city's inhabitants, is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution. In this study, the geochemistry of major ions (including reactive nitrogen species such as NO₃⁻, NO₂ˉ, and NH₄⁺) and stable isotope ratios (δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻, δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻, δ¹⁸O-H₂O, and δ²H-H₂O) of surface and groundwater samples from the Kabul Plain were analyzed over two sampling periods (dry and wet seasons). A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (BSIMM) was also employed to trace potential nitrate sources, transformation processes, and proportional contributions of nitrate sources in the Kabul aquifer. The plotting of δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ against δ¹⁸O-NO₃̄ (δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ and δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻ values ranged from +4.8 to +25.4‰ and from −11.7 to +18.6‰, respectively) suggests that NO₃⁻ primarily originated from the nitrification of sewage rather than artificial fertilizer. The plotting of δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ versus NO₃⁻/Cl⁻ ratios also supported the assumption that sewage is the dominant nitrate source. The results indicate that denitrification did not influence the NO₃⁻ isotopic composition in the Kabul aquifer. The BSIMM model suggests that nitrate in the dry season originated mainly from sewage (~81%), followed by soil organic N (10.5%), and chemical fertilizer (8.5%). In the wet season, sewage (~87.5%), soil organic N (6.7%), and chemical fertilizer (5.8%) were the main sources of NO₃⁻ in the Kabul aquifer. Effective land management measures should be taken to improve the sewage collection system in the Kabul Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aaquifers 3adenitrification 3adry season 3aenvironment 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aland management 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrates 3anitrification 3apollution 3areactive nitrogen species 3asewage 3asoil organic nitrogen 3astable isotopes 3awet season 3aAfghanistan 0aGroundwater 0aNitrate stable isotopes 0aNitrate 0aBayesian stable isotope mixing model 0aNitrogen transformation 0aKabul1 aNassery, Hamid Reza1 aKnoeller, Kay1 aAlijani, Farshad1 aMinet, Eddy0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 01, v. 823 p.153749-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1537493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010700166300001800273500001100291520142300302592002801725650001701753650001501770650001901785650002301804650002001827650002001847650001301867650001301880650002101893650001501914650001501929650001401944650001901958650001901977650001301996650001402009650001702023700001302040773015002053856008202203852000902285655001202294IND60674043920221119144657.0191023e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067404392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03215-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Changbiao10aBiological functions and clinical applications of exosomal non-coding RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 4203-4219.  aReview  aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, with a high mortality rate. Its dismal prognosis is attributed to late diagnosis, high risk of recurrence and drug resistance. To improve the survival of patients with HCC, new approaches are required for early diagnosis, real-time monitoring and effective treatment. Exosomes are small membranous vesicles released by most cells that contain biological molecules and play a great role in intercellular communication under physiological or pathological conditions. In cancer, exosomes from tumor cells or non-tumor cells can be taken up by neighboring or distant target cells, and the cargoes in exosomes are functional to modulate the behaviors of tumors or reshape tumor microenvironment (TME). As essential components, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are selectively enriched in exosomes, and exosomal ncRNAs participate in regulating specific aspects of tumor development, including tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, immunomodulation and drug resistance. Besides, dysregulated exosomal ncRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers, and exosomes can serve as natural vehicles to deliver tumor-suppressed ncRNAs for treatment. In this review, we briefly summarize the biology of exosomes, the functions of exosomal ncRNAs in HCC development and their potential clinical applications, including as biomarkers and therapeutic tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3acell communication 3adrug resistance 3aearly diagnosis 3aexosomes 3ahepatoma 3aimmunomodulation 3ametastasis 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics1 aXu, Xiao0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 Nov., v. 76, no. 21 p.4203-4219dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03215-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245010200188300001600290520092300306592002801229650000801257650001201265650002001277650001301297650001301310650002701323650003001350650002501380650001501405650001001420650000901430650002201439650001701461650003601478650001801514650002501532650002601557650001101583650001901594650003201613650002001645650003801665650001101703650000901714650001601723650003701739650002601776650001601802651001101818700002101829700001801850700001501868773008101883856008201964852000902046655001202055IND60099005420221119091252.0141105e20121210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009900542DNAL7 a230005652pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYigit, Serbulent10aAssociation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphism and rheumatoid arthritis  ap. 106-108.  aWe sought to determine the frequency of I/D polymorphism genotypes of angiotensin converting enzyme gene in Turkish patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

The hominicin was identified by the comparative analysis of LC-MS 2Dprofiles of peptides captured by bare and PL-immobilized MPs. This is the first report for the development of rapid AMP screening method using lipid-immobilized MPs and LC-MS which will be a promising tool for discovery of various kinds of AMPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus hominis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3achemical bonding 3aethanolamine 3aglycerol 3aliquid chromatography 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3aphospholipids 3arapid methods 3ascreening0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2018 Sept., v. 23, no. 5 p.598-604dThe Korean Society for Biotechnology and BioengineeringwJournal:J000001239x1226-83727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-018-0319-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007600159500002900235520095300264592002801217650001201245650002001257650001601277650001101293650001901304650001801323650001901341650001301360650001801373700001801391700001901409700001801428700001801446700001701464700001401481773012801495856007401623852000901697655001201706IND60738918420221119220716.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073891842DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131020172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Anbang 10aSpherically Optimized RANSAC Aided by an IMU for Fisheye Image Matching  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aFisheye cameras are widely used in visual localization due to the advantage of the wide field of view. However, the severe distortion in fisheye images lead to feature matching difficulties. This paper proposes an IMU-assisted fisheye image matching method called spherically optimized random sample consensus (So-RANSAC). We converted the putative correspondences into fisheye spherical coordinates and then used an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide relative rotation angles to assist fisheye image epipolar constraints and improve the accuracy of pose estimation and mismatch removal. To verify the performance of So-RANSAC, experiments were performed on fisheye images of urban drainage pipes and public data sets. The experimental results showed that So-RANSAC can effectively improve the mismatch removal accuracy, and its performance was superior to the commonly used fisheye image matching methods in various experimental scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adata collection 3adrain pipes 3afields 3aimage analysis 3apipe drainage 3aremote sensing 3asampling 3asport fishing1 aLi, Qingquan 1 aChen, Zhipeng 1 aZhang, Dejin 1 aZhu, Jiasong 1 aYu, Jianwei 1 aFang, Xu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 20, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131020173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245010700167300001600274520071300290592002801003650002501031650001701056650001501073650001601088650001801104650002101122650001601143650001301159650002001172700002201192700001901214700001801233700001701251773009901268856008501367852000901452655001201461IND4456639020221117224837.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2010.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, Dai-Hung10aMarine food-derived functional ingredients as potential antioxidants in the food industry: An overview  ap. 523-529.  aRecently, a great deal of interest has been developed by the consumers towards natural bioactive compounds as functional ingredients in the food products due to their various health beneficial effects.

However, many factors are responsible for inhibition of anammox route that prevent advances and efficiency of the process. Many inhibitory substances influence the effectiveness of the process including substrates (nitrite and ammonia), heavy metals, organic matter, phosphates, sulfides and salts concentrations in applications. This review paper is conducted based on prior studies on the inhibitory conditions affecting efficiency of anammox process. The effect of these inhibitors differs widely owing to varied operational requirements, methodologies, physical properties of sludge and presence of microbial populations in sludge. The optimum pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, substrate concentration, sludge acclimatization, oxidation–reduction potential, use of supporting agents and load controls can significantly improve efficiency during inhibitory environments. The knowledge of various inhibitory factors on anammox will help prevent the application and improvement of anammox process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aammonia 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aenvironmental technology 3anitrites 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3aredox potential 3asludge 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aAnammox inhibition 0aNitrogen removal rate 0aLoading rate 0aNitrite 0aSulfide1 aTyagi, R.D.1 aDrogui, P.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101553-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245012500215300002000340500001900360520163100379592002802010650001402038650001502052650002502067650002102092650001002113650001302123650001402136650001902150650002202169650001402191650000702205650001602212700001802228700002102246700003002267700005402297700001802351700002202369700005902391773013102450856008402581852000902665655001202674IND60705381520221119193913.0200804e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070538152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c012142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuthongkham, Pumidech1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9234-051X10aStructural Similarity Image Analysis for Detection of Adenosine and Dopamine in Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry Color Plots  ap. 10485-10494.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is widely used for in vivo detection of neurotransmitters, but identifying analytes, particularly mixtures, is difficult. Data analysis has focused on identifying dopamine from cyclic voltammograms, but it would be better to analyze all the data in the three-dimensional FSCV color plot. Here, the goal was to use image analysis-based analysis of FSCV color plots for the first time, specifically the structural similarity index (SSIM), to identify rapid neurochemical events. Initially, we focused on identifying spontaneous adenosine events, as adenosine cyclic voltammograms have a primary oxidation at 1.3 V and a secondary oxidation peak that grows in over time. Using SSIM, sample FSCV color plots were compared with reference color plots, and the SSIM cutoff score was optimized to distinguish adenosine. High-pass digital filtering was also applied to remove the background drift and lower the noise, which produced a better LOD. The SSIM algorithm detected more adenosine events than a previous algorithm based on current versus time traces, with 99.5 ± 0.6% precision, 95 ± 3% recall, and 97 ± 2% F₁ score (n = 15 experiments from three researchers). For selectivity, it successfully rejected signals from pH changes, histamine, and H₂O₂. To prove it is a broad strategy useful beyond adenosine, SSIM analysis was optimized for dopamine detection and is able to detect simultaneous events with dopamine and adenosine. Thus, SSIM is a general strategy for FSCV data analysis that uses three-dimensional data to detect multiple analytes in an efficient, automated analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3achemical species 3acolor 3adopamine 3ahistamine 3aimage analysis 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidation 3apH 3avoltammetry1 aRocha, Julian1 aBorgus, Jason R.1 aGanesana, Mallikarjunarao1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8894-373X1 aChang, Yuanyu1 aGahlmann, Andreas1 aVenton, B.

In this study, we modified the surface properties of oil droplets larger than 10μm in size by electrostatic layer-by-layer multicoatings using polyelectrolyte dietary fibers, aiming to control their stability. Monodisperse large oil droplets were prepared by microchannel emulsification using modified-lecithin as emulsifier. Chitosan (CHI) as a cationic dietary fiber and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as an anionic fiber were alternately coated onto oil droplet surface. The ζ-potential of oil droplets was alternately changed, depending on the net charge of droplets dominated by the electrostatic property of the outer fiber layer. Multicoated oil droplets did not aggregate or coalescence in an emulsifier-free aqueous medium after two weeks storage at room temperature. When CHI was modified outer layer, oil droplets were unstable at high pH value (pH>6), due to loss of CHI charge. When CMC was outer layer, the oil droplets showed good stability to aggregation in between pH 5 and 9, but aggregated at lower pH value (pH<5), due to loss of CMC charge. These findings indicated that large oil droplet stability can be controlled by layer-by-layer coating using food grade polyelectrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3acoatings 3adietary fiber 3adroplets 3aelectrolytes 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3agastrointestinal system 3aoils 3apH 3astorage time 3azeta potential 0aO/W emulsion 0aLayer-by-layer deposition 0aStabilization 0aDietary fibers1 aNeves, Marcos A.1 aWatanabe, Jun1 aSato, Seigo1 aIchikawa, Sosaku0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Jan. 05, v. 440 p.2-9dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245006600162300001600228520120100244592002801445650002701473650001501500650001601515650001601531650001501547650002401562650002001586650002401606650001101630650001401641650001401655653003301669653002401702653002301726700001601749700001601765700001701781700001901798700001801817773011101835856008301946852000902029655001202038IND60553546220221119065829.0180831e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055354622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafiu, C.10aLiquid crystals as optical amplifiers for bacterial detection  ap. 161-170.  aInteractions of bacteria with target molecules (e.g. antibiotics) or other microorganisms are of growing interest. The first barrier for targeting gram-negative bacteria is layer of a Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Liquid crystal (LC) based sensors covered with LPS monolayers, as presented in this study, offer a simple model to study and make use of this type of interface for detection and screening. This work describes in detail the production and application of such sensors based on three different LPS that have been investigated regarding their potential to serve as sensing layer to detect bacteria. The LPS O127:B8 in combination with a LC based sensor was identified to be most useful as biomimetic sensing surface. This LPS/LC combination interacts with three different bacteria species, one gram-positive and two gram-negative species, allowing the detection of bacterial presence regardless from their viability. It could be shown that even very low bacterial cell numbers (minimum 500 cellml⁻¹) could be detected within minutes (maximum 15min). The readout mechanism is the adsorption of bacterial entities on surface bond LPS molecules with the LC serving as an optical amplifier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquid crystals 3amicrobial detection 3amodels 3ascreening 3aviability 0aLiquid crystal-based sensing 0aBacterial detection 0aLipopolysaccharide1 aHussain, Z.1 aKüpcü, S.1 aMasutani, A.1 aKilickiran, P.1 aSinner, E.-K.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 June 15, v. 80 p.161-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245016000171300001600331520159300347592002801940650002701968650001501995650001402010650003202024650001602056650001602072650002102088650002102109650001802130650001102148650002202159650002602181650002202207650001902229650002602248650001902274650002002293650001802313650002102331650001502352650002502367653002202392653002102414653001202435653002902447653002002476653001902496700001602515700001902531700005602550700001902606700002402625773009102649856009002740852000902830655001202839IND60612946720221120162805.0190613e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061294672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aUtilizing recycled LiFePO4 from batteries in combination with B@C3N4 and CuFe2O4 as sustainable nano-junctions for high performance degradation of atenolol  ap. 457-469.  aIn this report recycled LiFePO4 (LFP) from exhaust batteries was utilized to form B@C3N4/LiFePO4/CuFe2O4 (BLC) nano-junction as a visible active photocatalyst. The junction synthesized by two routes: Using as extracted LFP and forming LFP by extracted FePO4 and Li2CO3 via in-situ deposition method. The two ternary junctions BLC and BLC (E) (utilizing as extracted LFP) were utilized for visible and solar powered degradation of beta-blocker drug Atenolol (ATL). Varying the loading of CuFe2O4 (CF) which possesses lowest band gap, BLC (10%), BLC-3 (30%), BLC-5 (50%) and BLC-E (30% CF and as extracted LFP) were produced with BLC-3 exhibiting remarkable activity. The optical band gaps of BLC-3 (2.40 eV) and BLC (E) (2.46 eV) and photocurrent responses reveal high visible absorption and highly diminished recombination. 99.5% and 85.3% of ATL (20 mg L−1) could be degraded by BLC-3 and BLC (E) (0.3 g L−1) respectively in 60 min of exposure to Xe lamp and retaining of high activity in natural sunlight. Band-junction analysis, effect of scavengers and effect on teraphthalic acid and nitroblue tetrazolium reveal O2− and OH radicals as active species and mineralization was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). Cyto-toxicity studies on human peripheral blood cells and effect on growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa confirm the complete mineralization. The BLC photocatalyst is a promising multi-functional catalyst utilizing LFP (rarely used as photocatalyst) for treatment of pharmaceutical waste water and other environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aabsorption 3abatteries 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3ablood cells 3adegradation 3aelectric current 3aferric phosphate 3afree radicals 3ahumans 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amineralization 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation 3aspectrometers 3asuperoxide anion 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPhoto-degradation 0aWaste management 0aLiFePO4 0aPharmaceutical effluents 0aWater treatment 0aCarbon nitride1 aKumari, Anu1 aSharma, Gaurav1 aNaushad, Mu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6056-587X1 aAhamad, Tansir1 aStadler, Florian J.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 209 p.457-469dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008700209520135700296592002801653650002301681650002801704650001801732650001801750650001401768650001601782650001201798650002501810651001401835653001701849653002001866653001801886653001001904653001501914653001401929653002801943653002701971653002001998653002502018653002802043700002002071700002002091700002402111700002602135700001702161700002002178773009402198856008602292852000902378655001202387IND60722493120221120044651.0210820e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072249312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudiarti, Mery1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0517-946314aThe use of antimalarial plants as traditional treatment in Papua Island, Indonesia  aThe residents of the Eastern part of Indonesia, specifically, Papua and West Papua provinces, are dependent on traditional medicines with the use of plants, which includes treating malaria. However, there are limited information on the diversity of medicinal plants in Papua Island. Hence, the Indonesian Ministry of Health put together a database of all the natural plant-based raw materials in Indonesia, to address part of the issues encountered as a result of the limited information on the diversity of plants. Based on this background, the aim of the research was to analyze the information on medicinal plants used by the traditional healers in Papua Island based on the results of research on medicinal plants and Jamu (RISTOJA), especially in treating malaria. Data were obtained through ethnomedicine research conducted in 2012 and 2017 involving 54 ethnicities in Papua. Based on the results, 72 species of medicinal plants from 67 genera and 40 families were used traditionally in treating malaria on Papua Island. The most common medicinal plants used as traditional antimalarial concoction are Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br., Carica papaya L., Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees, and Physalis minima L. Similar to other ethnobotany research, the leaves were the most used plant parts in preparing the various traditional concoctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlstonia scholaris 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aCarica papaya 3aantimalarials 3adatabases 3aethnobotany 3amalaria 3atraditional medicine 3aIndonesia 0aAntimalarial 0aMedicinal plant 0aEthnomedicine 0aPapua 0aWest Papua 0aIndonesia 0aBioactive plant product 0aPharmaceutical science 0aNatural product 0aAlternative medicine 0aEvidence-based medicine1 aMaruzy, Anshary1 aMujahid, Rohmat1 aSari, Aniska Novita1 aJokopriyambodo, Wahyu1 aWidayat, Tri1 aWahyono, Slamet0 tHeliyon.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.e05562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e055623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011300178300001600291520146300307592002801770650001601798650001501814650001301829650001101842650001701853650002001870650002001890650001401910653001701924653002801941653001701969653002001986653002902006653002402035700002602059700003002085700001702115773013402132856008602266852000902352655001202361IND60552758420221120141539.0170105e20140120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055275842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamaras, Konstantinos10aEffect of adding glycerol and Tween 80 on gas holdup and bubble size distribution in an aerated stirred tank  ap. 815-824.  aThis work presents the results of an experimental parametric study of air-water dispersions in a laboratory scale stirred tank. The quantities monitored are total gas holdup and bubble size distribution. The physical parameters varied, in order to study their effect on the dispersion properties, are liquid viscosity as well as surface tension (static and dynamic) and surface viscoelasticity. Viscosity is varied by adding glycerol whereas surface properties are varied by adding Tween 80. In addition, the effect of the gas flowrate and the stirring rate are studied. Measurements of gas holdup are taken primarily by a non-invasive electrical technique which utilizes ring electrodes flush mounted to the wall. These measurements are verified against simultaneous differential pressure measurements and video images of the instantaneous height of the liquid free surface. Bubble size distributions are estimated analyzing still photographs. In the examined range of parameters, as the concentration of glycerol increases the gas holdup first increases and then decreases going through a peak at 41.6% v/v glycerol (viscosity: 5mPas). On the contrary, as the concentration of Tween 80 increases, the gas holdup increases monotonically up to a plateau value at and above 50mg/l of Tween 80 (static surface tension: 38.3mN/m). Further analysis of the results indicate no influence of coalescence/breakage phenomena in the observed bubble size distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3aelectrodes 3aglycerol 3amixing 3apolysorbates 3asurface tension 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aStirred tank 0aGas–liquid dispersion 0aConductivity 0aRing electrodes 0aBubble size distribution 0aSurfactant addition1 aKostoglou, Margaritis1 aKarapantsios, Thodoris D.1 aMavros, Paul0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Jan. 20, v. 441 p.815-824dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014500161300001400306520030000320592002800620650001400648650001300662650001100675650001600686650001600702650001900718651001000737653001500747653001600762653001400778653001800792653001600810653000800826700001800834700001800852700001800870773009400888856008100982852000901063655001201072IND60699233720221120033704.0210117e20130412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069923372DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.289.42662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Rui-E10aNotes on black elytron species of Pyrrhalta Joannis and the description of a new species from China (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Galerucinae)  ap. 41-56.  aThirteen species of Pyrrhalta Joannis, 1865 with black elytron are reviewed.

Evidence from Europe and Asia  aThe purpose of this research is to examine the effect of voluntary integrated reporting on information asymmetry in European and Asian firms and investigate size as a moderator variable to this relationship. Using a final sample of 94 firms in Europe and Asia that published integrated reports in 2016, the Ordinary Least Square is then performed to analyze the data on quarterly basis. The quarterly analysis is used to look at the relevance of accounting information decline as the time lag increases. The results show that there is an insignificant relationship between integrated reporting quality and information asymmetry which is captured by spread. In addition, the insignificant effect of size to moderate this relationship is also found. These results are supported by additional analysis. This research contributes to the existing debate about whether integrated reporting affects the market, particularly information asymmetry. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of integrated reporting quality on the market on a quarterly basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3amarkets 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aIntegrated reporting 0aVoluntary 0aInformation asymmetry 0aSocial sciences 0aEconomics 0aSustainable business 0aCorporate Governance 0aCorporate social responsibility1 aAgustia, Dian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4669-73440 tHeliyon.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.e05602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245008800163500001900251520236200270592002802632650002002660650002102680650001802701650001602719650002102735650001102756650002402767650001102791650001502802650001002817650001702827650002202844651001002866653002202876653001602898653001802914653003202932653001802964700001302982700001902995700005503014700001703069773010503086856008603191852000903277655001203286IND60719319620221120132636.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071931962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1258112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yue12aA δ2H offset correction method for quantifying root water uptake of riparian trees  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRoot water uptake plays an important role in water cycle in Groundwater-Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Continuum. Stable isotopes (δ²H and δ¹⁸O) are effective tools to quantify the use of different water sources by plant roots. However, the widespread δ²H offsets of stem water from its potential sources due to δ²H fractionation during root water uptake result in conflicting interpretations of water utilization using stable isotopes. In this study, a potential water source line (PWL), i.e., a linear regression line between δ¹⁸O and δ²H data of both soil water at different depths and groundwater, was proposed to correct δ²H offsets of stem water. The PWL-corrected δ²H was determined by subtracting the deviation between δ²H in stem water and PWL from the original value. The MixSIAR model coupled with seven types of input data (i.e. various combinations of single or dual isotopes with uncorrected or corrected δ²H data by PWL or soil water line (SWL)) were used to determine seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of riparian tree of Salix babylonica (L.) along the Jian and Chaobai River in Beijing, China. These methods were evaluated via three criteria including Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and root mean square error (RMSE). Results showed that different types of input data led to considerable differences in the contributions of soil water at upper 30 cm (9.9–57.6%) and below 80 cm depths (29.0–76.4%). Seasonal water uptake patterns were significantly different especially when δ²H offset was pronounced (p < 0.05). The dual-isotopes method with uncorrected δ²H underestimated the contributions of soil water in the 0–30 cm layer (by 30.4%) and groundwater (by 56.3%) compared to that with PWL-corrected δ²H. The PWL correction method obtained a higher groundwater contribution (mean of 29.5%) than that estimated by the SWL correction method (mean of 24.5%). The MixSIAR model using dual-isotopes with PWL-corrected δ²H produced the smallest AIC (94.1), BIC (91.9) and RMSE values (4.8%) than other methods (94.9–101.7, 92.6–99.5 and 5.3–12.4%, respectively), which underlined the best performance of PWL correction method. The present study provides crucial insights into quantifying accurate root water uptake sources even if δ²H offset exists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSalix babylonica 3afractionation 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asoil water 3atrees 3awater uptake 3awater utilization 3aChina 0aRoot water uptake 0aδ2H offset 0aMixSIAR model 0aPotential water source line 0aRiparian tree1 aMa, Ying1 aSong, Xianfang1 aWang, Lixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0968-12471 aHan, Dongmei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Feb., v. 593 p.125811-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1258113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011800171520115400289592002801443650001401471650001201485650002901497650001101526650001501537653001401552653002101566653001901587653003101606653001801637700001801655700002601673700002901699700002301728773011801751856008201869852000901951655001201960IND60734978120221121032715.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073497812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonwani, Ravi Kumar10aMoving bed biofilm reactor with immobilized low-density polyethylene–polypropylene​ for Congo red dye removal  aThe wastewater containing the azo dye is a global environmental challenge among researchers. In this study, an effort has been made to use a modified carrier (i.e., low-density polyethylene–polypropylene(LDPE-PP)) to remove the Congo red (CR) dye from synthetic wastewater in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). The effect of CR dye concentration (25 to 300 mg/L), hydraulic retention time (HRT) (12 to 96 h) under the batch mode, and inlet loading rate (ILR) (40 to 320 mg/L day) under the continuous mode were examined. The highest removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) of CR dye were obtained as 99.2% and 214.4 mg/L day, respectively. Three models, namely first-order, Grau second-order, and modified Stover–Kincannon (S–K) were applied to study the kinetic aspects. The highest correlation coefficient (R2) was obtained for the modified S–K model, and the saturation constant (KB) and maximum substrate removal rate (Umax) were estimated as 0.67 g/L day and 0.71 g/L day, respectively. The proposed kinetic equations can predict the effluent concentration and estimate the bioreactor volume to scale up the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCongo red 3abiofilm 3aenvironmental technology 3amodels 3awastewater 0aCongo red 0aModified carrier 0aKinetic models 0aMoving bed biofilm reactor 0aPhytotoxicity1 aSwain, Ganesh1 aJaiswal, Ravi Prakash1 aSiṃha, Rāmaśaraṇa,1 aRai, Birendra Nath0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520174200296592002802038650003102066650001802097650001402115650001702129650001402146650002002160650001102180650001902191650001702210650001702227650001602244650001702260650001602277650001102293650002502304650001802329650002702347650001602374650000902390650001402399650004402413650001602457650001602473653001702489653004602506653002302552653001102575653001602586653001802602700001702620700003202637700003002669700002902699700002802728700002102756700002002777700002202797700002902819700002902848700002602877700001902903773012002922856008503042852000903127655001203136IND60612201820221122061807.0191220e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061220182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusto, Rebeca10aEllagic acid protects from myelin-associated sphingolipid loss in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  ap. 958-967.  aExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most common model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration into the central nervous system and demyelination. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of some polyphenols may reduce the neurological alterations of EAE. In this work, we show that ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound, is beneficial in EAE, most likely through stimulation of ceramide biosynthesis within the brain. EAE was induced in Lewis rats by injection of guinea-pig spinal cord tissue along with Freund's complete adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Clinical signs first appeared at day 8 post-immunization and reached a peak within 3 days, coincident with reduction of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cortex. Sphingolipids, the other major components of myelin, also decreased at the acute phase of EAE, both in the cerebral cortex and in the spinal cord. In rats receiving ellagic acid in the drinking water from 2 days before immunization, the onset of the disease was delayed and clinical signs were reduced. This amelioration of clinical signs was accompanied by sustained levels of both MBP and sphingolipid in the cortex, without apparent changes in infiltration of inflammatory CD3+ T-cells, microglial activation, or weight loss, which together suggest a neuroprotective effect of ellagic acid. Finally, in glioma and oligodendroglioma cells we demonstrate that urolithins, the ellagic acid metabolites that circulate in plasma, stimulate the synthesis of ceramide. Together these data suggest that ellagic acid consumption protects against demyelination in rats with induced EAE, likely by a mechanism involving sphingolipid synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3abiosynthesis 3aceramides 3acerebral cortex 3acortex 3adrinking water 3aellagic acid 3aencephalitis 3aguinea pigs 3aimmunization 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amyelin basic protein 3amyelin sheath 3aneuroprotective effect 3apolyphenols 3arats 3asclerosis 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aspinal cord 3aweight loss 0aEllagic acid 0aExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aMyelin 0aPolyphenols 0aSphingolipids1 aSerna, Jorge1 aPerianes-Cachero, Aránzazu1 aQuintana-Portillo, Rocío1 aGarcía-Seisdedos, David1 aCanfrán-Duque, Alberto1 aPaino, Carlos L.1 aLerma, Milagros1 aCasado, María E.1 aMartín-Hidalgo, Antonia1 aArilla-Ferreiro, Eduardo1 aLasunción, Miguel A.1 aPastor, Óscar0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Sept., v. 1863, no. 9 p.958-967dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245016800214300002000382500001900402520199000421592002802411650001302439650002502452650001602477650002102493650002002514650001602534650001902550650002302569650001702592650003302609650002002642650002102662650001302683650002302696650001602719700005902735700006602794773013102860856008402991852000903075655001203084IND60705381820210421000000.0200804e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070538182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c013012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranchina, Flavio A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7236-426610aIn-Depth Cannabis Multiclass Metabolite Profiling Using Sorptive Extraction and Multidimensional Gas Chromatography with Low- and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry  ap. 10512-10520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present research reports on the development of a methodology to unravel the complex phytochemistry of cannabis. Specifically, cannabis inflorescences were considered and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) was used for the preconcentration of the metabolites. Analytes were thermally desorbed into a comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) gas chromatography (GC × GC) system coupled with low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). Particular attention was devoted to the optimization of the extraction conditions, to extend the analytes’ coverage, and the chromatographic separation, to obtain a robust data set for further untargeted analysis. Monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, hydrocarbons, cannabinoids, other terpenoids, and fatty acids were considered to optimize the extraction conditions. The response of selected ions for each chemical class, delimited in specific 2D chromatographic regions, enabled an accurate and fast evaluation of the extraction variables (i.e., time, temperature, solvent, salt addition), which were then selected to have a wide analyte selection and good reproducibility. Under optimized SBSE conditions, eight different cannabis inflorescences and a quality control sample were analyzed and processed following an untargeted and unsupervised approach. Principal component analysis on all detected metabolites revealed chemical differences among the sample types which could be associated with the plant subspecies. With the same SBSE–GC × GC–MS methodology, a quantitative targeted analysis was performed on three common cannabinoids, namely, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol. The method was validated, giving correlation factors over 0.98 and <20% reproducibility (relative standard deviation). The high-resolution MS acquisition allowed for high-confidence identification and post-targeted analysis, confirming the presence of two pesticides, a plasticizer, and a cannabidiol degradation product in some of the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis 3aanalytical chemistry 3acannabidiol 3achemical species 3adata collection 3ametabolites 3amonoterpenoids 3aplant biochemistry 3aplasticizers 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3asesquiterpenoids 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3atemperature1 aDubois, Lena M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0084-03201 aFocant, Jean-François1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8075-29200 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 June 30, v. 92, no. 15 p.10512-10520dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c013013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04157naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245005300183500001900236520211400255592002802369650002302397650001502420650001502435650001602450650001302466650002102479650002302500650000902523650001302532650001302545651001202558651003702570651001302607651001802620651001202638651001102650651001302661651001102674653002602685653002702711653001902738653004402757653001702801653002302818700006402841700007002905700002402975700001902999700002003018700003003038700003303068700002303101700002803124700002803152700002603180700007003206773013403276856008803410852000903498655001203507IND60706735820221118045656.0201202e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070673582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1413162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtchie, Ayotunde Titilayo10aBurn to kill: Wood ash a silent killer in Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAside the emissions, burning of wood in traditional cookstoves (TCs) also generates substantial amount of ash containing hazardous pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and toxic metals. But, their concentrations in the ash, particularly in Africa where over 70% of the population utilize TCs, remain unknown. Here, we determined concentrations of sixteen PAHs and eleven heavy metals in ashes from twelve different African TCs, comprising six three-stone fires (TSFs) and six built-in-place cookstoves (BIPCs), burning common African wood species under real world situation. For each TC, ash samples were collected for six consecutive days (Monday–Saturday), and a total of seventy-two daily samples were collected from January–June 2019. Ash yields were measured gravimetrically, and concentrations of the pollutants were determined following standard analytical protocols. The results were used alongside secondary data (annual fuelwood consumption, African fuelwood densities, population proportion using fuelwood and surface human population density) to estimate annual tonnage, exposure potential and risk to health in Africa, using Monte Carlo simulation technique. The ash yields from all TCs studied exceeded 1% on dry weight basis, indicating that ash is a major waste by-product of wood combustion in TCs. TSFs produced more ash (5.7 ± 0.7%) than BIPCs (3.4 ± 1.0%). Concentrations of As, Cd, Hg and Pb in ashes were significantly higher (α = 0.05) for TSFs than BIPCs. In contrast, concentrations of PAHs were higher in ashes from BIPCs than TSFs. Assuming ash consumption rates range from 250 to 500 mg/day for young children weighing 10 to 30 kg, the upper dose (μg/kg-day) of Pb (0.2–3.9) or Σ₁₆PAHs (0.02–0.34), for instance, surpasses the 0.3 μg/kg-day of Pb or PAH recognized as causing adverse effects in children, indicating a concern.

The PN-CDs with P/C atomic ratio of ca. 9.2/100 emit blue luminescence with high quantum yields of up to 23.5%. The PN-CDs were used as a novel sensing platform for live cell imaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including ClO⁻, ONOO⁻, and NO in macrophages. The nanosensor design is based on our new finding that the strong fluorescence of the PN-CDs can be sensitively and selectively quenched by ROS and RNS both in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal that the PN-CDs can serve as a sensitive sensor for rapid imaging of ROS and RNS signaling with high selectivity and contrast.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahot water treatment 3ahypochlorites 3aimage analysis 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3areactive oxygen species 0aCarbon dots 0aCell imaging 0aAdenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) 0aFluorescent probe 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) 0aReal-time measurement1 aYu, Bin1 aYang, Wen1 aZhang, Xiaoling0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 May 15, v. 79 p.822-828dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015100174500002200325520164500347592002801992650000902020650002102029650001602050650001802066650001102084650001102095650001702106650001202123650002402135650001602159650001602175651001102191653001002202653001802212653002602230653001802256653003202274653002302306700002002329700003002349773009102379856008602470852000902556655001202565IND60776055120221116194535.0220517e20220422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077605512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2022.1022682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibhatu, Kibrom T.14aThe effect of agricultural programs on dietary diversity and food security: Insights from the smallholder productivity promotion program in Zambia  aPre-press version  aHunger and malnutrition remain enormous challenges in low-income countries. Many of the malnourished live in smallholder farm households in sub-Saharan Africa. Agricultural intervention programs increasingly aspire to help alleviate hunger and malnutrition in smallholder farm households by improving on-farm productivity and market participation at the same time. However, the impact of those programs on diets and food security is not yet well understood. To examine whether such smallholder productivity and market participation promoting programs lead to better household dietary diversity and food security, we analyze the impact of IFAD’s Smallholder Productivity Promotion Programme (S3P) implemented in Zambia from 2013 to 2019 using Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment (IPWRA). We measure dietary diversity by Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and food security by the Months of Adequate Household Food Provisions (MAHFP). Descriptive results illustrate that beneficiary households scored higher in FCS, HDDS, and MAHFP than non-beneficiary households. Regression results demonstrate positive impacts of the program on all three indicators by 3% or more. We show that the S3P increased households’ farm productivity and income from agricultural sales, leading to the observed higher dietary diversity and food security in beneficiary households. The overall impact of the S3P on food and nutrition security is robust and promising. We highlight the importance of including nutrition education and women’s empowerment components in such interventions for improved impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3afood consumption 3afood policy 3afood security 3ahunger 3aincome 3amalnutrition 3amarkets 3anutrition education 3aprobability 3asmall farms 3aZambia 0aDiets 0aFood security 0aAgricultural policies 0aMarket access 0aSmallholder farm households 0aSub-Saharan Africa1 aArslan, Aslihan1 aZucchini, E.q(Emanuele),0 tFood policy.g2022 Apr. 22,  p.102268-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2022.1022683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245014900173300001600322500002000338520178500358592002802143650002702171650001102198650002202209650001602231650001102247650001102258650003702269700001802306773011802324852000902442856009102451655001202542IND2050324020221122085347.0210418e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205032402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02972.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPEARSON, J.

Walker & Sanders or Glomus sp. (WUM 10(1)) was grown in 3 kg of Lancelin sand surrounding a fine mesh bag (< 38 μm) filled with 400 g of steamed sand. The mesh size was chosen to allow hyphae to penetrate but to exclude plant roots. Every week, from 3 wk after planting the original plants, subterranean clover seeds were sown into the sand inside the mesh bags. The last sowing date was 8 wk from sowing of the original plants. The seedlings, with their roots growing inside the mesh bags, were allowed to grow for 3 wk. At that stage the seedlings and the original plants were harvested and their roots assessed for mycorrhizal colonization. The percentage of root length of the original plants colonized by S. calospora decreased from the first harvest onwards, while colonization by Glomus sp. maintained a similar level at all harvests. Seedlings growing in pots whose original plants were colonized by S. calospora had a her percentage of root length colonized at the first two harvests but levels of Colonization decreased substantially thereafter. Seedlings in the Glomus sp. treatment on the other hand, had similar levels of colonization at all but the last harvest. The length of hyphae g⁻¹ soil in the mesh hues increased throughout the experiment for both fungi. However, the length of hyphae in the S. calospora treatment increased at a faster rate. Spore production by S. calospora commenced 7 wk after sowing the original plants. These results indicate that the hyphae produced by S. colospora after internal colonization had stopped increasing were largely non‐infective, and that these hyphae are primarily involved in the production of spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3aGlomus 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asporulation 3ahyphae 3aspores 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aSCHWEIGER, P.0 tnew phytologist.g1994 Aug., v. 127, no. 4 p.697-701dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02972.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012100208300001800329520183600347592002802183650002502211650002402236650001302260650001402273650001302287650001202300650001702312650002202329650001402351651001802365651001402383653001802397653001402415653001102429653001602440700005702456700002302513700002102536700002102557773017202578856008302750852000902833655001202842IND60754619720221118063553.0211219e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075461972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2021.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegleitner, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1928-070610aWild juvenile salmonid abundance in Wisconsin tributaries indicates limited contributions to Lake Michigan fisheries  ap. 1824-1835.  aNatural reproduction of salmonids occurs in many Lake Michigan tributaries, yet little is known about abundance and the potential contribution of wild fish hatching in Wisconsin tributaries. The objectives of our study were to determine if: 1) abundance of wild juvenile salmonids (primarily adfluvial rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, referred to as steelhead) varied among selected Wisconsin streams based on available spawning and age-0 habitat; 2) stream temperature regimes could limit survival of juvenile salmonids, and 3) wild juvenile salmonids outmigrate from Wisconsin tributaries into Lake Michigan or larger tributaries. In 2016 and 2017, juvenile salmonid abundance was estimated in six Wisconsin tributaries to Lake Michigan by multiple-pass depletion sampling using backpack electrofishing. Habitat assessments included steelhead redd surveys, age-0 habitat surveys, and stream temperatures were monitored using in-stream loggers. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagging and PIT antennas were used to detect outmigration from three streams (Willow, Stony and Hibbard creeks). Population estimates for individual streams ranged from 75 to 2276 for juvenile steelhead and from 0 to 243 for juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. No correlation was detected between juvenile steelhead abundance and quality age-0 habitat. Stream temperatures rarely exceeded the thermal limit for steelhead (27 °C). Outmigration rates for three streams ranged from 0.6% to 3.1%, but these estimates were considered minimum values. Low abundance of wild juvenile steelhead and coho salmon alone suggest that the contributions of these tributaries to Lake Michigan fisheries are likely small. Furthermore, relying on returns of wild steelhead produced in these streams is probably insufficient to maintain stream fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3aresearch 3astreams 3atransponders 3awater temperature 3awild fish 3aLake Michigan 3aWisconsin 0aRainbow trout 0aSteelhead 0aSalmon 0aGreat Lakes1 aRaabe, Joshua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0968-34051 aDembkowski, Daniel1 aLegler, Nicholas1 aIsermann, Daniel0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2021 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.1824-1835dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes ResearchwJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2021.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010400159300001800263520155800281592002801839650001201867650002401879650001701903650001901920650002601939650001601965650001801981650001901999650001402018650002402032650001302056650001702069653002602086653002502112653003202137653002602169653002702195700001702222700001802239700001602257700001802273700001302291700001302304700001202317700006402329700005102393773013902444856007902583852000902662655001202671IND60595281420221120053914.0180622e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059528142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b178382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sisi10aMultifunctional Bi@PPy-PEG Core–Shell Nanohybrids for Dual-Modal Imaging and Photothermal Therapy  ap. 1605-1615.  aHigh-performance theranostic nanoagents, which integrate multimodal imaging and photothermal therapy for clinical anticancer treatment, are highly desired. Herein, we report the synthesis and bioapplication of a multifunctional theranostic nanoagent based on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified polypyrrole (PPy)-coated bismuth (Bi) nanohybrids (referred to as Bi@PPy-PEG NHs) for X-ray computed tomography/photoacoustic (CT/PA) dual-modal imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT). The obtained Bi@PPy-PEG NHs have a distinct core–shell structure with the metallic Bi nanoparticle as the inner core and the PPy-PEG layer as the shell. The Bi@PPy-PEG NHs show excellent physiological stability and compatibility, without noticeable cytotoxicity. Importantly, the NHs exhibit strong NIR absorbance and remarkable photothermal conversion capability and conversion stability, with the photothermal conversion efficiency as high as ∼46.3%. Thanks to the strong PTT effect, highly effective photothermal ablation on cancer cells has been achieved both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a high-contrast in vitro and in vivo CT/PA dual-modal imaging has been realized, showing great potential to provide comprehensive diagnosis information for antitumor treatment. In particular, the CT enhancement efficiency of the NHs is of ∼14.4 HU mM–¹, which is ∼3.7-fold that of clinically used iohexol. Therefore, our work highlights the potential of using such core–shell Bi@PPy-PEG NHs as a versatile theranostic nanoplatform for cancer imaging and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3acomputed tomography 3acytotoxicity 3aimage analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananohybrids 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene glycol 3apyrroles 3atherapeutics 0abismuth nanoparticles 0aphotothermal therapy 0acomputed tomography imaging 0aphotoacoustic imaging 0acore−shell structure1 aLi, Zhenglin1 aWang, Yuanlin1 aFan, Xuelei1 aMiao, Zhaohua1 aHu, Ying1 aLi, Zhuo1 aSun, Ye1 aBesenbacher, Flemming1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0028-13351 aYu, Miao1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8820-95940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 17, v. 10, no. 2 p.1605-1615dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b178383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245010800202300001200310506007600322520108100398592002801479506003701507650001201544650001401556650001401570650002201584650002001606650001901626650002501645650001801670650001201688650001501700650001101715650001601726650002501742700001601767700001201783700001501795773010901810856008201919852000902001655001202010IND60591005420221207115545.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059100542DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1186-22doi7 aPMC58421612pmcid7 a295274532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Ruoyu10aEnhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of corncob by ultrasound-assisted soaking in aqueous ammonia pretreatment  ap. 166.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUltrasound-assisted soaking in aqueous ammonia (USAA) pretreatment with 15 wt% aqueous ammonia under low temperature (~ 60 °C) and short-time (< 12 min) low-frequency (20 kHz, 60–650 W) ultrasound has been investigated for enhancement of enzymatic hydrolysis of corncob. Operational parameters of energy density (2.93–17.07 W/mL) and sonication time (0.34–11.66 min) that affect cellulose recovery, delignification, and sugar recovery yield were studied and optimized. The maximum cellulose recovery, delignification and sugar recovery yield determined at the optimum conditions (energy density 10 W/mL, sonication time 11.66 min) were 83.8, 84.7, and 77.6%, respectively. The corncob pretreated using USAA has a lower hemicellulose content (28.9% vs 31.8%), a slightly lower crystallinity index value (42.7% vs 43.7%), and a larger surface cavity diameter (> 36 μm vs < 20 μm) than that pretreated using soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) pretreatment.

A total of 458 maize samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 40 metabolites were detected, where 94% of the samples contained at least 5 metabolites. Fumonisins (including B₁, B₂, B₃ and B₄), moniliformin and bikaverin were the most frequent (80–98%) Fusarium metabolites in both years. Furthermore, in samples from 2016, fumonisin A₁ and A₂, deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, zearalenone, culmorin, 15-hydroxyculmorin, fusapyron, fusaproliferin and aurofusarin were detected with frequencies of 58–80%. Levels of certain Fusarium metabolites in 2016 were higher on average due to increased humidity when compared to 2017, which was characterised by warm and dry conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3adeoxynivalenol-3-glucoside 3afumonisins 3ahumidity 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3azearalenone 3aSerbia 0aFusarium metabolites 0aLC-MS/MS 0amaize 0aagricultural regions 0aNorthern Serbia 0aweather conditions 0aemerging mycotoxins1 aKos, Jovana1 aJanić Hajnal, Elizabet1 aMalachová, Alexandra1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),1 aSulyok, Michael0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2021 Oct. 02, v. 14, no. 4 p.295-305dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4181658x1939-32297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19393210.2021.19618773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012000164300001400284520060600298592002800904650003400932650002400966650001400990650001901004650002401023650001401047650001501061653001901076653002201095653001401117653001501131653000901146700001501155700002101170700001601191700001701207700002001224773010601244856008001350852000901430655001201439IND60602153320221121214157.0180709e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060215332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2015.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Ching-Yu10aCell-based semiquantitative assay for sulfated glycosaminoglycans facilitating the identification of chondrogenesis  ap. 41-43.  aGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs), in particular chondroitin sulfate, are an accepted marker of chondrogenic cells.

However, the key components in plant extracts and their bioreduction functions concerning GO are still not well understood. In this study, the GO was reduced by Eucalyptus leaf (EL) extract. The optimal conditions for bioreduction were at volume ratio of leaf extract (10 g L−1) and GO (0.5 g L−1) solution of 1:4 for 8 h at 80 °C. The RGO was characterized with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Results confirmed the oxygen-containing groups in GO were efficiently removed, formation of capping layer on the surface of RGO, and good dispersion of RGO in aqueous solution. Furthermore, biomolecules were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), where eucalyptols, aldehydes, terpineols, alcohols, amides and ethers of Eucalyptus leaf extract may act as reducing and capping agents for the formation of RGO. Finally, the methyl blue (MB) adsorption on EL-RGO, activated carbon, graphite powder and commercial graphene were investigated separately. The order of the maximum adsorption capacity of different adsorbents emerged as: EL-RGO > commercial graphene > activated carbon > graphite powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aamides 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochemical compounds 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethers 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectrometers 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aGreen synthesis 0aEucalyptus 0aIdentification1 aLi, Na1 aWeng, Xiulan1 aLi, Chengyang1 aChen, Zuliang0 tChemosphere.g2018 Oct., v. 208 p.417-424dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.05.1993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011000156300001800266520219300284592002802477650001502505650001202520650002902532650001102561650001902572650001902591650002402610650002402634650001502658650002002673650001902693650002102712650001402733650001502747650001102762650002802773650002202801650001802823650001402841650001502855650001902870700003102889700001802920700001602938773010102954856007303055852000903128655001203137IND60435923120221118183525.0151020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043592312DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.130242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomas, Fiona10aResponses of seagrass to anthropogenic and natural disturbances do not equally translate to its consumers  ap. 4021-4030.  aCoastal communities are under threat from many and often co‐occurring local (e.g., pollution, eutrophication) and global stressors (e.g., climate change), yet understanding the interactive and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors in ecosystem function is far from being accomplished. Ecological redundancy may be key for ecosystem resilience, but there are still many gaps in our understanding of interspecific differences within a functional group, particularly regarding response diversity, that is, whether members of a functional group respond equally or differently to anthropogenic stressors. Herbivores are critical in determining plant community structure and the transfer of energy up the food web. Human disturbances may alter the ecological role of herbivory by modifying the defense strategies of plants and thus the feeding patterns and performance of herbivores. We conducted a suite of experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of anthropogenic (nutrient and CO₂ additions) and natural (simulated herbivory) disturbances on a seagrass and its interaction with two common generalist consumers to understand how multiple disturbances can impact both a foundation species and a key ecological function (herbivory) and to assess the potential existence of response diversity to anthropogenic and natural changes in these systems. While all three disturbances modified seagrass defense traits, there were contrasting responses of herbivores to such plant changes. Both CO₂ and nutrient additions influenced herbivore feeding behavior, yet while sea urchins preferred nutrient‐enriched seagrass tissue (regardless of other experimental treatments), isopods were deterred by these same plant tissues. In contrast, carbon enrichment deterred sea urchins and attracted isopods, while simulated herbivory only influenced isopod feeding choice. These contrasting responses of herbivores to disturbance‐induced changes in seagrass help to better understand the ecological functioning of seagrass ecosystems in the face of human disturbances and may have important implications regarding the resilience and conservation of these threatened ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aIsopoda 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenergy transfer 3aeutrophication 3afeeding behavior 3afood webs 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant communities 3aplant tissues 3apollution 3aseagrasses 3ataxonomic keys1 aMartínez‐Crego, Begoña1 aHernán, Gema1 aSantos, Rui0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.4021-4030dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.130243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245015000173300001600323500002000339520191400359592002802273650001502301650001602316650001002332650002202342650002102364650001402385650002502399650002102424650002302445650001802468700001902486773011802505852000902623856009102632655001202723IND2050324220221122085340.0210418e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205032422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02974.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMASUHARA, GAKU10aIn situ and in vitro specificity between Rhizoctonia spp. and Spiranthes sinensis (Persoon) Ames, var. amoena (M.

Bieberstein) Hara and Rhizoctonia spp. were investigated in situ at germination and in adult plants, Seeds of the orchid placed in cotton gauze were buried at 210 sampling points in turf grassland, the orchid habitat (in situ germination). Eight weeks later, protocorm development of the orchid was confirmed at 67 of the 210 sampling points. Isolation of fungi from protocorms showed that in situ germination was induced mainly by Rhizoctonia rapens Bernard. Similarly, R. repens was the dominant mycorrhizal fungus isolated from roots of adult plants. The number of adult plants within a radius of either 30 or 50 cm of burial points did not influence seed germination. The distribution of Rhizoctonia spp. other than R. repens in the sample site was examined with a baiting method using buckwheat stems. Thirty‐two isolates consisting of binucleate Rhizoctonia anastomosis group (AG)‐A, AG‐B, AG‐G, and AG‐1, R. solani Kuhn AG‐4, Waitea circinata Warcup & Talbot, which anastomozed with WAG‐O and WAG‐Z, and a multinucteate Rhizoctonia sp. were isolated. Three AG‐G isolates were obtained from the points at which protocorm development was induced by R. repens. Seeds of S. sinensis var. amoena were inoculated in vitro with these isolates to test for symbiotic germination. Most Rhizoctonia spp, not associated with the germination in situ induced seed germination in vitro. Seedlings which developed with these isolates in vitro were transferred to ex vitro conditions. New leaves developed and elongated as seedlings continued to grow for 3 months, The seed burial method enabled the clarification of the differences in orchid‐fungal specificity in situ and in vitro. We concluded that the specificity between S. sinensis var. amoena and fungi in situ conditions was different to that in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpiranthes 3aRhizoctonia 3aroots 3amycorrhizal fungi 3ahost specificity 3asymbiosis 3adevelopmental stages 3aseed germination 3astrain differences 3apathogenicity1 aKATSUYA, KEIZO0 tnew phytologist.g1994 Aug., v. 127, no. 4 p.711-718dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02974.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01509naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245008400179300001400263520047500277592002800752650001400780650001000794650001200804650001600816650001000832650001200842651001400854653001600868653001400884653001700898653001400915700002200929773010300951856008401054852000901138655001201147IND60123257320221118193105.0150325e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012325732DNAL7 a10.1080/21658005.2012.6798262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVyšniauskaitė, Sigrida10aNew data of owl-moths (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) in Raseiniai district, Lithuania  ap. 64-71.  aThe owl-moths (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) were studied in Gabšiai environs, Raseiniai district, Lithuania, in 2009.

We recently showed the neuroprotective and cerebrovascular protective effects of US on cerebral ischemia; however, its effects on the blood–brain barrier (BBB) are poorly understood. In this study, the effects of partially purified components of US (PPUS) on BBB disruption were investigated in mice subjected to ischemic brain injury. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in C57BL/6J mice by photothrombotic cortical ischemia. PPUS was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemic insults. Infarct volume, neurological score, wire-grip test, Evans blue leakage and brain water content were then examined 24 h after ischemic brain injury. RESULTS: Infarct volume was significantly reduced and neurological deficit and motor deficit were greatly improved in PPUS-pretreated mice relative to those treated with vehicle following photothrombotic cortical ischemia. Brain edema-induced change of Evans blue extravasation and water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere were alleviated by treatment with PPUS. In addition, PPUS significantly reduced ischemic brain injury-induced degradation of tight junction proteins and elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). CONCLUSIONS: PPUS prevents cerebral ischemic damage by BBB protection, and these effects were associated with inhibition of tight junction degradation and MMP-9 induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aUncaria sinensis 3aalternative medicine 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acardiovascular diseases 3agelatinase B 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3atight junctions 3awater content1 aKang, Bo Kyung1 aKim, Ji-Hyun,1 aChoi, Young Whan1 aHong, Jin Woo1 aChoi, Byung Tae1 aShin, Hwa Kyoung0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.157-157dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-015-0678-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245016800170300001600338500002000354520107000374592002801444650001301472650001401485650002501499650001601524650001201540650001401552650001201566650002501578650001101603650002001614650002001634650001501654700006701669700002201736700002001758773013101778856007301909852000901982655001201991IND60611365920221120102001.0180831e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061136592DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.123342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazzaghi, Mohammad Hossein10aInvestigation of the effect of coagulation bath composition on PVDF/CA membrane by evaluating critical flux and antifouling properties in lab‐scale submerged MBR  ap. 366-376.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUltrafiltration membranes were prepared from blends of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/cellulose acetate (CA) via phase inversion method. The effect of different coagulation bath compositions on the morphology and performance of the blend membrane prepared from casting solution of PVDF/CA with ratio of 80/20 was investigated using sewage wastewater. NaCl and ethanol were used as additives of coagulation bath. Fouling analysis was conducted with Bovine Serum Albumin solution and critical flux evaluation was performed using a lab‐scale membrane bioreactor. In terms of morphological structure, the macrovoids decreased and changed to finger‐like structure. The irreversible fouling reduced and the flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the modified membranes increased remarkably while the reversible fouling caused by deposition of foulants on the surface of the membranes increased. The maximum values of FRR and critical flux of irreversibility were reached by the membrane which was prepared in the coagulation bath containing the highest concentration of NaCl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadditives 3abovine serum albumin 3acoagulation 3aethanol 3afluorides 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3asewage 3asodium chloride 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater1 aTavakolmoghadam, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2312-56371 aRekabdar, Fatemeh1 aOveisi, Fatemeh0 tWater and environment journal.g2018 Aug., v. 32, no. 3 p.366-376dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.123343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012100163300001400284520096800298592002801266650002201294650001701316650001501333650000901348650002601357650001401383650001201397650001901409650001101428650001101439650002401450650002201474650002101496650003701517653001401554653001701568653001801585653002501603653002201628653001901650700002001669700001601689700001501705700001801720773010101738856008101839852000901920655001201929IND60599573120221117201233.0180702e20140120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059957312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yude10aInfluence of kaolinite/carbon black hybridization on combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of NR composites  ap. 39-46.  aA series of NR composites filled with modified kaolinite (MK), carbon black (CB) and the hybrid filler contained MK and CB, were prepared by melt blending. The microstructure, combustion and thermal decomposition behaviors of NR composites were characterized by TEM, XRD, infrared spectroscopy, cone calorimeter test (CCT) and thermal-gravimetric analysis (TG). The results show that the filler hybridization can improve the dispensability and shape of the kaolinite sheets in the rubber matrix and change the interface bond between kaolinite particles and rubber molecules. NR-3 filled by 10phr MK and 40phr CB has the lowest heat release rate (HRR), mass loss rate (MLR), total heat release (THR), smoke production rate (SPR) and the highest char residue among all the NR composites. Therefore, the hybridization of the carbon black particles with the kaolinite particles can effectively improve the thermal stability and combustion properties of NR composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3aheat 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3akaolinite 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3arubber 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aKaolinite 0aCarbon black 0aHybridization 0aCombustion behaviors 0aThermal stability 0aNatural rubber1 aXiang, Jingjing1 aZhang, Qian1 aLiu, Qinfu1 aFrost, Ray L.0 tThermochimica acta.g2014 Jan. 20, v. 576 p.39-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001600287520206400303592002802367650002602395650002002421650001102441650001402452650001202466650001702478650001602495650002402511650001402535650002302549650001002572650001102582650002102593650001002614651001502624653001602639653001502655653001402670653002402684653001602708653001902724653001902743653002402762653002502786653001602811700001802827700001802845773008202863856008102945852000903026655001203035IND60637684420221117230254.0190422s1995    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063768442DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900014072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, E.A.10aSimilarities and Differences in Dicotyledonous Woods of the Cretaceous and Paleocene. San Juan Basin, New Mexico, Usa  ap. 223-254.  aFossil wood is common in the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleocene of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. Six types of dicotyledonous wood are recognized: Paraphyllanthoxylon arizonense Bailey, Paraphyllanthoxylon anasazi sp. nov., Plataninium piercei sp. nov., Metcalfeoxylon kirtlandense gen. et sp. nov., Chalkoxylon cretaceum gen. et sp. nov., Carlquistoxylon nacimientense gen. et sp. nov. Woods with the characteristics of Paraphyllanthoxylon arizonense Bailey are the most common and occur in the Cretaceous Kirtland Shale and the Paleocene Ojo Alamo Sandstone and Nacimiento Formation. This wood type's characteristics are stable from the Cretaceous to the Paleocene. There were no significant differences in the vessel diameters, vessel densities, ray sizes, or estimated specific gravities of the P. arizonense woods from the Late Cretaceous (Kirtland Shale) and Early Paleocene (Nacimiento Formation and Ojo Alamo Sandstone). Based on the samples examined for this study, dicotyledonous woods were more diverse in the Cretaceous (five types) than in the Paleocene (two types) of the San Juan Basin. Diameters of the Cretaceous woods examined ranged from 14-40cm indicating they were trees rather than shrubs; diameters of the Paleocene woods examined ranged from 10-80cm. All the woods have generalized structure with combinations of features seen in more than one extant family, order, or subclass. Information from databases for fossil and extant woods indicates that some combinations of features (e. g., solitary narrow vessels, low vessel density and scalariform perforation plates, as seen in Metcalfeoxylon kirtlandense and Chalkoxylon cretaceum), while relatively common in the Cretaceous, represent strategies of the hydraulic system that are extremely rare in the Tertiary and at present. None of the dicotyledonous woods have distinct growth rings, although some samples of Paraphyllanthoxylon arizonense from the Paleocene show variations in vessel density and vessel diameter that may correspond to seasonal variations in water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3abasins 3adatabases 3afossils 3agrowth rings 3anew species 3aold and fossil wood 3asandstone 3aseasonal variation 3ashale 3ashrubs 3aspecific gravity 3atrees 3aNew Mexico 0aFossil wood 0aCretaceous 0aPaleocene 0aParaphyllanthoxylon 0aPlataninium 0aSan Juan Basin 0aKirtland Shale 0aOjo Alamo Sandstone 0aNacimiento Formation 0apaleobotany1 aMcClammer, J.1 aLaPasha, C.A.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 16, no. 3 p.223-254dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900014073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009900166300001600265520086000281592002801141650002701169650002901196650001301225650002901238650001701267650001201284650000901296650002501305650002801330650000701358650001201365650001601377650001501393700001401408700001701422700001501439700001801454700001801472700001901490700001501509700001401524773011701538856008601655852000901741655001201750IND50070674220221119200857.0190408e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007067422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gang10aPartial characterisation of an anti-listeria substance produced by Pediococcus acidilactici P9  ap. 275-279.  aTo improve the microbiological security of food products, 285 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from koumiss and pickles, and their antimicrobial properties were characterised.

The substance was heat (121 °C for 20 min) and pH (2.0–10.0) stable, but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. The production of bacteriocins started at the exponential phase and reached its maximum at the stationary phase, indicating that it was growth related.

Thirty isolates with high detectable phytase activity were chosen for media optimization study and species identification. Ten types of bacterial phytase producers have been discovered in this study, which provides opportunity for characterization of new phytase(s) and various commercial and environmental applications. The majority of the bacterial isolates with high detectable phytase activity were of endophyte origin and 1.6% of the total isolates showed phytase activity of more than 1 U/ml. Most of the strains produced extra-cellular phytase and Staphylococcus lentus ASUIA 279 showed the highest phytase activity of 1.913 U/ml. All 30 species used in media optimization study exhibit favorable enzyme production when 1% rice bran was included in the growth media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus lentus 3abacteria 3acorn 3aculture media 3aendophytes 3aphytases 3arhizosphere 3arice bran 3asoil 3aspecies identification1 aFarouk, Abd-ElAziem1 aGreiner, Ralf1 aSalleh, Hamzah Mohd1 aIsmail, Ahmad Faris0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2007 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.1653-1660dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9412-93Available from publisher's site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03902naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014700171300001600318520155400334592002801888650001501916650003401931650001701965650001901982650001402001650002202015650002002037650002202057650001802079650002102097650001102118650005002129650002502179650001502204650002302219650002702242650001702269653002902286653002502315653002102340700001602361700001902377700001702396700001802413700001702431700001802448700001702466700001702483700002002500700002502520700001602545700002202561700002502583700001502608700002002623700002202643700002202665700001702687700002002704700001802724700001302742700002202755700002502777700001602802700002202818700002102840700002102861773014202882856008703024852000903111655001203120IND60535386920221119124329.0190318e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053538692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Wenping10aGlobal comparison of light use efficiency models for simulating terrestrial vegetation gross primary production based on the LaThuile database  ap. 108-120.  aSimulating gross primary productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems has been a major challenge in quantifying the global carbon cycle. Many different light use efficiency (LUE) models have been developed recently, but our understanding of the relative merits of different models remains limited. Using CO2 flux measurements from multiple eddy covariance sites, we here compared and assessed major algorithms and performance of seven LUE models (CASA, CFix, CFlux, EC-LUE, MODIS, VPM and VPRM). Comparison between simulated GPP and estimated GPP from flux measurements showed that model performance differed substantially among ecosystem types. In general, most models performed better in capturing the temporal changes and magnitude of GPP in deciduous broadleaf forests and mixed forests than in evergreen broadleaf forests and shrublands. Six of the seven LUE models significantly underestimated GPP during cloudy days because the impacts of diffuse radiation on light use efficiency were ignored in the models. CFlux and EC-LUE exhibited the lowest root mean square error among all models at 80% and 75% of the sites, respectively. Moreover, these two models showed better performance than others in simulating interannual variability of GPP. Two pairwise comparisons revealed that the seven models differed substantially in algorithms describing the environmental regulations, particularly water stress, on GPP. This analysis highlights the need to improve representation of the impacts of diffuse radiation and water stress in the LUE models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abroadleaved evergreen forests 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3adatabases 3adeciduous forests 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental law 3amixed forests 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aprimary productivity 3ashrublands 3atemporal variation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater stress 0aGross primary production 0aLight use efficiency 0aSeven LUE models1 aCai, Wenwen1 aXia, Jiangzhou1 aChen, Jiquan1 aLiu, Shuguang1 aDong, Wenjie1 aMerbold, Lutz1 aLaw, Beverly1 aArain, Altaf1 aBeringer, Jason1 aBernhofer, Christian1 aBlack, Andy1 aBlanken, Peter D.1 aCescatti, Alessandro1 aChen, Yang1 aFrancois, Louis1 aGianelle, Damiano1 aJanssens, Ivan A.1 aJung, Martin1 aKato, Tomomichi1 aKiely, Gerard1 aLiu, Dan1 aMarcolla, Barbara1 aMontagnani, Leonardo1 aRaschi, A.,1 aRoupsard, Olivier1 aVarlagin, Andrej1 aWohlfahrt, Georg0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2014 July 15, v. 192-193 p.108-120dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
