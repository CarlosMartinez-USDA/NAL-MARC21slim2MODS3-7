We analysed the complement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) in several species of unicellular parasites that belong to Apicomplexa (Plasmodium; Cryptosporidium, Babesia, Theileria, and Toxoplasma), kinetoplastids (Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp.), as well as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis and a microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The analysis shows distinct distribution of the known families of tyrosine phosphatases in different species. Protozoan tyrosine phosphatases show considerable levels of divergence compared with their mammalian homologues, both in terms of sequence similarity between the catalytic domains and the structure of their flanking domains. This potentially makes them suitable targets for development of specific inhibitors with minimal effects on physiology of mammalian hosts. 3ainterspecific variation 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aphylogeny 3asignal transduction 3aProtozoa 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotozoal infections 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asequence homology 2aAnimals 2aApicomplexaxenzymology 2aEukaryotaxenzymology 2aKinetoplastidaxenzymology 2aMicrosporidia, Unclassifiedximmunology 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Tyrosine Phosphatasesxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Protozoanxmetabolism 0aspecies differences 0aliterature reviews1 aKutuzov, Mikhail A.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2008 Sept., v. 38, no. 11 p.1279-1295dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090406b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01357naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245010800150300001600258520022900274650001400503650002000517650001800537650001700555650002700572650002500599650004100624650001100665650002200676650002100698650003400719650004400753653002400797773008700821852000900908939003300917945000800950946001300958655001200971991618215110742620221121194924.0840308e198103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840014562DNAL7 a71847872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordgren, I.10aQuantitation of metrifonate and dichlorvos in blood and tissues by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 230-237.  ablood of humans infected with schistosomiasis treated with Bilarcil (metrifonate; dichlorvos), quantitation in blood and tissues using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, pharmacological properties, clearance, side effects 3aTrematoda 3aschistosomiasis 3adrug toxicity 3apharmacology 2aCholinesterasesxblood 2aDichlorvosxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aKidneyxanalysis. 2aLiverxanalysis. 2aSchistosomiasisxdrug therapy 2aTrichlorfonxadverse effectsxanalysis. 0aTreatment / Control0 tFundamental and applied toxicology.g1981 , v. 1, no. 2 p.230-237x0272-05907nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840308c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02809naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245008900159300001400248520166700262650001201929650001301941650002201954653002201976653002301998653001602021700001802037700001702055700001402072700001502086700001502101700001702116700001602133700001902149773007002168852000902238856008502247930003302332946001102365990002302376655001202399IND4384523620221121171628.0061018e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438452362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-005-7565-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorin, S.10aMicrobial Succession in a Compost-packed Biofilter Treating Benzene-contaminated Air  ap. 79-89.  aAir artificially contaminated with increasing concentrations of benzene was treated in a laboratory scale compost-packed biofilter for 240 days with a removal efficiency of 81-100%. The bacterial community in the packing material (PM) at different heights of the biofilter was analysed every 60 days. Bacterial plate counts and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) of the isolated strains showed that the number of cultivable aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and the species diversity increased with benzene availability. Identification of the isolated species and the main bands in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles from total compost DNA during the treatment revealed that, at a relatively low volumetric benzene load (1.2<=VBL<=6.4 g m-³ PM h-¹), besides low G+C Gram positive bacteria, originally present in the packing compost, bacteroidetes and β- and γ-proteobacteria became detectable in the colonising population. At the VBL value (24.8 g m-³ PM h-¹) ensuring the maximum elimination capacity of the biofilter (20.1 g m-³ PM h-¹), strains affiliated to the genus Rhodococcus dominated the microflora, followed by β-proteobacteria comprising the genera Bordetella and Neisseria. Under these conditions, more than 35% of the isolated strains were able to grow on benzene as the sole carbon source. Comparison of DGGE and automated RISA profiles of the total community and isolated strains showed that a complex bacterial succession occurred in the reactor in response to the increasing concentrations of the pollutant and that cultivable bacteria played a major role in benzene degradation under the adopted conditions. 3abenzene 3acomposts 3amicrobial ecology 0aair biofiltration 0aDNA-fingerprinting 0aRhodococcus1 aMarzorati, M.1 aBrusetti, L.1 aZilli, M.1 aCherif, H.1 aHassen, A.1 aConverti, A.1 aSorlini, C.1 aDaffonchio, D.0 tBiodegradation.g2006 Mar., v. 17, no. 2 p.79-89x0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-005-7565-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01722naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245007100149300001600220520028200236650002200518650001500540650001000555650003800565650005200603650003400655650003800689650005300727650001100780650001100791650000900802650001400811650001600825650003600841650001300877650001400890650005400904653002400958653002100982700001901003700001901022700001601041700002101057773007501078852000901153939003301162945000801195946001301203655001201216991618214590742620221121171537.0840307e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840014012DNAL7 a63078052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuelrud, M.10aSphincter of Oddi pressure in Chagasic patients with megaesophagus  ap. 584-588.  aChagasic patients with megaesophagus, determinations of sphincter of Oddi pressure, evaluation of effect of cholecystokinin-octapeptide on sphincter pressure, findings when compared with normal humans suggests that Chagasic patients may have sphincter of Oddi motor abnormality 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAmpulla of Vaterxphysiopathology 2aChagas Diseasexcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aCholecystokininxpharmacology 2aCommon Bile Ductxphysiopathology 2aEsophageal Achalasiaxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aManometry 2aMiddle Aged 2aPeptide Fragmentsxpharmacology 2aPressure 2aSincalide 2aSphincter of Oddixdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 0aPathology, Protozoa 0aPhysiology, Host1 aBettarello, A.1 aCecconello, I.1 aPinotti, W.1 aMantelmacher, H.0 tGastroenterology.g1983 Sept., v. 85, no. 3 p.584-588x0016-50857nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840307c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02325naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245009000154300001600244500002400260520128400284650001201568650001001580650001701590650001201607650001701619650002001636650001501656650001501671650001501686650000901701650001301710650002201723700002001745700001801765773010901783852000901892856003801901655001201939IND4459280120221121171558.0110625s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445928012DNAL7 a10.1071/WF081422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, T.G.10aDeterminants of spatial variation in fire return period in a semiarid African savanna  ap. 540-549.  aIncludes references  aFire pattern is predicted to vary across an African savanna in accordance with spatial variation in rainfall through its effects on fuel production, vegetation type (on account of differences in fuel load and in flammability), and distribution of herbivores (because of their effects on fuel load). These predictions were examined for the 23651-ha Mkuzi Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, based on a 37-year data set. Fire return period varied from no occurrence to a fire every 1.76 years. Approximately 75% of the reserve experienced a fire approximately every 5 years, 25% every 4.1-2.2 years and less than 1% every 2 years on average. Fire return period decreased in relation to an increase in mean annual rainfall. For terrestrial vegetation types, median fire return periods decreased with increasing herbaceous biomass, from forest that did not burn to grasslands that burnt every 2.64 years. Fire was absent from some permanent wetlands but seasonal wetlands burnt every 5.29 years. Grazer biomass above 0.5 animal units ha-1 had a limiting influence on the maximum fire frequency of fire-prone vegetation types. The primary determinant of long-term spatial fire patterns is thus fuel load as determined by mean rainfall, vegetation type, and the effects of grazing herbivores. 3abiomass 3afires 3aflammability 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuel production 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3aprediction 3arain 3asavannas 3aseasonal wetlands1 aMulqueeny, C.M.1 aGoodman, P.S.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2011, v. 20, no. 4 p.540-549dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF08142 7aarticle01942naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001100127245008000138300001600218500001500234520074100249650002300990650002001013650002501033650001001058650001801068650002301086650002301109650001401132651001301146653002701159653002601186700001401212773012101226852000901347856008201356930003301438945002501471946001301496990002301509655001201532IND4388882420221121171637.0070312e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438888242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWu, S.10aCost efficiency and scope economics of crop and livestock farms in Missouri  ap. 539-553.  a2019-12-05  aThis study investigates productive efficiency for a sample of Missouri crop-only (specialized) and integrated crop-livestock (diversified) farms using a cost frontier approach. Results suggest that significant cost inefficiency exists among sample farms. Lower cost efficiency in both types of farms was attributed to improper scale of operations and misallocation of inputs. On average, diversified farms were as technically and scale efficient as specialized farms. Lower allocative efficiency diluted gains in technical efficiency and resulted in greater cost inefficiency for diversified farms than for specialized farms. Technical efficiency was independent of farm size, whereas allocative, scale, and scope efficiencies were not. 3acost effectiveness 3acrop production 3alivestock production 3afarms 3acost analysis 3aeconometric models 3afarm profitability 3afarm size 3aMissouri 0aagricultural economics 0aefficiencies of scale1 aPrato, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and applied economics.g2006 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.539-553wJournal:jnl50907x1074-07087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agecon.uga.edu/~jaae/jaae.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/06  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01602naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245007500154300001600229520023800245650002200483650002500505650001100530650002800541650001100569650003100580650002000611650001400631650006600645650002400711650002700735650004400762650005600806651001300862651001300875653002300888700001600911700002100927700002300948700002200971773007800993852000901071939003301080945000801113946001101121655001201132991618213250742620221121124800.0840322e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017772DNAL7 a71859642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, K.A.B.10aCongenital toxoplasmosis: A prospective survey in the west of Scotland  ap. 219-229.  aToxoplasma gondii, human, prospective survey of antenatal patients to assess incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis, incidence higher than previous estimates, costs of preventive programs could probably be justified: Glasgow, Scotland 3aToxoplasma gondii 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFetal Bloodximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Mxanalysis 2aInfant, Newborn 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aProspective Studies 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aToxoplasmosisxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aToxoplasmosis, Congenitalxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 3aScotland 0aScotland 0aPrenatal infection1 aScott, J.M.1 aMacfarlane, D.E.1 aWilliamson, J.M.W.1 aElias-Jones, T.F.0 tJournal of infection.g1981 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.219-229x0163-44537nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840322c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03488naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100002100192245007600213300001600289520094900305650001801254650001401272650001701286650002701303650002501330650002301355650002501378650003501403650002401438650002101462650001001483650001101493650002101504650001001525650002401535650009501559650001201654650007801666650006401744650007001808650001101878650004901889650003001938650003501968650002802003650005002031650006002081650005902141650002402200650004802224653003502272700001902307700001702326700001802343700002002361700002102381700002902402700002002431700003202451700001902483773007102502852000902573856007902582930003302661945002502694946001102719655001202730IND4409710120221121124743.0080902e20080313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971012DNAL7 a183378142pmid7 a10.1038/nature067222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKaminsky, Ronald12aA new class of anthelmintics effective against drug-resistant nematodes  ap. 176-180.  aAnthelmintic resistance in human and animal pathogenic helminths has been spreading in prevalence and severity to a point where multidrug resistance against the three major classes of anthelmintics--the benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles and macrocyclic lactones--has become a global phenomenon in gastrointestinal nematodes of farm animals. Hence, there is an urgent need for an anthelmintic with a new mode of action. Here we report the discovery of the amino-acetonitrile derivatives (AADs) as a new chemical class of synthetic anthelmintics and describe the development of drug candidates that are efficacious against various species of livestock-pathogenic nematodes. These drug candidates seem to have a novel mode of action involving a unique, nematode-specific clade of acetylcholine receptor subunits. The AADs are well tolerated and of low toxicity to mammals, and overcome existing resistances to the currently available anthelmintics. 3aanthelmintics 3asynthesis 3adrug therapy 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aCooperia oncophora 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3anematode infections 3anematode control 3asheep 3acattle 3apharmacokinetics 2aAging 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAminoacetonitrilexadverse effectsxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxchemistryxclassificationxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCaenorhabditis elegans Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aParasitic Diseases, Animalxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aReceptors, Nicotinicxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSheepxparasitology 2aSheep Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 0aamino-acetonitrile derivatives1 aDucray, Pierre1 aJung, Martin1 aClover, Ralph1 aRufener, Lucien1 aBouvier, Jacques1 aSchorderet Weber, Sandra1 aWenger, André.1 aWieland-Berghausen, Susanne1 aGoebel, Thomas0 tNature.g2008 Mar. 13, v. 452, no. 7184 p.176-180x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature067223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03099naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100002200162245014100184300001400325500017600339500001500515520162400530650002102154650001602175650002202191650001802213650001402231650001702245650002402262650002102286651001102307653001002318653001902328653003002347653001702377700002402394773007202418852000902490856008502499930003302584945002502617946001102642655001202653IND4409709920221121124740.0080902s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970992DNAL7 a10.1108/000707008108448032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lindgreen and M. Hingley.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose -- This paper seeks to shed some light on value-creation in new product development (NPD) projects within the context of industry convergence and to explore alternative types of projects characterised by different buyer-seller relationships. Design/methodology/approach -- There has been much research on value-creation in general, but limited emphasis on value-creation in NPD projects addressing new industry segments emerging from industry convergence (for example, the segment of nuctraceuticals and functional foods (NFF) products that is positioned between the food and the pharmaceutical industries). Based on a multi-case study approach, this paper pursues an exploratory research strategy and investigates 54 NPD projects drawn from a Quebec (Canada) NFF foods cluster. Findings -- In the context of convergence a new value chain is emerging between two formerly separated sectors. Value-creation networks spread across industries and reinforce trends of convergence. Firms face competence gaps in NPD and seek to close these by choosing alternative forms of collaboration. Different types of NPD projects involve alternative forms of buyer-seller relationships and their approach of value-creation is analysed. Research limitations/implications -- A typology of different approaches to NPD in converging value chains is presented along with type-specific implications for value-creation for the required buyer-seller relationship. Originality/value -- This paper provides a unique insight into value-creation in NPD in the emerging NFF sector, in particular, and for converging industries, in general. 3afunctional foods 3anovel foods 3aeconomic analysis 3afood industry 3amarketing 3acase studies 3aproduct development 3ahuman food chain 3aQuebec 0afoods 0avalue creation 0abuyer-seller relationship 0avalue chains1 aCloutier, L.

The authors hypothesized that the plasma glucose level could be reduced through the inhibition of glucose absorption and/or the enhancement of insulin secretion. Administration of the extract (0.5 and 1 g/kg body weight) in an oral glucose tolerance test led to a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels in 30 minutes after the administration in moderately diabetic rats, as compared with untreated rats (P < .05), and this was at a faster rate than the use of an antidiabetic drug, glibenclamide. The inhibition of glucose absorption through the small intestine was investigated using an everted intestinal sac. The results showed that the extract at concentrations of 0.156 to 5 mg/mL caused a reduction of glucose absorption in a dose response manner. The maximum response was noted at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL. The promotion of the extract on insulin secretion was confirmed by incubating β cell of pancreatic islets and INS-1E insulinoma cells with the extract at 1 to 1000 μg/mL. These observations suggest that the aqueous extract from the A indicum plant has antidiabetic properties, which inhibited glucose absorption and stimulated insulin secretion. Phytochemical screening also revealed that the extract contained alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, and saponins that could account for the observed pharmacologic effects of the plant extract. 3aaqueous solutions 3aAbutilon 3aglucose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3ainsulin secretion 3arats 3aanimal models 3aglycemic effect 3aplant extracts 3aacute toxicity 3adiabetes mellitus 3amedicinal plants 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aDietary Sucrosexpharmacokinetics 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGlucosexpharmacokinetics 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aGlyburidexpharmacology 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIslets of Langerhansxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMalvaceae 2aMice 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReference Values 0aaqueous extracts 0aAbutilon indicum 0aglucose absorption1 aPeungvicha, Penchom1 aTemsiririrkkul, Rungravi1 aWongkrajang, Yuvadee0 tNutrition research.g2009 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.579-587dElsevier Science Inc.x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2009.07.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/28  aOther US 7aarticle01255naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001400133245008100147300001500228520017500243650002600418650002000444650001700464650001200481650001800493650003700511650002000548650003200568650001700600650005600617700001700673700001400690700002000704773008200724852000900806939003300815945000800848946001300856655001200869991618212520742620221121095621.0840323e198402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017702DNAL7 a66928882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulda, J.10aTritrichomonas foetus: Stable anaerobic resistance to metronidazole in vitro  ap. 93-103.  aTritrichomonas foetus, stable anaerobic resistance to metronidazole induced in vitro by cultivation in Diamond's TYM medium with metronidazole in sublethal concentrations 3aTritrichomonas foetus 3adrug resistance 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aCulture Media 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Resistance 2aMetronidazolexpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTritrichomonasxdrug effectsxgrowth & development.1 aCerkasov, J.1 aDemes, P.1 aCerkasovova, A.0 tExperimental parasitology.g1984 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.93-103x0014-48947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840323c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03220naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001600176245017100192300001600363500019100379500002400570520136100594650001101955650001001966650001701976650002701993650002002020650001502040650002602055650002202081650001502103650003602118650001102154650003402165650003102199650003202230650004102262650003802303653003202341700001702373700001902390700001802409773009702427852000902524856008802533930003302621945002502654946001102679655001202690IND4408987020221121074154.0080815e20080808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898702DNAL7 a185721762pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3801 aVatinno, R.10aAutomated high-throughput method using solid-phase microextraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of ochratoxin A in human urine  ap. 215-221.  aPaper presented at the 10th International Symposium on Hyphenated Techniques in Chromatography and Hyphenated Chromatographic Analysers held January 30-February 1, 2008, Bruges, Belgium.  aIncludes references  aA new automated, high-throughput method for the determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in human urine samples has been optimized and validated using solid-phase microextraction coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPME-LC-MS/MS). High-throughput was achieved by simultaneous preparation of up to 96 samples using multi-fiber SPME device and multi-well plates. A carbon-tape coating was chosen for the first time as the best extracting phase for this contaminant. The proposed method required only minimal sample pre-treatment to adjust sample pH to 3.0 using a dilution (1:1) with 0.5M phosphate-buffered saline. A simple gradient guaranteed a good chromatographic separation from matrix interferences in only 8min. Relative recovery (%), precision and linearity validation results met Food and Drug Administration acceptance criteria at three concentration levels (1, 10, and 50ng/mL), indicating excellent performance of the proposed method. Limits of detection and quantitation were 0.3 and 0.7ng/mL in urine, respectively. OTA determination in urine is a good marker for human exposure to this mycotoxin. It is also less invasive than blood analysis. This method is fully automated and the SPME technique is simpler, less time-consuming and cheaper compared with most widely adopted clean-up procedures for OTA extraction from urine. 3ahumans 3aurine 3aochratoxin A 3asolid phase extraction 3amicroextraction 3aautomation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 2aAutomation 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aHumans 2aOchratoxinsxanalysisxurine. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSolid Phase Microextractionxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 0asolid-phase microextraction1 aVuckovic, D.1 aZambonin, C.G.1 aPawliszyn, J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Aug. 8, v. 1201, no. 2 p.215-221dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0793Available from publisher's Web site  a20080825b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04317naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100003100199245010700230300001600337500001500353520170900368592002802077650002002105650002502125650001202150650001602162650002302178650001702201650001902218650002002237650001702257650001902274650001502293650001702308650003402325650001902359650001802378650000902396650001002405650005102415650002502466650001402491650004102505650001802546650001702564650001102581650004802592650004202640650006402682650001102746650001602757650000902773650002602782650001502808650003902823650003202862650001702894650005002911651001002961651002502971653000902996700002203005700003503027700003203062700003103094700002803125773013503153852000903288856008603297930003303383945002503416946001103441990002303452655001203475IND4409713320221121074234.0080902e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971332DNAL7 a186229452pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.6.3592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A Case-Control Study  ap. 359-368.  a2019-12-04  aWater-soluble vitamins influence the development of an adequate structure of bone tissue, but there is scant information relating them with osteoporotic fractures. We analyze whether serum vitamin C, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and erythrocyte folate, or dietary intake of vitamin C and folate, are related with osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. A hospital-based case-control study was carried out at the Hospital of Jaén (167 cases, 167 controls), Spain. Cases were defined as patients aged 65 or more years with a low-energy fracture. Controls were people without fracture, matched for age and sex with cases. Diet was assessed by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Serum vitamin C was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> were measured using procedures of competitive or immunometric immunoassay. Multivariable analyses were also fitted to adjust for confounding using analysis of covariance (for the comparison of adjusted means) and conditional logistic regression (for estimating adjusted odds ratios). A statistically significant difference between cases and controls for vitamin C blood levels was found, being higher for controls (p = 0.01). Analysis of the association between serum vitamin C and fracture risk showed a linear trend (p = 0.03) with a significantly reduced risk for the upper quartile (OR = 0.31; 95% CI 0.11–0.87). The intake of vitamin C, folic acid, and B<sub>12</sub> was not related to fracture risk, nor was there any association with erythrocyte folate or serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. In conclusion, serum vitamin C levels were lower in cases with osteoporotic fractures than in controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient intake 3acase-control studies 3aelderly 3avitamin B12 3anutritional status 3aimmunoassays 3abone fractures 3arisk assessment 3aerythrocytes 3abone formation 3afolic acid 3aosteoporosis 3afood frequency questionnaires 3arisk reduction 3aascorbic acid 2aAged 2aAging 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCausality 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDietxmethods 2aDiet Records 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aFractures, Bonexbloodxepidemiology. 2aGeriatric Assessmentxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aHumans 2aImmunoassay 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOdds Ratio 2aOsteoporosisxbloodxepidemiology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosagexblood. 3aSpain 0aSpainxepidemiology. 0adiet1 aPalma Pérez,  S.1 aDelgado Martínez, Alberto D.,1 aMartínez-González,  M.

Further purification of the gum was achieved by treating the gum solution with phenol to obtain protein free fenugreek gum (0.16% protein residue). The three types of fenugreek gums were evaluated for: molecular weight, surface activity and rheological performance. Surface and interfacial tension, measured by a Du Nouy ring, indicated that the removal of protein in the gum significantly reduced its surface activity. However, the crude fenugreek gum exhibited lower intrinsic viscosity and radius of gyration compared to the purified and protein free fenugreek gums. It was found that both protein residue and gum concentration affected the elastic modulus (G'), viscous modulus (G''), and complex viscosity (eta*). 3asurface active properties 3asurface tension 3aprotein content 3agalactomannans 3aviscosity 3amodulus of elasticity 3afenugreek 3afood composition 3amolecular weight 3ainterface phenomena 0agums 0aphysicochemical properties 0asurface activity 0arheological properties 0aelastic modulus 0aviscous modulus 0acomplex viscosity1 aWang, Q.1 aCui, S.W.1 aBarbut, S.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2049-2053dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.03.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03127naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002400167245011600191300001400307500002400321500001500345520165300360650003102013650001302044650001202057650002102069650001302090650001502103650002602118650002202144651001502166653003802181653002402219653001902243653001702262653002502279653002702304700001902331700002402350773009202374852000902466856008902475930003302564945002502597946001102622655001202633IND4408987920221121045211.0080815e20080830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aWishart, DeBonne N.10aFracture anisotropy characterization in crystalline bedrock using field-scale azimuthal self potential gradient  ap. 35-45.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe potential for the geophysical characterization of fractured rock bulk anisotropy using azimuthal self potential gradient (ASPG) method was investigated at four fractured rock field sites in the New Jersey Highlands (NJH) province. A visual (from polar plots) and empirical (from linear regression of cross plots) correlation exists between ASPG measurements and dominant fracture strike orientations mapped at three of the four study sites, with the magnitude of the SP signal positively correlated to the number of fractures (N) along the same azimuth. This result is consistent with recent electrokinetic theory that invokes a dependence of the streaming potential coupling coefficient on microgeometry in addition to hydraulic gradient. Based on local surface drainage patterns and regional fracture orientations, the direction of the positive lobe of the ASPG signal appears indicative of the likely flow direction within fracture sets. Three repeat measurements at one site over a one year period consistently reproduced the ASPG lobes along major and minor fracture sets, although the magnitude of the self potential varied along the major strike set possibly due to variable rates of groundwater flow. Whereas ASPG captured hydraulic-anisotropy at three of four sites, resistivity anisotropy only dominated azimuthal resistivity surveys (ARS) data at one site. Our results suggest that ASPG is a surprisingly simple, effective tool for characterization of fracture-dominated media. In addition to defining the fracture-induced hydraulic anisotropy, the direction of fracture-controlled flow is evident from the polarity of the SP signal. 3amathematics and statistics 3aporosity 3abedrock 3agroundwater flow 3aaquifers 3ageophysics 3aelectrical resistance 3ahydrologic models 3aNew Jersey 0aazimuthal self potential gradient 0acrystalline bedrock 0afractured rock 0ahydrogeology 0ahydraulic anisotropy 0aresistivity anisotropy1 aSlater, Lee D.1 aGates, Alexander E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Aug. 30, v. 358, no. 1-2 p.35-45dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20081124b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03655naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100001700199245010700216300001600323500001500339520125400354592002801608650002301636650001801659650001701677650000801694650001601702650001801718650000901736650002101745650001801766650001001784650002101794650002301815650001201838650002101850650001701871650001101888650001001899650002101909650002301930650005501953650005002008650003002058650002302088650001802111650005602129650003802185650001102223650001802234650003602252650000902288650005102297650002102348650001702369650002502386650002502411653001902436700002102455700002102476700002002497700002102517773013602538852000902674856008602683930003302769945002502802946001102827990002302838655001202861IND4409715720221121035956.0080902e20070901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971572DNAL7 a184533202pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.5.3472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Twenty-seven subjects received oat (providing 5.7g/day β-glucan) or wheat (control) cereal products, in random order, incorporated into their usual diets for two weeks. Total energy and fiber (∼14 g/day) contents of the cereals were matched. A meal tolerance test that included the study cereal and a high-fat milkshake (1240 kcal, 105 g fat) was performed at the end of each treatment period. Postprandial insulin and glucose responses over 10 hours did not differ between treatments. Peak triglyceride concentration was lower after oat vs. wheat cereal consumption [2.3 ± 1.2 (mean ± standard deviation) vs. 2.9 ± 1.3 mmol/L, p = 0.016]. Mean area under the triglyceride curve also tended to be lower (15.1 ± 8.2 vs. 17.6 ± 8.6 hours × mmol/L, p = 0.068). The free fatty acid area under the curve was elevated after the oat vs. the wheat products (3.64 ± 0.91 vs. 3.38 ± 0.98 hours × mmol/L, p = 0.018).

Biopolymer films, which contain both lipid and polysaccharide ingredients to form complex packaging enable us to obtain edible films with good mechanical and water barrier properties as emulsified alginate edible films. Moreover, these can be considered to encapsulate active molecules as flavours. The aim of this work is to better understand the influence of the composition and the structure of the film matrix on its barrier properties and thus on its capacity to protect encapsulated active substances. Granulometry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Microscopy (MEB) characterizations of films with or without flavour and/or fat showed that the encapsulated n-hexanal compound modifies the film structure because of interactions with the alginate matrix. This interaction affects the studied barrier properties, oxygen permeability, aroma compound permeability, liquid aroma permeability and surface properties, of emulsified alginate films. This study brings new understanding on the role of emulsion-based edible films as a matrix and on its ability to protect encapsulated aroma compounds and on its barrier properties. 3aedible films 3aemulsions 3achemical structure 3aalginates 3apermeability 3aodor compounds 3amicroencapsulation 3achemical composition 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3asurface quality 3afood packaging 3abiopolymers 3alipids 3aflavor compounds 0aliquid aroma1 aDebeaufort, Frédéric1 aBonnotte, Aline1 aVoilley, Andrée.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2116-2124dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.04.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle04218naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100001700199245009400216300001600310500001500326520165100341592002801992650002002020650002302040650001302063650000802076650001002084650001702094650002402111650002002135650002002155650002802175650001202203650002302215650001402238650001102252650001002263650002102273650002702294650002102321650006502342650002002407650002802427650002302455650004002478650001302518650001102531650001102542650001502553650000902568650001602577650002602593650001702619650002102636650002302657650004402680650005902724650001602783651001002799651002502809653003202834653002202866653002102888653001302909700002302922700001602945700002302961700001802984700001603002773013503018852000903153856008603162930003303248945002503281946001103306990002303317655001203340IND4409714120221121040057.0080902e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971412DNAL7 a186229512pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.6.4062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSotillo,  C.10aBody Composition in an Adult Population in Southern Spain: Influence of lifestyle Factors  ap. 406-414.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of the present study was to assess the body composition in an adult Mediterranean population by two methods, to identify groups at risk for obesity and lifestyle factors that might influence this risk. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Andalusia, a western Mediterranean region in southern Spain. Body composition was studied with anthropometric methods and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) in a random sample of 394 subjects (169 men, 225 women) between 20 and 60 years of age. When anthropometric methods were used, we found that 19.4% of the individuals had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In 46.2% of the men, more than 25% of the body weight consisted of fat, and in 74.1% of the women, more than 30% of the body weight consisted of fat. When BIA data were used, these values rose to 34.7% and 60.6% for men and women respectively. After controlling for sex, age correlated directly with percentage of body fat when skinfold thickness (r = 0.58) or BIA (r = 0.40) was used. In smokers, the number of cigarettes/day correlated directly with waist circumference (r = 0.76), after controlling for both age and sex. We found high percentages of obesity regardless of the indicator or method used, particularly in women. Factors such as sex, age, leisure-time physical exercise, educational level, and smoking appeared to influence obesity. The factors that made the greatest contribution to the rates of obesity and high waist-hip ratio were the age, time spent exercising, and educational level. In contrast, the risk of high body fat (as determined with both methods) was associated only with sex and age.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3askinfold thickness 3aexercise 3amen 3awomen 3arisk factors 3awaist circumference 3arisk assessment 3asmoking (habit) 3abioelectrical impedance 3aobesity 3aeducational status 3alifestyle 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAnthropometryxmethods 2aBody Composition 2aBody Fat Distributionxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEducational Status 2aElectric Impedancexdiagnostic use. 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Distribution 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aSmokingxadverse effectsxepidemiology. 2aWaist-Hip Ratioxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aYoung Adult 3aSpain 0aSpainxepidemiology. 0aanthropometric measurements 0aphysical activity 0abody composition 0abody fat1 aLópez-Jurado,  M.1 aAranda,  P.1 aLópez-Frías,  M.1 aSánchez,  C.1 aLlopis,  J.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2007 Nov. 1, v. 77, no. 6 p.406-414dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.77.6.4063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/08  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01642naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245009700149300001400246520030400260650002000564650001200584650004700596650004500643650003000688650002300718650001100741650003300752650002400785650002600809650000900835650002900844650002000873650002400893653004900917653002700966653002000993700001201013700001501025773008101040852000901121939003301130945000801163946001301171655001201184991618208050742620221121040142.0840322e198402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017612DNAL7 a66928822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, SK.10aAscaris lumbricoides and Ascaridia galli: Biogenic amines in adults and developmental stages  ap. 34-39.  aAscaris lumbricoides var. hominis, Ascaridia galli, concentrations of biogenic amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine) in different body regions of mature males and females and in different developmental stages (unembryonated eggs, embryonated eggs, infective larval stage) 3aAscaridia galli 2aAnimals 2aAscaridiaxanalysisxgrowth & development. 2aAscarisxanalysisxgrowth & development. 2aBiogenic Aminesxanalysis 2aDopaminexanalysis 2aFemale 2aGenitalia, Femalexanalysis. 2aHistaminexanalysis 2aIntestinesxanalysis. 2aMale 2aNorepinephrinexanalysis 2aOvumxanalysis. 2aSerotoninxanalysis 0aAscaris lumbricoides var. hominis (Nematoda) 0aBiochemistry, Nematoda 0aSex of parasite1 aSen, R.1 aGhatak, S.0 tExperimental parasitology.g1984 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.34-39x0014-48947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840322c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03648naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001700176245023400193300001400427500002400441520162200465650002802087650002102115650002102136650004302157650002202200650001302222650001802235650002502253650005002278650003602328650002102364650002602385650002702411650002302438650005702461650001602518653002602534653003702560653002302597700001302620700001302633700001702646700001902663700001702682700001802699700001702717700001802734700002002752773009602772852000902868856008802877930003302965945002502998946001103023655001203034IND4408984620221121035931.0080815e20080829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898462DNAL7 a186498872pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aQi, Lian-Wen10aQualitative and quantitative analysis of Radix Astragali products by fast high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry through dynamic adjustment of fragmentor voltage  ap. 27-35.  aIncludes references  aA novel fast high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method coupled with diode array detection (DAD) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/MS) was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Radix Astragali products. The potential of fast HPLC on 1.8-μm particles was compared with the performance of HPLC on conventional 5-μm particles columns. Significant advantages of fast HPLC include high-speed chromatographic separation, four times faster than HPLC with conventional columns, and great enhancement in sensitivity with limits of detection low to 0.001ng. With dynamic adjustment of fragmentor voltage in TOF/MS, an efficient transmission of the ions was achieved to obtain the best sensitivity and abundant fragmentation. By accurate mass measurements within 5ppm error for each molecular ion and subsequent fragment ions, a reliable identification and differentiation of six major saponins including two groups of isomers and twelve main isoflavonoids was described here for the first time. For quantitative analysis by fast HPLC-TOF/MS, linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r ² >0.99) for all analytes. Intra-day reproducibility was below 3% RSD and inter-day values were below 5% RSD. A good correlation (slope=1.1108, r ² =0.9853) was observed for accuracy test. It is concluded that the fast and sensitive HPLC-DAD-TOF/MS is powerful in qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex herbal medicines in terms of time savings, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, accuracy as well as increasing sample throughout and lowering solvent consumption. 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aherbal medicines 3amedicinal plants 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asaponins 3aisoflavonoids 3aelectrical treatment 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxanalysis 2aElectrochemistry 2aIsoflavonesxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aSaponinsxanalysis 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aUncertainty 0adiode array detection 0atime of flight mass spectrometry 0afragmentor voltage1 aCao, Jun1 aLi, Ping1 aYu, Qing-Tao1 aWen, Xiao-Dong1 aWang, Yu-Xia1 aLi, Chang-Yin1 aBao, Kang-De1 aGe, Xiao-Xiao1 aCheng, Xiao-Lan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Aug. 29, v. 1203, no. 1 p.27-35dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080825b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03279naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146100001800163245012000181300001600301520173100317592002802048650000802076650001002084650000802094650002302102650002402125650002002149650002102169650002302190650001302213650004302226650002302269650002602292650002002318650002602338650001402364651001702378653002002395700001802415700001702433773013602450852000902586856008602595930003302681945002502714946001102739990002302750655001202773IND4409714920221121024338.0080902e20070901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971492DNAL7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.5.3262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAl-Saleh,  I.10aAge and Gender-Related Reference Values for Serum dl-α-Tocopherol and All-Trans-Retinol Levels in Saudi Population  ap. 326-335.  aWe established a reference range for dl-α-tocopherol and all-trans-retinol in a Saudi population previously selected for a cross-sectional study evaluating selenium and vitamin status. Concentrations of dl-α-tocopherol and all-trans-retinol were 0.999 ± 0.31 mg/dL (n = 994, range 0.11–3.42 mg/dL) and 49.14 ± 24.15 μg/dL (n = 1000, range 11.20–400.85 μg/dL), respectively. The levels of dl-α-tocopherol and all-trans-retinol in serum were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector. We took the influence of age and gender into account. Both had significant effect on the levels of all-trans-retinol in serum, except in the case of dl-α-tocopherol, where no gender related effect was found. We used the 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles as reference limits. Based on these criteria, it was found that these reference limits differed between genders for all-trans-retinol. Our lower and upper limits for dl-α-tocopherol classified by three age groups were very close to the normal range of 0.5–1.6 mg/dL, as found in previous studies. The 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of all-trans-retinol in both males and females, stratified by age, was close to a level of < 20 μg/dL, which could be regarded as a mild vitamin A deficiency according to WHO criteria. But the value corresponding to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile was higher than the upper limit of vitamin A’s normal range of 70 μg/dL, suggesting a potentially harmful high dietary intake of vitamin A. The reference intervals elaborated here may help in the assessment of the vitamin status and in detecting subjects at risk of developing pathologies associated with either excess intake or deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3amen 3awomen 3aage 3atemporal variation 3areference standards 3ablood chemistry 3aalpha-tocopherol 3anutritional status 3aselenium 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3agender differences 3adiagnostic techniques 3anutrient excess 3anutrient deficiencies 3avitamin A 3aSaudi Arabia 0aage differences1 aEl-Doush,  I.1 aBilledo,  G.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2007 Sept. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.326-335dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.77.5.3263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/08  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03609naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199100002000216245011300236300001600349500001500365520138500380592002801765650002301793650001901816650002301835650001801858650000801876650002401884650001401908650001301922650001301935650001601948650001701964650001401981650002601995650001102021650001002032650000902042650002202051650002502073650001102098650004102109650001102150650001502161650000902176650001602185650001902201650001902220650003202239650002602271650002602297650001102323650001302334650003702347653002902384700001702413700002402430700001902454700001502473700001702488773013502505852000902640856008602649930003302735945002502768946001102793990002302804655001202827IND4409716920221121024333.0080902e20070701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971692DNAL7 a182712832pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.4.2802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was aimed at evaluating, in a pilot study, whether CHF patients have indications for a low vitamin D status during earlier periods of their lives. We performed a case-controlled study in 150 CHF patients and 150 controls. Study participants had to answer a questionnaire that included several items concerning vitamin D-associated lifestyle factors during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A vitamin D score was constructed. This score takes into consideration that ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure is the major vitamin D source for humans and that those lifestyle factors, which are associated with regular UVB exposure, can guarantee an adequate vitamin D status at best. The vitamin D score was significantly higher in controls than in patients (p < 0.001). Compared with the controls, more patients lived in large cities (p < 0.001), fewer patients were members of a sport club (p < 0.001), and fewer patients had summer holidays every year (p < 0.01). Patients also reported significantly less alcohol consumption during adulthood than controls (p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that CHF patients and controls differed in several vitamin D-associated lifestyle factors and in alcohol consumption during earlier periods of their lives.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3aquestionnaires 3anutritional status 3aheart failure 3aage 3aalcoholic beverages 3avitamin D 3achildren 3apatients 3aadolescents 3apathogenesis 3alifestyle 3aultraviolet radiation 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexetiologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aPilot Projects 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aSports 2aSunlight 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxmetabolism 0acongestive heart failure1 aFischer, J.,1 aSchleithoff,  S.

Our review is from the perspective of digestive tract, thereby taking into account the experiences in introducing the preparation, use and safety evaluation of probiotics in aquaculture. A better understanding of rationale, preparation and safety of probiotics in aquaculture may be of interest for commercial aquaculture. 3aprobiotics 3afood safety 3aaquaculture 0aliterature reviews1 aLi, Jian Rong.1 aLin, Junda0 tAquaculture.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 281, no. 1-4 p.1-4dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080922b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03004naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130100002400150245012800174300001600302500001500318520160700333650002301940650001601963650001301979650001301992650002302005650001002028650002602038650002202064650001702086650001802103650002602121650000902147650002502156650001702181650002102198650001802219653002402237653001602261653001602277700001802293700001502311700001502326773011402341852000902455946001102464990002302475655001202498IND4409716520221121014855.0080902s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aGarcia-Martinez, D.10aTocopherol Fate in Plasma and Liver of Streptozotocin-Treated Rats that Orally Received Antioxidants and Spirulina Extracts  ap. 263-271.  a2019-12-04  aStreptozotocin-induced diabetic rats constitute a model of oxidative stress, and vitamin E continues to be a topic of speculation in this area. On the other hand, marine extracts, particularly microalgae extracts obtained with environmentally clean technologies and which demonstrate antioxidant activity in vitro, are a potential source of in vivo antioxidant defense. We have studied the α-tocopherol content in the plasma and liver of diabetic rats after 7 and 14 days under the condition, and before and after the treatment with vitamin E and C, as well as with different Spirulina extracts, as compared with the corresponding controls. The improvement of analytical methodology related to the determination of α-tocopherol in the plasma and liver of rats was also considered. To do this, a method previously developed for plasma, employing a single extraction step, was adapted and validated for liver after minor modifications. Moreover, stability of α-tocopherol in plasma of diabetic and control animals was compared in different storage conditions. Results showed that diabetic plasma strongly influences stability of α-tocopherol, even at -20° C, but samples are stable for at least one year at -80° C. Finally, regarding supplementation, results indicate that supplementation with α-tocopherol increases stored α-tocopherol in liver, but not in plasma, but this availability is strongly dependent on the stage of diabetes of the animal. Extracts of Spirulina platensis, despite showing antioxidant activity in vitro, increased α-tocopherol concentration in neither plasma nor liver. 3atemporal variation 3atocopherols 3aextracts 3asampling 3astorage conditions 3aliver 3anutrient availability 3adiabetes mellitus 3ablood plasma 3aanimal models 3aArthrospira platensis 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aascorbic acid 0aSpirulina platensis 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aRuperez, F.J.1 aUgarte, P.1 aBarbas, C.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2007 July, v. 77, no. 4 p.263-271x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02793naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002000198245013000218300001600348520092000364650002101284650001001305650002001315650002001335650002001355650002001375650001101395650002101406650001501427650002101442650001201463650006701475650005601542650006601598650007501664650001101739650004801750650001101798650005801809650002201867650003901889653002301928653001701951700001901968773009101987852000902078856006902087930003302156945002502189946001302214655001202227IND4385068120221121014850.0061109e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438506812DNAL7 a169731732pmid7 a10.1016/j.jip.2006.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Engorged females of ticks, collected from a naturally B. caballi-infected horse, were incubated at 27 °C and relative humidity over 83%. After a 6-day incubation period, Giemsa-stained smears prepared from hemolymph were examined microscopically under oil immersion. B. caballi infected ticks were dissected and samples of midgut tissue were examined by transmission electron microscopy, through which free sporokinetes were seen in the cytoplasm of gut epithelial cells. In addition, Encephalitozoon-like microsporidia were observed inside the parasitophorous vacuoles in the same cell in which sporokinetes of B. caballi were found and also in some neighbour cells. They presented different morphological stages, suggesting a sequential phases of development. 3aAnocentor nitens 3aticks 3adisease vectors 3aBabesia caballi 3aEncephalitozoon 3amixed infection 3amidgut 3aepithelial cells 3ababesiosis 3amicrosporidiosis 2aAnimals 2aBabesiaxisolation & purificationxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aBabesiosisxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aDigestive Systemxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxultrastructure. 2aEncephalitozoonxisolation & purificationxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aHorses 2aIxodidaexmicrobiologyxparasitologyxultrastructure. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 0anatural infections 0asporokinetes1 aPassos, L.M.F.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2006 Nov., v. 93, no. 3 p.183-185x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2006.07.0033electronic resource  a20061117b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/17  aOther US 7aarticle02515naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001900162245012000181300001600301500001500317520077700332650001801109650001701127650001601144650002101160650001501181650002901196650002601225650002501251650001601276650002201292650002201314650000901336650001901345650002301364650002001387650002401407651001001431653001001441653002401451700002201475700002301497700002601520700001701546700002001563700002201583700002101605700002001626700002101646773008301667852000901750856008501759930003301844945002501877946001101902655001201913IND4409717720221120232143.0080902e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971772DNAL7 a10.1080/036702406009854642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although animal source foods (ASF) provide highly bioavailable micronutrients, Ghanaian preschoolers consume little. Participatory rapid appraisal methods identified constraints to the availability, accessibility, and utilization of ASF. Stakeholders working with or living in six communities in three agro-ecological zones reported constraints including low income, lack of access to technology and markets, inequitable household food allocation, inadequate knowledge, and beliefs. The least expensive ASF was fish, which was easy to preserve and consumed by all communities.

Growth was significantly higher in Acartia-fed larvae compared with larvae fed Artemia (unenriched and DHA-enriched) until day 10. On day 20, Acartia-fed larvae had significantly lower growth than fish fed DHA-enriched Artemia. Feeding success was highest in larvae fed Acartia on day 1. Ingestion rate and satiation time did not differ among fish fed different types of feeds until day 20. Swimming activity before feeding was significantly lower in larvae fed Acartia compared with larvae fed Artemia (unenriched and DHA-enriched) until day 10. Higher growth in Acartia-fed fish on day 10 is probably due to the suitable size and high DHA content of A. tsuensis, and lower swimming activity of the larvae. However, on day 20, lower growth observed in Acartia-fed fish may be attributed to the shift in the food size preference of the fish. The present study was able to demonstrate the effects of copepods on growth and behavioural development of marine finfish using R marmoratus as a model animal. 3afish culture 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal growth 3afeeds 3aAcartia 3aArtemia franciscana 3afish larvae 3aCyprinodontiformes 3afish feeding 0aCopepoda 0aAcartia tsuensis 0aRivulus marmoratus1 aKotani, Tomonari1 aSakakura, Yoshitaka1 aHagiwara, A.q(Atsushi)0 tAquaculture.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 281, no. 1-4 p.100-105dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080922b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle00930naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245013900133300001600272520011400288650001400402650002000416653001800436653002200454700001800476773009500494852000900589939003300598945000800631946001300639655001200652991618205320742620221120232217.0840321e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrezden, B.L.10aCalcium entry blockers inhibit contractures induced by the molluscicide Frescon in Lymnaea stagnalis smooth and cross-striated muscles  ap. 269-277.  acalcium entry blockers inhibit muscle contractures induced by Frescon in Lymnaea stagnalis induced by Frescon 3aTrematoda 3aschistosomiasis 0aSnail control 0aVectors, Mollusca1 aGardner, D.R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1983 Dec., v. 20, no. 3 p.269-277x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840321c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001700176245011900193300001600312500002400328500001500352520150800367650002301875650001501898650002301913650001101936650002701947650001101974650002201985650001102007650002102018651001002039653001802049773009402067852000902161856008902170930003302259945002502292946001102317655001202328IND4408988620221120221741.0080815e20080905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aP200 0aB2001 aThomas, Axel10aDevelopment and properties of 0.25-degree gridded evapotranspiration data fields of China for hydrological studies  ap. 145-158.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aConstruction and spatial and temporal properties for a 0.25° resolution gridded data set of monthly Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration estimates over the territory of the PR China (including Tibet) and adjacent areas (15°N-55°N, 65°E-135°E) for the period 1951-1990 are described. To account for the interaction between climate and the rugged topography of the study area the REGEOTOP procedure was used to incorporate the effects of relief forms into the interpolation. Evapotranspiration rates over much of China show a range of values (annual rates from 550-2300mm) and variability comparable to precipitation. Monthly evapotranspiration rates are distributed more evenly over the year than precipitation, are out of phase with the summer precipitation peak and in some cases may reach winter rates comparable to those in summer. Hydrological studies based on idealized regular seasonal variation of evapotranspiration may contain considerable errors due to inherent seasonal fluctuations as compared to precipitation. High resolution gridded PET data that account for the influence of topography on climate are required to resolve the spatial heterogeneity of topography and land use in order to allow precise estimates of actual evapotranspiration and run-off. The spatial distribution of runoff appears to have remained fairly constant over most of China during 1951-1990 which stands in contrast to the anticipated increase in hydrological activity under global warming conditions. 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3aevapotranspiration 3awinter 3ageographical variation 3asummer 3aspatial variation 3arunoff 3aclimatic factors 3aChina 0aprecipitation0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Sept. 5, v. 358, no. 3-4 p.145-158dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20081124b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001300176245007600189300001500265500002400280500001500304520152300319650001101842650001601853650001801869650002001887650001101907650002401918650001501942650002201957650001501979653003101994653002302025653001502048653002802063653001402091653002802105700001502133700001302148773009302161852000902254856008902263930003302352945002502385946001102410655001202421IND4408988420221120221724.0080815e20080830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aM500 0aX1001 aWu, C.L.10aRiver stage prediction based on a distributed support vector regression  ap. 96-111.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn accurate and timely prediction of river flow flooding can provide time for the authorities to take pertinent flood protection measures such as evacuation. Various data-derived models including LR (linear regression), NNM (the nearest-neighbor method) ANN (artificial neural network) and SVR (support vector regression), have been successfully applied to water level prediction. Of them, SVR is particularly highly valued, because it has the advantage over many data-derived models in overcoming overfitting of training data. However, SVR is computationally time-consuming when used to solve large-size problems. In the context of river flow prediction, equipped with LR model as a benchmark and genetic algorithm-based ANN (ANN-GA) and NNM as counterparts, a novel distributed SVR (D-SVR) model is proposed in this study. It implements a local approximation to training data because partitioned original training data are independently fitted by each local SVR model. ANN-GA and LR models are also used to help determine input variables. A two-step GA algorithm is employed to find the optimal triplets (C, ε, σ) for D-SVR model. The validation results reveal that the proposed D-SVR model can carry out the river flow prediction better in comparison with others, and dramatically reduce the training time compared with the conventional SVR model. The pivotal factor contributing to the performance of D-SVR may be that it implements a local approximation method and the principle of structural risk minimization. 3arivers 3astream flow 3alinear models 3aneural networks 3afloods 3aregression analysis 3aalgorithms 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 0amathematics and statistics 0agenetic algorithms 0ariver flow 0asupport vector gression 0ahydrology 0anearest neighbor method1 aChau, K.W.1 aLi, Y.S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Aug. 30, v. 358, no. 1-2 p.96-111dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.05.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03260naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001800198245014600216300001600362520159900378650001601977650001401993650001902007650001902026650001902045650001902064650002402083650002402107650003402131650003102165650003302196650001302229650003902242650002502281650002202306650003202328700002302360700002402383700001902407700002202426773011202448852000902560856006902569930003302638945002502671946001102696990002302707655001202730IND4384956920141222000000.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495692DNAL7 a164773502pmid7 a10.1007/s10532-005-9028-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the present study, the biodegradation capacities of various microflorae towards diesel oil were determined in laboratory conditions. Microflorae were collected from 9 contaminated and 10 uncontaminated soil samples and were compared to urban wastewater activated sludge. The recalcitrance of hydrocarbons in tests was characterised using both gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). The microflorae from contaminated soils were found to exhibit higher degradation capacities than those from uncontaminated soil and activated sludge. In cultures inoculated by contaminated-soil microflorae, 80% of diesel oil on an average was consumed over 4-week incubation compared to only 64% in uncontaminated soil and 60% in activated sludge cultures. As shown by GC, n-alkanes of diesel oil were totally utilised by each microflora but differentiated degradation extents were observed for cyclic and branched hydrocarbons. The enhanced degradation capacities of impacted-soil microflorae resulted probably from an adaptation to the hydrocarbon contaminants but a similar adaptation was noted in uncontaminated soils when conifer trees might have released natural hydrocarbons. GCxGC showed that a contaminated-soil microflora removed all aromatics and all branched alkanes containing less than C₁₅. The most recalcitrant compounds were the branched and cyclic alkanes with 15-23 atoms of carbon. 3adiesel fuel 3afuel oils 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3asoil microorganisms 2aAlkanesxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aGasoline 2aHydrocarbons, Aromaticxmetabolism 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism1 aVendeuvre, Colombe1 aBertoncini, Fabrice1 aMarchal, Rémy1 aMonot, Frédéric0 tBiodegradation.g2006 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.577-585dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-005-9028-43electronic resource  a20061205b20070102c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/12/05  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03590naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100002900181245011900210300001600329520198900345650001802334650001502352650002502367650001902392650001902411650001902430650001602449650001302465650002002478650001502498650003402513650001202547650003002559650004102589650003102630650001302661650002302674650002302697700001502720700002102735700002202756773011202778852000902890856006902899930003302968945002503001946001103026990002303037655001203060IND4384956520221120221720.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495652DNAL7 a164894152pmid7 a10.1007/s10532-005-9024-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSnyder, Christopher J.P.10aBiodegradation kinetics of 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol by an acclimated mixed microbial culture under aerobic conditions  ap. 535-544.  aThe objective of this study was to achieve a better quantitative understanding of the kinetics of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) biodegradation by an acclimated mixed microbial culture. An aerobic mixed microbial culture, obtained from the aeration basin of the wastewater treatment plant, was acclimated in shake flasks utilizing various combinations of 2,4,6-TCP (25-100 mg l-¹), phenol (300 mg l-¹) and glycerol (2.5 mg l-¹) as substrates. Complete primary TCP degradation and a corresponding stoichiometric release of chloride ion were observed by HPLC and IEC analytical techniques, respectively. The acclimated cultures were then used as an inoculum for bench scale experiments in a 4 l stirred-tank reactor (STR) with 2,4,6-TCP as the sole carbon/energy (C/E) source. The phenol acclimated mixed microbial culture consisted of primarily Gram positive and negative rods and was capable of degrading 2,4,6-TCP completely. None of the predicted intermediate compounds were detected by gas chromatography in the cell cytoplasm or supernatant. Based on the disappearance of 2,4,6-TCP, degradation was well modelled by zero-order kinetics which was also consistent with the observed oxygen consumption. Biodegradation rates were compared for four operating conditions including two different initial 2,4,6-TCP concentrations and two different initial biomass concentrations. While the specific rate constant was not dependent on the initial 2,4,6-TCP concentration, it did depend on the initial biomass concentration (X init). A lower biomass concentration gave a much higher zero-order specific degradation rate. This behaviour was attributed to a lower average biomass age or cell retention time (θx) for these cultures. The implications of this investigation are important for determining and predicting the potential risks associated with TCP, its degradation in the natural environment or the engineering implications for ex situ treatment of contaminated ground water or soil. 3achlorophenols 3apollutants 3awastewater treatment 3amicroorganisms 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abioreactors 3akinetics 2aAcclimatization 2aAerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aChlorophenolsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aOxygen Consumption 2aWater Microbiology1 aAsghar, M.1 aScharer, Jeno M.1 aLegge, Raymond L.0 tBiodegradation.g2006 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.535-544dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-005-9024-83electronic resource  a20061205b20070102c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/12/05  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04202naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072001700169072001700186072001700203100002100220245014500241300001600386500001500402520193200417650001502349650001202364650001602376650002302392650001102415650002002426650003502446650001902481650001302500650001902513650001802532650002302550650002502573650001502598650001002613650003002623650002802653650002302681650001002704650005002714650001102764650003102775650001302806650001102819650003102830650003302861650002502894650000902919650001602928650002602944653002802970653001602998653002203014653002703036700001903063700001803082700001403100700002703114773013303141852000903274856009003283930003303373945002503406946001303431655001203444IND4400023620221120221642.0080113e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440002362DNAL7 a181874302pmid7 a10.1080/07315724.2007.107196442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHerbeth, Bernard14aThe Lipoprotein Lipase Serine 447 Stop Polymorphism Is Associated With Altered Serum Carotenoid Concentrations in the Stanislas Family Study  ap. 655-662.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Carotenoids are mainly carried by lipoproteins in blood, however little is known about the influence of polymorphisms of apolipoproteins (apo), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) involved in serum lipid metabolism. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze whether serum concentrations of 5 carotenoids (lutein-zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, α-carotene, β-carotene) are associated with common polymorphisms of Apo E, Apo B, Apo CIII, CETP, and LPL. METHODS: Serum concentrations of lutein-zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, α-carotene, and β-carotene were measured and polymorphisms of Apo E (cys112arg and arg158cys), Apo B (thr71ile), Apo CIII [C(-482)T, Apo CIII T(-455)C, Apo CIII C1100T, Apo CIII C3175G, Apo CIII T3206G], CETP (ile405val), and LPL (S447X) were determined in a sample of 447 children and adults drawn from the Stanislas Study. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, oral contraceptive use, BMI, serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and fruit and vegetable intakes, carriers vs. non carriers of the lipoprotein lipase X447 allele had significant lower concentrations of lutein-zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene and β-carotene; differences vs. S447S genotype being the largest for X447X: -18.8%, -50.5%, -54.8% and -47.1%, for the four carotenoid fractions, respectively. No significant association was noticed for lycopene concentration. None of the other tested polymorphisms was significantly related to the serum carotenoid concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation for the first time demonstrates that LPL S447X polymorphism could alter serum concentrations of carotenoids in healthy individuals, independently of serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentration. These data indicate that genetic factors could be involved in the variability of carotenoid bioavailability and bioconversion. 3astop codon 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3alipoprotein lipase 3aserine 3ablood chemistry 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ablood sampling 3alycopene 3aalpha-carotene 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aApolipoproteinsxgenetics 2aBiological Availability 2aCarotenoidsxblood 2aChild 2aCholesterol Ester Transfer Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLipid Metabolismxgenetics 2aLipoprotein Lipasexgenetics 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0acarotenoids 0alutein-zeaxanthin 0aStanislas Family Study1 aGueguen, Sonia1 aLeroy, Pierre1 aSiest, G.1 aVisvikis-Siest, Sophie0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2007 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.655-662dAmerican College of Nutritionx0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2007.107196443Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02753naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300001600203500001500219520173900234650002801973650001602001650001002017650001902027650001402046650001802060650001002078650001202088653002402100653003602124653002302160653001002183653001302193700001502206773006802221852000902289930003302298945001302331946001102344655001202355IND2202069620221120212047.0991222e199905  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220206962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapuisat, M.10aTesting kin selection with sex allocation data in eusocial Hymenoptera  ap. 473-478.  a2019-12-05  aSex allocation data in eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) provide an excellent opportunity to assess the effectiveness of kin selection, because queens and workers differ in their relatedness to females and males. The first studies on sex allocation in eusocial Hymenoptera compared population sex investment ratios across species. Female-biased investment in monogyne (= with single-queen colonies) populations of ants suggested that workers manipulate sex allocation according to their higher relatedness to females than males (relatedness asymmetry). However, several factors may confound these comparisons across species. First, variation in relatedness asymmetry is typically associated with major changes in breeding system and life history that may also affect sex allocation. Secondly, the relative cost of females and males is difficult to estimate across sexually dimorphic taxa, such as ants. Thirdly, each species in the comparison may not represent an independent data point, because of phylogenetic relationships among species. Recently, stronger evidence that workers control sex allocation has been provided by intraspecific studies of sex ratio variation across colonies. In several species of eusocial Hymenoptera, colonies with high relatedness asymmetry produced mostly females, in contrast to colonies with low relatedness asymmetry which produced mostly males. Additional signs of worker control were found by investigating proximate mechanisms of sex ratio manipulation in ants and wasps. However, worker control is not always effective, and further manipulative experiments will be needed to disentangle the multiple evolutionary factors and processes affecting sex allocation in eusocial Hymenoptera. 3ainterspecific variation 3aHymenoptera 3amales 3asocial insects 3asex ratio 3akin selection 3alabor 3afemales 0aspecies differences 0apopulation sex investment ratio 0aliterature reviews 0acaste 0acolonies1 aKeller, L.0 tHeredity.g1999 May, v. 82, no. pt.5 p.473-478x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01844naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245009300142300001700235520063700252650001500889650001100904650001400915650003600929650003800965650001701003650001201020650002301032650002801055650003101083650003801114650003301152650002401185650003801209653002401247700002001271700001701291773006101308852000901369939003301378946001101411655001201422IND9202833720221120212030.0920508s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920283372DNAL7 a20805212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBye, S.N.13aAn enzyme immunoassay for atractyloside, the nephrotoxin of Callilepis laureola (Impila)  ap. 997-1000.  aTubers of Callilepis laureola, a traditional remedy, contain an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, atractyloside.

R1533-R1541.  a2019-12-04  aThe regulation of Na and Cl transport in hen colon by mineralocorticoids was investigated with isolated epithelia in vitro by histological and electrophysiological techniques. The electrogenic transport of Na and Cl was measured in Ussing chambers by the short-circuit current technique and was identified by the specific inhibitors amiloride and bumetanide or by the secretagogue theophylline. Hens were maintained either on low (LS)- or on high-NaCl diets (HS), and the plasma aldosterone (PA) levels of these groups were measured with radioimmunoassay. A group of HS hens received injections of aldosterone at a 6-h schedule before experiments. A group of LS hens was resalinated, and experiments were carried out at a 24-h interval for up to 3 days after resalination. The LS diet stimulated PA levels ninefold, compared with HS hens. Na transport was modulated by the hormonal stimulus in a way that the apical Na entry switched from an electrogenic Na-amino acid-hexose cotransport system completely to an amiloride-sensitive Na channel. Electrogenic Cl secretion was induced by theophylline and was inhibited by bumetanide. Nacl deprivation, resalination, or aldosterone injection modulated electrogenic Cl secretion in parallel between 7 (HS) and 14.4 microeq.cm-2.h-1 (LS), with pronounced alteration in tissue conductance. These findings reveal a new action of aldosterone that, besides stimulating Na absorption, also directly or indirectly modulates Cl secretion. 3adiet 3asecretion 3ahistology 3aion transport 3ahormonal regulation 3aintestinal absorption 3asodium 3aintestinal mucosa 3asodium chloride 3aaldosterone 3aelectrophysiology 3ahens 3acolon 0achlorides 0astimulation1 aDantzer, V.1 aSkadhauge, E.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1991 Dec., v. 261, no. 6:pt.2 p.R1533-R1541x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02915naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245010300185300001800288500002400306500001500330520122800345650001601573650002201589650001001611650001301621650001401634650001701648650001701665650002201682650002501704650000701729650002501736650001201761650001501773650001501788650001201803650002701815650002301842650002101865650001701886650000901903650002001912650002201932650001801954650002101972650002301993650002602016650003102042650002302073653000902096700002102105700001602126773009702142852000902239856005302248655001202301IND4402069620221120212041.0080227e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440206962DNAL7 a175131042pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, V.K.10aIon exchange during heavy metal bio-sorption from aqueous solution by dried biomass of macrophytes  ap. 1932-1938.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, potentials of oven dried biomass of Eichhornia crassipes, Valisneria spiralis and Pistia stratiotes, were examined in terms of their heavy metal (Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr and Pb) sorption capacity, from individual-metal and multi-metal aqueous solutions at pH 6.0±0.1 (a popular pH of industrial effluent). V. spiralis was the most and E. crassipes was the least efficient for removal of all the metals. Cd, Pb and Zn were efficiently removed by all the three biomass. Cd was removed up to 98% by V. spiralis. Sorption data for Cr, Ni and Cd fitted better to Langmuir isotherm equation, while, the sorption data for Pb, Zn and Cu fitted better to Freundlich isotherm equation. In general, the presence of other metal ions did not influence significantly the targeted metal sorption capacity of the test plant biomasses. Ion exchange was proven the main mechanism involved in bio-sorption and there was a strong ionic balance between adsorbed (H⁺ and M²⁺) to the released ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to and from the biomass. No significant difference was observed in the metal exchanged amount, by doubling of metal concentration (15-30mg/l) in the solution and employing individual-metal and multi-metal solutions. 3amacrophytes 3aaqueous solutions 3aovens 3asorption 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3aPistia stratiotes 3aindustrial effluents 3apH 3aEichhornia crassipes 3abiomass 3ametal ions 2aAdsorption 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCadmiumxchemistry 2aIndustrial Waste 2aIon Exchange 2aIons 2aLeadxchemistry 2aMetalsxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavy 2aModels, Chemical 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aWater Purification 0aions1 aTewari, Saumyata1 aRai, J.P.N.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 6 p.1932-1938dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.042 7aarticle03076naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245011300159300001800272520160000290650002701890650004401917650002201961650001601983650002101999650002702020650001802047650001702065650001802082650001902100650002602119650002002145650002102165650001602186650001902202650001302221650003302234650001602267700003002283700001802313773014202331852000902473856007802482930003302560946001302593655001202606IND4437536220221120201503.0100522e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443753622DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.220112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYumakgil, Kübra10aEffects of TEMED and EDTA on the structural and mechanical properties of NIPAAm/Na⁺MMT composite hydrogels  ap. 1256-1264.  aN-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) hydrogels are known as thermosensitive crosslinked polymer networks. In this work, the network parameters of their composites, i.e., NIPAAm/sodium montmorillonite (NIPAAm/Na⁺MMT) hydrogels synthesized by free radical solution polymerization in the presence of two different types of accelerator (tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TEMED) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)) and initiator (potassium persulphate (K₂S₂O₈) and cerium ammonium nitrate ((NH₄)₂Ce(NO₃)₆), Ce(IV)) using five different clay content (in the range of 1.0-5.0 wt % of total monomer concentration) at 25 °C were presented and discussed. FTIR spectra, XRD patterns, SEM photographs, and network parameters of the samples indicated that the presence of COOH groups on EDTA molecules was resulted in the formation of exfoliated structures and the activity of EDTA/KPS redox pair was higher than those of TEMED/KPS and EDTA/Ce (IV) pairs. The compression moduli (G) of the hydrogels initiated with EDTA/Ce(IV) redox pair showed smooth and continual changings with increase in Na⁺MMT content (for swelling equilibrium at 25 °C) on the contrary of EDTA/KPS and TEMED/KPS pairs. It might be related to low initiator efficiency of cerium ammonium nitrate than KPS molecules, having higher effective crosslinking density with increasing clay content. On the other hand, the G moduli of NIPAAm/Na⁺MMT hydrogels (above their phase transition temperature) initiated with TEMED/KPS redox pair were higher than the others because of the more hydrophobic nature of TEMED molecules. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacrylamides 3aammonium nitrate 3aceric ammonium nitrate 3aclay fraction 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3amontmorillonite 3aphase transition 3aphotographs 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aGökçeören, Argun Talat1 aErbil, Candan0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 June 15, v. 48, no. 12 p.1256-1264dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.220113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03008naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002200167245008800189300001800277500002400295500001500319520151100334650001901845650002401864650002001888650001201908650002001920650001601940650001301956650001601969650002301985650001102008650001802019650001602037650001502053653002902068653001002097653000902107653001002116653002302126653001902149700001702168700001802185773009602203852000902299856008902308930003302397945002502430946001102455655001202466IND4426503720221120201314.0090925e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442650372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aOzge Ozkoc, Semin14aThe effects of gums on macro and micro-structure of breads baked in different ovens  ap. 2182-2189.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, the effects of gums on macro and micro-structure of breads baked in different ovens (infrared (IR)-microwave combination and conventional) were investigated by the help of image and SEM analysis, respectively. The gums used were xanthan, guar, @k-carrageenan and xanthan-guar blend. The gums were added to the formulation at 0.5% concentration. As a control, no gum added formulations were used. Results of Image analysis demonstrated that xanthan-guar gum blend addition improved bread quality with increasing pore area fractions. It was seen that about 75% of the pores of control breads baked in infrared-microwave combination oven and about 63% of the pores of control breads baked in conventional oven had diameters of above 1000 @mm. According to SEM analysis, pores in control breads baked in conventional oven were found to be smaller, and had spherical, oval-like shape as compared to the ones baked in IR-microwave combination oven. Moreover, more homogeneous closed-cell structure was observed for conventionally baked control breads. The pores of breads baked in IR-microwave combination oven were so close to each other which resulted in coalescence of the gas cells to form channels, then the pores were no longer spherical. The starch granules in conventionally baked breads were more distorted and seen as a continuous sheet of gelatinized starch. On the other hand, granular residues and continuous starch structure was observed together in IR-microwave combination heating. 3amicrostructure 3abreadmaking quality 3astarch granules 3atexture 3amicrowave ovens 3acarrageenan 3aguar gum 3abreadmaking 3achemical structure 3abreads 3ablended foods 3axanthan gum 3adimensions 0ainfrared-microwave ovens 0aovens 0agums 0apores 0aconventional ovens 0amacrostructure1 aSumnu, Gulum1 aSahin, Serpil0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2182-2189dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01818naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010100126300001400227520081800241650000901059650001001068650001301078650002401091650002001115650003901135650002701174651001801201653002401219653002401243653003501267700001501302773010001317852000901417939003301426946000901459655001201468IND9202832520221120191255.0920508e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920283252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, W.Y.10aDetermination of a variable price support schedule as applied to agricultural production control  ap. 26-32.  aAdoption of variable price support (VPS) schedules could be effective in controlling agricultural production and targeting program benefits to specific farm groups. The design of a VPS program would require determination of price schedules for farm-level production decisions that satisfy both farmer and program objectives. We applied a primal-dual mathematical programming model to the determination of a VPS program for production control of U.S. corn, wheat, and soybeans. We show that government program costs under the VPS program would decline to $15 billion from $26.8 billion under a comparably scaled mandatory production control program. The program benefits to a 120-acre farm would increase 80 percent to $18,000 from $10,000, while the benefits to a 2,500-acre farm would fall 82 percent to $40,000. 3acorn 3awheat 3asoybeans 3amathematical models 3adecision making 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aagricultural subsidies 3aUnited States 0aagricultural prices 0aproduction controls 0aprimal-dual porgramming models1 aHyberg, B.0 tJournal of agricultural economics research.g1991 Summer, v. 43, no. 3 p.26-32x1043-33097nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aUSDA 7aarticle01605naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005600127300001400183500001500197520061200212650002700824650002200851650002500873650002300898650002600921650003900947650002400986650002401010651001801034653001001052653004201062773010001104852000901204939003301213946000901246655001201255IND9202832620221120191251.0920508e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920283262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilkenny, M.10aNonfarm prospects under agricultural liberalization  ap. 33-43.  a2019-12-04  aWhat does the United States stand to gain from liberalizing international trade in agriculture?

  1 aYuan, X.10aAnalysis of the subgenomic RNAs and the small open reading frames of Beet black scorch virus  ap. 3077-3086.  a2019-12-05  aA full-length cDNA of the genome of Beet black scorch virus (BBSV), isolate Ningxia, was constructed and modified by site-directed mutagenesis to permit in vitro transcription of mutant viral RNAs. Two subgenomic (sg) RNAs (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) appeared during BBSV replication. Mutagenesis revealed that sgRNA1 transcription was initiated at G2209 within the P82 polymerase subunit open reading frame (ORF) and that transcription of sgRNA2 began at G2526 within the nested p7b/p5' ORF. Initiation-codon shifting or premature termination of translation of the three ORFs (P7a, P7b and P5') encoded by sgRNA1 indicated that each of the genes was required for localized movement, accumulation of viral RNAs and formation of local lesions on the leaves of Chenopodium amaranticolor. Microscopic observations of the distribution of green fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminal portion of the capsid protein provided additional evidence that the P7a, P7b and P5' proteins are each required for cell-to-cell movement. In contrast, elimination of sgRNA2 showed that the BBSV coat protein was not required for viral RNA accumulation or the appearance of local lesions on C. amaranticolor. In addition, disruption of the small P5 ORF previously predicted by computer analysis to originate at the C terminus of the P82 ORF had no effect on disease phenotype, suggesting that this ORF may represent a cryptic, non-essential gene. These results show that BBSV has a novel cell-to-cell movement protein organization that differs in size and sequence from that of other viruses. 3acoat proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aChenopodium giganteum 3atranscription (genetics) 3aNecrovirus 3aRNA 3ainfection 0amolecular sequence data 0aBeet black scorch virus 0aviral proteins 0asubgenomic RNA 0anucleotide sequences 0amovement protein1 aCao, Y.1 aXi, D.1 aGuo, L.1 aHan, C.1 aLi, D.1 aZhai, Y.1 aYu, J.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Oct., v. 87 p.3077-3086x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.81928-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100001300158245011700171300001800288500001500306520157100321650001801892650003001910650002701940650001401967650001001981650002501991650001802016650002202034650003502056651001202091651001302103653003502116653001302151653001902164653002102183773008002204852000902284856008202293930003302375945002502408946001102433655001202444IND4390704820221120182222.0070430e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439070482DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.81834-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHall, G.10aSelective constraint and genetic differentiation in geographically distant barley yellow dwarf virus populations  ap. 3067-3075.  a2019-12-05  aNumerous studies have documented molecular variability in plant virus populations, but few have assessed the relative contribution of natural selection and genetic drift in generating the observed pattern of diversity. To this end, gene function, environment and phylogenetic history were examined to observe the effect on genetic diversity and population structure of the PAV and PAS species of Barley yellow dwarf virus (family Luteoviridae). Three functional classes of gene were analysed: transcription-related (RdRp), structural (CP) and movement-related (MP). The results indicate that there were no inherent differences, in terms of total diversity or diversity at synonymous or non-synonymous nucleotide sites, between functional classes of genes or populations. Rather, selective constraints on a gene may be more or less relaxed depending on its function and the phylogenetic history of the population sampled. The CP of the PAS species, but not the PAV species, was differentiated genetically between regions. This is probably due to genetic drift, as there was no evidence that any gene deviated from a neutral model of evolution or is under positive selection. In general, the MP was under considerably less functional constraint than structural or replication-related proteins and four positively selected codon sites were identified. Mutations at these sites differentiate species and geographical subpopulations, so presumably they have aided the virus in adaptation to its host environment and contributed to intra- and interspecies diversification. 3acoat proteins 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3ageographical variation 3aphylogeny 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aMorocco 3aNew York 0atranscription-related proteins 0amutation 0aviral proteins 0amovement protein0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Oct., v. 87 p.3067-3075x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.81834-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03076naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072001700156072001700173100002000190245010500210300001600315520136800331650002101699650001601720650001001736650001801746650002201764650002601786650001001812650001601822650001601838650003201854650001701886650001501903650001001918650005901928650003301987650001102020650001102031650002102042650003102063650001002094653003202104700001702136700002502153773015202178852000902330856007702339930003302416945002502449946001302474990002302487655001202510IND4409684120221120182058.0080830e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440968412DNAL7 a184330262pmid7 a10.1002/eat.205262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWade, Tracey D.14aThe eating disorder examination: Norms and construct validity with young and middle adolescent girls  ap. 551-558.  aOBJECTIVE:: The purpose of this investigation was to examine the norms and construct validity of the eating disorder examination (EDE) with young and middle adolescent girls. METHOD:: The EDE was completed with 699 female twins aged 12-15 years. Four aspects of construct validation were examined: a factor analysis, internal reliability of the subscales, differences across the different age groups, and correlations between the variables. Results were reported separately for Twin 1 and 2 in order to examine the stability of the findings. RESULTS:: The factor structure of the EDE was unstable, except for an eight-item derived weight and shape concern subscale. This scale, along with the total score and the shape concern subscale had good internal reliability. The cognitive diagnostic items performed strongly in terms of discriminating between age groups and presence of disordered eating. CONCLUSION:: Given the central role of weight and shape concern and the importance of weight and shape in diagnosis and predicting onset of disordered eating, it would appear that the EDE is likely to perform well as both a diagnostic and predictive tool. Caution should be exercised with respect to the use and interpretation of the individual subscales in nonclinical populations of young adolescent girls. © 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In comparison, mechanical action from chewing flavourless gum and the stimulation from sucking a mint also stimulate high flow rates of saliva, although it is significantly less elastic than that from acid-based stimuli. However, the viscosity of human whole mouth saliva is relatively insensitive to beverage type, chewing, or mint. It is speculated that the stimulation of highly elastic saliva in response to acidic beverages is a defence mechanism for protecting the teeth from acid erosion. A separate sensory panel was used to identify key mouthfeel attributes that are likely to be related to the response of saliva, including: tongue dryness, mouth moistness, amount of saliva, tongue sensation, and throat drying. These results indicate that saliva viscoelasticity and flow rate alter dramatically in response to what a consumer eats and drinks, and that this in turn may affect mouthfeel and other organoleptic properties. 3amouthfeel 3aviscoelasticity 3aacidity 3aelasticity (mechanics) 3amastication 3aviscosity 3asalivation 3asaliva 3abeverages 0asensory properties1 aWantling, Emma1 aStokes, Jason R.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2261-2269dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20091209b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02586naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100002300158245011400181300001800295520143200313650002301745650002201768650001901790650002501809650001601834650002501850653004101875700001701916700001801933700002101951773008001972852000902052856008202061930003302143945002502176946001102201655001202212IND4390709220221120160820.0070430e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439070922DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.82153-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKarakasiliotis, I.10aFeline calicivirus replication: requirement for polypyrimidine tract-binding protein is temperature-dependent  ap. 3339-3347.  aThe interaction of host-cell nucleic acid-binding proteins with the genomes of positive-stranded RNA viruses is known to play a role in the translation and replication of many viruses. To date, however, the characterization of similar interactions with the genomes of members of the family Caliciviridae has been limited to in vitro binding analysis. In this study, Feline calicivirus (FCV) has been used as a model system to identify and characterize the role of host-cell factors that interact with the viral RNA. It was demonstrated that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts specifically with the 5' sequences of the FCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Using RNA interference it was shown that PTB is required for efficient FCV replication in a temperature-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTB resulted in a 15- to 100-fold reduction in virus titre, as well as a concomitant reduction in viral RNA and protein synthesis at 32 °C. In addition, virus-induced cytopathic effect was significantly delayed as a result of an siRNA-mediated reduction in PTB levels. A role for PTB in the calicivirus life cycle was more apparent at temperatures above and below 37 °C, fitting with the hypothesis that PTB functions as an RNA chaperone, potentially aiding the folding of RNA into functional structures. This is the first functional demonstration of a host-cell protein interacting with a calicivirus RNA. 3aFeline calicivirus 3avirus replication 3aviral proteins 3aRNA-binding proteins 3atemperature 3amolecular chaperones 0apolypyrimidine tract-binding protein1 aChaudhry, Y.1 aRoberts, L.O.1 aGoodfellow, I.G.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Nov., v. 87 p.3339-3347x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.82153-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02938naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001900175245006100194300001800255500001500273520161100288650001201899650001501911650001001926650003501936650002501971650001201996650002502008650002202033650001102055651001802066653001302084653001302097653001002110653002102120700001702141700001902158700001302177700001402190773008002204852000902284856008202293930003302375945002502408946001102433655001202444IND4390707820221120151601.0070430e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439070782DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.81779-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSaunders, G.C.10aPrP genotypes of atypical scrapie cases in Great Britain  ap. 3141-3149.  a2019-12-05  aGreat Britain and elsewhere have detected atypical scrapie infection in sheep with PrP genotypes thought to be genetically resistant to the classical form of scrapie. DNA sequencing of the PrP gene of British atypical scrapie cases (n=69), classical scrapie cases (n=59) and scrapie-free controls (n=138) was undertaken to identify whether PrP variants, other than the three well-characterized polymorphic codons, influenced susceptibility to atypical scrapie infection. Four non-synonymous changes, M112T, M137T, L141F and P241S, were detected that are most probably associated with the A136R154Q171 haplotype. Only the PrP variant containing a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 141 was found to be associated more commonly with the atypical scrapie cases. In addition to the single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the ARQ allele, two out of nine atypical scrapie cases with the ARR/ARR genotype were found to contain a 24 bp insertion, leading to an additional octapeptide repeat. In terms of PrP genetics, one classification of the GB scrapie cases examined in this study would place animals carrying any homozygous or heterozygous combination of ARR, AHQ or AF141RQ alleles, or any one of these alleles when paired with ARQ, as being susceptible to atypical scrapie infection, and animals heterozygous or homozygous for VRQ or homozygous for ARQ as being susceptible to classical scrapie disease. The AHQ PrP allele was associated with the highest incidence of atypical scrapie (263 per 100 000 alleles), whilst VRQ was associated with the lowest incidence (10 per 100 000 alleles). 3aalleles 3ahaplotypes 3asheep 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aamino acid sequences 3ascrapie 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3aprions 3aGreat Britain 0amutation 0agenotype 0agenes 0aatypical scrapie1 aCawthraw, S.1 aMountjoy, S.J.1 aHope, J.1 aWindl, O.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Nov., v. 87 p.3141-3149x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.81779-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle04219naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002000185245016800205300001600373500002400389500001500413520241400428650002002842650001602862650001502878650001502893650002402908650002002932650001502952650001702967650002002984650001303004650001303017650001103030650001503041650001203056650003503068650001103103650004903114650004003163650003503203653001803238700001703256700003203273700001703305700001603322700001603338773009703354852000903451856008803460930003303548945002503581946001103606655001203617IND4426510520221120151449.0090925e20091014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442651052DNAL7 a196158222pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8221 aYazwinski, T.A.10aFecal egg count reduction and control trial determinations of anthelmintic efficacies for several parasiticides utilizing a single set of naturally infected calves  ap. 232-241.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, a single set of naturally infected calves was used for the conduct of a fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) immediately followed by a control trial; all, to evaluate the efficacies of several commonly used, non-generic anthelmintics. Ten animals were allocated into each of the five treatment groups; untreated control (UTC), injectable 1% moxidectin given at 0.2mgkg⁻¹ BW (MXD), injectable 1% ivermectin given at 0.2mgkg⁻¹ BW (IVM), 9.06% oxfendazole given orally at 4.5mgkg⁻¹ BW (OXF), and 10.0% fenbendazole given orally at 5.0mgkg⁻¹ BW (FBZ). Confinement of animals to clean, concrete-floored pens was initiated on day -7 and continued until animal necropsy (2 animals were necropsied per treatment group per day on days 35-39 for nematode collections). All treatments were given on day 0, and the FECRT was conducted on all animals until necropsy. From days 2 to 14, FECR %'s for the combined strongyle egg counts were >=90% for all anthelmintic groups. At the time of necropsy, FECRT %'s for the combined strongyle egg counts continued to be >=90% for all treatments with the exception of IVM (84%). After adjustment of the strongyle egg counts in accordance with coproculture larvae percentages, FECRT %'s at the time of necropsy for Haemonchus, Ostertagia and Cooperia were found to be >=94% for MXD and OXF, but <90% for FBZ (Ostertagia) and IVM (Haemonchus and Cooperia). At necropsy, more than six of the ten untreated animals were infected with Ostertagia ostertagi (adults, EL₄ and LL₄), and adult Haemonchus placei, Trichostrongylus axei, Cooperia oncophora, C. surnabada and C. punctata. Based on geometric means: all of the above populations were removed by >=96% by MXD; were removed by >=90% by IVM except for O. ostertagi LL₄ (81.9%), C. oncophora and C. surnabada adults (77.4%) and C. punctata adults (84.8%); were removed by >=90% by OXF except for O. ostertagi adults, EL₄ and LL₄ (89.9, 70.2 and 48.1%, respectively); and were removed by >=90% by FBZ except for O. ostertagi adults, EL₄ and LL₄ (72.5, 0.0 and 21.9%, respectively). Judging from the above data, FECR and control trial results can be extremely similar given the proper experimentation and, despite varied degrees of nematode resistance, targeted nematode burdens commonly carried by Midwestern beef cattle are effectively removed by the parasiticides that are available today. 3acattle diseases 3aoxfendazole 3aivermectin 3aOstertagia 3anematode infections 3adrug evaluation 3amoxidectin 3afenbendazole 3afecal egg count 3anecropsy 3aCooperia 3acalves 3aHaemonchus 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aHelminthiasis, Animalxdrug therapy 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 0aanthelmintics1 aTucker, C.A.1 aPowell, J.q(James),d1932-1 aReynolds, J.1 aHornsby, P.1 aJohnson, Z.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2009 Oct. 14, v. 164, no. 2-4 p.232-241dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.06.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/11/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01127naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245012600133300001600259520022000275650002700495650001300522651001000535653006200545653002500607653002700632700003100659773007400690852000900764939003300773945000800806946001100814655001200825991618196440742620221120134641.0840323s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840018182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, I.10aNew contributions on parasitic coccidia of the hepatic region of Glossobalanus minutus Kow.

For the in vitro studies, filter paper contact bioassays were used to test the oils and their lethal activities were compared with that of d-phenothrin. Four minutes post-treatment, the median lethal concentration, LC50, values were 2.74, 7.28, 12.35, 18.67 and 22.79% for camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), onion (Allium cepa), peppermint (Mentha piperita), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and rosemary oils (Rosmarinus officinalis), respectively, whereas for d-phenothrin, it was 1.17%. The lethal time (50) (LT50) values were 0.89, 2.75, 15.39, 21.32, 11.60 and 1.94min after treatment with 7.5% camphor, onion, peppermint, chamomile, rosemary and d-phenothrin, respectively. All the materials used except rosemary, which was not applied, were ovicidal to the eggs of H. tuberculatus. Despite the results of the in vitro assays, the in vivo treatments revealed that the pediculicidal activity was more pronounced with oils. All treated lice were killed after 0.5-2min, whereas with d-phenothrin, 100% mortality was reached only after 120min. The number of lice infesting buffaloes was significantly reduced 3, 6, 4, 6 and 9 days after treatment with camphor, peppermint, chamomile, onion, and d-phenothrin, respectively. Moreover, the oils and d-phenothrin significantly repelled flies, Musca domestica, Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematobia irritans and Hippobosca equina, for 6 and 3 days post-treatment, respectively. No adverse effects were noted on either animals or pour-on operators after exposure to the applied materials. Consequently, some Egyptian essential oils show potential for the development of new, speedy and safe lousicides and insect repellents for controlling lice and flies which infest water buffaloes. 3abuffaloes 3aHaematopinus tuberculatus 3aMusca domestica 3aessential oils 3ainsect repellents 3aovicides 3aphenothrin 3abioassays 3ain vitro studies 3aCinnamomum camphora 3aAllium cepa 3aMentha piperita 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3aHaematobia irritans 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloes 2aInsect Repellentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aLice Infestationsxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aMyiasisxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxpharmacology. 3aEgypt 0aEgyptxepidemiology. 0alousicides 0aMatricaria chamomilla 0aHippobosca equina1 aRamadan, Mohamed Y.1 aEl-Madawy, Reham S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2009 Oct. 14, v. 164, no. 2-4 p.257-266dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.06.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/11/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02907naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100002600192245009200218300001600310500001500326520144000341650002701781650001901808650001301827650002601840650002501866650001301891650001701904650001201921650001401933650002501947650004001972650002402012650002202036650001702058651001402075653002202089653001802111653001502129700001802144773007002162852000902232856007902241930003302320945002502353946001102378655001202389IND4409707020221120134657.0080902e20080207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970702DNAL7 a182566702pmid7 a10.1038/nature065032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aClark, Christopher M.10aLoss of plant species after chronic low-level nitrogen deposition to prairie grasslands  ap. 712-715.  a2019-12-04  aRates of atmospheric deposition of biologically active nitrogen (N) are two to seven times the pre-industrial rates in many developed nations because of combustion of fossil fuels and agricultural fertilization. They are expected to increase similarly over the next 50 years in industrializing nations of Asia and South America. Although the environmental impacts of high rates of nitrogen addition have been well studied, this is not so for the lower, chronic rates that characterize much of the globe. Here we present results of the first multi-decadal experiment to examine the impacts of chronic, experimental nitrogen addition as low as 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 above ambient atmospheric nitrogen deposition (6 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at our site). This total input rate is comparable to terrestrial nitrogen deposition in many industrialized nations. We found that this chronic low-level nitrogen addition rate reduced plant species numbers by 17% relative to controls receiving ambient N deposition. Moreover, species numbers were reduced more per unit of added nitrogen at lower addition rates, suggesting that chronic but low-level nitrogen deposition may have a greater impact on diversity than previously thought. A second experiment showed that a decade after cessation of nitrogen addition, relative plant species number, although not species abundances, had recovered, demonstrating that some effects of nitrogen addition are reversible. 3aatmospheric deposition 3asoil pollution 3anitrogen 3abotanical composition 3aenvironmental impact 3aprairies 2aBiodiversity 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlantsxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 3aMinnesota 0aspecies diversity 0aplant ecology 0agrasslands1 aTilman, David0 tNature.g2008 Feb. 7, v. 451, no. 7179 p.712-715x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature065033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090112b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245005400171300001400225500002400239520112900263650003401392650001501426650001301441650001701454650001601471650001701487650000901504650001001513650002401523650002701547650001901574650001501593650001301608650002201621650001401643650001801657650001501675650002901690700001801719700002701737700002001764700002201784773009701806852000901903856004801912655001201960IND4415158720221120130445.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441515872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-008-9193-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Marchis, Francesca10aGenetic transformation of the sugar beet plastome  ap. 17-30.  aIncludes references  aIt is very important for the application of chloroplast engineering to extend the range of species in which this technology can be achieved. Here, we describe the development of a chloroplast transformation system for the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris, Sugar Beet Group) by biolistic bombardment of leaf petioles. Homoplasmic plastid-transformed plants of breeding line Z025 were obtained. Transformation was achieved using a vector that targets genes to the rrn16/rps12 intergenic region of the sugar beet plastome, employing the aadA gene as a selectable marker against spectinomycin and the gfp gene for visual screening of plastid transformants. gfp gene transcription and protein expression were shown in transplastomic plants. Detection of GFP in Comassie blue-stained gels suggested high GFP levels. Microscopy revealed GFP fluorescence within the chloroplasts. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering the sugar beet chloroplast genome; this technology provides new opportunities for the genetic improvement of this crop and for social acceptance of genetically modified sugar beet plants. 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3abiolistics 3abreeding 3achloroplasts 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3agels 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic transformation 3aintergenic DNA 3amicroscopy 3apetioles 3aprotein synthesis 3ascreening 3aspectinomycin 3asugar beet 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWang, Yongxin1 aStevanato, Piergiorgio1 aArcioni, Sergio1 aBellucci, Michele0 tTransgenic research.g2009 Feb., v. 18, no. 1 p.17-30dSpringer Netherlandsx0962-88197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-008-9193-4 7aarticle02987naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001900162245010800181300001600289500001500305520162100320650001901941650003101960650002001991650002502011650002002036650002302056650002302079653001002102653002602112653002402138653001602162653001602178653002302194700002302217700002002240700003002260773007602290852000902366856008502375930003302460945002502493946001102518655001202529IND4409706920221120130305.0080902s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970692DNAL7 a10.1108/000707008108779242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTenbult, Petra10aIntuitive and explicit reactions towards “new” food technologies: Attitude strength and familiarity  ap. 622-625.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose -- New food technologies are of increasing importance but not a lot of research into how people react to these technologies has been conducted. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into how implicit measurements in addition to explicit measurements give insight into how well an attitude towards a food concept, in relation to its familiarity, is predictive for behaviour. Design/methodology/approach -- An implicit measurement (EAST) and an explicit questionnaire were used to investigate people's attitudes and attitude strength towards two food technologies (genetic modification and organic production). Correlations between the two measurements were calculated to determine whether familiar food technologies are more predictive for behaviour than relatively unfamiliar food technologies. Findings -- Implicit measurements showed negative associations with genetic modification. Explicit measurements showed neutral associations with genetic modification. In contrast, implicit and explicit measurements showed positive associations with organic production. When a food technology is well known (e.g. organic production), significant correlations between the two measurements were present suggesting that attitudes were predictive for behaviour. In contrast, when a food technology is not well known (e.g. genetic modification), significant correlations were not present suggesting that attitudes were not predictive for behaviour. Originality/value -- This is the first study to examine the relation between intuitive and explicit reactions in relation with the novelty of food technologies. 3aquestionnaires 3agenetically modified foods 3afood processing 3aconsumer preferences 3afood production 3aconsumer attitudes 3aorganic production 0afoods 0anew food technologies 0aintuitive reactions 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aexplicit reactions1 aVries, Nanne K. de1 aDreezens, Ellen1 aMartijn, Alida Catharina.0 tBritish food journal.g2008, v. 110, no. 6-7 p.622-625x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707008108779243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03085naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001800196245008200214300001400296500017600310500001500486520163900501650002302140650002002163650001702183650002102200650002202221650001602243650002502259650001702284650002102301650002102322651001402343653001902357653001602376773007202392852000902464856008502473930003302558945002502591946001102616655001202627IND4409709420221120130254.0080902s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970942DNAL7 a10.1108/000707008108447772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lindgreen and M. Hingley.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose -- The purpose of this paper is to identify and explain the triggers and processes of value creation in Australia's chicken meat supply chains. This industry was chosen as the critical case due to the rapid rise in poultry meat consumption in western markets. This study addresses the lack of understanding about the transformation of agri-food supply chains to provide a chronological and historical explanation of patterns of value creation in this industry. Design/methodology/approach -- A historical case study approach was chosen. Multiple primary and secondary sources were collated and analysed to describe events in narrative form. Findings -- Analysis of the patterns of value creation revealed four major phases in the evolution of Australia's chicken meat supply chains. In each phase a dominant form of value creation was identified and the triggers that facilitated the transition between phases are described. Research limitations/implications -- As the study is confined to a single industry, further research in other settings is needed to verify the patterns described. Since agri-food supply chains are dynamic they should be continuously monitored to identify trends that resemble previous triggers and processes, or manifest as novel ones. Originality/value -- This study takes a historical perspective to identify the triggers and patterns of value creation in Australia's chicken meat supply chains. A schema of phases of value creation is offered that can potentially be applied by practitioners in other industries to diagnose the possible outcomes of prior events and actions by supply chain members. 3atemporal variation 3aeconomic trends 3achicken meat 3afood consumption 3afood availability 3avalue added 3aagricultural history 3acase studies 3ahuman food chain 3apoultry industry 3aAustralia 0avalue creation 0afood supply0 tBritish food journal.g2008, v. 110, no. 1 p.26-41x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707008108447773Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02234naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245009700180300001600277500001500293520064800308650001400956650001300970650001300983650002000996650002601016650000901042650002501051650001601076650001301092650001501105650001601120650002301136650001901159650002501178650001901203650001501222653002001237653001401257653002201271700001901293700001701312700001701329700001601346773012101362852000901483856008201492930003301574945002501607946001301632990002301645655001201668IND4388883220221120130423.0070312e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438888322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A stochastic optimization using EPIC data maximized expected utility of 100 years' worth of net revenues for a quarter section. Phosphorus accumulation was more likely with the CPS than with the SDI but soil nitrogen was constant under both systems. SDI conserves more water than CPS per acre but depletes the aquifer faster because a greater area is irrigated. These results were invariant in the sensitivity analysis. 3aeffluents 3aZea mays 3anitrogen 3afarm management 3asubsurface irrigation 3acorn 3asprinkler irrigation 3afarm income 3aaquifers 3aphosphorus 3afertigation 3aeconometric models 3asoil fertility 3astochastic processes 3arisk reduction 3apig manure 0arisk management 0awater use 0aaquifer depletion1 aStoecker, A.L.1 aEpplin, F.M.1 aHattey, J.A.1 aKizer, M.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and applied economics.g2006 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.645-658wJournal:jnl50907x1074-07087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agecon.uga.edu/~jaae/jaae.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/06  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03319naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100001600175245007200191300001600263500001500279520142700294650002501721650001801746650002201764650001901786650002201805650002301827650002001850650001901870650006101889650005301950650004802003650002702051650004902078650004502127650004202172653001702214653001902231653002202250653004102272700001902313700001902332700001702351700001802368700001802386700001602404700001802420700002002438700001902458773007102477852000902548856007902557930003302636945002502669946001102694655001202705IND4409707420221120130349.0080902e20080214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440970742DNAL7 a182730192pmid7 a10.1038/nature065452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKwon, Chian10aCo-option of a default secretory pathway for plant immune responses  ap. 835-840.  a2019-12-04  aCell-autonomous immunity is widespread in plant-fungus interactions and terminates fungal pathogenesis either at the cell surface or after pathogen entry. Although post-invasive resistance responses typically coincide with a self-contained cell death of plant cells undergoing attack by parasites, these cells survive pre-invasive defence. Mutational analysis in Arabidopsis identified PEN1 syntaxin as one component of two pre-invasive resistance pathways against ascomycete powdery mildew fungi. Here we show that plasma-membrane-resident PEN1 promiscuously forms SDS-resistant soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes together with the SNAP33 adaptor and a subset of vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs). PEN1-dependent disease resistance acts in vivo mainly through two functionally redundant VAMP72 subfamily members, VAMP721 and VAMP722. Unexpectedly, the same two VAMP proteins also operate redundantly in a default secretory pathway, suggesting dual functions in separate biological processes owing to evolutionary co-option of the default pathway for plant immunity. The disease resistance function of the secretory PEN1-SNAP33-VAMP721/722 complex and the pathogen-induced subcellular dynamics of its components are mechanistically reminiscent of immunological synapse formation in vertebrates, enabling execution of immune responses through focal secretion. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aErysiphe pisi 3aBlumeria graminis 3apowdery mildew 3amembrane proteins 3adisease resistance 3aplasma membrane 3aplant proteins 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aN-Glycosyl Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aQa-SNARE Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSNARE Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPEN1 protein 0aSNARE proteins 0aErysiphe graminis 0avesicle-associated membrane proteins1 aNeu, Christina1 aPajonk, Simone1 aYun, Hye Sup1 aLipka, Ulrike1 aHumphry, Matt1 aBau, Stefan1 aStraus, Marco1 aKwaaitaal, Mark1 aRampelt, Heike0 tNature.g2008 Feb. 14, v. 451, no. 7180 p.835-840x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature065453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03781naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001600168245011400184300001600298500001500314520159300329650001001922650001501932650003301947650001401980650001301994650001402007650001802021650001402039650001202053650002702065650003402092650001202126650002902138650002602167650002002193650003202213650002902245650002602274650001102300650002702311650002902338650000902367650000902376650002302385650002102408650002802429650002402457650001402481650003902495650002802534653001702562653000802579653001602587700002302603700002002626773014402646852000902790856008902799856008902888930003302977945002503010946001303035990002303048655001203071IND4383114120221120130426.0060827e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438311412DNAL7 a167752252pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod.106.0532232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjduk, Anna10aSperm Chromatin Remodeling after Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection Differs from That of In Vitro Fertilization  ap. 442-451.  a2019-12-05  aIntracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a popular method used in assisted conception, and live offspring have been born from a variety of species, including humans. In ICSI, sperm chromatin is introduced into the oocyte together with the acrosome, a structure that does not enter the oocyte during normal fertilization. We compared sperm chromatin remodeling, the potential of embryos to develop in vitro, and DNA synthesis in mouse embryos obtained from in vitro fertilization (IVF) and ICSI. We also tested whether sperm pretreatment prior to ICSI (i.e., capacitation, acrosome reaction, membrane removal, and reduction of disulfide bonds in protamines) facilitates chromatin remodeling and affects embryo development. Sperm chromatin was examined on air-dried, Giemsa-stained preparations at 30-min intervals for up to 4.5 h postfertilization. In all experimental groups, the oocytes underwent activation and formed pronuclei with similar rates. However, the dynamics of sperm chromatin remodeling in ICSI and IVF embryos varied. In ICSI, chromatin remodeling was more asynchronous than in IVF. Sperm capacitation prior to injection enhanced remodeling asynchrony and resulted in delayed pronuclei formation and DNA synthesis. The removal of the acrosome prior to injection with calcium ionophore A23187 but not with detergent Triton X-100 allowed more synchronous chromatin remodeling, timely DNA synthesis, and good embryo development. Our data have significance for the refinement of the molecular and biologic mechanisms associated with ICSI for current and future applications. 3aA-DNA 3apronucleus 3afertilization (reproduction) 3ainjection 3aacrosome 3achromatin 3aembryogenesis 3asynthesis 3aoocytes 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAcrosome Reactionxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCalcimycinxpharmacology 2aChromatinxphysiology 2aColoring Agents 2aDNA Replicationxphysiology 2aDetergentsxpharmacology 2aEmbryonic Development 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aIonophoresxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aOctoxynolxpharmacology 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aSperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0acapacitation 0aDNA 0aspermatozoa1 aYamauchi, Yasuhiro1 aWard, Monika A.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g2006 Sept., v. 75, no. 3 p.442-451dSociety for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.106.0532233Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.106.0532233Available from publisher's Web site  a20110315b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeRSC 2011/0  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02419naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245006900168300001600237500002400253520140600277650001001683650001201693650002601705650001601731650000901747650002001756650000901776650001201785700001601797700002501813700001801838773014701856852000902003856005702012655001202069IND4451019320221120130321.0110320e19980112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445101932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.1998.tb00336.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCifre, J.10aPerformance of a hyperprolific rabbit line I. Litter size traits  ap. 131-138.  aIncludes references  aSUMMARY: Litter size traits of a maternal line of meat rabbits, line H, founded by selecting on hyperprolificacy, were studied to check its prolificacy. Due to health problems related to the putting together of animals with different origins and to the genetic heterogeneity of the commercial population from which the new line (line H) was founded, line H was compared to the best maternal line available (line V) and with crossbred does (A × V) of high litter size. The comparison took place on four farms and involved 858 females. The analysis of litter size traits showed that line H had superior prolificacy compared with crossbred females and the average of line V and crossbred females, which was around 0.5-0.8 young (p < 0.05). The contrasts between line H and line V were always favourable to line H, by around 0.5 pups, but were not significant (p = 0.06). The differences between the two lines, however, changed with parity order: they were null for first and second parity but reached values of one young and even more for superior parity orders. The differences in prolificacy did not have consequences on the fertility of the females as there were no differences in kindling interval for the animals studied. It can be concluded that hyperprolific selection has been successful in rabbits, and the new line could play an important role as a maternal line in rabbit production for meat. 3afarms 3afemales 3agenetic heterogeneity 3alitter size 3ameat 3ameat production 3apups 3arabbits1 aBaselga, M.1 aGarcía-Ximénez, F.1 aVicente, J.S.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g1998 Jan. 12, v. 115, no. 1-6 p.131-138dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1998.tb00336.x 7aarticle01390naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024002200115040001800137100001600155245011900171300001600290520023400306650001200540650001700552650002500569650002600594650001100620650002200631650001100653650002600664650000900690650002300699650002500722653003500747700001400782700002100796773010200817852000900919939003300928945000800961946001100969655001200980991618194580742620221120114639.0840322e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017752DNAL7 a68865872pmid7 aPMC10522812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, B.L.12aA stochastic model of malaria transition rates from longitudinal data: Considering the risk of "lost to follow-up"  ap. 153-156.  asimple stochastic model for studying human malaria transition probabilities and estimating daily malaria parasite incidence and recovery rates from follow-up data while considering patients "lost to follow-up" as a competing risk 3amalaria 3aepidemiology 3aprotozoal infections 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMalariaxepidemiology 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aStochastic Processes 0aMathematical models and theory1 aRay, S.K.1 aSrivastava, R.N.0 tJournal of epidemiology and community health.g1983 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.153-156x0143-005X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840322c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01784naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245012500155300001600280520037300296650002800669650001300697650002400710650002600734650001000760650001200770650002300782650001100805650003100816650005000847650000900897650000900906650002900915650004500944650005400989651001301043651001101056651001301067653002401080700001601104700001701120700001501137773007701152852000901229939003301238945000801271946001101279655001201290991618193760742620221120114608.0840322e198006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840017802DNAL7 a71859192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, D.H.H.13aAn accidental laboratory infection with African trypanosomes of a defined stock.

Biodiesel fuel is a renewable substitute fuel for petroleum diesel fuel made from vegetable or animal fats. Biodiesel fuel has better properties than that of petroleum diesel fuel such as renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. The purpose of the transesterification process is to lower the viscosity of the oil. The viscosity values of linseed oil methyl and ethyl esters highly decreases after transesterification process. The viscosity values of vegetable oils vary between 27.2 and 53.6 mm2 s-1, whereas those of vegetable oil methyl esters between 3.59 and 4.63 mm2 s-1. Compared with no. 2 diesel fuel, all of the vegetable oil methyl esters were slightly viscous. The flash point values of vegetable oil methyl esters are highly lower than those of vegetable oils. The transesterification of linseed oil in supercritical fluids such as methanol and ethanol has proved to be the most promising process. Methanol is the commonly used alcohol in this process, due in part to its low cost. Methyl esters of vegetable oils have several outstanding advantages among other new-renewable and clean engine fuel alternatives. The most important variables affecting the methyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil and reaction temperature. Biodiesel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification. 3abiodiesel 3alinseed oil 3abiological production 3amethanol 3aethanol 3aesters 3atransesterification 3asupercritical fluid extraction 0anon-catalytic supercritical fluids conditions0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.113-118dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.04.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02822naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245005200163300001600215500002400231520145100255650001601706650001301722650001201735650002601747650002501773650002401798650002101822650002401843650002301867650002301890650001001913650003701923650002501960650001101985650002601996651001302022653002202035700001802057773008602075852000902161856006402170930003302234945002502267946001302292990002302305655001202328IND4364707420221120095928.0040929e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436470742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGuenther, D.A.10aObservations of cattle use of prairie dog towns  ap. 410-417.  aSummary in Spanish.  aWe investigated the use of prairie dog towns by cattle (Bos taurus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado by conducting surveys of cattle and vegetation from June to August 1999. Cattle presence and behavior were recorded 3 times a week during driving surveys of 15 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. A subset of 3 pastures with prairie dog towns was intensively surveyed twice weekly wherein the habitat and activity of a randomly chosen focal animal was recorded every 6 minutes for 3.5 hours. Bite and step counts of other individuals were recorded for 5-minute intervals. Vegetation height and cover data were collected monthly on each of 6 habitats. Results from driving surveys and intensively surveyed pastures were similar; cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided prairie dog towns. Bare ground cover on prairie dog towns did not significantly differ from most other habitats, but vegetation on prairie dog towns was significantly shorter on (mean = 6.7 cm) than that off (mean = 11.9 cm) prairie dog towns. Nevertheless, foraging observations indicated that there was no significant difference between cattle foraging rates on swales (70.9 bites/min) and prairie dog towns (69.5 bites/min). Thus, cattle on the shortgrass steppe appear to use prairie dog towns in proportion to their availability and, while there, they graze as intensively as they do on habitats not inhabited by prairie dogs. 3abeef cattle 3aprairies 3agrazing 3abotanical composition 3aCynomys ludovicianus 3ahabitat preferences 3avegetation cover 3afeeding preferences 3aBouteloua gracilis 3aPascopyrum smithii 3aCarex 3aAristida purpurea var. longiseta 3aSphaeralcea coccinea 3aVulpia 3aBouteloua dactyloides 3aColorado 0ashortgrass steppe1 aDetling, J.K.0 tJournal of range management.g2003 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.410-417x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/10/05  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03841naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245007900162300001400241500002400255520234000279650002302619650001102642650001802653650002202671650002302693650002602716650002202742650001302764650001402777650002302791650002502814650001502839650001002854650001202864650002302876650002102899651001102920653002002931653001502951653001602966700001902982700001803001700001803019773008303037852000903120856006403129930003303193945002503226946001303251990002303264655001203287IND4364735720221120085829.0040930e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436473572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHickman, K.R.10aGrazing management effects on plant species diversity in tallgrass prairie  ap. 58-65.  aSummary in Spanish.  aA 6-year study was conducted in tallgrass prairie to assess the effects of grazing management (cattle stocking densities and grazing systems) on plant community composition and diversity. Treatments included sites grazed season-long (May to October) at 3 stocking densities (3.8, 2.8, and 1.8 hectares per animal unit), ungrazed control sites, and sites under a late-season rest rotation grazing system at this same range of stocking densities. Plant communities were sampled twice each season using a nearest-point procedure. Native plant species diversity, species richness, and growth form diversity were significantly higher in grazed compared to ungrazed prairie, and diversity was greatest at the highest stocking density. This enhancement of plant species diversity under grazing was not a result of increased frequency of weedy/exotic species. There were no significant effects of grazing system on plant diversity, nor any significant stocking density x grazing system interactions, indicating that animal density is a key management variable influencing plant species diversity and composition in tallgrass prairie and that effects of animal density override effects of grazing systems. Increasing cattle stocking densities decreased the abundance of the dominant perennial tall grasses, and increased abundance of the C4 perennial mid-grasses. The frequency of perennial forbs was relatively stable across grazing treatments. Abundance of annual forbs varied among years and grazing treatments. In half of the years sampled, annual forbs showed the highest frequency under intermediate stocking density. Patterns of responses among plant groups suggest that some species may respond principally to direct effects of grazers and others may respond to indirect effects of grazers on competitive relationships or on the spatial patterns of fuel loads and fires. Thus, this study suggests that large grazer densities, fire, and annual climatic variability interact to influence patterns of plant community composition and diversity in tallgrass prairie. Effects of varying management such as stocking densities and grazing systems on plant species diversity and the relative abundances of different plant growth forms or functional groups may have important consequences for grassland community stability and ecosystem function. 3aindigenous species 3acattle 3astocking rate 3agrazing intensity 3arotational grazing 3abotanical composition 3aplant communities 3aprairies 3aC4 plants 3aplant architecture 3aspatial distribution 3aperennials 3aforbs 3aannuals 3aprescribed burning 3arange management 3aKansas 0aspecies eveness 0amidgrasses 0atallgrasses1 aHartnett, D.C.1 aCochran, R.C.1 aOwensby, C.E.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.58-65x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3electronic resource  a20041012b20041101c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/10/12  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01704naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245009200189300001600281500002400297520055900321650001200880650002100892650001800913650002100931650002100952650001600973650001700989650001601006651001001022700001701032773008901049852000901138856009001147930003301237945002501270946001101295655001201306IND4426435220221120085934.0090925e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442643522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aK5901 aDas, Subhrabaran10aDistrict-level biomass resource assessment: A case study of an Indian State West Bengal  ap. 137-143.  aIncludes references  aWest Bengal is basically an agricultural-based state in India.

  1 aBai, Y.10aLandscape-level dynamics of grassland-forest transitions in British Columbia  ap. 66-75.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aGrasslands in the interior British Columbia of Canada are adjacent to forests and are susceptible to tree encroachment. Grazing, fire suppression, and climate variability are among factors affecting vegetation dynamics in the ecotone between grassland and forest, but topographic factors such as slope aspect, slope degree and elevation may interact with these factors and result in uneven changes in vegetation among landscape elements. Nine sites with a total of approximately 50,000 ha of grasslands and forests in the Cariboo/Chilcotin forest region of British Columbia were selected to study the effect of slope aspect, slope degree and elevation on vegetation distribution, dynamics and forest expansion from the 1960's to 1990's. Vegetation maps of the 1960's and 1990's were generated using aerial photos and overlaid with GIS layers including aspect, slope and elevation. The classification of open grassland, treed grassland, open forest and closed forest was based on the percent coverage of coniferous species, ranging from 0-5%, 5-15%, 15-35%, and > or = 35%, respectively. A probability index (P-value) was developed to test the effect of aspect, slope, and elevation on vegetation distribution, dynamics, and forest expansion based on the distribution and changed areas. Results show that open grasslands occurred on southerly aspects and the shift to treed grassland occurred mostly on these aspects. The probability of vegetation shift from open to treed grasslands decreased with increasing slope degree, probably due to the less favorable moisture regime on steep slopes. Treed grassland also shifted to open forest on south facing slopes and more level sites. In contrast, closed forest most often occurred on northerly facing slopes and the shift from open to closed forests was most likely to occur there. The greatest changes in vegetation cover types occurred at mid-elevations between 700 and 1,000 m. Management plans aimed at the control of tree encroachment and forest ingrowth should take these topographic factors into consideration. 3ageographical distribution 3alandscape ecology 3aecotones 3abotanical composition 3aecological succession 3aconiferous forests 3aforest communities 3aaltitude 3aoverstory 3agrasslands 3aBritish Columbia 0aplant communities 0aslope 0aforest encroachment 0aaspect1 aBroersma, K.1 aThompson, D.1 aRoss, T.J.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.66-75x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3electronic resource  a20041013b20041101c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/10/12  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02902naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245014200191300001600333500002400349520097800373650001301351650002301364650002501387650002301412650002301435650002001458650001501478650001401493650002101507650002001528650002901548650001701577650007401594650004601668650001801714650002301732650002501755650004201780650002101822650006501843650003901908650002801947650001401975650003001989650002702019650002702046700003202073700002502105700002002130773011002150852000902260856005502269655001202324IND4399979120221120074927.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439997912DNAL7 a181773712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01468.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlázquez, Blas10aIdentification and analysis of a glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase-encoding gene and its cognate transcriptional regulator from Azoarcus sp.

CIB was shown to encode a glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is essential for the anaerobic catabolism of many aromatic compounds and some alicyclic and dicarboxylic acids. The primary structure of the GcdH protein is highly conserved in many organisms. The divergently transcribed gcdR gene, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, accounts for the glutaconate/glutarate-specific activation of the Pg promoter driving expression of gcdH. The Azoarcus sp. CIBdgcdH mutant strain harbouring a disrupted gcdH gene was used as host to identify heterologous gcdH genes, such as that from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Moreover, the expression of gcdH from P. putida can be efficiently controlled by the GcdR activator in Azoarcus sp. CIB, demonstrating the existence of cross-talk between GcdR regulators and gcdH promoters from members of different phylogenetic subgroups of proteobacteria. 3aAzoarcus 3aPseudomonas putida 3aamino acid sequences 3aaromatic compounds 3adicarboxylic acids 3agene expression 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3apromoter regions 3aregulator genes 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAzoarcusxclassificationxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Regulator 2aGlutaryl-CoA Dehydrogenasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydrocarbons, Aromaticxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aCarmona Rodríguez, Manuel.1 aGarcía, José Luis.1 aDíaz, Eduardo.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.474-482dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01468.x 7aarticle02550naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245019300127300001600320520155400336650002101890650001601911650001401927650001001941650000901951650002801960650001201988650001702000650001302017700001502030773009902045852000902144930003302153945001302186946001302199655001202212IND2200352820221120074808.0990828e199902  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220035282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecherer, C.10aDistribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid-, proctolin-, Periplaneta hypertrehalosaemic hormone- and FMRF amide-like immunoreactivity in the visual ganglia of the spider Cupiennius salei Keys  ap. 267-275.  aAntisera to four substances were tested in the spider central nervous system and analyzed with special regard to the visual system. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-, proctolin, Periplaneta hypertrehalosaemic hormone and FMRFamide like immunoreactivity (Glir, Plir, PeaHTHlir and Flir, respectively) could be detected in the visual tracts (VT), interneurons and neuropiles of the spider brain. The four antisera reliably produced four different staining patterns one for each substance. Glir was found in the first- and the second-order visual neuropiles of the principal eyes and the visual tracts of principal and secondary eyes. Several layers of the third visual neuropile of the principal eyes were Glir, as were some large fibres in the third visual neuropile of the secondary eyes. Plir was found in three layers of the central body. The visual tracts of the secondary eyes were stained as well as the third visual neuropile of the secondary eyes. PeaHTHlir was found in the first visual neuropiles of all eyes and in the visual tract of the secondary eyes. Flir was found in the first visual neuropiles of all eyes and in all visual tracts. Nearly all layers of the third-order neuropile of the principal eyes were Flir. From behavioural experiments with spiders we know that different types of eyes serve different functions. Thus, it is probable, that the staining patterns of the four tested antisera indicate the existence of a neuronal substrate used for different functions in information processing between principal and secondary eyes. 3aCupiennius salei 3aPeriplaneta 3aantiserum 3abrain 3aeyes 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aganglia 3ainterneurons 3astaining1 aSchmid, A.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Feb., v. 122A, no. 2 p.267-275x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02002naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002200168245009700190300001600287500002400303520065900327650001400986650002601000650002701026650002401053650001001077650001101087650001301098650002101111650001401132650002701146650001401173650002001187653002101207653001501228700001301243700001901256773008901275852000901364856009001373930003301463945002501496946001101521655001201532IND4426435520221120074754.0090925e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442643552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aQ1031 aChung, Kyong-Hwan10aBiodiesel production by transesterification of duck tallow with methanol on alkali catalysts  ap. 155-158.  aIncludes references  aDuck tallow was employed as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel by transesterification with methanol.

Acid value, density, and kinematic viscosity of the biodiesel products also came up to the biodiesel qualities. 3abiodiesel 3abiological production 3afood processing wastes 3atransesterification 3aducks 3atallow 3amethanol 3aalkali treatment 3acatalysts 3afatty acid composition 3aviscosity 3aproduct quality 0aalkali catalysts 0afeedstocks1 aKim, Jin1 aLee, Ki Young.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.155-158dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245005000177300001300227500001500240520159300255650002001848650003201868650002001900650001501920650001801935650001701953650001701970650001101987650002301998650002002021651001302041651001802054653003702072653001302109653001602122653001702138653001702155653003202172653001702204700001802221773008702239852000902326856006002335930003302395945002502428946001302453990002302466655001202489IND4364622620221120064234.0040922s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436462262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCotugna, N.10aChildren rate the summer food service program  ap. 3-11.  a2019-12-05  aFood waste has been identified as an issue in the Summer Food Service Program. National studies conducted to identify the cause have typically questioned only program administrators and parents, not the children. We sought to determine reasons for plate waste from the children's perspective. Plate waste was assessed by direct observation, nutrient content was evaluated, and children were asked what a typical lunch at home might be. Children graded the menus and participated in either focus groups or individual interviews. A total of 203 individual interviews and two focus groups were completed. Results showed that more traditional menu items such as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches received higher marks than did trendy items such as wraps, tacos, and pita sandwiches. Taste appeared to be the dominant factor influencing how children rated a meal. Using the National School Lunch Program as a basis of comparison, we found that the meals as served met most Federal nutrition guidelines, but meals as consumed fell short in calcium, iron, and vitamin C for selected age groups. Based on what children reported they might eat at home if not participating in the Summer Food Service Program, we found that 18 percent of the children reported lunch meals that could be evaluated as inadequate. Food waste was estimated to be 38 percent of calories overall or 32 percent excluding condiments. This study provides a unique perspective on strategies to reduce plate waste, increase meal consumption, and improve nutrient intake of the participants in the Summer Food Service Program. 3anutrient intake 3aSummer Food Service Program 3aschool children 3afood waste 3amenu planning 3afood quality 3aschool lunch 3aflavor 3afood acceptability 3achild nutrition 3aDelaware 0aUnited States 0aUSDA food and nutrition programs 0achildren 0afood wastes 0afood choices 0aschool meals 0afood and nutrition programs 0ameals (menu)1 aVickery, C.E.0 tFamily economics and nutrition review.g2004, v. 16, no. 1 p.3-11x1085-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.usda.gov/cnpp/fenr.html3electronic resource  a20050628b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2005/06/28  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03143naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245004100143300001400184520193100198650002002129650001602149650001302165650002002178650001102198650002602209650001402235650001302249650002102262650001602283650000902299650001602308653002502324653001902349653002502368700001602393700002002409773007602429852000902505856011202514930003302626945002502659946001302684655001202697IND4364221720221120064329.0040901e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436422172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWomac, A.R.10aFoliar spray banding characteristics  ap. 37-44.  aFoliar spray banding was explored as a means of reducing pesticide use compared to broadcast applications. Various geometric spray patterns and delivery angles of foliar spray bands were investigated to increase spray deposits in a crop row at a constant spray rate of 94 L/ha. Wind-free laboratory results indicated that a banded application using three 65° hollow-cone nozzles, with a laser-measured volume median diameter (VMD) of 110 micrometer, resulted in the highest (p = 0.05) upper canopy coverage of water-sensitive paper (WSP) of 37%, compared to 31% for a broadcast, 80° flat-fan application (VMD = 152 micrometer). However, the fore-aft trajectory created by a twin-orifice nozzle (VMD = 135 micrometer) resulted in less upper canopy deposit and did not increase deposit in the lower canopy. No statistical differences were observed in lower canopy WSP coverage. Cumulative volume distributions (CVD) of deposit droplet spectra in the upper and lower canopy indicated that large droplets were deposited on WSP in the lower canopy. Field test results indicated that the broadcast, 80° flat-fan nozzle produced the numerically highest malathion residues of 7.5 ng/cm2 on leaf tops, but this was not statistically different (p = 0.05) from a banded 40° flat-fan nozzle application. Banded twin-orifice and three-nozzle hollow-cone treatments produced the statistically lowest (p = 0.05) leaf-top residues of <3 ng/cm2. No significant (p = 0.05) differences were observed in leaf bottom residues and boll weevil mortality. In summary, downward-pointed sprays produced the greatest leaf-top residue levels under field conditions with a weak crosswind. Banded, narrow-angle (40°) flat-fan nozzles resulted in more deposit than a three-nozzle hollow-cone nozzle arrangement in the field. Thus, light wind conditions appeared to negate any advantages offered by multiple geometric spray patterns and delivery angles. 3afoliar spraying 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aphysical models 3acanopy 3apesticide application 3amalathion 3adroplets 3aspray deposition 3afan nozzles 3awind 3aspray drift 0afoliar spray banding 0aplastic plants 0amodel soybean plants1 aSmith, C.W.1 aMulrooney, J.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v. 47, no. 1 p.37-44x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/200203Available in Treesearch, US Forest Service's digital repository  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/09/08  aOther US 7aarticle02566naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245015500148300001600303520103200319650003001351650001901381650001201400650002001412650001201432650002801444650002601472650001001498650002101508650002501529650001201554650004101566650005701607650002601664650004501690650002201735650001101757650003001768650002801798650002201826700001301848700001401861700001801875773009901893852000901992930003302001945001302034946001302047655001202060IND2200352920221120053416.0990828e199902  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220035292DNAL7 a103276212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidiroglou, M.10aPharmacokinetic study of 45Ca administered intravenously following intramuscular injection of vitamin D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in early weaned lambs  ap. 277-282.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of 45Ca administered intravenously at a dose of 50 microcurie in young lambs. The experiment was performed on 18 female lambs allocated to three treatments. Six animals received intravenous calcium only; six received intramuscularly vitamin D3 8 days prior to the administration of calcium, and six received intramuscularly 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 5 days prior to the administration of calcium. Blood samples were collected from 15 min up to 8 days after the administration of 45Ca. The different pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the curve, clearance, mean residence time and volume of distribution) were estimated using non-compartmental and compartmental approaches. Statistical analysis of the results showed no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the three groups. It can be concluded that vitamin D does not modify either the elimination or the distribution of calcium in the lambs receiving adequate dietary vitamin D. 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3ablood sampling 3acalcium 3acholecalciferol 3afemales 3aintramuscular injection 3aintravenous injection 3alambs 3apharmacokinetics 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimals 2aCalcifediolxadministration & dosage 2aCalciumxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aCalcium Radioisotopes 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosage 2aDrug Interactions 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aSheepxmetabolism1 aZhao, X.1 aRaffy, S.1 aToutain, P.L.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Feb., v. 122A, no. 2 p.277-282x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02338naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245008500121300001600206500001500222520141700237650002301654650000901677650002301686650001501709650002401724653002901748653002001777653002601797653001901823700001101842773006901853852000901922930003301931945001301964946001101977655001201988IND2202081720221120053521.0991228e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220208172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, N.10aMapping quantitative trait loci for complex binary traits in outbred populations  ap. 668-676.  a2019-12-05  aComplex binary traits have a dichotomous phenotypic expression but do not show a simple Mendelian segregation ratio. These traits are considered to be jointly controlled by the actions of several genes and a random environmental effect. The binary phenotype and the underlying factor are assumed to be linked through a threshold model. The underlying factor, referred to as the liability, is treated as a regular but unobservable quantitative character. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) can be performed directly on the liability. Methods of QTL mapping for the liability of a complex binary trait have been well developed in line-crossing experiments. However, such a method is not available in outbred populations which usually consist of many independent pedigrees (families). In this study, we develop a method to analyse jointly multiple families of an outbred population. The method is developed based on a fixed-model approach, i.e. the QTL effects, rather than the variance, are estimated and tested. After the test, the estimated effects are then converted into a single estimate of the QTL variance by taking into consideration errors in the estimated effects. The QTL effects and variance-covariance matrix of the estimates are obtained by a fast Fisher-scoring method. Monte Carlo simulations show that the method is not only powerful but also generates very accurate estimates of QTL variances. 3aMonte Carlo method 3aloci 3achromosome mapping 3aalgorithms 3aquantitative traits 0afisher-scoring algorithm 0athreshold model 0aquantitative genetics 0agenetic models1 aXu, S.0 tHeredity.g1999 June, v. 82, no. pt.6 p.668-676x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02688naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245008400192300001600276500002400292520118300316650001401499650002001513650002201533650001501555650001801570650001901588650002301607650002401630650002201654650001201676650001401688650001801702650002001720650001501740650001501755651002101770653002201791653002401813700002001837700001701857700001501874773008901889852000901978856009001987930003302077945002502110946001102135655001202146IND4426436320221120053340.0090925e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442643632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aP120 0aF8311 aBegley, D.10aInteraction in Short Rotation Coppice willow, Salix viminalis genotype mixtures  ap. 163-173.  aIncludes references  aSeven straight Salix viminalis genotypes with different levels of rust (Melampsora epitea) susceptibility were grown as mono-plots as well as being incorporated into a range of mixtures. Two 3-year harvests (2003 and 2006) were taken. Disease progress was followed on each of the individual genotypes throughout each growing season 2001-2006. In 2003 there were small but significant yield increases from the mixtures compared to the yield of individual components grown as mono-plots. These differences were not evident at the second harvest in 2006. No consistent effect of mixtures on reducing rust on the most susceptible genotype, Salix viminalis '77082' were observed. In some years, e.g. 2003, at certain times during the growing season, significant reductions were observed on Salix viminalis '77082' in certain 3-way mixtures compared to mono-plots. These, however, were not repeated consistently in subsequent years. It was concluded that the current commercial practice in many parts of Europe of planting mixtures as a disease control strategy will only be effective if there is sufficient genetic diversity between the Salix genotypes incorporated into the mixture. 3acoppicing 3aSalix viminalis 3agenotype mixtures 3aMelampsora 3arust diseases 3adisease course 3adisease resistance 3acontinuous cropping 3agenetic variation 3abiomass 3abioenergy 3acrop rotation 3adisease control 3apathotypes 3acrop yield 3aNorthern Ireland 0aMelampsora epitea 0ashort crop rotation1 aMcCracken, A.R.1 aDawson, M.W.1 aWatson, S.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2009 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.163-173dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02614naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245010900182300001600291500002400307500001500331520130600346650001101652650001101663650001801674650001401692650001801706650001201724650002501736650001201761651001201773653002501785653001001810700001801820700001401838700001601852700001901868773008901887852000901976856009001985930003302075945002502108946001102133655001202144IND4426436820221120053328.0090925e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442643682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aP1101 aLindh, T.10aReed canary grass transportation costs - Reducing costs and increasing feasible transportation distances  ap. 209-212.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aReed canary grass is used in several heat and power plants in Finland and it is estimated that about 70-80 plants could utilise reed canary grass as a co-firing fuel. Long-distance transport of reed canary grass forms a significant share of the production and delivery costs. Reed canary grass can be transported in bales or as loose matter. The density of the matter and shape of the bales influence the load-size and the cost. At present it is impossible to obtain the full load-bearing capacity of a lorry even with bales, and with light bulk matter the obtainable load is less than one-third of the load-bearing capacity of a lorry. By using Orkel local-baler it has been possible to obtain the largest load-sizes, but the total economy of the chain is not very good because the baling and chopping of bales increase the total costs. If a full load-bearing capacity of a lorry (30-40 tonne) would be obtained, the transportation costs would be reduced significantly compared to the present situation. Second alternative would be to mix reed canary grass with wood chips or peat before long-distance transport. At the moment feasible transportation distances are relatively short. With briquettes the cargo space could be used more efficiently and the load-size of the transport could be increased. 3abalers 3atrucks 3aprofitability 3abioenergy 3acost analysis 3abiomass 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3adensity 3aFinland 0atransportation costs 0aloads1 aPaappanen, T.1 aRinne, S.1 aSivonen, K.1 aWihersaari, M.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2009 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.209-212dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2008.05.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02749naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245010600143300001600249520104500265650002901310650002701339650001301366650003001379650000901409650002001418650001001438650001901448650001901467650001001486650001401496650003901510650001301549650001201562650007901574650002701653650002301680650003101703650006801734650002201802650006601824650003601890653001401926700001501940700001501955700001501970700001701985700001402002773009902016852000902115930003302124945001302157946001302170655001202183IND2200352320221120041151.0990828e199902  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220035232DNAL7 a103276172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbran, N.10aPore-forming properties and antibacterial activity of proteins extracted from epidermal mucus of fish  ap. 181-189.  aAmong several biological functions, the epidermal mucus of fish may play an important role in host defense, particularly in the prevention of colonization by parasites, bacteria and fungi. In previous work, two hydrophobic proteins of 27 and 31 kDa were isolated from carp mucus. This study identified a strong antibacterial activity (0.16-0.18 micromolar) well correlated with pore-forming properties. Here this work was extended to other fish species, four fresh water fish and one sea water fish. After a first step of purification, water-soluble and hydrophobic material were separated, and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and capillary electrophoresis. Only the hydrophobic component induced pore-forming activity, when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers. This pore-forming activity was well correlated to a strong antibacterial activity against several bacteria strains. These results suggest that fish secrete antibacterial proteins able to permeabilize the membrane of the target cell and thus act as a defense barrier. 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibacterial proteins 3abacteria 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acarp 3afreshwater fish 3afungi 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3amucus 3aparasites 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aseawater 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aIon Channelsxdrug effects 2aIonophoresxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMucusxmetabolism 2aProteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSkinxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 0aepidermis1 aJulien, S.1 aOrange, N.1 aSaglio, P.1 aLemaitre, C.1 aMolle, G.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Feb., v. 122A, no. 2 p.181-189x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100003300158245010900191300001800300500002400318520160200342650001701944650002501961650001801986650002402004650001702028650002402045650001902069650001402088650001802102700002902120773011602149852000902265856007902274655001202353IND4440613620221120032332.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444061362DNAL7 a216168812pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.10000882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandero, Juan Pablo Castillo10aSpecies-specificity of nurse plants for the establishment, survivorship, and growth of a columnar cactus  ap. 1289-1295.  aIncludes references  aPremise of the study: Seedling establishment and early survivorship are crucial steps for the regeneration of plant populations because both have long-lasting effects on plant population dynamics. For species recruiting through facilitation, species-specific facilitative effects might affect early fitness, an overlooked aspect in studies of facilitation considering groups of nurse species. METHODS: We experimentally evaluated the roles of 10 nurse species and open space on the early performance of the columnar cactus Neobuxbaumia mezcalaensis. We measured establishment, survivorship, and growth of individuals over 3 years. Moreover, to study an extended period of the ontogeny of the interaction between this cactus and its nurse plants, we also monitored survivorship and growth rates of individuals between 3 to 12 cm tall during a 3-year period. Key results: Neobuxbaumia mezcalaensis performance varied significantly among nurse species, and only six yielded positive effects on early fitness. Densely canopied plants were the best nurses for this cactus. However, even among densely canopied species, some produced negative effects on the early fitness of N. mezcalaensis, indicating that similar nurse plants may elicit either facilitative or interference effects on beneficiary species. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the importance of species-specific facilitative interactions in the crucial early stages in the life cycle of N. mezcalaensis and how different nurse species modify the effect of seed-rain and contribute significantly to the population dynamics of the species. 3aNeobuxbaumia 3acacti and succulents 3aplant density 3aplant establishment 3aplant growth 3apopulation dynamics 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3asurvival rate1 aValiente-Banuet, Alfonso0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2010 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.1289-1295dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.10000883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02304naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008900129300001400218520126600232650001801498650001401516650001001530650002701540650001301567650004501580650002001625650001501645651001101660653001801671700001601689700002001705700001601725700001601741700001601757773006701773852000901840930003301849945001301882946001101895655001201906IND2202669820221120032351.0000222e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220266982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillemaud, T.10aQuantitative variation and selection of esterase gene amplification in Culex pipiens  ap. 87-99.  aAlthough descriptions of evolutionary mechanisms are common in the literature, very few studies focus on the possible evolution of the adaptive genes themselves, i.e. their quantitative and qualitative changes. Evolution of insecticide resistance in Culex pipiens is a suitable model for studying such processes. In this species, organophosphorous insecticide resistance can be achieved through the overproduction of esterases that sequester the insecticide, and this overproduction can be caused by gene amplification. It is generally assumed, but never verified, that esterase activity, and therefore resistance, is monotonically related to gene amplification. We have analysed resistance, esterase activity and gene amplification in different laboratory strains and natural populations in order to detect variability and to infer effects of selection on these factors. We have shown that resistance, esterase activity and amplification covary, that insecticide selection is able to increase amplification levels, and that a fitness cost is probably attached to the amplification in laboratory strains, related to the level of amplification. The importance of variation in gene amplification level is discussed and some evolutionary implications are proposed. 3aCulex pipiens 3aesterases 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3atemephos 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aenzyme activity 3apopulation 3aFrance 0aamplification1 aRaymond, M.1 aTsagkarakou, A.1 aBernard, C.1 aRochard, P.1 aPasteur, N.0 tHeredity.g1999 July, v. 83, no. pt.1 p.87-99x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001600206520148300222650001601705650001401721650002001735650001801755650001601773650001801789650001301807650002901820650001601849653002401865700001601889700001701905700001801922773006901940852000902009930003302018945001302051946001102064655001202075IND2202081620221120025512.0991228e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220208162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, M.G.14aThe influence of triploidy on gene expression in the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 661-667.  aIn Bombyx mori, it is well established that polyploids are easily induced when newly laid eggs are exposed to a variety of conditions, such as high or low temperature, centrifugal force, or chemicals like colchicine. To investigate gene dosage effects by varying the ploidy, the transcription levels of six genes expressed in various tissues were analysed in the diploid and two different genetically produced triploids (PPC and CCP). In the PPC triploid, the transcription level per cell of two genes was directly proportional to the structural gene dosage, whereas two other genes showed the mRNA level expected if compensation occurred. In the CCP triploid, three genes displayed dose-dependent levels of expression, whereas one gene showed the same expression level as the diploid strains. In both triploids, exceptional cases showed a negative correlation of expression with ploidy or a positive correlation greater than expected from the structural gene dosage. Interestingly, the transcription levels of most tested genes were significantly different from the strains which were used as parents of the triploids, and also widely divergent expression patterns were found for some genes in the diploid offspring. In this study, the cause of the unexpected expression patterns observed in the euploid series is discussed in relation to the difference between the two parental strains in expression level of genes and in trans-acting regulatory effects on their target genes. 3aBombyx mori 3atriploidy 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3agene dosage 3aribosomal RNA 3afat body 3atranscription (genetics) 3asilk glands 0adosage compensation1 aShimada, T.1 aYokoyama, T.1 aKobayashi, M.0 tHeredity.g1999 June, v. 82, no. pt.6 p.661-667x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01552naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245004700157300001400204500001500218520048100233650002100714650001900735650002200754650002600776650001300802650001400815651001800829653003100847653001200878653001300890773008800903852000900991856006001000930003301060945002501093946001301118990002301131655001201154IND4364622920221120025352.0040922s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||chi||7 aIND436462292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pupating hornet larvae produce a silk cocoon whose cap is made up of cross-linked silk fibers with sporadic flat plates that partially fill the gaps between the fibers. Large free gaps of up to 100 micrometer exist between the silk fibers, but the cocoon and its cap is a multilayered structure with at least ten fiber layers, thereby preventing E. coli K12 sp. bacteria or tiny particles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a size range of 1-30 micrometer from passing through the silk caps during wet centrifugal filtration or dry gas filtration performed at 2 bar. Of approximately 10(7) bacteria or TiO2 particles per ml loaded on the upstream side of the filtering silk cap, less than 100 particles per ml were counted in the liquid filtrate collected following wet centrifugal filtration and even fewer number of particles were detected in the filtered air during forced gas filtration through the silk caps. These findings suggest that the pupal silk caps function as an efficient filtration system affording the developing pupa the appropriate physical and biological conditions for the production of its cuticle during pupation. Such 'clean room' conditions are a sine qua non during the formation of the semi-conductive elements that characterize the adult hornet cuticle. 3aEscherichia coli 3aVespa orientalis 3aadults 3aair 3abacteria 3acrosslinking 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3alarvae 3apupae 3apupation 3asilk 3atitanium dioxide 0acombs1 aIshay, J.S.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1998 July, v. 120A, no. 3 p.565-570x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01805naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007800127300001600205520089000221650001401111650002401125650001301149650001201162650001901174650001201193650001101205650001901216650002001235700001701255700001601272773009901288852000901387930003301396945001301429946001301442655001201455IND2197722720221120025306.0990323e199812  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219772272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwatsuki, K.10aSymbiotic Chlorella enhances the thermal tolerance in Paramecium bursaria  ap. 405-409.  aSymbiotic Chlorella enhanced the tolerance to high temperature in Paramecium bursaria.

The degree of thermal tolerance in Chlorella-containing P. bursaria was not affected in the presence of these carbohydrates or oxygen. 3aChlorella 3aParamecium bursaria 3afructose 3aglucose 3aheat tolerance 3amaltose 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3asodium chloride1 aNishidoi, M.1 aSuehiro, K.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1998 Dec., v. 121A, no. 4 p.405-409x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03510naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002500176245012000201300001800321500002400339500001500363520182900378650001702207650002302224650001702247650004802264650001602312650001702328650002302345650001602368650001702384650001302401650002402414650002002438650001902458650002502477650001002502650003102512653002102543653001802564700002302582700002702605700002702632700002202659773009602681852000902777856008902786930003302875945002502908946001102933655001202944IND4426506920221120025439.0090925e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442650692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ501 0aQ1111 aWróblewska, Barbara10aInfluence of the addition of transglutaminase on the immunoreactivity of milk proteins and sensory quality of kefir  ap. 2434-2445.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTraditionally prepared kefir was enriched by the addition of transglutaminase (m-TG) to milk used for fermentation. Following multiplication of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, milk proteins were hydrolysed to short chain peptides. Results of a chromatographic analysis demonstrated significant changes in protein profiles observed at 214 nm and 280 nm absorbance. The addition of m-TG to fresh kefir evoked the formation of protein aggregates. Two distinct fractions (at 50-55 ml and 135-155 ml) were observed at 280 nm, which may suggest the formation of aromatic acids. After storage, the first fraction (50-55 ml) observed in the chromatographic analysis and the second one (135-155 ml) tended to divide into two peaks, both the kefir with m-TG and that without m-TG. Two-dimensional electrophoresis proved the formation of the protein aggregates as an effect of transglutaminase action. The ELISA results obtained during the reaction of kefir proteins with specific antibody against individual milk proteins (@b-lactoglobulin, @a-lactalbumin and @a-casein, @b-casein and @k-casein) indicated differences in the level of proteins as a result of m-TG addition as well as storage. The reaction between immunoreactive @b-lg and specific antibodies was not detectable in any of the kefir samples under the adopted conditions of the ELISA assay. The kefirs were evaluated for their sensory quality using a quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). The results showed that both the addition of the m-TG enzyme and storage had significant effects on the sensory quality of the kefir samples. The kefirs with m-TG obtained higher scores for overall quality than the control one. The results indicated that this type of kefir can be offered especially to those consumers who are searching for foodstuffs with low immunoreactivity. 3afermentation 3aprotein aggregates 3akappa-casein 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3alactalbumin 3aalpha-casein 3asensory properties 3abeta-casein 3afood storage 3apeptides 3aenzymatic treatment 3astorage quality 3alactoglobulins 3aprotein hydrolysates 3akefir 3aantigen-antibody reactions 0aimmunoreactivity 0amilk proteins1 aKołakowski, Piotr1 aPawlikowska, Katarzyna1 aTroszyńska, Agnieszka1 aKaliszewska, Anna0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2434-2445dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.06.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03149naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100003200167245006500199300001800264500002400282500001500306520171900321650002702040650002302067650001502090650001802105650001002123650000902133650002602142650001202168650001902180650002402199650001102223653000902234653002602243653002602269653000902295700002502304700003002329700002102359773009602380852000902476856008902485930003302574945002502607946001102632655001202643IND4426507020221117182507.0090925e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442650702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ506 0aQ4061 aHernández-Briones, Araceli10aEffects of adding fish gelatin on Alaska pollock surimi gels  ap. 2446-2449.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFish gelatin is a food additive obtained after hydrolysis of collagen from fish skin. The importance of fish gelatin as a food additive is increasing due to its increased commercial availability. Surimi is washed minced fish meat used as the raw material for seafood analogs like crabmeat substitutes. The most important attributes of surimi are gelling and whiteness. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of using fish gelatin as an additive in surimi to improve the mechanical and functional properties of gels. Surimi gels were prepared by mixing grade A or FA surimi (Alaska pollock) with salt (20 g/kg w/w) and commercial fish gelatin at 0 (control), 5, 7.5, 10, or 15 g/kg (w/w) previously dissolved in water (200 mL/kg surimi). The solubilized paste was incubated at 40 ^oC for 30 min followed by cooking at 90 ^oC for 15 min. Changes in mechanical properties (torsion test), a functional property (expressible water content) and color attributes of surimi gels were measured. Grade FA surimi gels containing 7.5-15 g/kg of fish gelatin showed an improved expressible moisture. However, gelatin added at 15 g/kg showed a disruptive effect detrimental to the mechanical properties. Color parameters were modified slightly. Whiteness attribute as affected by increasing the fish gelatin was instrumentally detected but not observed by sensory panelists. Gelatin did not change the overall color attributes and all gels remained in the grayish region. These results indicated that fish gelatin did not have an advantage for using as a functional additive in Alaska pollock surimi grades A or FA. However, it can be used at up to 10 g/kg without a negative effect on the mechanical properties. 3achemical concentration 3atorsional strength 3afood paste 3awater content 3acolor 3afish 3afunctional properties 3agelatin 3afood additives 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3asurimi 0askin 0aTheragra chalcogramma 0amechanical properties 0agels1 aVelázquez, Gonzalo.1 aVázquez Murillo, Manuel.1 aRamirez, Jose A.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2446-2449dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.07.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002300158245008100181300001800262500002400280520160100304650001901905650001601924650001701940650001401957650002701971650000901998650001302007650001902020650000702039650002002046650001702066650001602083650002202099650001902121650001502140650002202155650001502177650002102192700002502213700002002238773009602258852000902354856008902363930003302452945002502485946001102510655001202521IND4426507520221117182443.0090925e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442650752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aEuston, Stephen R.10aComparing the heat stability of soya protein and milk whey protein emulsions  ap. 2485-2492.  aIncludes references  aThe heat stability of emulsions stabilized by WPC or SPI or mixtures of the two are compared by following the change in oil droplet number during heating, and applying kinetic rate equations to calculate the rate constant (k) for destabilization. SPI emulsions were found to be unstable to heat at pH around the pI, whilst being stable at pH further from the pI. This is related to the pH dependent solubility of soy proteins. This determined that a pH close to the pI (pH 4.5) be used for further studies so as to give a heat labile emulsion. Both WPC and SPI emulsions showed a weak dependence of k on protein concentration at pH 4.5, and an increasing k as the temperature increased. Arrhenius plots for emulsions made with WPC were bilinear, whilst those for SPI followed a single straight line. The change in slope of the Arrhenius plots for the WPC emulsions occurred around 70 ^oC, lower than would be expected from the denaturation temperature of @b-lactoglobulin, the protein that dominates the thermal behaviour of WPC. The activation energies for WPC and SPI emulsions calculated from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots are slightly lower for WPC and considerably lower for SPI than the equivalent values in the literature for these proteins in solution. This, and the apparent lower denaturation temperature of @b-lactoglobulin in emulsions, we explain by hypothesizing that the WPC and SPI proteins are already partially denatured by surface adsorption when they are heated, and thus require less energy to denature, and unfold at lower temperatures than native non-adsorbed proteins. 3aheat stability 3asoy protein 3awhey protein 3aemulsions 3aemulsifying properties 3aoils 3adroplets 3aheat treatment 3apH 3aprotein content 3adenaturation 3atemperature 3aactivation energy 3alactoglobulins 3asolubility 3aisoelectric point 3aadsorption 3aprotein isolates1 aAl-Bakkush, Al-Amari1 aCampbell, Lydia0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 8 p.2485-2492dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.08.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014300127300001600270520151700286650001501803650002301818650001401841650001601855650002201871650001401893650000901907650002501916650003001941650001901971650001901990650002102009650002402030650001502054651002202069700001702091773007002108852000902178930003302187945001302220946001102233655001202244IND2205543320221121170554.0000630e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220554332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoates, D.J.10aGenetic divergence and the mating system in the endangered and geographically restricted species, Lambertia orbifolia Gardner (Proteaceae)  ap. 418-427.  aPopulation genetic structure and the mating system were investigated in the endangered plant Lambertia orbifolia. This species is geographically restricted with two disjunct groups of populations. Twelve out of 19 allozyme loci were polymorphic and four were suitable for mating system studies. Levels of genetic variation within populations were comparable to other long-lived woody shrub endemics. Genetic divergence between population groups was very high (D = 0.252) and the F(ST) over all populations was 0.441. Gene flow estimates within population groups were low even though the maximum geographical distance between any pair of populations is 15 km and could be attributed to the localized movement of bird pollinators. Mating system studies on four populations showed consistently low levels of outcrossing, compared with other Proteaceae. Correlations of outcrossed paternity were moderately high and all were significantly greater than zero. Values ranged from r(p) = 0.33, in the two largest and very dense populations, to the highest value of r(p) = 0.54 in a smaller low-density population. The current population genetic structure in L. orbifolia is probably the result of local extinction of intervening populations because of Pleistocene climatic change and increased aridity, and extended isolation of the two remnants. It is proposed that the phylogenetically distinct Narrikup population group be recognized as a separate conservation unit and be given high priority for conservation action. 3aProteaceae 3aendangered species 3agene flow 3aoutcrossing 3agenetic variation 3aallozymes 3aloci 3agenetic polymorphism 3ageographical distribution 3aheterozygosity 3agene frequency 3agenetic distance 3aenzyme polymorphism 3apopulation 3aWestern Australia1 aHamley, V.L.0 tHeredity.g1999 Oct., v. 83, no. pt. 4 p.418-427x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01940naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100003000144245007200174300002100246520095600267650002101223650001501244650002401259650001901283650002501302650002301327650002301350651001101373700002601384773010001410852000901510930003301519945002501552946001301577655001201590IND4412257020221121170515.0081104e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441225702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W08414 (11 p.  aIn many developing and developed cities, nonpayment for water services undermines the financial health of water utilities; in poorer areas, it also hinders the water utilities' ability to serve poor households. However, nonpayment has not received much attention in the literature so far. In this paper, we analyze nonpayment for a unique data set of households from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Our fieldwork and basic statistics indicate that nonpayment is very common and affects both poor and affluent households, so ability to pay may only partly explain nonpayment. Using panel data models to control for unobserved household characteristics (to avoid omitted variable bias) and after accounting for monthly effects, we find that long-term delinquent households consume approximately 3% more water than do other families; this number is larger for households who are retired and affluent, which further compounds the adverse consequences of nonpayment. 3awater management 3ahouseholds 3apublic water supply 3apublic opinion 3astatistical analysis 3aeconometric models 3awillingness to pay 3aMexico1 aSaphores, Jean-Daniel0 tWater resources research.g2008 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.W08414 (11 p-W08414 (11 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20081215b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/12/15  aOther US 7aarticle02458naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009400158300001600252500002400268520146900292650002101761650002101782650002001803650002601823700001901849773008501868852000901953856006401962930003302026945002502059946001302084990002302097655001202120IND4365612320221121170520.0041116e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436561232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A study was conducted in 1998 and replicated again in 1999 to determine whether native plants could be established through "assisted succession" -- manipulating a cheatgrass-dominated area to perennial plant domination, then to native or near-native diversity. Cheatgrass dominated rangeland that had been successfully revegetated with crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertner) was seeded with native species. Another area dominated by cheatgrass, but without crested wheatgrass, was also seeded. Four seedbed preparation methods were investigated: tilling, harrowing, application of a herbicide, and no treatment. Four different seeding methods were used in the 2 areas and 4 seedbed preparation techniques: drilling, broadcasting, a broadcast-cover method, and no seed. Seeding was done in February, and data were collected in mid-summer each year. Native grasses and shrubs emerged in greater numbers on treatments established on the crested wheatgrass matrix than on those established on the cheatgrass matrix. Perhaps in general, but especially in years with normal or below average precipitation, the assisted succession approach proved successful for restoration of native sagebrush-grassland steppe from cheatgrass range. 3arange management 3aland restoration 3aBromus tectorum 3abotanical composition1 aAnderson, V.J.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.203-210x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3electronic resource  a20041207b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/12/07  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02801naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164100001600173245013400189300001600323500002400339500001500363520155400378650001101932650001701943650001001960650002001970650001701990650001002007653002802017653002002045653001002065653001702075700001702092773009702109852000902206856009502215930003302310945002502343946001102368655001202379IND4426416120221121170506.0090924e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442641612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2009.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aN2001 aAnsorge, D.14aThe effect of tyres and a rubber track at high axle loads on soil compaction. 3.

In particular, the in situ approach to determine a VCL from readily available tyre and soil data (Ansorge & Godwin, 2008) was compared to triaxial cell test results. The results showed that a VCL was not a unique line with respect to mean normal pressure. The VCL was dependent on the relationship of minor and major principle stresses. Hence a triaxially derived VCL could only be successfully employed to predict the soil displacement if the relationship of minor and major principle stresses in the triaxial cell test represented those occurring in the field from the passage of a tyre. Subsequently the in situ approach was successfully employed using small scale plate sinkage tests further validating the entire approach and demonstrating the potential of a simple laboratory test to derive VCLs. Applying the in situ approach to soil displacement data from a rubber track showed that rubber tracks have different compaction behaviour than tyres. The rut depth of a rubber track was successfully predicted when the track roller body was modelled with tyres representing the pressure profile occurring underneath a track employing the in situ VCL derived from tyre only data. However, soil displacement at depth was significantly overestimated. 3arubber 3awheel tracks 3atires 3asoil compaction 3avirgin soils 3aaxles 0avirgin compression line 0ahigh axle loads 0aloads 0arubber track1 aGodwin, R.J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2009 Oct., v. 104, no. 2 p.278-287dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2009.06.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02919naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245006200177520161400239592002801853650001601881650001801897650001401915650002001929650002401949650001801973650001501991650001502006651002002021653002002041653001302061653000802074653001702082653001702099653001702116700002002133700001902153700001702172700001802189700002002207700001802227773011902245856008802364852000902452655001202461IND60776780420221119092325.0220606e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Bradley S.10aMethcathinone in wastewater: Drug of choice, or artefact?  aMethcathinone is a prevalent Novel Psychoactive Substance (NPS) used illicitly in some countries. Routine analysis of wastewater sampled from catchments in South Australia has shown a consistent low-level presence of the compound, inconsistent with NPS use. This raised the question was the occurrence due to regular use as a drug of choice or was it an artefact being produced from other sources in the sewer system? NPS consumption is generally sporadic and would therefore point to the origin of methcathinone in wastewater being due to in-sewer oxidation of its legal precursor, pseudoephedrine. The present study tested this hypothesis by comparing the levels of pseudoephedrine and methcathinone in wastewater samples collected bimonthly from 8 catchment sites in South Australia. Laboratory experiments exposing pseudoephedrine to common household oxidizing agents (hypochlorite and percarbonate) were also performed and the production of methcathinone was demonstrated and monitored. The results of this study showed that the level of pseudoephedrine and methcathinone measured in wastewater followed a similar pattern. However, there were periods when the levels of each compound diverged. Laboratory experiments showed that when exposed to various oxidizing agents, pseudoephedrine is oxidised to non-stoichiometric quantities of methcathinone. Although the use of methcathinone as a drug of choice remains possible, the results of this study indicate that the low and persistent level of methcathinone found in wastewater may arise in part from the oxidation of pseudoephedrine in the sewer system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3ahypochlorites 3aoxidation 3apseudoephedrine 3apsychotropic agents 3asewer systems 3awastewater 3awatersheds 3aSouth Australia 0aPseudoephedrine 0aOxidants 0aNPS 0aIllicit drug 0aHypochlorite 0aPercarbonate1 aJaunay, Emma L.1 aGhetia, Maulik1 aNguyen, Lynn1 aBade, Richard1 aWhite, Jason M.1 aGerber, Cobus0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 836 p.155696-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245005500206300001600261506007600277520045600353592002800809506003700837650001000874650001500884650003100899650001400930650001800944650001600962700001900978700002300997773012501020856007901145852000901224655001201233IND60300843720221207112143.0150703e20130111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030084372DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12279012doi7 aPMC44316342pmcid7 a233077322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguzzi, Adriano10aMicroglia: Scapegoat, Saboteur, or Something Else?  ap. 156-161.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroglia are resident immune cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Deighton (late leafspot) are the most destructive foliar pathogens of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and occur each year in Florida in epidemic proportions. This research establishes a data base relating growth of 'Florunner' peanut to leafspot disease severity and can be used as an aid in evaluating other resistant lines. Five leafspot disease severity levels were applied to Florunner peanut during the 1982 growing season by spraying with five levels of chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisopthalonitrile) foliar sprays beginning 40 days after planting, and continuing on a 14 day schedule until harvest. The research was conducted at the Marianna Agricultural Research Center, on a Lucy fine sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Paleudult). Disease severity levels were compared to peanut growth measurements of leaf area index (LAI), shoot weight (leaf and stem), root weight (lateral and tap root), sample pod weight, and total biomass during the pod fill period. Although ratings were made for early and late leafspot, late leafspot was the predominant foliar disease. The LAI, leaf weight, and lateral root weight were negatively influenced by invasion of late leafspot pathogens. A comparison of field pod yield to sample pod yield indicated that lower dosages of chlorothalonil were not effective in maintaining healthy pegs, and may have allowed early pod maturity and resulted in some shedding of pods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aMycosphaerella arachidis 3aMycosphaerella berkeleyi 3aPaleudults 3aagricultural research 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3achlorothalonil 3adatabases 3adisease severity 3afoliar diseases 3alateral roots 3aleaf area index 3aleaf mass 3aleaves 3apeanuts 3asand 3atap roots 3aFlorida1 aShokes, F.

A conventional beamforming technique based on a hypothetical array is first used, and the detection of the narrow-band components is sequentially carried out so that the corresponding amplitudes and phases at these narrow-band components can be acquired. We convert the towed array estimation problem into a nonlinear discrete-time filtering problem with the joint estimates of amplitudes and time-delay differences, and then propose the ORPF method to acquire enhanced estimates of the time delays by exploiting the underlying properties of slowly changing time-delay differences across sensors. The proposed scheme fully exploits directional radiated noise targets as sources of opportunity for online array shape estimation, and thus it requires neither the number nor direction of sources to be known in advance. Both simulations and real experimental data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3ahydrodynamics 3asonar1 aXu, Youhai 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 10, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245008700215300001800302520156600320592002801886596008301914596007701997596007302074650002502147650001302172650001202185650001702197650002002214650001302234650001102247650001702258650001402275650003002289650003702319650001402356700003002370700003202400700002802432700003102460700004002491700003102531700002702562773011102589856008302700852000902783655001202792IND60744902920221121002258.0210815e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074490292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02553-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Melo, Roberta Torres1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8265-516310aGenotypical Relationship Between Human and Poultry Strains of Campylobacter jejuni  ap. 2980-2988.  aThis study aimed to compare the genotype diversity of C. jejuni isolates. From the total of 64 C. jejuni strains evaluated, 44 were isolated from broiler carcasses (2015–2016) and 20 from hospitalized patients with gastroenteritis caused by the microorganism (2000–2006). The strains were correlated for the presence of flaA, pldA, cadF, ciaB, cdtABC, luxS, dnaJ, cbrA, htrA, pVir, Hcp, cstII, and neuA genes by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and for phylogenetic proximity by PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). Of the total strains studied, 28 (43.7%) presented all the studied genes, except pVir. Among these strains, 25 (89.3%) were of poultry origin. Poultry strains showed a higher prevalence (P < 0.05) of genes linked to adhesion, colonization, invasion, cytotoxicity, biofilm formation, and adaptation to adverse conditions. Additionally, the profile that denotes the presence of all genes identified in the study (P1) was identified in 56.8% of poultry strains and in 15.0% of human strains. Molecular typing analysis identified five pulsotypes, none of which grouped strains from different origins. Although human strains were from hospitalized patients, they presented limited virulence capacity and adaptability to adverse conditions compared to chicken carcasses, besides being different in molecular typing. However, the ability to cause Guillain-Barré Syndrome is equal for both strains. In general, poultry strains, being more recent, are more specialized to adapt to the environment, invade, and cause disease in the human host.  aPublisher supplied data  a407924/2013-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aPPM-00313-15cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3acytotoxicity 3agastroenteritis 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amicrobiology 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3avirulence1 aDumont, Carolyne Ferreira1 aBraz, Raquelline Figueiredo1 aMonteiro, Guilherme Paz1 aTakeuchi, Micaela Guidotti1 aLourenzatto, Eduarda Cristina Alves1 ados Santos, Jandra Pacheco1 aRossi, Daise Aparecida0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.2980-2988dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02553-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011400157520112900271592002801400650002301428650001701451650001301468650002601481650001801507650001001525650001201535650002001547650001101567650002401578650001101602650001001613650001201623650000901635650003101644650001801675650001601693700001601709700001601725700001801741700001701759773012601776856007501902852000901977655001201986IND60771351620221122231954.0220325e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077135162DNAL7 a10.3390/md200302032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan-dan 12aA New Fungal Triterpene from the Fungus Aspergillus flavus Stimulates Glucose Uptake without Fat Accumulation  aThrough activity-guided fractionation, a new triterpene (asperflagin, 1) was isolated as a PPAR-γ agonist from the jellyfish-derived fungus Aspergillus flavus. Asperflagin displayed selective and moderate transactivation effects on PPAR-γ in Ac2F rat liver cells. Based on further biological evaluation and molecular docking analysis, we postulated that asperflagin might function as a PPAR-γ partial agonist. This compound was calculated to display a typical PPAR-γ ligand–receptor interaction that is distinct from that of full agonistic antidiabetics such as rosiglitazone, and may retain the antidiabetic effect without accompanying weight gain. Weight gain and obesity are typical side effects of the PPAR-γ full agonist rosiglitazone, and lead to suboptimal outcomes in diabetic patients. Compared to rosiglitazone, asperflagin showed higher glucose uptake in HepG2 human liver cells at concentrations of 20 and 40 μM but induced markedly lower adipogenesis and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These results suggest that asperflagin may be utilized for further study on advanced antidiabetic leads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aadipogenesis 3aagonists 3abiological assessment 3afractionation 3afungi 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3ahypoglycemic agents 3alipids 3aliver 3aobesity 3arats 3atranscriptional activation 3atriterpenoids 3aweight gain1 aWang, Ying 1 aKim, Eun La1 aHong, Jongki 1 aJung, Jee H.0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 20, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200302033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245005200162300001200214520141300226592002801639650002301667650001101690650001401701650001001715650001101725650002301736700001601759700001901775773012501794856007701919852000901996655001202005IND60732047220221119185713.0210326e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073204722DNAL7 a10.3390/fishes60100022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Bradley10aAchieving Sea Lamprey Control in Lake Champlain  ap. 2-0.  aThe control of parasitic sea lamprey in Lake Champlain has been a necessary component of its fishery restoration and recovery goals for 30 years. While adopting the approach of the larger and established sea lamprey control program of the Laurentian Great Lakes, local differences emerged that shifted management focus and effort as the program evolved. Increased investment in lamprey assessment and monitoring revealed under-estimations of population density and distribution in the basin, where insufficient control efforts went unnoticed. As control efforts improved in response to a better understanding of the population, the effects of lamprey on the fishery lessened. A long-term evaluation of fishery responses when lamprey control was started, interrupted, delayed, and enhanced provided evidence of a recurring relationship between the level of control effort applied and the measured suppression of the parasitic sea lamprey population. Changes in levels of control efforts over time showed repeatedly that measurable suppression of the parasitic population required effective control of 80% of the known larval population. Understanding the importance of assessment and monitoring and the relationship between control effort and population suppression has led to recognition that a comprehensive, not incremental, approach is needed to achieve effective control of sea lamprey in Lake Champlain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetromyzon marinus 3abasins 3afisheries 3alakes 3alarvae 3apopulation density1 aAllaire, BJ1 aSmith, Stephen0 tFishes.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 6, no. 1 p.2-0dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27137x2410-38887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes60100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011700208300001800325520154500343592002801888596004901916596005001965650002302015650002802038650001202066650001402078650002602092650002502118650001802143650001702161650001502178650001002193650002402203650001902227650005802246650001302304700002102317700002102338773011102359856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60744903020221120225925.0210815e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074490302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02546-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomai, Benesh M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4294-826510aTulbaghia violacea (Harv) Exerts its Antifungal Activity by Reducing Ergosterol Production in Aspergillus flavus  ap. 2989-2997.  aOpportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients have led to an increase in fungal infections, with Aspergillus being one of the main causative agents. Medicinal plants exhibiting antifungal activity have the potential to be used as chemotherapeutic agents. However, often their mechanisms of action are not fully researched. Tulbaghia violacea exhibits antifungal activity towards Candida, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus but its mode of action has only recently begun to be investigated. This study aimed to ascertain the effect of T. violacea rhizome extracts on ergosterol production in A. flavus and the mechanism of inhibition. The MIC of a T. violacea rhizome extract against A. flavus was first determined, using a broth dilution assay, to be 15 mg/ml. Thereafter, the culture was subjected to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the extract before sterol intermediates of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway were isolated and analysed for dose-dependent accumulation. Analysis by reverse-phase HPLC displayed a decline in ergosterol production in a dose-dependent manner when exposed to increasing concentrations of T. violacea extract. Quantification of the sterol intermediates of the ergosterol pathway indicated a definite accumulation of 2,3-oxidosqualene. The results prove that the plant extract affected ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting oxidosqualene cyclase. This prevented the formation of downstream intermediates of the ergosterol pathway ultimately resulting in inhibition of ergosterol production.  aPublisher supplied data  aTTK14061870154cNational Research Foundation  aG a/ccNelson Mandela Metropolitan University 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aCandida 3aTulbaghia 3aantifungal properties 3abiochemical pathways 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aergosterol 3afungi 3amechanism of action 3aplant extracts 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3arhizomes1 aBelewa, Vuyokazi1 aFrost, Carminita0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.2989-2997dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02546-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245016900176520136300345592002801708650001801736650003801754650003101792650002201823650001401845650001101859650001301870650001501883650001401898650001401912650001401926650001301940650001301953650001301966650001101979700001901990700002302009773012802032856008702160852000902247655001202256IND60768449420221120210433.0220225e20220126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076844942DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100202952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImhoff, Johannes F.10aGenomic Comparison, Phylogeny and Taxonomic Reevaluation of the Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Description of Halorhodospiraceae fam. nov. and Halochlorospira gen. nov.  aThe Ectothiorhodospiraceae family represents purple sulfur bacteria of the Gammaproteobacteria found primarily in alkaline soda lakes of moderate to extremely high salinity. The main microscopically visible characteristic separating them from the Chromatiaceae is the excretion of the intermediate elemental sulfur formed during oxidation of sulfide prior to complete oxidation to sulfate rather than storing it in the periplasm. We present a comparative study of 38 genomes of all species of phototrophic Ectothiorhodospiraceae. We also include a comparison with those chemotrophic bacteria that have been assigned to the family previously and critically reevaluate this assignment. The data demonstrate the separation of Halorhodospira species in a major phylogenetic branch distant from other Ectothiorhodospiraceae and support their separation into a new family, for which the name Halorhodospiraceae fam. nov. is proposed. In addition, the green-colored, bacteriochlorophyll-containing species Halorhodospira halochloris and Halorhodospira abdelmalekii were transferred to the new genus Halochlorospira gen. nov. of this family. The data also enable classification of several so far unclassified isolates and support the separation of Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii and Ect. vacuolata as well as Ect. mobilis and Ect. marismortui as distinct species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromatiaceae 3aEctothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii 3aHalorhodospira halochloris 3acomparative study 3aexcretion 3agenome 3agenomics 3anew family 3anew genus 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3asalinity 3asulfates 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aKyndt, John A.1 aMeyer, Terrance E.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Jan. 26, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100202953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010500163300001800268520174400286592002802030596006202058596006502120596005902185596009202244596007102336650002702407650001202434650000902446650001702455650003202472650001402504650001002518650000902528650001402537650002602551650001802577650003002595650001102625650001702636650001502653650002102668650001102689650002902700700001202729700001902741700002702760700001702787700001402804700001402818700001802832700001702850700001702867773011102884856008302995852000903078655001203087IND60744903120221120230004.0210815e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074490312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02503-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zheng10aConsuming Different Structural Parts of Bamboo Induce Gut Microbiome Changes in Captive Giant Pandas  ap. 2998-3009.  aGiant pandas consume different structural parts of bamboo (shoots, leaves and culms) during different seasons. Previous research showed different bamboo parts have varying nutritional content and that a long-term diet consisting of a single part of bamboo resulted in remarkable metabolic changes within captive giant pandas. However, the effects on the gut microbiome of giant pandas, as a result of a single bamboo part diet, have not been investigated. Here, we evaluated the changes in gut microbial communities based on single bamboo part diets and their potential implications by using 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing and metagenome shotgun sequencing. We found that the composition and function of the gut microbiome from captive giant pandas fed exclusively culms were significantly different from that of individuals fed shoots or leaves. During the culm feeding period, the gut microbiome showed strongest digestive capabilities for cellulose, hemicellulose and starch, and had the highest potential abilities for the biosynthesis of bile acids, fatty acids and amino acids. This suggests the microbiome aids in breaking down culm, which is more difficult for giant pandas to digest, as a means to compensate for the nutrient poor content of the culm. Genes related to fatty acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes were more abundant during the leaf stage diet than that in the shoot and culm stages. Thus, the microbiome may help giant pandas, which typically have low lipase levels, with fat digestion. These results illustrate that adaptive changes in the gut microbiome community and function may be an important mechanism to aid giant panda digestion when consuming different structural parts of bamboo.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0501701cNational Key Research Development Program  aCPF2017-10cChengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Foundation  a31470462cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a17TD0037cFunds for Creative Research Groups of Sichuan Provincial Education Department  a17YC357cTalent Foundation Project of China West Normal University 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3abamboos 3abile 3abiosynthesis 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acellulose 3aculms 3adiet 3adigestion 3afatty acid metabolism 3ahemicellulose 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aleaves 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3anutrient content 3astarch 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aXu, Qin1 aHsu, Walter H.1 aEsser, Stephan Schmitz1 aAyala, James1 aHou, Rong1 aYao, Ying1 aJiang, Dandan1 aYuan, Shibin1 aWang, Hairui0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.2998-3009dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02503-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013100158520107500289592002801364650002001392650001401412650002201426650002601448650002801474650002401502650001201526650001801538650001201556650001501568651002601583700001901609700001501628700001701643700001801660700002201678700001801700773012601718856007501844852000901919655001201928IND60771351820221120183034.0220325e20220223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077135182DNAL7 a10.3390/md200301602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kangyu 10aEffects of Structural and Compositional Changes of Nanochloropsis oceania after Enzyme Treatment on EPA-Rich Lipids Extraction  aImproved methods for the extraction of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an essential and economically important polyunsaturated fatty acid, are urgently required. However, lipid extraction rates using food-grade solvents such as ethanol are usually low. To improve the ethanol-based extraction rate, and to elucidate the relevant mechanisms, we used cellulase and laccase to treat powdered Nannochloropsis, one of the most promising microalgal sources of EPA. Cellulase and laccase synergistically increased lipid yields by 69.31% and lipid EPA content by 42.63%, by degrading the amorphous hemicellulose and cellulose, improving crystallinity, and promoting the release and extraction of lysodiacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine. Scanning electron microscopy showed that cell morphology was substantially altered, with cell-wall rupture, loss of cell boundaries, and the release of intracellular substances. In conclusion, Nannochloropsis lipid yields may be directly linked to cell-wall hemicellulose structure, and enzymatic treatment to alter this may improve lipid yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic treatment 3aethanol 3ahemicellulose 3alaccase 3amicroalgae 3aPacific Ocean Islands1 aZhang, Meilan 1 aTian, Hua 1 aLei, Fenfen 1 aHe, Dongping 1 aZheng, Jingcheng 1 aZhang, Liwei 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 20, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200301603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011900166520179800285592002802083650001202111650001202123650001602135650001902151650001002170650001602180653002602196653001602222653003702238653001602275653003602291700001802327700001402345773011902359856008802478852000902566655001202575IND60776780820221119090051.0220606e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1557002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yong10aHow reliable is chlorophyll-a as algae proxy in lake environments? New insights from the perspective of n-alkanes.  aChlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been employed as the “golden proxy” of algae biomass and algae cell densities in lake environments for many years. However, how reliable Chl-a is as algae proxy in lake environments needs further evaluation. Here, we take the eutrophic Lake Chaohu and 46 lakes and reservoirs across China as objects on temporal and spatial scales, respectively, to resolve this issue from the perspective of n-alkanes. Our results showed that Chl-a ranged from 10.5 to 735 μg∙L⁻¹ with a geometric mean of 92.4 μg∙L⁻¹ in Lake Chaohu. There were no statistically significant correlations between Chl-a and algae cell densities in all seasons (Pearson's correlation, p > 0.05), and also for macrophytes and terrestrial plants input (p > 0.05). It was related to the complex changes of environmental factors. By contrast, Chl-a ranged from 7.1 to 1608 μg∙L⁻¹ with a geometric mean of 125 μg∙L⁻¹ in nationwide lakes and reservoirs, and its occurrence was not only related to algae, but also associated with macrophytes and terrestrial plants (p < 0.05). In summary, Chl-a can be applied as an algae proxy, but its application is subject to certain restrictions. Besides, the multiple sources of Chl-a in lake environments may result in an overestimation of algae cell densities. Compared to Chl-a, biogenic n-heptadecane (bio C₁₇) could be regarded as a potential alternative. Hence, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of bio C₁₇ and Chl-a in the aspects of specificity, accuracy, sensitivity and applicability. We found that for most scenarios, their limitations could be surmounted by each other, but failed in some scenarios. Accordingly, an ensemble proxy system may be used for more reliable representation of algae in lake environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3amacrophytes 0aChlorophyll-a (Chl-a) 0aAlgae proxy 0aBiogenic n-heptadecane (Bio C17) 0aLake Chaohu 0aNationwide lakes and reservoirs1 aWang, Xiangyu1 aXu, Fuliu0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 836 p.155700-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1557003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005900169300001800228520182500246592002802071650001702099650001402116650001102130650002502141650001702166650001202183650001902195650002302214650001802237650001502255650002102270650001302291650001202304650002102316650002202337650002002359650001302379650001802392700002202410700002002432773010402452856008402556852000902640655001202649IND60086600420221121041501.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008660042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllison, David10aCarbon accounting and the climate politics of forestry  ap. 1062-1078.  aMany proposals have been made for the more successful inclusion of LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) in the Kyoto framework.

The presence of a significantly large “incentive gap” justifies the urgency of reforming the current LULUCF carbon accounting framework. In addition to significantly broadening the scope of carbon pools accounted under LULUCF, we recommend paying far greater attention to the troika of competing but potentially compatible interests surrounding the promotion of standing forests (in particular for the purposes of carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection and ecosystem promotion/ preservation), harvested wood products (HWP) and bioenergy use. The successful balancing of competing interests, the enhancement of efficiency and effectiveness and the balanced use of forest resources require an accounting mechanism that weighs and rewards each component according to its real climate mitigation potential. Further, our data suggest the benefits of such a broadly based carbon accounting strategy and the inclusion of LULUCF in national and international accounting and emission trading mechanisms far outweigh potential disadvantages. Political arguments suggesting countries could take advantage of LULUCF accounting to reduce their commitments are not supported by the evidence we present.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adeforestation 3aecosystems 3aforest resources 3aforestry 3aforests 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3apolitics 3awood products1 aLundblad, Mattias1 aPetersson, Hans0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2011 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.1062-1078dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04366naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245008300213520268800296592002802984650002403012650002703036650001503063650001803078650001303096650003003109650001103139650001003150650001703160650002003177650001803197650001303215650000903228650001803237650001103255650001503266651001303281651001003294651000903304651001703313651001203330651001303342651001203355653003503367653002103402700006703423700006103490700001903551700001703570700001703587773009703604856009003701852000903791655001203800IND60750135320221123042131.0211023e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1061332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSripa, Banchob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8899-591910aCurrent status of human liver fluke infections in the Greater Mekong Subregion  aThe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is a trans-national region of the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia comprising Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam home to more than 340 million people or almost 4.5% of the global population. Human liver fluke infections caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis have been major public health problems in this region for decades. Opisthorchiasis caused by O. viverrini is prevalent in Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and central-southern Vietnam with more than 12 million people infected. Clonorchiasis caused by C. sinensis is endemic in northern Vietnam and Guangxi with estimated 3.5 -5 million infected. The infections can cause several liver and biliary diseases such as cholangitis, periductal fibrosis, gallstones, and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a fatal bile duct cancer. Key determinants of the geographical distribution differences of the two liver fluke species are snail species and geographic barriers. Main risk behaviour of the infections is the culture of eating raw fish “the raw attitude” of people in the GMS, especially the Tai/Dai/Thai/Laos ethnic groups, the major population in the GMS. Over the past 20 years, there is a big change in prevalence of the infections. Opisthorchiasis has long been endemic, particularly in northern and northeastern Thailand and Lao PDR with over 8-10 million cases estimated. However, after several rounds of national campaign against opisthorchiasis using integrated control approach in Thailand over the past three decades, the prevalence of O. viverrini infection has reduced from over 15% in 1996 to 2.2% in 2019. High prevalence of O. viverrini infection continues in Lao PDR and central Vietnam. Emerging high prevalence, up to a maximum of 47.5%, has been noted in Cambodia during the past 10 years possibly due to more studies being conducted rather than increasing prevalence. O. viverrini infection has now also been reported in Lower Myanmar in recent years. Clonorchiasis has been known in northern Vietnam and southern China for a long time. Several surveys have reported infections in Guangxi in the last 10 years, and until now liver fluke infected cases have not been reported in Yunnan. Overall, nowadays, there is a shift in high risk areas for GMS liver fluke infection from northeastern Thailand to Lao PDR, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Guangxi P.R. China. Urgent systematic disease mapping and integrated liver fluke control using One Health approaches should be implemented nationwide in GMS countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClonorchis sinensis 3aOpisthorchis viverrini 3abile ducts 3aclonorchiasis 3afibrosis 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aliver 3aliver flukes 3aopisthorchiasis 3apublic health 3araw fish 3arisk 3arisk behavior 3asnails 3awatersheds 3aCambodia 3aChina 3aLaos 3aMekong River 3aMyanmar 3aThailand 3aVietnam 0aGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) 0aInfection status1 aSuwannatrai, Apiporn T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3722-14271 aSayasone, Somphou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-95671 aDo, Dung Trung1 aKhieu, Virak1 aYang, Yichao0 tActa tropica.g2021 Dec., v. 224 p.106133-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1061333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010600208300001800314520149500332592002801827596008301855596015501938650002002093650001702113650002702130650002502157650002102182650001702203650002102220650001702241650001102258650001802269650003002287650001502317650002102332650000902353650001502362700002802377700006302405773011102468856008302579852000902662655001202671IND60744903220221120230030.0210815e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074490322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02564-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfilasari, Nisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8978-216510aGut Health Function of Instant Dehydrated Rice Sticks Substituted with Resistant Starch Types 2 and 4  ap. 3010-3019.  aThe purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of instant dehydrated rice sticks (IDRS) which were substituted with resistant starch (RS) types 2 and 4 whose gut health function targets gut microbiota. IDRS are a type of rice noodles that were developed by two formulations. The first formulation had substitution of rice flour with 20% RS type 2 and 0.15% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (RSc-2), and the second formulation had 25% RS type 4 and 0.15% CMC (RSc-4). RSc-2 and RSc-4 were investigated for gut health function by human fecal fermentation in a pH-controlled batch culture. The results of gut microbiota enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed that significantly (P < 0.05) higher numbers of bifidobacteria were obtained with RSc-2 (10.06 ± 0.09 log cells/mL) and RSc-4 (10.00 ± 0.06 log cells/mL) compared to the control (100% rice flour formula) at 24 h fermentation. Additionally, the prebiotic indexes of RSc-2 and RSc-4 were 3.8 and 2.8 -fold higher than that of the control at 24 h fermentation. The short-chained fatty acids, acetic, propionic and butyric acid were analyzed by gas chromatography–flame ionization detector. The butyric acids were significantly (P < 0.05) higher with RSc-2 (43.56 ± 0.01 mM) and RSc-4 (43.63 ± 0.07 mM) compared to the control at 24 h. Thus, RSc-2 and RSc-4 showed butyrogenic, bifidogenic and prebiotic potential to support gut health and could aid in prevention of colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  aTEH-AC 008/2018cThailand Education Hub for Southern Region of ASEAN Countries  a2561/016cInstitute of Food Research Innovation, Prince of Songkla University and Thai Preserved Food Factory Company Limited, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand 3aBifidobacterium 3abutyric acid 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adigestive system 3afermentation 3aflame ionization 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aprebiotics 3aresistant starch 3arice 3arice flour1 aSirivongpaisal, Piyarat1 aWichienchot, Santad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8352-79210 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.3010-3019dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02564-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011400172520136500286592002801651650002201679650001401701650001001715650001001725650001301735650001501748650000901763650002401772650001701796650001801813651001001831653002401841653001601865653001401881700001701895700001801912700001901930700001201949700001601961700001801977700001501995700001702010700001702027700001602044700001802060773009702078856009002175852000902265655001202274IND60750135420221123020542.0211023e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1061342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yehua10aMolecular detection and genetic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii in pork from Chongqing, southwest China  aRaw or undercooked meat is an important source of Toxoplasma gondii infection in China, but there is little research data on these infections in Chongqing. This study determined the prevalence of T. gondii, and its genotypes, in pork. A total of 1,223 diaphragm muscle samples were collected from eight slaughterhouses and 79 markets and detected by PCR amplification of the ITS gene. All of the positive samples were used for genotype identification by PCR-RFLP with 11 genetic markers. The total positive rate of T. gondii in Chongqing pork was 8.7%, and differences in T. gondii infection rates were found between different districts (0%–23.3%), seasons (e.g., 4.3% from Spring, 7.3% from Summer, 11.4% from Autumn, 12.0% from Winter) and years (2.7%–14.3%). Six samples were successfully genotyped, of which one was identified as ToxoDB#9 and five were ToxoDB#9-like. This was the first continuous study about the prevalence of T. gondii in pork in Chongqing for several years. Slaughterhouses in different districts, pork source, farm scale, season and year were potential risk factors for T. gondii contamination by the univariate logistic regression, and using multivariate logistic regression districts, pork source and year were the independent risk factor. These data may help reducing the levels of toxoplasmosis in pigs and humans in Chongqing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3adiaphragm 3afarms 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3apork 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3atoxoplasmosis 3aChina 0aMolecular detection 0aRisk factor 0aChongqing1 aXie, Jianhua1 aMi, Rongsheng1 aLing, Hongquan1 aLuo, Lu1 aJia, Haiyan1 aZhang, Xiaoli1 aHuang, Yan1 aGong, Haiyan1 aHan, Xiangan1 aZeng, Zheng1 aChen, Zhaoguo0 tActa tropica.g2021 Dec., v. 224 p.106134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1061343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013500167300001600302500002000318520174400338592002802082596007502110596005902185596009502244650002702339650001302366650001302379650001702392650001302409650001602422650002102438650002502459650001202484650001702496650001002513650002102523650001002544650001902554650001102573650001202584650001902596650002202615650001602637650002002653650001002673650002502683650002202708650001002730650001302740650001002753700002102763700001302784700002002797700006402817773011602881856007902997852000903076655001203085IND60696475320221120023941.0200526e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069647532DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.126772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Wei‐Ning10aMolecular and functional characterization of three odorant‐binding proteins from the wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana  ap. 721-734.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSitodiplosis mosellana, a periodic but devastating wheat pest, relies on wheat spike volatiles as a cue in selecting hosts for oviposition. Insect odorant‐binding proteins (OBPs) are thought to play essential roles in filtering, binding and transporting hydrophobic odorant molecules to specific receptors. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying S. mosellana olfaction are poorly understood. Here, three S. mosellana antenna‐specific OBP genes, SmosOBP11, 16 and 21, were cloned and bacterially expressed. Binding properties of the recombinant proteins to 28 volatiles emitted from wheat spikes were investigated using fluorescence competitive binding assays. Sequence analysis suggested that these SmosOBPs belong to the Classic OBP subfamily. Ligand‐binding analysis showed that all three SmosOBPs preferentially bound alcohol, ester and ketone compounds, and SmosOBP11 and 16 also selectively bound terpenoid compounds. In particular, the three SmosOBPs had high binding affinities (Kᵢ < 20 μmol/L) to 3‐hexanol and cis‐3‐hexenylacetate that elicited strong electroantennogram (EAG) response from female antennae. In addition, SmosOBP11 displayed significantly higher binding (Kᵢ < 8 μmol/L) than SmosOBP16 and 21 to 1‐octen‐3‐ol, D‐panthenol, α‐pinene and heptyl acetate which elicited significant EAG response, suggesting that SmosOBP11 plays a major role in recognition and transportation of these volatiles. These findings have provided important insight into the molecular mechanism by which S. mosellana specifically recognizes plant volatiles for host selection, and have facilitated identification of effective volatile attractants that are potentially useful for pest monitoring and trapping.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0200402cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31371933cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018NY‐07cScience and Technology Planning Project of Yangling Demonstration Zone, China 3aSitodiplosis mosellana 3aTriticum 3aacetates 3aalpha-pinene 3aantennae 3aattractants 3abinding capacity 3aelectroantennography 3afemales 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3ahydrophobicity 3amidges 3aoctenol 3aodor compounds 3aodorant receptors 3aoviposition 3apest monitoring 3apests 3arecombinant proteins 3asequence analysis 3asmell 3atrapping 3awheat1 aZhang, Yu‐Dong1 aLiu, Wei1 aLi, Guang‐Wei1 aZhu‐Salzman, Keyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2443-43270 tInsect science.g2020 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.721-734dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.126773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245008800210300001600298506007600314520057500390592002800965506003700993650001601030650001301046650001701059650002301076650001401099650001201113650001501125650002001140700001701160773012501177856007901302852000901381655001201390IND60300844220221207112138.0150703e20130111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030084422DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12307212doi7 aPMC37254572pmcid7 a233077352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdegaard, Justin I.10aPleiotropic Actions of Insulin Resistance and Inflammation in Metabolic Homeostasis  ap. 172-177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetabolism and immunity are inextricably linked both to each other and to organism-wide function, allowing mammals to adapt to changes in their internal and external environments.

An appreciation of the adaptive context in which these responses arose is useful for understanding their pathogenic actions in disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alifestyle 3amammals 3ametabolism 3aobesogenic diet1 aChawla, Ajay0 tScience.g2013 Jan. 11, v. 339, no. 6116 p.172-177dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12307213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04157naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245011800182520258600300592002802886650002202914650002702936650001302963650001202976650001302988650002003001650001703021650001903038650002403057650001303081650001903094650001603113650002103129650001403150650001403164650001903178650001703197650001403214650001103228650002003239650002203259650001603281651001203297653002203309700002303331700001803354700002603372773013003398856009003528852000903618655001203627IND60674165820221121004224.0200217e20200316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067416582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1083852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDygico, Lionel Kenneth14aThe ability of Listeria monocytogenes to form biofilm on surfaces relevant to the mushroom production environment  aDue to its ubiquitous nature, Listeria monocytogenes is a threat to all fresh fruits and vegetables, including mushrooms, which are Ireland's largest horticultural crop. Although fresh cultivated mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) have not been previously linked with listeriosis outbreaks, the pathogen still poses a threat to the industry, particularly due to its ability to form biofilms. This threat is highlighted by the multiple recalls of mushroom products caused by L. monocytogenes contamination and by previous studies demonstrating that L. monocytogenes is present in the mushroom production environment. In this study, the biofilm formation potential of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the mushroom production environment was investigated on materials and at temperatures relevant to mushroom production. A preliminary assessment of biofilm formation of 73 mushroom industry isolates was undertaken using a crystal violet assay on polystyrene microtitre plates. The biofilm formation of a subset (n = 7) of these strains was then assessed on twelve different materials, including materials that are representative of the materials commonly found in the mushroom production environments, using the CDC biofilm reactor. Vertical scanning interferometry was used to determine the surface roughness of the chosen materials. All the strains tested using the CDC biofilm reactor were able to form biofilms on the different surfaces tested but material type was found to be a key determining factor on the levels of biofilm formed. Stainless steel, aluminium, rubber, polypropylene and polycarbonate were all able to support biofilm levels in the range of 4–4.9 log₁₀ CFU/cm², for seven different L. monocytogenes strains. Mushroom industry-specific materials, including growing nets and tarpaulins, were found to support biofilms levels between 4.7 and 6.7 log₁₀ CFU/cm². Concrete was found to be of concern as it supported 7.7 log₁₀ CFU/cm² of biofilm for the same strains; however, sealing the concrete resulted in an approximately 2-log reduction in biofilm levels. The surface roughness of the materials varied greatly between the materials (0.7–3.5 log₁₀ Ra) and was found to have a positive correlation with biofilm formation (rₛ = 0.573) although marginally significant (P = 0.051). The results of this study indicate that L. monocytogenes can readily form biofilms on mushroom industry relevant surfaces, and additionally identifies surfaces of specific concern, where rigorous cleaning and disinfection is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aaluminum 3abiofilm 3aconcrete 3acrop production 3adisinfection 3agentian violet 3ahorticultural crops 3aindustry 3ainterferometry 3alisteriosis 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apathogens 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3araw fruit 3arubber 3astainless steel 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3aIreland 0aMushroom industry1 aGahan, Cormac G.M.1 aGrogan, Helen1 aBurgess, Catherine M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Mar. 16, v. 317 p.108385-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1083853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010500167300002000272520110000292592002801392596009601420596011001516650005001626650001401676650001701690650001301707650002001720650001701740650001801757650001201775650001801787650002201805650001901827650001301846650001401859650001601873650001701889700002201906700002301928700009201951700001902043700002202062700006302084773017302147856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60791737820221118163044.0220831e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079173782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c016842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalakhova, Irina10aFlow-Through Polyethylenimine/ZnS Supermacroporous Composite for Hg(II) Uptake at ppb Concentrations  ap. 12754-12763.  aFlow-through supermacroporous monoliths (cryogels) for Hg(II) ion uptake have been fabricated by cross-linking polyethylenimine (PEI) at subzero temperature and in situ functionalization with zinc sulfide nanoparticles to enhance the efficiency of sorption performance. The synergetic effect of Hg(II) chelation by the PEI matrix and ion exchange on ZnS allowed one to reach with a composite cryogel the decontamination factor of >10⁵ and the Hg(II) residual concentration of <2 μg/L, which are set by U.S. EPA for mercury discharge to the aqueous environment. Under the same sorption conditions, an unmodified PEI cryogel allowed reducing the Hg(II) concentration down to 3.9 ± 0.3 μg/L, which complies with WHO requirements for drinking water. The effective dynamic sorption capacity at the Hg(II) breakpoint of 6 μg/L was more than twice higher for the PEI/ZnS cryogel than for the unmodified PEI cryogel, while the static sorption capacities of both the PEI cryogel (1214 mg/g) and PEI/ZnS cryogel (1478 mg/g) were significantly higher in comparison with previously reported materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a20-53-76016c, Russian Foundation for Basic Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002261  aFWFN(0205)-2022-0002cFar East Branch, Russian Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006421 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3achelation 3acrosslinking 3acryogels 3adecontamination 3aion exchange 3aion transport 3amercury 3ananoparticles 3apolyethyleneimine 3aprocess design 3asorption 3asynergism 3atemperature 3azinc sulfide1 aParotkina, Yuliya1 aEliseikina, Marina1 aMyronenko, Oleksandrq(Oleksandr Vitaliĭovych),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3590-474X1 aPrivar, Yuliya1 aElovskiy, Evgeniy1 aBratskaya, Svetlana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4954-04220 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 61, no. 34 p.12754-12763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c016843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011500160520175700275592002802032650001502060650001102075650001302086650002502099650002302124650001202147650001502159650001702174650001702191650002002208650002802228650001702256700002202273700001802295700002702313700001902340700002002359700002202379700002902401700002602430700002302456773012602479856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60771352220221120172834.0220325e20220313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077135222DNAL7 a10.3390/md200302082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Ishtiaq 10aExploring Marine as a Rich Source of Bioactive Peptides: Challenges and Opportunities from Marine Pharmacology  aThis review highlights the underexplored potential and promises of marine bioactive peptides (MBPs) with unique structural, physicochemical, and biological activities to fight against the current and future human pathologies. A particular focus is given to the marine environment as a significant source to obtain or extract high-value MBPs from touched/untouched sources. For instance, marine microorganisms, including microalgae, bacteria, fungi, and marine polysaccharides, are considered prolific sources of amino acids at large, and peptides/polypeptides in particular, with fundamental structural sequence and functional entities of a carboxyl group, amine, hydrogen, and a variety of R groups. Thus, MBPs with tunable features, both structural and functional entities, along with bioactive traits of clinical and therapeutic value, are of ultimate interest to reinforce biomedical settings in the 21st century. On the other front, as the largest biome globally, the marine biome is the so-called “epitome of untouched or underexploited natural resources” and a considerable source with significant potentialities. Therefore, considering their biological and biomedical importance, researchers around the globe are redirecting and/or regaining their interests in valorizing the marine biome-based MBPs. This review focuses on the widespread bioactivities of MBPs, FDA-approved MBPs in the market, sustainable development goals (SDGs), and legislation to valorize marine biome to underlying the impact role of bioactive elements with the related pathways. Finally, a detailed overview of current challenges, conclusions, and future perspectives is also given to satisfy the stimulating demands of the pharmaceutical sector of the modern world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3alaws and regulations 3amarine environment 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 3apharmacology 3apolypeptides 3apolysaccharides 3asustainable development 3atherapeutics1 aAsgher, Muhammad 1 aSher, Farooq 1 aHussain, Syed Makhdoom1 aNazish, Nadia 1 aJoshi, Navneet 1 aSharma, Ashutosh 1 aParra Saldivar, Roberto,1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 is endemic in commercial pig farms worldwide that act as a reservoir. Pig-to-human transmission may occur when infectious animals enter the food chain at slaughter, through consumption of contaminated meat, direct exposure or use of by-products. To reduce the fraction of infectious animals at slaughter age and thus the risk for public health, it is important to understand the transmission dynamics of HEV in pig populations. In this study, we estimate the transmission rate parameter and mean infectious period of HEV in pigs from field data, using a Bayesian analysis. The data were collected in ten commercial pig herds that are each divided into three different age groups. Two transmission models were compared, assuming that animals are infected either locally by their group mates or globally by any infectious animal regardless of its group. For local and global transmission, the transmission rate parameters were 0.11 (posterior median with 95% credible interval: 0.092–0.14day⁻¹) and 0.16 (0.082–0.29day⁻¹), the mean infectious periods were 24 (18–33) days and 27 (20–39) days and the reproduction numbers were 2.7 (2.2–3.6) and 4.3 (2.8–6.9). Based on these results, global transmission is considered to be the more conservative model. Three effects of vaccination were explored separately. When vaccination is not sufficient to eliminate the virus, a shorter mean infectious period decreases the fraction of infectious animals at slaughter age, whereas a reduced transmission rate parameter adversely increases it. With a reduced susceptibility, vaccination of animals at a later age can be a better strategy than early vaccination. These effects should be taken into account in vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage at slaughter 3aOrthohepevirus A 3arisk 3apublic health 3areproduction 3adirect contact 3ahepatitis E 3aherds 3afarms 3ameat 3amodels 3abyproducts 3aBayesian theory 3aviruses 3agenotype 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3afood chain 3aswine 0aHepatitis E virus1 aBerto, A.1 aMcCreary, C.1 aMartelli, F.1 avan der Poel, W.H.M.0 tEpidemics.g2012 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.86-92dElsevier B.V.x1755-43657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245007100162300001600233520055700249592002800806650002800834650002400862650002200886700001600908700001800924700001800942700001800960700001500978700001700993700001301010700001601023700001801039700002201057700001901079773012501098856007901223852000901302655001201311IND60300844420221123013651.0150703e20130111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030084442DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12268972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatridge, M.10aQuantum Back-Action of an Individual Variable-Strength Measurement  ap. 178-181.  aTracking Quantum Evolution The actual process of measuring a quantum system has an effect on the result making the outcome unpredictable.

The obtained freeze-dried cryogels yield thermal conductivity of 23 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹, with specific surface area of 369.4 m² g⁻¹, and porosity of 96.7%, whereas ambient-pressure-dried aerogels exhibit thermal conductivity of 23.6 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹, specific surface area of 473.8 m² g⁻¹, and porosity of 97.4%. In addition, the fiber-reinforced nanocomposites obtained via freeze-drying feature a low thermal conductivity (28.0 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹) and high mechanical properties (∼620 kPa maximum compressive stress and Young's modulus of 715 kPa), coupled with advanced flame-retardant capabilities, while the composite materials from the ambient pressure drying process have thermal conductivity of 28.8 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹, ∼200 kPa maximum compressive stress and Young's modulus of 612 kPa respectively. The aforementioned results highlight the capabilities of both drying processes for the development of thermal insulation materials for energy-efficient applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aambient pressure 3acryogels 3aenergy efficiency 3afreeze drying 3ainsulating materials 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface area 3athermal conductivity1 aGuo, Zipeng1 aAn, Lu1 aArmstrong, Jason N.1 aZhou, Chi1 aRen, Shenqiang0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 12, no. 33 p.21213-21222dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra03325a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245014100200300002000341520114400361592002801505596009801533650001401631650002001645650001901665650002401684650001901708650001201727650002201739650001601761700001701777700001601794700001401810773017301824856008101997852000902078655001202087IND60791737920221118163038.0220831e20220811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079173792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c017292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6931-576X10aExperimental and Theoretical Study of the Impact of Operating Conditions on Catalytic Propane Dehydrogenation in a Fluidized Bed Reactor  ap. 12434-12447.  aThe catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was carried out in a bench-scale fluidized bed utilizing both experimental and computational methods. In order to investigate the reaction kinetics of CrOₓ-based catalysts, an Eulerian numerical model was utilized in conjunction with a modified energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) drag model. On the basis of which, the effects of the catalyst packing temperature, the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and the PDH catalyst composition on propane conversion were evaluated. The results revealed that, when the catalyst packing temperature increased from 823 to 923 K, the conversion rose by 104.93, 121.91, and 134.51%, for the inlet propane WHSVs of 1.24, 2.49, and 3.73 h–¹, respectively. With increasing the propane WHSV from 1.24 to 4.98 h–¹, the conversion dropped by 52.72, 45.62, and 39.35 %, for catalyst temperatures of 848, 873, and 923 K, respectively. The conversions with the CrOₓ-based catalyst were 1.5 to 2.5 times that of the Pt-based catalyst. Multivariate correlation for propane conversion was fitted, yielding an average discrepancy of 4.38%.  aPublisher supplied data  a51676146cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3afluidized beds 3amathematical models 3aprocess design 3apropane 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aWang, Jiarui1 aWang, Simin1 aWen, Jian0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 11, v. 61, no. 34 p.12434-12447dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c017293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014700168300002000315520129500335592002801630650001301658650001401671650001701685650001801702650001301720650001701733650001201750650001101762650001701773650001301790650000701803650002001810650002201830650001601852700002401868700002801892700003401920700001801954700003001972700003802002700003402040700002902074700003302103700002202136773012502158856007502283852000902358655001202367IND60786616920221120155206.0220805e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078661692DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra03346a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodínez-Loyola, Yokari10aCasiopeinas® third generation, with indomethacin: synthesis, characterization, DFT studies, antiproliferative activity, and nanoencapsulation  ap. 21662-21673.  aSeven new Casiopeinas® were synthesized and properly characterized. These novel compounds have a general formula [Cu(N–N)(Indo)]NO₃, where Indo is deprotonated indomethacin and N–N is either bipyridine or phenanthroline with some methyl-substituted derivatives, belonging to the third generation of Casiopeinas®. Spectroscopic characterization suggests a square-based pyramid geometry and voltammetry experiments indicate that the redox potential is strongly dependent on the N–N ligand. All the presented compounds show high cytotoxic efficiency, and most of them exhibit higher efficacy compared to the well-known cisplatin drug and acetylacetonate analogs of the first generation. Computational calculations show that antiproliferative behavior can be directly related to the volume of the molecules. Besides, a chitosan (CS)–polyacrylamide (PNIPAAm) nanogel was synthesized and characterized to examine the encapsulation and release properties of the [Cu(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(Indo)]NO₃ compound. The results show good encapsulation performance in acidic conditions and a higher kinetic drug release in acidic media than at neutral pH. This result can be described by the Peppas–Sahlin model and indicates a release mechanism predominantly by Fick diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acisplatin 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3ageometry 3aindomethacin 3aligands 3amodels 3ananocapsules 3ananogels 3apH 3aredox potential 3aspectral analysis 3avoltammetry1 aGracia-Mora, Jesús1 aRojas-Montoya, Iván D.1 aHernández-Ayala, Luis Felipe1 aReina, Miguel1 aOrtiz-Frade, Luis Antonio1 aRascón-Valenzuela, Luisa Alondra1 aRobles-Zepeda, Ramón Enrique1 aGómez-Vidales, Virginia1 aBernad-Bernad, María Josefa1 aRuiz-Azuara, Lena0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 03, v. 12, no. 33 p.21662-21673dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra03346a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014000160520199800300592002802298650002402326650003702350650002502387650002802412650001902440650001002459650001202469650001802481650001302499650003102512650001402543650001902557650001902576650001702595650002202612650001802634650001802652700001702670700001802687700001802705773012602723856007502849852000902924655001202933IND60771349220221120130636.0220325e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077134922DNAL7 a10.3390/md200301812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwack, Kyu Hwan10aFucoidan (Undaria pinnatifida)/Polydopamine Composite-Modified Surface Promotes Osteogenic Potential of Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells  aFucoidan, a marine-sulfated polysaccharide derived from brown algae, has been recently spotlighted as a natural biomaterial for use in bone formation and regeneration. Current research explores the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of fucoidan-based composites for bone tissue engineering applications. The utility of fucoidan in a bone tissue regeneration environment necessitates a better understanding of how fucoidan regulates osteogenic processes at the molecular level. Therefore, this study designed a fucoidan and polydopamine (PDA) composite-based film for use in a culture platform for periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and explored the prominent molecular pathways induced during osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs through transcriptome profiling. Characterization of the fucoidan/PDA-coated culture polystyrene surface was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The osteogenic differentiation of the PDLSCs cultured on the fucoidan/PDA composite was examined through alkaline phosphatase activity, intracellular calcium levels, matrix mineralization assay, and analysis of the mRNA and protein expression of osteogenic markers. RNA sequencing was performed to identify significantly enriched and associated molecular networks. The culture of PDLSCs on the fucoidan/PDA composite demonstrated higher osteogenic potency than that on the control surface. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (n = 348) were identified during fucoidan/PDA-induced osteogenic differentiation by RNA sequencing. The signaling pathways enriched in the DEGs include regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and Ras-related protein 1 and phosphatidylinositol signaling. These pathways represent cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization functions that are significantly involved in the osteogenic process. These results suggest that a fucoidan/PDA composite promotes the osteogenic potential of PDLSCs by activation of critical molecular pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3abones 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3afucoidan 3agene expression regulation 3aligaments 3amicrofilaments 3amineralization 3apolystyrenes 3aprotein synthesis 3atissue repair 3atranscriptome1 aJi, Ju Young1 aPark, Borami 1 aHeo, Jung Sun0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 20, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200301813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245020700161300001800368500001900386500002000405520161400425592002802039596005902067596007002126596006402196650002102260650001502281650001802296650001002314650001102324650002602335650002902361650001502390650003502405650002902440700001902469700001902488700005402507773013502561856007802696852000902774655001202783IND60696472220221122122046.0200526e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069647222DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2019009342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Fengying10aDetermination of lipid mediators in breast cancer cells using lyophilization‒supercritical fluid extraction online coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography‒quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1800-1807.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA lyophilization‒supercritical fluid extraction coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography‒quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry online method was developed for the determination of lipid mediators in breast cancer cells. Supercritical fluid extraction was applied to the cell samples for the first time due to the use of lyophilization. The conditions of supercritical fluid extraction and supercritical fluid chromatography‒quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry were investigated systematically. Under the optimized conditions, all the calibration curves for the lipid mediators showed good linearity (correlation coefficient > 0.99). The limits of detection and the limits of quantification were in the range of 0.190‒5.36 pg and 0.560‒16.2 pg, respectively. The recoveries were in the range of 70.3‒125%. The relative standard deviations of the precision ranged from 1.49‒18.7% and the accuracies were higher than 84%. Compared with liquid‒liquid extraction coupled with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry method, the present approach reduced the manual labor and obtained higher sensitivity as well as higher extraction recoveries for all 15 lipid mediators. Finally, the online method was applied to the quantification of lipid mediators in breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells. On the basis of the results, this lyophilization‒supercritical fluid extraction online coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography‒quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry method showed great promise in the analysis of lipid mediators in complex biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a21775047cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018MS55cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a201806010055cPearl River S and T Nova Program of Guangzhou 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelium 3afreeze drying 3alabor 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aseparation 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aZhong, Qisheng1 aLiang, Yanshan1 aZhou, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2276-79420 tJournal of separation science.g2020 May, v. 43, no. 9-10 p.1800-1807dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2019009343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04909naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010200177500001900279520345700298592002803755650001603783650001203799650001303811650001203824650001903836650001603855650001603871650001103887650001303898650001203911650001903923651001603942653002303958653003303981653002304014653003004037653000904067653000804076700002004084700001704104700002304121700001904144700001904163700001804182773010704200856008704307852000904394655001204403IND60727698820221120103748.0210401e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072769882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1181832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Swaluw, Eric10aTrend analysis of reduced nitrogen components over the Netherlands with the EMEP4NL and OPS model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeclining ammonia emissions are not always reflected in ammonia concentrations due to physicochemical processes and meteorology. Here we present a trend analysis of reduced nitrogen components over the Netherlands using two different types of atmospheric transport models: the Eulerian grid model EMEP/MSC-W and the plume model OPS.We employ calculations with the Eulerian grid model EMEP/MSC-W for the Netherlands in its EMEP4NL configuration. Using the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model as meteorological driver plus detailed emission data over the Netherlands as input into the EMEP4NL model, we present simulation results over the Netherlands of reduced nitrogen components from this model at a horizontal resolution of 1.3 × 2.1 km.Using this configuration of the EMEP/MSC-W model (EMEP4NL), a trend analysis is performed over the period 2006–2015 for concentration and deposition of reduced nitrogen components over the Netherlands. The same analysis is performed with the OPS-model, a plume model with a Lagrangian trajectory model for long range transport. Both models use the same MACC III emission distribution for countries outside of the Netherlands, and spatially more detailed emissions for the Netherlands itself. Emission totals per SNAP (Supporting National Action and Planning) sector per country are used over the period 2006–2015, according to the latest CEIP (Centre on Emissions Inventories and Projections) expert estimates. The OPS-model is driven with yearly specific meteorological fields provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). Furthermore, the OPS-model parameterizes its chemistry, whereas EMEP4NL uses a state-of-the-art chemistry scheme.Results from ammonia concentrations, ammonium concentrations and wet deposition as calculated with both models, are first compared with observations from the National Air Quality Monitoring Network in the Netherland (LML). Calculations of ammonia and wet deposition both agree well with the measurements in the OPS and the EMEP4NL model. Ammonium is better represented by calculations with the EMEP4NL model than by the OPS-model. Measurements of dry deposition of reduced nitrogen are very limited, therefore only a comparison is made between the model results of EMEP4NL and OPS.Subsequently, a trend analysis is performed over the period 2006–2015 for the reduced nitrogen components for both model calculation results and the measurements. The trends of all components are calculated over the mean values of monitoring stations over the Netherlands. The reported decline in the emissions of ammonia is not reflected in the ammonia concentrations and wet deposition of reduced nitrogen as measured and calculated with the OPS and the EMEP4NL model. Ammonium concentrations on the other hand are declining (also) due to the decrease of the SOₓ emissions over the period 2006–2015. Finally, both models show a slight decline in the dry deposition values, despite the fact that both models (and observations) do not show a decrease in the ammonia concentrations. A more detailed analysis of the comparison of dry deposition of reduced nitrogen between both models, and the influence of the physicochemical processes and meteorology is in preparation. Overall, it is found that the calculated trends for the different reduced nitrogen components with a grid model like EMEP4NL and a plume model like OPS are roughly in line with each other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonia 3aammonium 3adecline 3adry deposition 3aenvironment 3ameteorology 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aweather 3awet deposition 3aNetherlands 0aEulerian modelling 0aSecondary inorganic aerosols 0aParticulate matter 0aSource-receptor modelling 0aEMEP 0aOPS1 ade Vries, Wilco1 aSauter, Ferd1 aWichink Kruit, Roy1 aVieno, Massimo1 aFagerli, Hilde1 avan Pul, Addo0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 248 p.118183-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1181833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245008400169520106700253592002801320650002301348650001701371650001001388650003201398650001501430650001601445650001701461650001001478650002101488650001801509651001001527653001901537653001901556653002401575653002701599700001901626700001801645700002301663700001801686700002001704700001801724773011801742856008801860852000901948655001201957IND60674162920221120130443.0191118e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067416292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.1048022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Zhihao10aAntimicrobial usage on 72 farrow-to-finish pig farms in Japan from 2015 to 2017  aIn Japan veterinary antimicrobials are used most in the pig production sector. However, there is a paucity of data on the quantity of antimicrobials used on pig farms in Japan. This study describes antimicrobial use on Japanese pig farms in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in terms of mg of active ingredient per kg of PCU (population correction unit). Data on antimicrobial use from a total of 72 farrow-to finish farms over these three years were used in the study. The results revealed that the average use of antimicrobials in 2015, 2016 and 2017 was 304.8 (SD = 226.3), 311.2 (SD = 241.0) and 342.9 (SD = 291.3) mg/kg PCU, respectively. Most (97%) of the antimicrobials were administered orally. The most commonly used antimicrobials were tetracyclines, followed by macrolides, penicillins and sulfonamides. Tohoku was the region in which the lowest quantities of antimicrobial were used whilst South Kanto was the region in which the largest amount was used. The use of antimicrobials was on the increase in the North Kanto, South Kanto and Kyushu regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3adrug therapy 3afarms 3alivestock and meat industry 3amacrolides 3apenicillins 3asulfonamides 3aswine 3aswine production 3atetracyclines 3aJapan 0aPig production 0aAntimicrobials 0aAntimicrobial usage 0aFarrow-to-finish farms1 aTakagi, Hiroko1 aYamane, Itsuo1 aYamazaki, Hisanori1 aNaito, Megumi1 aKure, Katsumasa1 aPīko,d1945-0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 173 p.104802-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.1048023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013800171520145700309592002801766650001801794650002901812650002501841650001701866650001501883650001101898650001601909650002401925650002101949650001701970650001501987650001002002650001102012700002302023700002302046700002302069700002402092700002202116773012502138856008302263852000902346655001202355IND60732044420221119185752.0210326e20210323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073204442DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70100432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChecchia, Ilaria 10aUnravelling the Impact of Grape Washing, SO2, and Multi-Starter Inoculation in Lab-Scale Vinification Trials of Withered Black Grapes  aWine quality is strongly affected by chemical composition and microbial population of grape must, which, in turn, are influenced by several post-harvest treatments, including grape withering. Different strategies have been suggested to manage the fermenting must microbiota, as it plays a central role in the outcomes of both spontaneous and guided fermentations. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of grape washing, SO₂ addition, and selected starter culture inoculation on population dynamics, fermentation kinetics, and main oenological parameters in lab-scale trials, focusing on withered grapes usually used for Amarone production. Although grape washing treatment was effective in removing heavy metals and undesirable microorganisms from grape berry surface, inoculation of multi-starter cultures impacted more fermentation rates. Further, both grape washing and starter inoculation procedures had a remarkable impact on wine chemical characteristics, while 30 mg/L SO₂ addition did not significantly affect the fermentation process. In summary, the best strategy in terms of limiting off-flavors and potentially reducing the need for SO₂ addition in wine from withered grapes was the use of yeast starters, particularly mixed cultures composed by selected strains of Metschnikowia spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Application of a washing step before winemaking showed a potential to improve organoleptic characteristics of wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetschnikowia 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3achemical composition 3afermentation 3agrape must 3agrapes 3aoff flavors 3apopulation dynamics 3astarter cultures 3awine quality 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts1 aBinati, Renato  L.1 aTroiano, Eleonora 1 aUgliano, Maurizio 1 aFelis, Giovanna  E.1 aTorriani, Sandra 0 tFermentation.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70100433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245012700203300001800330500002000348520167700368592002802045596005802073596003402131650001402165650001502179650001002194650001302204650001502217650001302232650001702245651001702262700006202279773013102341856007702472852000902549655001202558IND60789737820221116171824.0220822e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078973782DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0150062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRalston, David K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0774-310110aResponse to Channel Deepening of the Salinity Intrusion, Estuarine Circulation, and Stratification in an Urbanized Estuary  ap. 4784-4802.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aModifications for navigation since the late 1800s have increased channel depth (H) in the lower Hudson River estuary by 10–30%, and at the mouth the depth has more than doubled. Observations along the lower estuary show that both salinity and stratification have increased over the past century. Model results comparing predredging bathymetry from the 1860s with modern conditions indicate an increase in the salinity intrusion of about 30%, which is roughly consistent with the H⁵/³ scaling expected from theory for salt flux dominated by steady exchange. While modifications including a recent deepening project have been concentrated near the mouth, the changes increase salinity and threaten drinking water supplies more than 100 km landward. The deepening has not changed the responses to river discharge (Qᵣ) of the salinity intrusion (~Qᵣ⁻¹/³) or mean stratification (Qᵣ²/³). Surprisingly, the increase in salinity intrusion with channel deepening results in almost no change in the estuarine circulation. This contrasts sharply with local scaling based on local dynamics of an H² dependence, but it is consistent with a steady state salt balance that allows scaling of the estuarine circulation based on external forcing factors and is independent of depth. In contrast, the observed and modeled increases in stratification are opposite of expectations from the steady state balance, which could be due to reduction in mixing with loss of shallow subtidal regions. Overall, the mean shift in estuarine parameter space due to channel deepening has been modest compared with the monthly‐to‐seasonal variability due to tides and river discharge.  aPublisher supplied data  a1325136cNSF | GEO | Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE)  aOCE 1325136cNSF Coastal SEES 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3amouth 3aresearch 3ariver flow 3asalinity 3aurbanization 3aHudson River1 aGeyer, W.

The aim of this study was the identification and characterization of the probiotic potential of L. johnsonii CNCM I-4884, as well as its safety assessment. This strain was originally classified as Lactobacillus gasseri based on 16S gene sequence analysis. Whole genome sequencing led to a reclassification as L. johnsonii. A genome-wide search for biosynthetic pathways revealed a high degree of auxotrophy, balanced by large transport and catabolic systems. The strain also exhibits tolerance to low pH and bile salts and shows strong bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Sequencing results revealed the absence of antimicrobial resistance genes and other virulence factors. Phenotypic tests confirm that the strain is susceptible to a panel of 8 antibiotics of both human and animal relevance. Altogether, the in silico and in vitro results confirm that L. johnsonii CNCM I-4884 is well adapted to the gastrointestinal environment and could be safely used in probiotic formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus gasseri 3aLactobacillus johnsonii 3aanimal models 3aantibiotic resistance 3abile 3abiosynthesis 3acholoylglycine hydrolase 3acomputer simulation 3agastrointestinal system 3agiardiasis 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphenotype 3aprobiotics 3asafety assessment 3asequence analysis 3ataxonomic revisions 3avirulence1 aFlorent, Isabelle 1 aPolack, Bruno 1 aLangella, Philippe 1 aBermúdez-Humarán, Luis G.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100202733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013300173500001900306520130300325592002801628650000801656650001501664650001901679650001401698650002901712650002401741650001701765650001601782650002401798650002301822650001401845650001501859650001501874650001701889650000901906650002001915651001001935653001501945653002301960653001501983653002601998700001802024700005702042700002902099700002102128773010702149856008702256852000902343655001202352IND60727698920221120103807.0210401e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072769892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1182312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Antonio,10aIndoor air pesticide in dwellings of breastfeeding mothers of the Valencian Region (Spain): Levels, exposure and risk assessment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study assessed the inhalation risk associated with indoor pesticide concentrations in the dwellings of 41 lactating mothers living in the Valencian Region, Spain, who were participants in the BETTERMILK project.Twenty-eight substances were investigated, including pyrethroid (PYRs), organophosphate (OPPs), and organochlorine (OCPs) pesticides. Bifenthrin, cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, permethrin and pyrimethanil were detected with frequencies ranging from 2% (malathion) to 80% (cypermethrin), and with an arithmetic mean concentration ranging from 4.1 ng m⁻³ (bifenthrin) to 12.1 ng m⁻³ (cypermethrin).The indoor air analysis was combined with several surveys to assess the possible relationships between indoor pesticide concentrations and the use of pesticides at home. Any of the evaluated pesticides were significantly associated with the evaluated variables (obtained p-value>0.05).Daily inhalation exposure (DIE) of the breastfeeding mothers and their infants was estimated, and a risk assessment was performed for these population groups. The HQs (Hazard Quotient) and HIs (Hazard Index for cumulative exposure) of the detected pesticides were lower than 1. The cancer risk for cypermethrin and permethrin in infants was found to be higher than 1.0 E−06.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abifenthrin 3abreast feeding 3abreathing 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3acumulative exposure 3acypermethrin 3aenvironment 3ainhalation exposure 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3amalathion 3apermethrin 3apyrethrins 3apyrimethanil 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aSpain 0aPesticides 0aIndoor ambient air 0aOccurrence 0aBreastfeeding mothers1 aYusà, Vicent1 aVilloldo, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8780-68561 aCorpas-Burgos, Francisca1 aCoscollà, Clara0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 248 p.118231-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1182313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010800158300001800266520152900284592002801813650001301841650001601854650002001870650001501890650002001905650001701925650001701942650001901959650001401978650001701992650001702009650001902026653003502045653001702080653002102097653002402118700001502142700001202157700001502169700001502184700001602199700005402215773013902269856007802408852000902486655001202495IND60684922520221118052148.0200226e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068492252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b200622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuchu10aSequential Intra-Intercellular Delivery of Nanomedicine for Deep Drug-Resistant Solid Tumor Penetration  ap. 8978-8988.  aCells in the center of solid tumors have always been an abyss untouched by treatments because of their deep location and increased drug resistance. Herein, we designed a rational strategy for sequential intra-intercellular delivery of nanomedicine to deep sites of drug-resistant solid tumors. In our formulation, dopamine and hemoglobin were polymerized to form a smart nanocarrier (PDA/Hb). Subsequently, the doxorubicin and nitric oxide donor were connected on the surface of PDA/Hb to obtain D/N-PDA/Hb. Ultimately, the hyaluronic acid was combined with D/N-PDA/Hb to form D/N-PDA/Hb@HA. Concretely, acidic and neutral environments of tumor cells were treated as a switch to turn on or off the drug release of a nanodrug. Meanwhile, the generation of nitric oxide in situ was exploited to favor the lysosomal escape of nanocarriers and overcome the drug resistance of deep solid tumor cells. The results indicated that the nanodrug based on sequential intra-intercellular delivery showed exciting penetration efficiency and resistance reversal of solid tumors. Conventional nanodrug delivery was highly dependent on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and limited by tumorous interstitial fluid pressure. Plenty of drugs stayed on the surface of solid tumors, and the infiltrated drugs were inefficient due to strict resistance. To conquer this dilemma, this work proposed a new mechanism reversing the EPR effect for drug delivery, leading to better penetration and resistance reversal of solid tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adopamine 3adoxorubicin 3adrug resistance 3ahemoglobin 3ahyaluronic acid 3ananocarriers 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3apermeability 3apolymerization 0asequential initiative delivery 0asolid tumors 0adeep penetration 0aresistance reversal1 aCong, Cong1 aLi, Lei1 aLuo, Liyao1 aHe, Yaqian1 aHao, Zining1 aGao, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5030-70220 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 12, no. 8 p.8978-8988dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b200623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245019100206300001800397520092500415592002801340650001301368650002601381650002901407650002501436650001701461650002501478650001501503650001301518650001701531650001501548651001201563700002001575700002301595700002401618700002001642700002101662700002101683700002601704700002001730773013101750856008301881852000901964655001201973IND60744900620221122140652.0211021e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074490062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-021-02288-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoussar, Noura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-374710aPhytochemical constituents, antioxidant and antistaphylococcal activities of Evernia prunastri (L.)

All extracts showed antibacterial activity against all tested strains (MIC values ranging from 0.078 to 0.625 mg/mL), the strongest inhibition was obtained with the extract of Evernia prunastri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRamalina 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical composition 3aflavonoids 3amethanol 3amicrobiology 3ausnic acid 3aMorocco1 aAchmit, Mohamed1 aEs-sadeqy, Youness1 aVasiljević, Perica1 aRhallabi, Naima1 aAit Mhand, Rajaa1 aZerouali, Khalid1 aManojlović, Nedeljko1 aMellouki, Fouad0 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 203, no. 6 p.2887-2894dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02288-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013800174520186200312592002802174650001302202650001502215650002602230650002302256650002402279650001602303650002302319650001002342650001002352650001302362650001502375650002302390650001502413650001402428650001702442650003302459650001602492650000902508650002202517653003102539653001802570653001802588653001802606700001802624700002102642700001802663700002002681700001802701773011902719856008802838852000902926655001202935IND60776778120221121075202.0220606e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077677812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulgarelli, R.G.10aEucalypt species drive rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community assembly but soil phosphorus availability rearranges the microbiome  aSoil phosphorus (P) availability may limit plant growth and alter root-soil interactions and rhizosphere microbial community composition. The composition of the rhizosphere microbial community can also be shaped by plant genotype. In this study, we examined the rhizosphere microbial communities of young plants of 24 species of eucalypts (22 Eucalyptus and two Corymbia species) under low or sufficient soil P availability. The taxonomic diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities was assessed by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The taxonomic modifications in response to low P availability were evaluated by principal component analysis, and co-inertia analysis was performed to identify associations between bacterial and fungal community structures and parameters related to plant growth and nutritional status under low and sufficient soil P availability. The sequencing results showed that while both soil P availability and eucalypt species influenced the microbial community assembly, eucalypt species was the stronger determinant. However, when the plants are subjected to low P-availability, the rhizosphere selection became strongest. In response to low P, the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of some species showed significant changes, whereas in others remained relatively constant under low and sufficient P. Co-inertia analyses revealed a significant co-dependence between plant nutrient contents and bacterial and fungal community composition only under sufficient P. By contrast, under low P, bacterial community composition was related to plant biomass production. In conclusion, our study shows that eucalypt species identity was the main factor modulating rhizosphere microbial community composition; significant shifts due to P availability were observed only for some eucalypt species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorymbia 3aEucalyptus 3abacterial communities 3abiomass production 3acommunity structure 3aenvironment 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agenes 3agenotype 3amicrobiome 3anutritional status 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aprincipal component analysis 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 0aNext-generation sequencing 0a16S rRNA gene 0a18S rRNA gene 0aPlant species1 aLeite, M.F.A.1 ade Hollander, M.1 aMazzafera, P.1 aAndrade, S.A.L.1 aKuramae, E.E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 836 p.155667-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014500161300001800306500002000324520094500344592002801289650002401317650001801341650001201359650001401371650002001385650002201405650002501427650002301452650002401475650003201499650001501531650001501546651001101561700006001572773013801632856007401770852000901844655001201853IND60750132720221120152755.0210910e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013272DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeray, Loic S.G.10aWeb‐scraping applied to acquire difficult to access animal disease outbreak information, using African Swine Fever in Europe as an example  ap. 2795-2805.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSurveillance data are key to informing decisions on the control and prevention of transboundary and emerging diseases.

The antioxidant activity of MAAs in acidic conditions was low compared to that in neutral and alkali conditions, but we found strong antioxidant activity from the heated crude MAA fraction in acidic conditions. In this study, we identified and characterized the key compounds involved in the antioxidant activity of this fraction. We first isolated two MAAs, palythine, and porphyra-334, from the fraction and evaluated the activities of the two MAAs when heated. MAAs possess absorption maxima at around 330 nm, while the heated MAAs lost this absorption. The heated MAAs showed a high ABTS radical scavenging activity at pH 5.8–8.0. We then determined the structure of heated palythine via ESI-MS and NMR analyses and speculated about the putative antioxidant mechanism. Finally, a suitable production condition of the heated compounds was determined at 120 °C for 30 min at pH 8.0. We revealed compounds from red algae with antioxidant activities at a wide range of pH values, and this information will be useful for the functional processing of food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aPalmaria palmata 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3apH1 aSaburi, Wataru 1 aMiyabe, Yoshikatsu 1 aKishimura, Hideki 1 aKumagai, Yuya 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 20, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200301843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245018500159300001800344520176600362592002802128650002602156650001502182650001702197650002902214650001602243650001702259650002302276650002202299650001802321650002202339650002202361650001602383650002402399650002202423650002802445650001502473650001302488650001302501650001702514650001302531653002102544653002802565653002702593653002902620653002702649700001702676700005802693773013902751856007802890852000902968655001202977IND60684922820221118051957.0200226e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068492282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b201022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dekang10aBacterial Detection and Elimination Using a Dual-Functional Porphyrin-Based Porous Organic Polymer with Peroxidase-Like and High Near-Infrared-Light-Enhanced Antibacterial Activity  ap. 8989-8999.  aThe efficient fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms for bacterial detection and elimination is of great importance in nanobiotechnology. A new porphyrin-based porous organic polymer, FePPOPBFPB, was synthesized via the reaction between pyrrole and 4-{2,2-bis[(4-formylphenoxy)methyl]-3-(4-formylphenoxy) propoxy} benzaldehyde (BFPB). The C-centric tetrahedral structure of BFPB promoted the formation of FePPOPBFPB with a 3D interconnected porous structure, high specific surface area, and plentiful surface catalytic active sites. The adjustable structural alkyl chain also enhanced the absorption capability of FePPOPBFPB in the long-wavelength visible and near-infrared regions (NIR). FePPOPBFPB exhibited excellent peroxidase-like activity toward a representative peroxidase substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H₂O₂. Utilizing these features, a rapid and visual detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) based on FePPOPBFPB was established and exhibited high sensitivity and stability. Combining the catalysis with near-infrared-light (NIR) absorption, FePPOPBFPB can effectively catalyze the decomposition of biologically relevant concentrations of H₂O₂ to produce vast amounts of •OH radicals via the photo-Fenton reaction, which avoids the utilization of high toxic concentrations of H₂O₂. On the basis of these satisfactory features, FePPOPBFPB had a conspicuous bactericidal performance against S. aureus under NIR irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a porphyrin-based porous organic polymer antibacterial agent. The main reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in this system and the possible antibacterial mechanism of FePPOPBFPB was also proposed through a series of experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aactive sites 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abenzaldehyde 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme substrates 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3amicrobial detection 3ananobiotechnology 3anear infrared radiation 3aperoxidase 3apolymers 3apyrroles 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0ametalloporphyrin 0aporous organic polymers 0aphoto-Fenton catalysts 0aperoxidase-like activity 0aantibacterial activity1 aFang, Yishan1 aZhang, Xiaomei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9056-51330 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 12, no. 8 p.8989-8999dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b201023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04189naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245018300170520229100353592002802644650002002672650001902692650002402711650001302735650002002748650001902768650001602787650001902803650002202822650001002844650003502854650001302889650001802902650001302920650001902933650003002952650002002982650003303002650000903035650001603044650001103060650001103071650001103082650001203093650001803105650001503123653001203138653002003150653002503170653001803195653002303213700001403236700001203250700001403262700001603276700001703292700001303309773012003322856008803442852000903530655001203539IND60776778520221120201523.0220628e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077677852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Xiaoqi10aEffect of rainfall-runoff process on sources and transformations of nitrate using a combined approach of dual isotopes, hydrochemical and Bayesian model in the Dagang River basin  aThe control of agricultural nitrogen through inflow rivers is crucial for lake aquatic environment conservation, while nitrate is the main form of non-point source pollution of agricultural nitrogen in watersheds. Therefore, understanding the nitrate sources and transformation in the intensive-agricultural region was particularly concerned. Nitrate sources and transformation varied largely during some crucial periods or events. However, low-resolution sampling campaigns increased some uncertainties due to without considering the effect of key driving factors for identifying nitrate transformations and sources. In our study, high-frequency sampling and analysis of nitrogen and oxygen isotope, hydrochemical and Bayesian model was conducted at the Dagang River to capture nitrate sources and transformations and identify its response to rainfall-runoff process at the event scale. In addition, the N cycle process was refined by comparing the variation and relationship of water quality factors and isotopes before, during, and after rainfall. We found that nitrate and major ions derived from similar agricultural activities caused by anthropogenic factors, such as domestic sewage from rural residents and livestock waste, through field survey and principal component analysis. The δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ and δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻ in Dagang River ranged from +0.05‰ to +9.94‰ and + 1.49‰ to +11.64‰, respectively. The spatio-temporal variations of nitrate isotopes and hydrochemical compositions of river water suggested that nitrification was the dominant nitrate transformation process although the mixing effect occurred in some periods, especially during, and after the rainfall. The relationship between NO₃⁻/Cl⁻ and Cl⁻ ratios suggested the occurrence of denitrification in downstream of the river basin after the rainfall. The results of Bayesian model showed that livestock manure and groundwater contributed to the most (66.4 ± 31.9%) nitrate, which indicated the necessity to establish its regulatory policy to avoid the overuse of livestock manure and groundwater in Dagang River. This study benefit for developing concrete and legible management and conservation strategies for decreasing the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen loading on lake eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aanimal manures 3aaquatic environment 3aconcrete 3adenitrification 3aeutrophication 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3anatural resources conservation 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anonpoint source pollution 3aoxygen isotopes 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3asewage 3asurveys 3awater quality 3awatersheds 0aNitrate 0aRainfall events 0aDual stable isotopes 0aMixSIAR model 0aAgricultural river1 aNiu, Yuan1 aYu, Hui1 aGou, Peng1 aHou, Qinyao1 aLu, Xiaofeng1 aWu, Yali0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 837 p.155674-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245006200170300001800232500002000250520174300270592002802013596012102041650002402162650001902186650002002205650001802225650002202243650001302265650001802278650002402296650001202320651001102332651000902343651001102352651002602363700006002389700007802449773013802527856007402665852000902739655001202748IND60750133120221120101714.0210910e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013312DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz‐Pérez, Carolina10aAfrican swine fever vaccine: Turning a dream into reality  ap. 2657-2668.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAfrican swine fever (ASF) is currently threatening the swine industry at a global level. The disease originated in Africa has spread to Europe, Asia and Oceania, since 2007, reaching a pandemic dimension. Currently, the spread of ASF is unstoppable and that the development of a safe and effective vaccine is urgently required. The objective of this paper is to review the vaccine candidates tested during the 20th and 21st centuries, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these studies and to highlight what we should learn. Several strategies have been explored to date, some of which have shown positive and negative results. Inactivated preparations and subunit vaccines are not a viable option. The most promising strategy would appear to be live attenuated vaccines, because these vaccine candidates are able to induce variable percentages of protection against certain homologous and heterologous virus isolates. The number of studies on live attenuated vaccine candidates has steadily increased in the 21st century thanks to advances in molecular biology and an in‐depth knowledge of ASF virus, which have allowed the development of vaccines based on deletion mutants. The deletion of virulence‐related genes has proved to be a useful tool for attenuation, although attenuation does not always mean protection and even less, cross protection. Therefore, ASF vaccine development has proved to be one of the top priorities in ASF research. Efforts are still being made to fill the gaps in the knowledge regarding immune response, safety and cross protection, and these efforts will hopefully help to find a safe and effective vaccine that could be commercialised soon, thus making it possible to turn a dream into reality.  aPublisher supplied data  a862874cEuropean Project H2020 VACDIVA – ‘A Safe DIVA vaccine for African Swine Fever control and eradication’ 3aAfrican swine fever 3across immunity 3aimmune response 3alive vaccines 3amolecular biology 3apandemic 3apork industry 3avaccine development 3aviruses 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aPacific Ocean Islands1 aJurado, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1745-04091 aSánchez‐Vizcaíno, José Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1502-89680 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 Sept., v. 68, no. 5 p.2657-2668dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.141913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012000160300001800280520181000298592002802108650001702136650001902153650002102172650001902193650001102212650001402223650001202237700002202249700002002271700001902291700002302310700002102333773013202354856007802486852000902564655001202573IND60541849820221120023304.0160823e20160330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054184982DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b133772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuki, Yuka10aRectified Proton Grotthuss Conduction Across a Long Water-Wire in the Test Nanotube of the Polytheonamide B Channel  ap. 4168-4177.  aA hydrogen-bonded water-chain in a nanotube is highly proton conductive, and examining the proton flux under electric fields is crucial to understanding the one-dimensional Grotthuss conduction. Here, we exploited a nanotube-forming natural product, the peptide polytheonamide B (pTB), to examine proton conduction mechanisms at a single-molecule level. The pTB nanotube has a length of ∼40 Å that spans the membrane and a uniform inner diameter of 4 Å that holds a single-file water-chain. Single-channel proton currents were measured using planar lipid bilayers in various proton concentrations and membrane potentials (±400 mV). We found, surprisingly, that the current–voltage curves were asymmetric with symmetric proton concentrations in both solutions across the membrane (rectification). The proton flux from the C-terminal to the N-terminal end was 1.6 times higher than that from the opposite. At lower proton concentrations, the degree of rectification was attenuated, but with the addition of a pH-buffer (dichloroacetate) that supplies protons near the entrance, the rectification emerged. These results indicate that the permeation processes inside the pore generate the rectification, which is masked at low concentrations by the diffusion-limited access of protons to the pore entrance. The permeation processes were characterized by a discrete-state Markov model, in which hops of a proton followed by water-chain turnovers were implemented. The optimized model revealed that the water-chain turnover exhibited unusual voltage dependence, and the distinct voltage-dependencies of the forward and backward transition rates yielded the rectification. The pTB nanotube serves as a rectified proton conductor, and the design principles can be exploited for proton-conducting materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aelectric field 3ahydrogen bonding 3alipid bilayers 3amodels 3ananotubes 3aprotons1 aIwamoto, Masayuki1 aMita, Kenichiro1 aShigemi, Kenji1 aMatsunaga, Shigeki1 aOiki, Shigetoshi0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Mar. 30, v. 138, no. 12 p.4168-4177dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b133773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245008900177500002200266520085200288592002801140650000801168650001901176650001701195650002001212650001901232650002401251650001501275650002301290650002901313653002601342653002501368653002801393700002101421700002501442700002601467700002601493700002201519773010201541856008401643852000901727655001201736IND60674163420221120095556.0191024e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067416342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1057452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahrudeen, Mohamed N.M.10aEstimating RNA numbers in single cells by RNA fluorescent tagging and flow cytometry  aPre-press version  aEstimating the statistics of single-cell RNA numbers has become a key source of information on gene expression dynamics. One of the most informative methods of in vivo single-RNA detection is MS2d-GFP tagging. So far, it requires microscopy and laborious semi-manual image analysis, which hampers the amount of collectable data. To overcome this limitation, we present a new methodology for quantifying the mean, standard deviation, and skewness of single-cell distributions of RNA numbers, from flow cytometry data on cells expressing RNA tagged with MS2d-GFP. The quantification method, based on scaling flow-cytometry data from microscopy single-cell data on integer-valued RNA numbers, is shown to readily produce precise, big data on in vivo single-cell distributions of RNA numbers and, thus, can assist in studies of transcription dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aimage analysis 3ainformation sources 3amicroscopy 3astandard deviation 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTime-lapse microscopy 0aMS2d-GFP RNA tagging 0aSingle-cell RNA numbers1 aChauhan, Vatsala1 aPalma, Cristina S.D.1 aOliveira, Samuel M.D.1 aKandavalli, Vinodh K.1 aRibeiro, Andre S.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Oct. 15, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1057453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284520106200300592002801362650002101390650001401411650001501425650001001440653002801450653002701478653001501505700006201520700007301582700005801655700006601713773008201779856008101861852000901942655001201951IND60750133220221120101641.0210910e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013322DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-bja101022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Aquino, Itzel10aTactical deception in sociosexual behaviour of stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides): an exploratory study  ap. 945-969.  aTactical deception (TD) is a social strategy in which a subject performs an action to its own benefit causing disadvantage for a competitor. In primates, the cognitive mechanisms involved in TD have been described at different levels. Sneaky mating is a common context within which to study TD because in many primate groups, dominant males monopolize access to females and subordinate males must find a way to copulate with females avoiding the alpha’s presence. The objective of this study was to explore which of the TD behavioural strategies are involved in the male sociosexual behaviour of a group of stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides). We found that the subordinate males participated in more interactions when they were in a section of the enclosure where the alpha male was not present. The alpha male had more copulation interactions, but the beta male’s interactions lasted longer on average. Our data offer evidence in support of the hypothesis that stump-tailed macaques may use TD strategies that are related to operant conditioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca arctoides 3acognition 3acopulation 3amales 0aintrasexual competition 0abehavioural strategies 0aalpha male1 aPlatas-Neri, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6738-09741 aSánchez-Ferrer, José Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1330-37751 aJiménez, Said1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-41511 aMuñoz-Delgado, Jairo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2249-44650 tBehaviour.g, v. 158, no. 11 p.945-969dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-bja101023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001800276520103400294592002801328650001801356650002301374650000901397650001401406650002201420650001101442650001401453650001501467650001701482650001101499650001101510650001901521700002601540773010401566856008401670852000901754655001201763IND60086598320221120043506.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008659832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2011.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüke, Tayfun10aEstimation of the health benefits of controlling air pollution from the Yatağan coal-fired power plant  ap. 1113-1120.  aThe health benefits of the flue-gas desulphurisation units of the Yatağan coal-fired power plant were estimated by using the AirPacts model. The primary pollutant emitted from the stack is sulphur dioxide; however, secondary pollutants are created downstream of the source as a result of chemical reactions involving other species that exist in the surrounding atmosphere. The impact pathway approach was used to quantitatively estimate the level of the health effects caused by sulphur species emission. Health benefits were then assessed by comparing the estimated health impacts with and without the flue-gas desulphurisation equipment. The flue-gas desulphurisation units of the power plant were found to result in, on average, 77 fewer cases of short-term mortality, 2280 fewer cases of long-term mortality, and 88 fewer cases of respiratory hospital admissions annually. In monetary terms, this benefit is equivalent to US $103 million (in 2000 prices) per annum. This benefit exceeds the investment cost (US $80 million).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3achemical reactions 3acoal 3aequipment 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amortality 3apollutants 3apower plants 3aprices 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide1 aKöne, Aylin Çiğdem0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2011 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.1113-1120dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2011.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011300207300001600320520066600336592002801002650002101030650001501051650001901066650001001085650001401095650002101109651001701130653001301147653001601160653002501176700005501201700005701256700002101313700001601334700002201350700005601372700005601428773008201484856008101566852000901647655001201656IND60750133320221120152757.0210910e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075013332DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-bja101032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, V.M.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1774-039310aAggression towards neonates and possible infanticide in the boto, or Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis)  ap. 971-984.  aRecent observed attacks by male Amazon river dolphins on conspecific calves, together with post-mortem examinations, indicate that infanticide occurs in this species but that not all attacked calves are killed.

Decision making about taking actions to reduce the flood risk is complicated by uncertainties about the current and future flood probabilities and impacts. Because decision makers are increasingly aware of uncertainties, new decision-making approaches are being explored. Among other concepts, robustness is put forward by decision makers in the Netherlands as a way to deal with uncertainties. However, they cannot specify what makes a system more robust. This paper defines robustness as the ability of a system to remain functioning under disturbances, where the magnitude of the disturbance is variable and uncertain. We present a conceptual framework for analysing system robustness, and we suggest how the robustness of flood risk systems can be quantified. The ideas are tested on the Westerschelde flood risk system in the Netherlands. This case shows that analysing system robustness provides additional insight into the effect of flood risk reduction measures on system behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental science 3aflood control 3afloods 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aNetherlands1 aKlijn, Frans1 ade Bruijn, Karin M.1 aBeek, Eelco van,0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2011 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.1121-1131dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2011.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245006900165300001800234500002000252520121300272592002801485596007501513596006601588596006601654596006601720596009301786596012401879596008402003650001502087650001302102650001902115650001602134650001502150651002002165700005602185700005402241700001602295700001802311773013102329856007702460852000902537655001202546IND60789738720221121095733.0220822e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078973872DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0144442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chuan Jiang10aObservation and Parameterization of Broadband Sea Surface Albedo  ap. 4480-4491.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe broadband sea surface albedo (SSA) was observed from a fixed sea platform in the South China Sea. This observation period lasted approximately 152 days and included a wide range of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Under clear‐sky conditions, the observed SSA increased significantly with the increase in the solar zenith angle at low solar altitudes, while the SSA changed little under high Sun. Under cloudy skies, however, the SSA was negligibly dependent on the solar zenith angle. The observed SSA was also influenced by atmospheric and oceanic conditions, in which it increased with increasing winds or surface waves and decreased with increasing water vapor pressure at the sea surface. An empirical parameterization of the broadband SSA was proposed based on these observations, in which the SSA was a function of the solar zenith angle, wind speed or significant wave height, and water vapor pressure. The correlation coefficients between the predicted SSA and the observations reached 0.95, 0.94, and 0.88 in clear skies, mixed skies, and cloudy skies, respectively. Finally, the root‐mean‐square deviations were only 0.009, 0.015, and 0.011 in these three sky conditions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1404000cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a41776038cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aU1606405cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41821004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aGASI‐IPOVAI‐05cIndo‐Pacific Ocean Environment Variation and Air‐Sea Interaction  a2016YFE0101400cChina‐Australia Research Center for Maritime Engineering of Ministry of Science and Technology, China  a2018S03cBasic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institutes of China 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor 3awind speed 3aSouth China Sea1 aQiao, Fangli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5829-47801 aChen, Siyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7302-92561 aXue, Yuhuan1 aGuo, Jingsong0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 July, v. 124, no. 7 p.4480-4491dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0144443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013200165300002000297520111400317592002801431596010101459596009801560596008001658596010101738596010201839596008101941650001502022650001502037650001002052650001302062650002302075650001902098650002202117650002202139650001302161650001402174700001802188700001802206700005102224700005602275700001502331700006002346773017302406856008102579852000902660655001202669IND60791735720221121054756.0220831e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079173572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c009552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Qiangbing10aEfficient Recovery of Dichloromethane from Tail Gas by 1-Alkyl-2-ethylimidazole Ethyl Sulfate and 1-Ethylpyridine Ethyl Sulfate  ap. 12699-12709.  aFour sulfate-based ILs, 1-butyl-3-ethylimidazolium ethyl sulfate [Beim][EtSO₄], 1-ethyl-3-ethylimidazolium ethyl sulfate [Eeim][EtSO₄], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate [Emim][EtSO₄], and 1-ethylpyridinium ethyl sulfate [Epy][EtSO₄], were synthesized and used as an absorbent for dichloromethane (DCM). Among them, the maximum DCM absorption capacity of 0.426 g DCM g–¹ IL was achieved in [Beim][EtSO₄] at 313.15 K and 37.7% DCM concentration, which was 42.2% higher than that of common organic solvent bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate under the same conditions. The density and viscosity of [Beim][EtSO₄] containing different mass fractions of DCM were measured. The density of [Beim][EtSO₄] increases with the mass fraction of adsorbed DCM, while the viscosity decreases sharply. The efficient performance of ILs to absorb DCM is mainly due to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the anion and DCM, which was confirmed by spectroscopic measurement and quantum chemical calculations. This work demonstrates the great potential of ILs in separating and recovering DCM from exhaust gas.  aPublisher supplied data  a21961160744cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22122814cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2018064cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  aB2021103005cNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003787  a202300410004cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006407  a201300310900cHenan Major Science and Technology Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3agases 3ahydrogen 3amethylene chloride 3aprocess design 3aquantum mechanics 3aspectral analysis 3asulfates 3aviscosity1 aWang, Kaixuan1 aWang, Mengjun1 aLi, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1780-80091 aRen, Baozeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1804-24311 aBai, Yinge1 aZhang, Xiangping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1431-08730 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 61, no. 34 p.12699-12709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c009553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010200171500002200273520112200295592002801417650002401445650002301469650001601492650001901508650002001527650002401547650002501571650002501596650002001621653001901641653001601660653002601676653000801702653000801710653000801718653000801726653000801734700002101742700002301763700002301786773010201809856008401911852000901995655001202004IND60674164020221120105149.0191024e20191011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067416402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1057412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelker, Dennis L.10aMultiple pulse electroporation of lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus casei  aPre-press version  aGenetic manipulation of lactic acid bacteria is often difficult due to the inability to transform them with high efficiency. Multi-pulse electroporation offers a simple approach to increase transformation efficiencies. Using cells grown with 1% glycine and pretreated with lithium acetate and dithiothreitol, multi-pulse electroporation (five pulses of 12.5 kV cm−1) of Lactococcus lactis JB704 cells resulted in a transformation efficiency of up to 1.2 × 106 colony forming units (CFU) μg−1 pGK13, an 8-fold increase in the transformation efficiency compared to single pulse electroporation. Other cell growth and pretreatment conditions with JB704 resulted in lower transformation efficiencies but had 4-fold to 27-fold higher transformation efficiencies with the five pulse electroporations. With similarly grown and pretreated Lactobacillus casei 32G cells, multi-pulse electroporation (five pulse of 7.5 kV cm−1) resulted in a mean transformation efficiency of 7.3 × 103 CFU μg−1 pTRKH2, a 4-fold increase in the transformation efficiency compared to single pulse electroporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactococcus lactis 3acell growth 3adithiothreitol 3aelectroporation 3agenetic engineering 3aglycine (amino acid) 3alactic acid bacteria 3alithium acetate 0aTransformation 0aMulti-pulse 0aLactic acid bacterium 0aCFU 0aDTT 0aLAB 0aMRS 0aPEG1 aCoburn, Bryan M.1 aMcClatchy, John H.1 aBroadbent, Jeff R.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Oct. 11, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1057413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245007600207300001800283520170800301592002802009650002302037650001502060650001302075650002902088650001402117650001102131650002202142650002202164650001602186650001602202653002402218653002702242653002802269653003002297653002202327653002102349653001702370700002602387700006602413700006202479700002302541700006502564700002202629700006302651700006402714700002402778700006602802700006502868773013902933856007803072852000903150655001203159IND60684923420221118051853.0200226e20200203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068492342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b202952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosorev, Andrey Yu.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9343-550210aFluorinated Thiophene-Phenylene Co-Oligomers for Optoelectronic Devices  ap. 9507-9519.  aOrganic optoelectronics requires materials combining bright luminescence and efficient ambipolar charge transport. Thiophene-phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs) are promising highly emissive materials with decent charge-carrier mobility; however, they typically show poor electron injection in devices, which is usually assigned to high energies of their lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs). A widely used approach to lower the frontier orbitals energy levels of a conjugated molecule is its fluorination. In this study, we synthesized three new fluorinated derivatives of one of the most popular TPCOs, 2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)bis[5-phenylthiophene] (PTPTP) and studied them by cyclic voltammetry, absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies. The obtained data reveal a positive effect of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties of PTPTP: LUMO levels are finely tuned, and photoluminescence quantum yield and absorbance are increased. We then grew crystals from fluorinated PTPTPs, resolved their structures, and showed that fluorination dramatically affects the packing motif and facilitates π-stacking. Finally, we fabricated thin-film organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and demonstrated a strong impact of fluorination on charge injection/transport for both types of charge carriers, namely, electrons and holes. Specifically, balanced ambipolar charge transport and electroluminescence were observed only in the OFET active channel based on the partially fluorinated PTPTP. The obtained results can be extended to other families of conjugated oligomers and highlight the efficiency of fluorination for rational design of organic semiconductors for optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3acrystals 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3aphotoluminescence 3atransistors 3avoltammetry 0aorganic electronics 0aorganic semiconductors 0afield-effect transistor 0alight-emitting transistor 0acrystal structure 0acharge transport 0afluorination1 aTrukhanov, Vasiliy A.1 aMaslennikov, Dmitry R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8697-54121 aBorshchev, Oleg V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3134-98571 aPolyakov, Roman A.1 aSkorotetcky, Maxim S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0413-05021 aSurin, Nikolay M.1 aKazantsev, Maxim S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2869-17771 aDominskiy, Dmitry I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4871-06051 aTafeenko, Viktor A.1 aPonomarenko, Sergey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0930-77221 aParaschuk, Dmitry Yu.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9156-06570 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 03, v. 12, no. 8 p.9507-9519dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b202953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159520213300266592002802399650001702427650001602444650001902460650001102479650001002490650001502500650002202515650001502537650001702552651001002569700001702579700001702596700001802613700001902631700002102650773012802671856007502799852000902874655001202883IND60763582020221122002024.0220120e20220109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076358202DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140202912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhengyu 10aSpatially Varying Relationships between Land Subsidence and Urbanization: A Case Study in Wuhan, China  aLand subsidence has become an increasing global concern over the past few decades due to natural and anthropogenic factors. However, although several studies have examined factors affecting land subsidence in recent years, few have focused on the spatial heterogeneity of relationships between land subsidence and urbanization. In this paper, we adopted the small baseline subset-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method using Sentinel-1 radar satellite images to map land subsidence from 2015 to 2018 and characterized its spatial pattern in Wuhan. The bivariate Moran’s I index was used to test and visualize the spatial correlations between land subsidence and urbanization. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was employed to explore the strengths and directions of impacts of urbanization on land subsidence. Our findings showed that land subsidence was obvious and unevenly distributed in the study area, the annual deformation rate varied from −42.85 mm/year to +29.98 mm/year, and its average value was −1.0 mm/year. A clear spatial pattern for land subsidence in Wuhan was mapped, and several apparent subsidence funnels were primarily located in central urban areas. All urbanization indicators were found to be significantly spatially correlated with land subsidence at different scales. In addition, the GWR model results showed that all urbanization indicators were significantly associated with land subsidence across the whole study area in Wuhan. The results of bivariate Moran’s I and GWR results confirmed that the relationships between land subsidence and urbanization spatially varied in Wuhan at multiple spatial scales. Although scale dependence existed in both the bivariate Moran’s I and GWR models for land subsidence and urbanization indicators, a “best” spatial scale could not be confirmed because the disturbance of factors varied over different sampling scales. The results can advance the understanding of the relationships between land subsidence and urbanization, and they will provide guidance for subsidence control and sustainable urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeformation 3ainterferometry 3amodels 3aradar 3asatellites 3aspatial variation 3asubsidence 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLiu, Yaolin 1 aZhang, Yang 1 aLiu, Yanfang 1 aWang, Baoshun 1 aZhang, Guangxia 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 09, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140202913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245010900160300001800269520074200287592002801029650001801057650001201075650002301087650001501110650000801125700002001133700002101153700001501174700001701189700001801206700001701224700001801241773013201259856007801391852000901469655001201478IND60541850320221121003645.0160823e20160330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054185032DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b001422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seon Joo10aFabrication of Efficient Formamidinium Tin Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells through SnF2–Pyrazine Complex  ap. 3974-3977.  aTo fabricate efficient formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI₃) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), it is essential to deposit uniform and dense perovskite layers and reduce Sn⁴⁺ content. Here we used solvent-engineering and nonsolvent dripping process with SnF₂ as an inhibitor of Sn⁴⁺. However, excess SnF₂ induces phase separation on the surface of the perovskite film. In this work, we report the homogeneous dispersion of SnF₂ via the formation of the SnF₂–pyrazine complex. Consequently, we fabricated FASnI₃ PSCs with high reproducibility, achieving a high power conversion efficiency of 4.8%.

The optimization of the interdigital micromixer was conducted through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The mixing performance and flow field of this novel micromixer were investigated in detail. The introduction of the interdigital micromixer promoted the mass transfer between anilines and alkyl halides, affording the corresponding N-monoalkylated anilines with a selectivity of 93% and a yield of 89%. No other bases and catalysts were used in this process. The interdigital micromixer had 13% higher selectivity than that of the commercial Y-type micromixer and 30% higher selectivity than that of the batch method. Furthermore, the universality experiments of this N-monoalkylation process proved that the micromixer had a better broad applicability. All the findings reported provided useful references for the improvement of selectivity and yield of the chemical reaction in microflow systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a21776130cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21908094cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22078150cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22178168cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021YFC2101900cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a202002037cNanjing International Joint Research and Development Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcTop-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutionsdhttps://doi.org/NA 3achemical reactions 3amass transfer 3aprocess design1 aZhao, Shuangfei1 aFang, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3209-47131 aYang, Zhao1 aLi, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9323-42171 aYang, Jiming1 aMeng, Jingjing1 aLi, Yuguang1 aJi, Dong1 aHe, Wei1 aGuo, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0013-32631 aTu, Shan-Tung,0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 61, no. 34 p.12680-12689dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002400162245009600186300001600282500001900298500000900317520040800326592002800734650001300762650001200775650001200787650001100799650001600810650001000826650001400836650001400850650001200864700002000876700002300896700002400919773012100943856009701064852000901161655001201170IND60663658520221118005627.0191122e195905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066365852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1959.00021962005100050010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittaker, Colin W.10aLiming Qualities of Three Cement Kiln Flue Dusts and a Limestone in a Greenhouse Comparison  ap. 280-282.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSynopsisThree cement kiln flue dusts had about the same soil liming qualities as pulverized limestone.

This study aimed to assess the effect of plant densities using CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean for low latitudes. The crop model was calibrated and evaluated using data from field experiments, including plant densities (10, 20, 30 and 40 plants per m²), maturity groups (MG 7.7 and 8.8) and sowing dates (calibration: 06 Jan., 19 Jan., 16 Feb. 2018; and evaluation: 19 Jan. 2019). The model simulated phenology with a bias lower than 2 days for calibration and 7 days for evaluation. Relative root mean square error for the maximum leaf area index varied from 12.2 to 31.3%; while that for grain yield varied between 3 and 32%. The calibrated model was used to simulate different management scenarios across six sites located in the low latitude, considering 33 growing seasons. Simulations showed a higher yield for 40 pl per m², as expected, but with greater yield gain increments occurring at low plant density going from 10 to 20 pl per m². In Santarém, Brazil, MG 8.8 sown on 21 Feb. had a median yield of 2658, 3197, 3442 and 3583 kg/ha, respectively, for 10, 20, 30 and 40 pl per m², resulting in a relative increase of 20, 8 and 4% for each additional 10 pl per m². Overall, the crop model had adequate performance, indicating a minimum recommended plant density of 20 pl per m², while sowing dates and maturity groups showed different yield level and pattern across sites in function of the local climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3aclimate 3acrop models 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3alatitude 3aleaf area index 3aphenology 3aplant density 3asoybeans 3aBrazil 0aCrop management 0acrop modelling 0aGlycine max L 0alate maturity group 0apotential yield1 aBattisti, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5768-45011 aLana, M.

The evolution of rocky desertification is a typical landscape change that directly affects ecological environment governance and sustainable development. Guizhou is one of the most typical subtropical karst landform areas in the world. Its special karst rocky desertification phenomenon is an important factor affecting the ecological environment and limiting sustainable development. In this paper, remote sensing imagery and machine learning methods are utilized to model and analyze the spatiotemporal variation of rocky desertification in Guizhou. Based on an improved CA-Markov model, rocky desertification scenarios in the next 30 years are predicted, providing data support for exploration of the evolution rule of rocky desertification in subtropical karst areas and for effective management. The specific results are as follows: (1) Based on the dynamic degree, transfer matrix, evolution intensity, and speed, the temporal and spatial evolution of rocky desertification in Guizhou from 2001 to 2020 was analyzed. It was found that the proportion of no rocky desertification (NRD) areas increased from 48.86% to 63.53% over this period. Potential rocky desertification (PRD), light rocky desertification (LRD), middle rocky desertification (MRD), and severe rocky desertification (SRD) continued to improve, with the improvement showing an accelerating trend after 2010. (2) An improved CA-Markov model was used to predict the future rocky desertification scenario; compared to the traditional CA-Markov model, the Lee–Sallee index increased from 0.681 to 0.723, and figure of merit (FOM) increased from 0.459 to 0.530. The conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) From 2001 to 2020, the evolution speed of PRD was the fastest, while that of SRD was the slowest. Rocky desertification control should not only focus on areas with serious rocky desertification, but also prevent transformation from NRD to PRD. (2) Rocky desertification will continue to improve over the next 30 years. Possible deterioration areas are concentrated in high-altitude areas, such as the south of Bijie and the east of Liupanshui.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adesertification 3agovernance 3ahumans 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aQiang, Hequn 1 aQin, Changyou 1 aWang, Zi 1 aLi, Mingyang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 09, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140202923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013800166300001600304520136800320592002801688650002501716650001101741650001201752650001301764650002401777650002101801650001801822650001901840650002101859650002601880650001601906653001601922653001501938653003101953653003901984700001402023700001802037773010602055856008702161852000902248655001202257IND60582519120221120183111.0180830e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058251912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Bing10aParticle aggregation behavior during photocatalytic ethanol reforming reaction and its correlation with the activity of H2 production  ap. 114-120.  aWhen dispersed in water, nanoscale photocatalysts tend to aggregate due to their high surface energy. Complex interaction of the incident light with the aggregated particles is expected due to their comparable length scales. In this study, the aggregation behavior of TiO2 nanoparticles during photocatalytic ethanol reforming was investigated by the dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS results demonstrated that UV light can significantly inhibit the aggregation of TiO2 compared to that under visible light or in the dark. Considering that the ethanol photo-reforming over TiO2 can only occur under UV light, we correlated the significant light-induced particle aggregation with the photocatalytic reactions. Three different aggregation degrees for TiO2 were employed to study the effect of aggregation on its activity for photocatalytic H2 production. The H2 production is found to decrease with the increase of aggregates in the suspension. Our results should be of great value for the understanding of the dynamics in photocatalyst particle suspension during the photocatalytic reaction. More importantly, it is supposed that one can improve the activity of the photocatalytic reaction by controlling the particle aggregation through carefully adjusting the external physical fields such as the intensity of the incident light at certain wavelength interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregation behavior 3aenergy 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysts 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 0aAggregation 0aInhibition 0aParticle size distribution 0aPhotocatalytic hydrogen production1 aSong, Rui1 aJing, Dengwei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 535 p.114-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245013500218300001600353506007600369520169400445592002802139506003702167650002602204650001902230650001502249650002502264650001602289650001502305650001402320650002302334650002202357650002002379650001202399650001202411650002102423650003002444650001502474650002102489650001302510650002602523650001002549650002202559650001002581650000902591700002402600773010702624856004802731852000902779655001202788IND50063484320221207044900.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006348432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-012-0499-22doi7 aPMC38815662pmcid7 a244158412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYong, Seok Yien Christina10aMolecular characterization of a cellulose synthase gene (AaxmCesA1) isolated from an Acacia auriculiformis x Acacia mangium hybrid  ap. 303-313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCellulose is the major component of plant cell walls, providing mechanical strength to the structural framework of plants. In association with lignin, hemicellulose, protein and pectin, cellulose forms the strong yet flexible bio-composite tissue of wood. Wood formation is an essential biological process and is of significant importance to the cellulosic private sector industry. Cellulose synthase genes encode the catalytic subunits of a large protein complex responsible for the biogenesis of cellulose in higher plants. The hybrid Acacia auriculiformis x Acacia mangium represents an important source of tree cellulose for forest-based product manufacturing, with enormous economic potential. In this work, we isolate the first cellulose synthase gene, designated AaxmCesA1, from this species. The isolated full-length AaxmCesA1 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 1,064 amino acids. Sequence analyses revealed that AaxmCesA1 cDNA possesses the key motif characteristics of a CesA protein. AaxmCesA1 shares more than 75 % amino acid sequence identity with CesA proteins from other plant species. Subsequently, the full-length AaxmCesA1 gene of 7,389 bp with partial regulatory and 13 intron regions was also isolated. Relative gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR in different tissues of the Acacia hybrid, suggests the involvement of the AaxmCesA1 gene in primary cell wall synthesis of rapidly dividing young root cells. Similarity analyses using Blast algorithms also suggests a role in primary cell wall deposition in the Acacia hybrid. Southern analysis predicts that AaxmCesA1 is a member of a multigene family with at least two isoforms in the genome of the Acacia hybrid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcacia auriculiformis 3aAcacia mangium 3aalgorithms 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3ahybrids 3aintrons 3amultigene family 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3aprotein subunits 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3atrees 3awood1 aWickneswari, Ratnam0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.303-313dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0499-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008100161520159700242592002801839650002001867650001501887650001501902650001601917650001001933650001601943650001201959650001801971650001701989650001102006650001002017650001502027650000902042650001702051650001302068650001702081653001202098653003802110653000902148653001402157700002002171700006502191700002602256700005902282700006002341773012402401856008102525852000902606655001202615IND60750801420221118005601.0210918e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075080142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2021.1090322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aBeneficial effects of inorganic nitrate in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic representation of the metabolic disorders. Inorganic nitrate/nitrite can be converted to nitric oxide, regulate glucose metabolism, lower lipid levels, and reduce inflammation, thus raising the hypothesis that inorganic nitrate/nitrite could be beneficial for improving NAFLD. This study assessed the therapeutic effects of chronic dietary nitrate on NAFLD in a mouse model. 60 ApoE⁻/⁻ mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to allow for the development of atherosclerosis with associated NAFLD. The mice were then randomly assigned to different groups (20/group) for a further 12 weeks: (i) HFD + NaCl (1 mmol/kg/day), (ii) HFD + NaNO₃ (1 mmol/kg/day), and (iii) HFD + NaNO₃ (10 mmol/kg/day). A fourth group of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice consumed a normal chow diet for the duration of the study. At the end of the treatment, caecum contents, serum, and liver were collected. Consumption of the HFD resulted in significantly greater lipid accumulation in the liver compared to mice on the normal chow diet. Mice whose HFD was supplemented with dietary nitrate for the second half of the study, showed an attenuation in hepatic lipid accumulation. This was also associated with an increase in hepatic AMPK activity compared to mice on the HFD. In addition, a significant difference in bile acid profile was detected between mice on the HFD and those receiving the high dose nitrate supplemented HFD. In conclusion, dietary nitrate attenuates the progression of liver steatosis in ApoE⁻/⁻ mice fed a HFD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abile acids 3abiophysics 3ablood serum 3acecum 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3alipids 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amice 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3atherapeutics 0aNitrate 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aAMPK 0aBile acid1 aCroft, Kevin D.1 aCaparros-Martin, Jose1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1214-49521 aO'Gara, F.q(Fergal),1 aMori, Trevor A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5264-92291 aWard, Natalie C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6042-437X0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2021 Oct. 30, v. 711 p.109032-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2021.1090323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245010100218300001800319500001900337520173500356592002802091650002602119650002202145650000902167650002002176650001702196650002202213650002002235650001102255650001302266650001502279650001002294651001102304700002902315700002602344700002502370700002802395700003102423700003002454773012402484856008202608852000902690655001202699IND60706976320221118232734.0200812e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070697632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05550-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Daniele Heloísa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7804-153710aSuitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in Dichelops melacanthus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)  ap. 4989-5000.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe relative quantification of gene expression is mainly realized through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). However, the accuracy of this technique is deeply influenced by the expression stability of the reference genes used for data normalization. Therefore, the selection of suitable reference genes for a given experimental condition is a prerequisite in gene expression studies. Dichelops melacanthus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an important phloem sap-sucking insect pest of soybean, wheat, and maize in Brazil. Most of the genetic and molecular biology studies require gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, there are no reports about reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization in D. melacanthus. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes (nadh, sdhb, gapdh, fau, ef1a, rpl9, ube4a, gus and rps23) in different developmental stages, body parts, sex, starvation-induced stress and dsRNA exposure by RefFinder software that integrates the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt method. Our results showed that ef1a and nadh are the most stable reference genes for developmental stages, fau and rps23 for sex, ube4a and rps23 for body parts, rpl9 and fau for starvation stress, and nadh and sdhb for dsRNA exposure treatment. The reference genes selected in this work will be useful for further RT-qPCR analyses on D. melacanthus, facilitating future gene expression studies that can provide a better understanding of the developmental, physiological, and molecular processes of this important insect pest. Moreover, the knowledge gained from these studies can be helpful to design effective and sustainable pest management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDichelops melacanthus 3acomputer software 3acorn 3agene expression 3ainsect pests 3amolecular biology 3apest management 3aphloem 3asoybeans 3astarvation 3awheat 3aBrazil1 aMoreira, Raquel Oliveira1 aLeite, Natália Alves1 aRedoan, Ana Carolina1 aXavier, André da Silva1 aBarros, Beatriz de Almeida1 aCarneiro, Newton Portilho0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.4989-5000dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05550-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008000177300001600257520093400273592002801207650001201235650001501247650001101262650001601273650002501289650002601314651001101340653002301351653002401374653001801398653002401416653003201440700002301472773010701495856008801602852000901690655001201699IND60525806020221117202411.0190319e20160710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052580602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeymans, Johanna J.10aRegime shifts in the Northern Benguela ecosystem: Challenges for management  ap. 151-159.  aAn existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of the Northern Benguela ecosystem for 1956, previously fitted to time series for 50 years, was used to describe the impact that the different pressures (fishing and climate drivers) had on the structure of the ecosystem. Ecological network analysis indices and Integrated Trend Assessment of the input data and model outputs were used to describe the changes in this ecosystem over time. We test the hypothesis that the system has been reorganised over the course of the past 50 years, probably due to the cumulative effects of overfishing and environmental drivers such as the Benguela Niño, showing two large changes, with a transition period between the early 1970s and the early 1980s. The ecosystem has moved into a new stable state and this reorganised system will need a large shift to change with the consequential change not necessarily being back towards the pre-existing system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3amodels 3aoverfishing 3atime series analysis 3atrophic relationships 3aAngola 0aBenguela ecosystem 0aEcosystem modelling 0aRegime shifts 0aEcopath with Ecosim 0aEcological network analysis1 aTomczak, Maciej T.0 tEcological modelling.g2016 July 10, v. 331 p.151-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010300166300001600269520106100285592002801346650002501374650001101399650002901410650001601439650002301455650002501478650001901503650001301522650001301535650001801548650001701566650001401583650001601597650003301613650002001646650001301666650002101679653002501700653002701725653001601752653003301768653001901801700001601820700001901836700001601855700001401871700001701885773010601902856008702008852000902095655001202104IND60582519220221120182956.0180914e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058251922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.08.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aSurface modification of titanium substrates for enhanced osteogenetic and antibacterial properties  ap. 110-116.  aThe insufficient osseointegration and bacterial infection of titanium and its alloys remain the key challenges in their clinic applications, which may result in failure implantation. To improve osteogenetic and antibacterial properties, TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated on titanium substrates for loading of antibacterial drug. Then, TiO2 nanotube arrays were covered with chitosan/sodium alginate multilayer films. The successful construction of this system was verified via scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurement. The cytocompatibility evaluation in vitro, including cytoskeleton observation, cell viability measurement, and alkaline phosphatase activity assay, confirmed that the present system was capable of accelerating the growth of osteoblasts. In addition, bacterial adhesion and viability assay verified that treated Ti substrates were capable of reducing the adhesion of bacteria.

Variance and regression analyses were used to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on the quantitative changes in algae. Results underlined the basic role of soil depth and cultivation, while soil type had a significant effect on cyanobacteria and diatoms. The seasonal effect in the abundance of eukaryotic algae was registered by summer maximum cell numbers. Taking all three investigated algal groups into consideration, the humus content of soil seemed to be the most important factor, being in negative correlation with their abundance, while the actual water content of soil had a slight positive effect on cell numbers. A negative correlation was found between the nitrogen content of soil and cyanobacterial abundance. The carbonate content of soils had a positive effect, while plasticity, zinc concentration and the actual pH of soil were in negative correlation with diatomal abundance. The actual pH of soils was the most important factor in the negative correlation with other eukaryotic algal abundance. Coefficients of determination showed that only 16.1%, 14.6% and 8% of the total variance in the abundance of cyanobacteria, diatoms and other eukaryotic algae, respectively, can be explained by measured soil and meteorological parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3aenvironmental factors 3ahighlands 3ahumus 3ameteorological parameters 3anational parks 3anitrogen content 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asoil depth 3asoil pH 3asoil types 3asoil water content 3asummer 3avariance 3azinc 3aHungary 0adirect cell count 0aBalaton Upland National Park 0abiomass 0asoil algae1 aÖrdög, V.0 tAgrokémia és talajtan.g2006 Mar. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.271-278dAkadémiai Kiadóx0002-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAgrokem.55.2006.1.293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245010600170520156800276592002801844650001901872650002101891650002101912650002601933650001101959650001801970650001401988650002402002650001002026650001102036651001102047700003002058700002302088773012702111856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60652349520221118022006.0190712e20180622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065234952DNAL7 a10.3390/su100721412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanțău, Adrian Dumitru,10aModels for Analyzing the Dependencies between Indicators for a Circular Economy in the European Union  aThe circular economy has become one of the main strategic issues on a global scale in the striving towards achieving sustainable economic systems. The traditional model of production, consumption and disposal is being transformed into a recycling and waste integration process from the beginning of the production cycle of a product until its full use by the consumers. While measuring the progress towards a circular economy can be a challenging factor, several indicators can be used to evaluate developments in this direction. That is why recycling in general, as well as recycling of municipal waste, have become a main strategic issue in the process towards implementation of circular economy principles. The main objective of the paper is to elaborate a panel regression model for determining the dependency between main indicators, that are indicating progress of the circular economy in Europe, such as the recycling rate of municipal waste, circular material use rate, R&amp;D expenditure by all sectors, trade in recyclable raw materials and environmental tax revenues, resource productivity and domestic material consumption. Furthermore, the fixed and random effects regression models estimations are included and tested through the Durbin&ndash;Hausman&ndash;Wu statistic. The research in this study is based on the analysis of regressions in the circular economy fields in the European Union and intends to contribute to the research in the field, being an emerging scientific topic due to changing technological, economic and environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acircular economy 3aeconomic systems 3aenvironmental factors 3aincome 3araw materials 3arecycling 3aregression analysis 3atrade 3awastes 3aEurope1 aMaassen, Maria  Alexandra1 aFratila, Laurentiu0 tSustainability.g2018 June 22, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100721413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011700161300001600278520123100294592002801525650002001553650001301573650001401586650002001600650001701620650001201637650002001649650001601669650001501685650001801700650001301718650001801731653002001749653001601769653001401785653002901799700002001828700001701848700001401865700001401879773012701893856008202020852000902102655001202111IND60478488220221121045542.0160121e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047848822DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.55.2007.4.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarsai, I.10aEffect of combinations of light intensity and photoperiod on heading date of barley ( <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.)  ap. 397-405.  aIn order to evaluate the effect of light intensity and photoperiod on heading and to establish the reaction types of barley, a set of barley germplasm of various geographical origin and growth habit was examined in a series of controlled growth chamber experiments combining two levels of light intensity with long and short photoperiod regimes. Low light intensity contributed only a limited portion to the total variance of heading and this originated to a large extent from the genotype × light intensity interaction for both photoperiods. Under the long photoperiod regime the effect of low light intensity was only apparent in a significant delay in heading. Under a short photoperiod the type of sensitivity depended on the growth habit. Low light intensity hastened plant development in 15% of the spring barley varieties, while the flowering of 44% of the winter barley varieties was significantly delayed. Establishing the reaction types for photoperiod and low light intensity in this range of barley germplasm made it possible to identify the typical reaction types of the two growth-habit groups. In addition, it also became possible to identify genotypes with contrasting or unusual combinations of these traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agrowth chambers 3agrowth habit 3aheading 3alight intensity 3aphotoperiod 3aprovenance 3aspring barley 3avariance 3awinter barley 0alight intensity 0aphotoperiod 0aflowering 0a<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L1 aMészáros, K.,1 aKőszegi, B.1 aBedő, Z.1 aVeisz, O.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2007 Dec. 1, v. 55, no. 4 p.397-405dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.55.2007.4.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008000173300001800253520148500271592002801756650001501784650000801799650002801807650001501835650001301850650001201863650001101875700002401886700006401910773011301974856008502087852000902172655001202181IND60769022520220517000000.0220301e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076902252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c032922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraniatte, Sylvain10aWetting at the Nanoscale: Molecular Mobility Induced by Contact Line Forces  ap. 2614-2625.  aIn this paper, we study the interaction of a contact line with molecules physically adsorbed on a surface. We developed specific atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments where a nanoneedle attached at the extremity of the cantilever is dipped in a liquid droplet. The motion of the contact line at the extremity of the meniscus formed depends on the presence of topographical and chemical defects at the surface of the nanoneedle. The analysis of the force measured by AFM based on a capillary model allows one to distinguish the effects of topographical and chemical defects and to monitor minute changes of surface properties. Using six different liquids and five tips, we show that the change of the surface properties of one nanoneedle results either from the adsorption of airborne molecules when the tip is left in the air or from their desorption by the moving contact line when the tip is repeatedly dipped in the liquid. The desorption rate is found to depend only on the number of dipping cycles and is not influenced by the velocity or the liquid properties. A model based on the estimation of capillary and adsorption energies confirms a capillary desorption mechanism in agreement with the experimental results. Finally, we demonstrate that three distinct desorption mechanisms may be at play. Interestingly, using a deliberate contamination with large hydrocarbon molecules, we show that the capillary desorption studied in this paper can be used to clean surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3adesorption 3adroplets 3aliquids 3amodels1 aTordjeman, Philippe1 aOndarçuhu, Thierry,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7657-52710 tLangmuir.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 38, no. 8 p.2614-2625dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c032923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245014400215300002000359506007600379520193600455592002802391596005502419506003702474650002402511650001902535650002002554650001902574650002302593650002402616650001802640650001402658650002102672650001702693650001602710650000902726650002402735700002502759773016902784856008102953852000903034655001203043IND60601062020221207072214.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060106202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1987-12doi7 aPMC60615172pmcid7 a297041772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfegbua, Seniyat Larai10aEffect of single and mixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination on plant biomass yield and PAH dissipation during phytoremediation  ap. 18596-18603.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated sites have a mixture of PAH of varying concentration which may affect PAH dissipation differently to contamination with a single PAH. In this study, pot experiments investigated the impact of PAH contamination on Medicago sativa, Lolium perenne, and Festuca arundinacea biomass and PAH dissipation from soils spiked with phenanthrene (Phe), fluoranthene (Flu), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in single and mixed treatments. Stimulatory or inhibitory effects of PAH contamination on plant biomass yields were not different for the single and mixed PAH treatments. Results showed significant effect of PAH treatments on plant growth with an increased root biomass yield for F. arundinacea in the Phe (175%) and Flu (86%) treatments and a root biomass decrease in the mixed treatment (4%). The mean residual PAHs in the planted treatments and unplanted control for the single treatments were not significantly different. B[a]P dissipation was enhanced for single and mixed treatments (71–72%) with F. arundinacea compared to the unplanted control (24–50%). On the other hand, B[a]P dissipation was inhibited with L. perenne (6%) in the single treatment and M. sativa (11%) and L. perenne (29%) in the mixed treatment. Abiotic processes had greater contribution to PAH dissipation compared to rhizodegradation in both treatments. In most cases, a stimulatory effect of PAH contamination on plant biomass yield without an enhancement of PAH dissipation was observed. Plant species among other factors affect the relative contribution of PAH dissipation mechanisms during phytoremediation. These factors determine the effectiveness and suitability of phytoremediation as a remedial strategy for PAH-contaminated sites. Further studies on impact of PAH contamination, plant selection, and rhizosphere activities on soil microbial community structure and remediation outcome are required.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcPetroleum Technology Development Fund, Nigeria0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium perenne 3aMedicago sativa 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiomass production 3acommunity structure 3aphenanthrenes 3aphytomass 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms1 aBatty, Lesley Claire0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 19 p.18596-18603dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1987-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011500173300001800288500001900306520156000325592002801885650001901913650001501932650001901947650002201966650003001988650002402018650000902042650002402051650003102075651001502106700006602121700002202187700001902209700002102228700001702249700002102266773012402287856008202411852000902493655001202502IND60706976620221118233239.0200812e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070697662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05572-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaque, Parsa Sanjana10aSMAD2 rs4940086 heterozygosity increases the risk of cervical cancer development among the women in Bangladesh  ap. 5033-5040.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSMAD2 is a critical signal transducer molecule in the TGFβ- SMAD pathway which is also known for its tumor suppressor role. Genetic variations in SMAD2 render cells insensitive to its anti-proliferative signals leading to tumor formation. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SMAD2 (rs4940086 and rs8085335) on cervical cancer risk development in Bangladeshi population. 132 cervical cancer patients and 98 control volunteers were enrolled in the study and genotyped utilizing polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) method. The association between cervical cancer susceptibility and the chosen SNPs were evaluated through multiple logistic regression. SMAD2 rs4940086 heterozygous genotype (T/C) was associated with a 3.89 times higher risk of cervical cancer development (P = 0.001, AOR 3.89, 95% CI 1.777–8.513). The T/C and C/C genotypes in combination also significantly elevated cervical cancer risk (P = 0.035, AOR 1.876, 95% CI 1.047–3.364). Urban cancer patients had a significantly higher chance of carrying the rs4940086 polymorphism as compared to rural cancer patients (P = 0.045, OR 2.59 95% CI 1.02–6.59). SMAD2 rs8085335 heterozygous variant (A/G) demonstrated modest effects in increasing cervical cancer susceptibility (P = 0.594, AOR 1.247, 95% CI 0.554–2.809). Our results suggest that polymorphic variations in SMAD2, particularly rs4940086, can potentially elevate cervical cancer susceptibility in Bangladeshi women.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3amolecular biology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asignal transduction 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3aBangladesh1 aApu, Mohd Nazmul Hasan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3727-89251 aNahid, Noor Ahmed1 aIslam, Farhana1 aIslam, Md Reazul1 aHasnat, Abul1 aIslam, Md Saiful0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.5033-5040dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05572-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245012100206300001600327520180800343592002802151650001102179650002002190650001202210650001802222650002602240650001502266650001202281650002702293650002502320650001302345650001302358650001502371650001102386650001102397650001102408651001502419653001502434653002002449653001202469653001802481653002102499653001402520700006102534700005902595700002302654773012702677856008702804852000902891655001202900IND60567135420221116231737.0190318e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056713542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Siyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6145-196X10aSlow ecosystem responses conditionally regulate annual carbon balance over 15 years in Californian oak-grass savanna  ap. 252-264.  aMany ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes respond rapidly to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, while ecosystem-level responses develop much more slowly (e.g., over months, seasons, years, or decades). To better understand the role of the slow responses in regulating interannual variability in NEE, we partitioned NEE into two major ecological terms—gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). We tested a set of hypotheses on seasonal scales using the flux and environment data collected from 2000 to 2015 in an oak-grass savanna area in California where ecosystems experience a wet winter and spring and a five-month-long summer drought each year. In our results, the spring season (Apr.–Jun.) contributed more than 50% of annual GPP and Reco. An analysis of outliers showed that each season could introduce significant anomalies in annual carbon budgets. The magnitude of the contribution depends on biotic and abiotic seasonal circumstances across the year and the particular sequences. We found that: (1) extremely wet springs reduced GPP in the years of 2006, 2011 and 2012; (2) soil moisture left from those extremely wet springs enhanced summer GPP; (3) groundwater recharged during the spring of 2011 was associated with the snowpack depth accumulated during the winter between 2010 and 2011; (4) dry autumns (Oct.–Dec.) and winters (Jan.–Mar.) decreased Reco significantly; (5) grass litter produced in previous seasons might increase Reco, and the effect of litter legacy on Reco was more observable in the second year of two consecutive wet springs. These findings confirm that biotic and abiotic extremes and legacies can introduce variations to annual ecosystem carbon balance, other than those that might be explained by the fast responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adrought 3aecophysiology 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aprimary productivity 3asavannas 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aCalifornia 0aCO2 fluxes 0aEddy-covariance 0aDrought 0aPrecipitation 0aClimate extremes 0aAmeriFlux1 aBaldocchi, Dennis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3496-49191 aWolf, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7717-69931 aVerfaillie, Joseph0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 228-229 p.252-264dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012200164300001600286520125700302592002801559650001301587650000901600650002801609650001601637650001201653650002001665650001101685650001801696650001701714650001501731651001201746653001001758653001801768653002601786653002201812653002801834653002001862700001601882773012701898856008202025852000902107655001202116IND60478488420221121045438.0160121e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047848842DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.55.2007.4.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerzsenyi, Z.10aStudy of the effect of plant density on the growth of maize ( <i>Zea mays</i> L.) hybrids using the Richards function  ap. 417-436.  aIn maize, plant density has a considerable influence on the rate of dry matter accumulation and on its partitioning between vegetative and reproductive sinks. The aim of the present research was to use the first, second and third derivatives of the Richards function (RF) for growth analysis on maize hybrids grown at various densities. In two-factorial split-plot experiments carried out in Martonvásár, Hungary in 1997–1999 the growth analysis method was used to examine the effect of six plant densities (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 thousand plants ha <sup>−1</sup>) on the growth of three maize hybrids (Mara, Mv 355, Florencia) with different vegetation periods. Plant density had a significant effect on the dynamics of dry matter accumulation, absolute growth rate (AGR) and absolute acceleration rate (AAR). There was a significant reduction in the asymptotic maximum (A) and growth parameters (AGR, AAR) of the whole plant and of the individual plant organs (stalk, leaf, ear and grain yield), while the parameters of the leaf area index (LAI) increased significantly with a rise in the plant density. The usefulness of the RF for approximating the growth processes of maize plants and individual plant parts was confirmed statistically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3aplant density 3aplant organs 3avegetation 3aHungary 0amaize 0aplant density 0aplant growth analysis 0aRichards function 0adry matter accumulation 0aleaf area index1 aDang, Q.

This study investigated the interactions between PFOS with linear chain structure and DNA. A new phenomenon of DNA damage due to PFOS using electrochemistry technique was proved. The data was obtained on a modified glassy carbon electrode, on which didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), ZrO₂ and calf thymus DNA were immobilized layer-by-layer. Electrochemical response of DNA damage caused by PFOS was detected by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using methylene blue (MB) as electro-active indicator. The current of MB attenuated obviously after DNA/ZrO₂/DDAB/GCE were incubated in PFOS. The shift of MB reduction peak potential indicates that PFOS is bound with DNA in groove probably by the first step of hydrophobic interaction and then the second step of intercalation into the base of DNA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) was used to elucidate in detail the intercalation of PFOS into DNA and the formation of hydrogen bond between PFOS and DNA base. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) proved the formation of adducts of DNA and PFOS. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates that the PFOS influence DNA structure and attenuate DNA charge transport. These results demonstrate that PFOS intercalated into DNA do induce DNA base damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA adducts 3aDNA damage 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3acalves 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amethylene blue 3aquartz1 aXu, Laihui1 aKang, Tianfang1 aCheng, Shuiyuan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 May 15, v. 35, no. 1 p.180-185dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.02.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245016800162300001600330520165100346592002801997650002102025650001102046650001702057650001602074650002102090650002602111650001902137650002002156650001502176650001602191650001702207650001502224651001002239700002002249700001702269700001802286700001902304700001302323773010202336856008502438852000902523655001202532IND4448480720221123040220.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444848072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang10aCanopy reflectance in two castor bean varieties (Ricinus communis L.) for growth assessment and yield prediction on coastal saline land of Yancheng District, China  ap. 395-402.  aA field experiment was conducted in 2007–2009 in coastal saline regions of Yancheng city in Jiangsu province of China (120°13′E, 33°38′N). The experiment was to investigate relationships among canopy spectral reflectance, canopy chlorophyll density (CCD), leaf area index (LAI), and yield of two Chinese castor varieties (Zi Bi var. and Yun Bi var.) across four N fertilizer rates of 0, 90, 180, and 360kgNha⁻¹. These N rates were used to generate a wide range of difference in canopy structure and seed yield. Measurements of canopy reflectance were made throughout the growing season using a hand-held spectroradiometer. Samples for CCD and LAI were obtained on days that reflectance measurements were made. Fifteen hyperspectral reflectance indices were calculated. Canopy spectral characteristics were heavily influenced by saline soil background in the rapid growing period (RGP), thus hyperspectral data obtained in this period were not suited for reflecting castor growth condition or predicting final yield. CCD increased linearly with most reflectance indices in the full coverage period (FCP) and senescent period (SP) for the two castor varieties, whereas LAI did not. Most of reflectance indices were significantly correlated with yield of two varieties in different growing periods. The OSAVI model provided the best yield prediction for Zi Bi var. with predicted values very close to observed ones (R²=0.799), and the mSRVI705 model was well used for Yun Bi var. yield estimation (R²=0.759). These results indicate that the hyperspectral data measured at appropriate time could be well used for castor yield estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3acanopy 3acastor beans 3achlorophyll 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asaline soils 3aseed yield 3aChina1 aZhang, Huangshi1 aWu, Xianghua1 aShi, Chuanyan1 aHuang, Xianjin1 aQin, Pei0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.395-402dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300002000270520155200290592002801842596006601870650001301936650001201949650002201961650003301983650001302016650001602029650002102045650002202066650001302088650001302101650001302114650000702127650001902134650001102153650001602164650001502180700001502195700001602210700001502226773016902241856008102410852000902491655001202500IND60601062320221116172300.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060106232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2050-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaolong10aInfluence of temperature fluctuations on one-stage deammonification systems in northern cold region  ap. 18632-18641.  aCold and fluctuant temperatures are still a bottleneck for the application of one-stage deammonification in mainstream anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation). In this study, to simulate the practical but critical operational condition under rapidly fluctuant temperatures between April and May in cold northern area, two deammonification reactors with anammox granular sludge and nitritation flocculent sludge were tested under the cold shock with temperature fluctuations (11–18 °C). Under the controlled temperature (32 °C), good performances were obtained in both reactors. However, after the cold shock (ca. 13 °C), both reactors deteriorated similarly. The ammonia removal efficiencies decreased by half, while total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies decreased by two thirds. Nitrite accumulated in both reactors, while nitrate production was not disturbed although its contributions from nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) increased. In the stage with increasing wastewater temperatures (17.5 ± 2.2 °C), several operational conditions were tested to recover the performances, including limited dissolved oxygen, long hydraulic retention time (HRT), high nitrogen loading with elevated pH, and low NH₄⁺–N (60 mg/L), which did not significantly improve the performances, while the phenomena of heterotrophic nitrate reduction dramatically improved the nitrogen removal performances under limited aeration. During the cold temperature shock, insufficient anammox activity, and nitrate overproduction were the main problems.  aPublisher supplied data  aZD201412cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province 3aaeration 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacteria 3acold stress 3adissolved oxygen 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3apH 3apollution load 3asludge 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aQi, Guiman1 aYuegenYan, 1 aGao, Dawen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 19 p.18632-18641dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2050-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008400171300001600255520214100271592002802412650002002440650002102460650001802481650001502499650002702514650001302541650001902554650001302573650002502586650001402611650001602625651001202641653003802653653002802691653003902719700001302758773012202771856008402893852000902977655001202986IND60479363520170621000000.0160121e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047936352DNAL7 a10.1556/Agrokem.55.2006.1.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazányi, János10aEvaluation of 0.01 M CaCl2 Extractable Nitrogen Forms in a Long-term Experiment  ap. 135-144.  aSoil nitrogen undergoes a series of chemical and biological transformations, which influence their availability to plants and the leaching losses. Methods for measuring various forms of nitrogen in soil are important in order to improve N management and to minimize losses of essential nutrients in soils. In the present study 0.01 <i>M</i> CaCl <sub>2</sub> extraction was used to determine the concentrations of ammonium, nitrate and N-organic forms, as these are closely related to the N mineralization potential of the soil and play a major role in nitrogen availability to plants. Improving the precision of nitrogen requirement estimation is essential for increasing the efficiency and minimizing potential losses of nitrogen in agricultural production. A better knowledge of the plant-availability of nitrogen may help improve the efficient use of fertilizers and organic manure. In the present study the amounts of N-NO <sub>3</sub> , N-NH <sub>4</sub> and N organic were studied in Westsik's crop rotation experiment. The crop rotation experiment was established in 1929, and is the best known and most remarkable example of continuous production in Hungary, enabling the study of the long-term effects of organic manure treatment, the development of models and the prediction of the probable influences of different cropping systems on soil properties and crop yields in the Nyírség (sandy soil) region of Hungary. The study aimed the optimization of the fertilizer recommendation system by considering the soil N-organic content as a measurement of site-specific mineralization potential. The 0.01 <i>M </i> CaCl <sub>2</sub> extraction method measures soluble organic N compounds that are related to the mineralization of organic nitrogen in the soil. The introduction of this concept can possibly result in a more environment-friendly nitrogen fertilization, without negative effects on the yield or the quality of produced crops. Taking practicability and costs into consideration, the 0.01 <i>M</i> CaCl <sub>2</sub> extraction method is suitable for the routine analysis of measuring easily available organic nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acalcium chloride 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3afertilizer application 3aleaching 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3asandy soils 3aHungary 0a0.01 M CaCl2 extractable nitrogen 0asustainable agriculture 0anitrogen fertilizer recommendation1 aLoch, J.0 tAgrokémia és talajtan.g2006 Mar. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.135-144dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000044x0002-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/Agrokem.55.2006.1.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016700167300001800334500001900352520139600371592002801767650001701795650001401812650002101826650001201847650001901859650001401878650001901892650002401911650002101935650001101956650001301967650000901980650001101989650002202000650001902022700002202041700005602063773012402119856008202243852000902325655001202334IND60706976920221118232850.0200812e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070697692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05617-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarei, Mehrdad10aNatural bioactive 4-Hydroxyisophthalic acid (4-HIPA) exhibited antiproliferative potential by upregulating apoptotic markers in in vitro and in vivo cancer models  ap. 5343-5353.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is tremendous scope for identifying novel anti-cancer molecules from the unexplored reserves of plant kingdom. The application of dietary supplementation or medicine derived from such sources is a promising approach towards treatment of cancer. In the present study we have evaluated the antiproliferative potential of 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid (4-HIPA), which is a novel antioxidant compound isolated from the roots of the aqueous extract of Decalepis hamiltonii. 4-HIPA was screened in vitro against human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and normal human breast epithelial cell MCF-10, and demonstrated that human breast cancer cell lines, in contrast to MCF-10, are sensitive to 4-HIPA .4-HIPA showed marked reduction in cell viability and short-term proliferation assays in these cells. Results of the long-term colony formation and scratch assay further reaffirmed that 4-HIPA inhibited the growth and proliferation in breast cancer cells. We further conducted in vivo studies using murine Ehrlich Ascites Tumor (EAT) cell model. Our in vivo results established that treatment with 4-HIPA reduced the tumorigenesis by promoting apoptosis in EAT-bearing mice. The results of our molecular docking predictions further warranted our claim. This study is valuable as 4-HIPA exhibits antiproliferative potential that can be exploited in the development of anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acell viability 3adietary supplements 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amice 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aneoplasm cells1 aShivanandappa, T.1 aZarei, Mahsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0554-61630 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.5343-5353dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05617-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013100161300001400292520173500306592002802041650002002069650001902089650001702108650001902125650001602144650001602160650001402176650001302190650002202203650001302225650001502238653002102253653002802274653002502302653002302327653002802350700005602378700001602434700005302450700001502503700005702518773013702575856008302712852000902795655001202804IND60750801920221118005504.0211030e20211203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075080192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yi10aMicro/nano topography of selective laser melting titanium inhibits osteoclastogenesis via mediation of macrophage polarization  ap. 53-59.  aSelective laser melting (SLM) titanium (Ti) implants have shown good prospects for personalized clinical application, but further research is necessary to develop stabilized long-term properties. Since surface modification has been proven bioactive for osseointegration, conventional Ti surface treatment technologies, including sandblasting/acid-etching (SLA) and sandblasting/alkali-heating (SAH), were applied to construct micro and micro/nano surfaces. The SAH group with netlike nano-structure topography exhibited appropriate surface roughness and high hydrophilicity, and as expected, the osseointegration capacities in vivo of the three groups were in order of SAH > SLA > SLM. Besides, both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that the SLA- and SAH-treated SLM Ti implants significantly inhibited osteoclast activity of peri-implants. Considering the close associations between osteoclasts and macrophages, the effects of Ti surface topography on macrophage polarization were detected. The results showed that the SLA- and SAH-treated SLM Ti implants, especially the latter, had the capacity to promote macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype. Moreover, the cell culture supernatants of M2 macrophages and RAW264.7 cells seeded on SLA- and SAH-treated SLM Ti surfaces had an adverse effect on osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, this study demonstrated that micro/nano topographies of SLM Ti implants were effective for osseointegration promotion, and their inhibition of osteoclastogenesis might be attributed to macrophage polarization. Our findings shed some light on clinical application of SLM Ti implants and also prove a specific association between macrophage polarization and osteoclastogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abone formation 3acell culture 3ahydrophilicity 3amacrophages 3aosteoclasts 3aphenotype 3aresearch 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 3atopography 0aTitanium implant 0aSelective laser melting 0aSurface modification 0aOsteoclastogenesis 0aMacrophage polarization1 aTang, Cuizhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8286-68651 aDeng, Jiali1 aXu, Ruogu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0896-65691 aYang, Yang1 aDeng, Feilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6848-41740 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 581 p.53-59dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002100164245012800185300001600313520117900329592002801508650001301536650002401549650001801573650001601591650001101607650001901618650001201637650001401649650001401663700002001677700002301697700001601720700001801736700001701754700001901771700002001790700002101810700001901831773014401850856007901994852000902073655001202082IND50089332320221119030134.0150207e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008933232DNAL7 a249835332pmid7 a10.1111/1758-2229.121512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrediet, Cory J.10aInteractions between the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pallida and Serratia marcescens, an opportunistic pathogen of corals  ap. 287-292.  aCoral reefs are under increasing stress caused by global and local environmental changes, which are thought to increase the susceptibility of corals to opportunistic pathogens. In the absence of an easily culturable model animal, the understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression in corals remains fairly limited. In the present study, we tested the susceptibility of the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pallida to an opportunistic coral pathogen (Serratia marcescens). A. pallida was susceptible to S. marcescens PDL100 and responded to this opportunistic coral pathogen with darkening of the tissues and retraction of tentacles, followed by complete disintegration of polyp tissues. Histological observations revealed loss of zooxanthellae and structural changes in eosinophilic granular cells in response to pathogen infection. A screen of S. marcescens mutants identified a motility and tetrathionate reductase mutants as defective in virulence in the A. pallida infection model. In co‐infections with the wild‐type strain, the tetrathionate reductase mutant was less fit within the surface mucopolysaccharide layer of the host coral Acropora palmata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora 3aSerratia marcescens 3aanimal models 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adisease course 3amutants 3apathogens 3avirulence1 aMeyer, Julie L.1 aGimbrone, Nicholas1 aYanong, Roy1 aBerzins, Ilze1 aAlagely, Ali1 aCastro, Herman1 aRitchie, Kim B.1 aPaul, Valerie J.1 aTeplitski, Max0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2014 June, v. 6, no. 3 p.287-292dSociety for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Pub.x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.121513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011400170520133100284592002801615650001401643650001901657650001501676650000901691650002801700650002101728700002501749773010801774856008401882852000901966655001201975IND60782223820221118140030.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078222382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1008012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudau, Naledzani10aTowards understanding informal settlement growth patterns: Contribution to SDG reporting and spatial planning  aThe study proposes a ratio of informal settlement land consumption rate to imperviousness growth rate to understand informal settlement growth patterns. To compute this ratio, information on the informal extent and impervious surface within an informal settlement over at least two time periods is required. This ratio can be used to understand the density of building structures within an informal settlement. We investigated this ratio in a densely populated township in Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality over a five-year interval between 2005 and 2020. Informal settlement extent was generated using the object-based image analysis technique which uses asymmetry of image objects to classify informal settlements. The impervious surface was mapped using a ruleset that uses soil adjusted vegetation index, border index and radiometric values of the blue band. The results show that the ratio of land consumption rate of informal settlement to the impervious surface growth rate was 0.70 during the 2005–2010 interval, decreased substantially to −11.25 during the 2010–2015 interval and increased to 0.85 during the 2015–2020 interval. The results can be used to support the management and planning of informal settlement upgrade projects and to monitor progress made towards achieving sustainable development goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3aimage analysis 3aradiometry 3asoil 3asustainable development 3avegetation index1 aMhangara, Paidamwoyo0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.100801-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1008013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245004300161300001600204500001500220520103300235592002801268650001501296650001901311650001101330650002501341650001101366650001301377650000901390650001901399650001401418650001501432650001001447653001001457700002101467700001801488700002901506700002001535700001601555773011201571856004801683852000901731655001201740IND4482947520221120214658.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448294752DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838120200682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemi, Y.10aMicroalgae biofuel potentials (Review)  ap. 126-144.  a2019-12-05  aWith the decrease of fossil based fuels and the environmental impact of them over the planet, it seems necessary to seek the sustainable sources of clean energy. Biofuels, is becoming a worldwide leader in the development of renewable energy resources. It is worthwhile to say that algal biofuel production is thought to help stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and decrease global warming impacts. Also, among algal fuelsâ attractive characteristics, algal biodiesel is non toxic, with no sulfur, highly biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled. Algae are capable of producing in excess of 30 times more oil per acre than corn and soybean crops. Currently, algal biofuel production has not been commercialized due to high costs associated with production, harvesting and oil extraction but the technology is progressing. Extensive research was conducted to determine the utilization of microalgae as an energy source and make algae oil production commercially viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3acarbon dioxide 3asulfur 3aenvironmental impact 3aenergy 3asoybeans 3acorn 3aglobal warming 3abiodiesel 3amicroalgae 3acrops 0aAlgae1 aRasoul-Amini, S.1 aNaseri, A.

We developed and evaluated a novel rangeland model aimed at simulating rangeland at different stages of degradation using limited parameterisation and measurements.The developed model Linrange is a biophysical simulation model of the aboveground part of a mixed grass sward, combined with sub-models for evapotranspiration, soil water dynamics, and root development. Main processes of the biomass model are growth through a source/sink limited mechanism, reserve storage and remobilisation, basal area dynamics, winter dormancy. The grass sward is simulated based on average species characteristics of the dominating grass community.We show that a model based on simplified biophysical processes and a single set of parameters for a mixed sward can satisfactorily simulate mixed-species rangeland vegetation. The model also could reproduce year-to-year phytomass dynamics, including for exceptionally wet and dry years. Without calibrating specifically for it, the model was able to reproduce observed water-use efficiency values, indicating a good representation of the relationship between the main limiting factor, water, and productivity. By recalibrating the model using only five parameters associated with degradation, the accuracy of simulated degraded rangeland states was close to that of undegraded rangeland. We therefore consider the Linrange model a good tool for research on rangeland dynamics and degradation resulting from management and climate. We also point to directions of further model improvement, particularly regarding the modelling of parameter changes with degradation states.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3arangelands 3asward 3awater use efficiency 3asemiarid zones 3agrowth models 3asoil water 3apopulation growth 3adormancy 3abiomass 3astand basal area 3avegetation 0aDynamic model 0aDegradation 0aGrazing 0aSemi-arid grassland 0abasal area 0aRangeland model1 aEwert, Frank1 aSnyman, Hennie A.0 tEcological modelling.g2016 Feb. 24, v. 322 p.54-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001800283500001900301520142200320592002801742596006801770650002001838650001101858650001301869650002201882650001701904650002001921650002201941700001801963700005701981773012402038856008202162852000902244655001202253IND60706977120221118233428.0200812e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070697712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05608-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Liang10aGlobal correlation analysis for miRNA and protein expression profiles in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  ap. 5295-5304.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at protein level by protein translation inhibition or mRNA degradation. However, the global correlation patterns between miRNA and protein have not been studied yet. To establish the global correlation patterns in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), this study conducted multiple types of miRNA–protein correlation analyses in 28 Chinese subjects. Pearson correlation analysis showed a negative but relatively small global correlation in each subject. Among the 371 constructed miRNA–protein pairs (60 unique miRNAs, and 150 unique proteins), 10.5% of pairs have significant correlations (P < 0.05). Some highlighted miRNAs (e.g., hsa-miR-590-3p, hsa-miR-520d-3p) exerted significant regulation on multiple genes. Simultaneously, some genes (e.g., HSP90B1) were targeted by multiple miRNAs. The target genes associated with miRNAs tend to enrich in some important GO terms: biological processes (e.g., gene expression, protein binding and RNA binding), and molecular functions (protein binding: GO:0005515; RNA binding: GO:0003723). The results provided a global view of the miRNA–protein expression correlation profile in human PBMCs, which would facilitate in-depth investigation of biological functions of key miRNAs/proteins and better understanding of the pathogenesis underlying PBMC related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a560 thousand yuancNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3apathogenesis 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis1 aDeng, Fei-Yan1 aLei, Shu-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1453-80820 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.5295-5304dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05608-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009700166520114800263592002801411650001101439650002001450650001401470650001301484650001301497650004301510650001601553700001701569773012701586856007401713852000901787655001201796IND60652350120221118022005.0190712e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235012DNAL7 a10.3390/su100724342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFastenrath, Sebastian10aLost in Transition? Directions for an Economic Geography of Urban Sustainability Transitions  aSocio-technical transitions towards more sustainable modes of production and consumption are receiving increasing attention in the academic world and also from political and economic decision-makers. There is increasing demand for resource-efficient technologies and institutional innovations, particularly at the city level. However, it is widely unclear how processes of change evolve and develop and how they are embedded in different socio-spatial contexts. While numerous scholars have contributed to the vibrant research field around sustainability transitions, the geographical expertise largely has been ignored. The lack of knowledge about the role of spatial contexts, learning processes, and the co-evolution of technological, economical, and socio-political processes has been prominently addressed. Bridging approaches from Transition Studies and perspectives of Economic Geography, the paper presents conceptual ideas for an evolutionary and relational understanding of urban sustainability transitions. The paper introduces new perspectives on sustainability transitions towards a better understanding of socio-spatial contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adecision making 3ageography 3alearning 3apolitics 3asustainability science and engineering 3aurban areas1 aBraun, Boris0 tSustainability.g2018 July 12, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100724343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002400153245015700177300001400334520195600348592002802304650002202332650001702354650001702371650002002388650002102408650001402429650001702443650001802460650001102478650004302489650002302532650000902555650001602564650001702580650001602597650001602613700002002629700002202649700002202671773009802693856008902791852000902880655001202889IND4468672720221122222937.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446867272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConcellón, Analía10aChanges in quality and phenolic antioxidants in dark purple American eggplant (Solanum melongena L. cv. Lucía) as affected by storage at 0°C and 10°C  ap. 35-41.  aMany beneficial effects associated with fruit and vegetable consumption are related to the presence of antioxidants, which could be greatly affected by postharvest storage conditions. Eggplants or aubergines (Solanum melongena L.) are among the top vegetables in terms of antioxidant content. In this work, we evaluated the effect of two postharvest temperature regimes on deterioration and antioxidants of dark purple American eggplants (cv. Lucía). Fruit were stored at 0 or 10°C for 0, 3, 5, 10 or 14 d and weight loss, electrolyte leakage, chilling injury, and pulp browning were evaluated. We also followed DPPH and Folin–Ciocalteu reacting substances and the content of chlorogenic and quinic acid by HPLC. Although weight loss was reduced in fruit held at 0°C, higher electrolyte leakage and chilling injury manifested as surface scalds and pulp browning were found. Antioxidants (AOX) measured with the DPPH radical and with the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent increased during the first 3 d of storage at 0°C, but afterwards significant degradation was found. In contrast, a gradual but continuous accumulation of AOX was detected in fruit stored at 10°C. The slow rate in the reaction between DPPH and eggplant samples suggested that the main changes during postharvest storage were due to modifications in phenolic compounds. The major phenolic detected by HPLC was chlorogenic acid (ChA), an ester between caffeic (CA) and quinic acids (QA), which accumulated in fruit maintained at 10°C, increasing by 60% after 14 d of storage. No free CA was found at any storage temperature or time, suggesting that its biosynthesis is activated simultaneously with the production of ChA. Free QA showed minor changes at 0°C as pulp lightness decreased, indicating that ChA rather than CA may be the main substrate for browning reactions. Changes in eggplant fruit antioxidants during storage at chilling and non-chilling temperatures are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum melongena 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3achilling injury 3achlorogenic acid 3aeggplants 3aelectrolytes 3afree radicals 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenolic compounds 3apulp 3aquinic acid 3astorage time 3atemperature 3aweight loss1 aZaro, María J.1 aChaves, Alicia R.1 aVicente, Ariel R.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2012 Apr., v. 66 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.x0925-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245012800159520092500287592002801212650002001240650001801260650001901278650001101297650002401308650001301332650002001345653002201365653001901387653001801406653001801424700001601442700001801458700001801476700001401494700001601508773010301524856007801627852000901705655001201714IND4435758620221121155122.0160209e20100318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443575862DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.18322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Benyin10aExperimental Study on Energy Saving of Fluidized Bed Dryer with Self-Excited Mode Oscillating-Flow Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger  aThis paper investigated experimentally the influences of gas flow type, position of heat source and gas flow rate on the properties of a heat exchanger with a Self-Excited Mode Oscillating-Flow Heat Pipe (SEMOFHP). The SEMOFHPs were made from copper with an inner diameter of 3mm. Distilled water was used as working liquid. The results showed that the heat exchange capability of the SEMOFHP heat exchanger is about 3 times higher than that of a common tube heat exchanger. The heat exchanger unit used in the experiments was operated under counterflow, bottom heat source and high gas flow rate conditions. However, it was found that the unit could also work well with a top heat source arrangement. The heat recovery efficiency of the heat exchanger is slightly increased with the increase of inlet air temperature. The SEMOFHP heat pipe works only when the hot gas temperature is higher than the initial temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3afluidized beds 3adryers 3aenergy conservation 3aair flow 3afood processing 0aSEMOFHP heat pipe 0aheat exchanger 0aenergy saving 0aheat recovery1 aLi, Xuanyou1 aZhou, Shenjie1 aLiu, Dengying1 aShao, Min1 aPeng, Lihua0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2010 Mar. 18, v. 6, no. 2dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.18323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03890naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011400163300002000277520227800297592002802575650002302603650001702626650001502643650002402658650002002682650001102702650001402713650001302727650001602740650001302756650001202769650001602781650001602797653003302813653003102846653002302877653002202900653000802922653002002930653001802950700002102968700001802989700001803007700005903025700006003084773014103144856007803285852000903363655001203372IND60650870120221121014521.0190710e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087012DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b006032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChugh, Srishti10aDramatic Enhancement of Optoelectronic Properties of Electrophoretically Deposited C₆₀–Graphene Hybrids  ap. 24349-24359.  aFullerene (C₆₀) and multilayer graphene hybrid devices were fabricated using electrophoretic deposition, where the C₆₀ clusters are electrically charged upon the application of an external bias in a polar solvent, acetonitrile, mixed with toluene, which facilitates their deposition on the graphene membranes. Raman spectroscopy unveiled the unique vibrational fingerprints associated with the A₂g mode of the C₆₀ molecules at ∼1453 cm–¹, while blue shifts of ∼6 and ∼17 cm–¹ were also attributed to the G- and 2D-bands of the hybrids relative to bare graphene, suggestive of p-doped graphene. The intensity ratio of the G- and the 2D-bands I₂D/IG (hybrid) dropped to ∼0.18 from ∼0.3 (bare graphene), and this reduction in I₂D/IG is also a signature of hole-doped graphene, consistent with the relatively strong electron accepting nature of C₆₀. The electronic conductance of the two-terminal hybrid devices increased relative to bare graphene at room temperature which was attributed to the increased carrier density, and temperature-dependent electronic transport measurements were also conducted from ambient down to ∼5.8 K. Additionally, a low energy shift in the Fermi level, EF ≈ 140 meV, was calculated for the hybrids. When the hybrid devices were irradiated with a broadband white light source and a tunable laser source (with a wavelength λ ranging from ∼400–1100 nm), a strong photoresponse was evident, in contrast to the bare graphene devices which appeared unresponsive. The responsivity R of the hybrids was measured to be ∼10⁹ A/W at λ ≈ 400 nm and ∼298 K, while the detectivity and external quantum efficiency were also exceptional, ∼10¹⁵ jones and ∼10⁹%, respectively, at ∼1 V and a light power density of ∼3 mW/cm². The R values are ∼10 times higher compared to other hybrid devices derived from graphene reported previously, such as quantum dot-graphene and few-layer MoS₂–graphene heterostructures. The strong photoresponse of the C₆₀–graphene hybrids reported here is attributed to the doping enhancement arising in graphene upon the adsorption of C₆₀. This work demonstrates the exceptional potential of such hybrid nanocarbon-based structures for optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aelectrophoresis 3aenergy 3afullerene 3agraphene 3airradiation 3asolvents 3atoluene 3awavelengths 3awhite light 0aC60−graphene hybrid device 0aelectrophoretic deposition 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aelectron transfer 0aAFM 0aoptoelectronics 0aphotoresponse1 aAdhikari, Nirmal1 aLee, Ji Hyung1 aBerman, Diana1 aEchegoyen, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-94231 aKaul, Anupama B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4052-80640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 29, v. 11, no. 27 p.24349-24359dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b006033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245008100185300001600266520074000282592002801022650001401050650001301064650001901077650001801096650002201114650001601136650001001152650001801162650002401180650000901204650001801213650001501231650003701246650001101283650001401294650002101308650002001329650001301349650002001362651001101382651001301393651001101406653001401417653001301431653001301444653001501457773009401472856008401566852000901650655001201659IND50060465220221122163217.0190318e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006046522DNAL7 a230927562pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobstein, T.10aResearch needs on food marketing to children.

Correspondingly, the optimization of thermal processes has to have two different criteria: the well known entropy generation minimization method and the recently proposed entransy dissipation maximization method. This study analyzes the thermal issues in a heat exchanger group, and optimizes the unit arrangements under different constraints based on a suitable optimization criterion. The result indicates that the principle of minimum entropy generation rate is valid for optimizing heat exchangers in a thermodynamic cycle with given boundary temperatures. In contrast, the entransy dissipation maximization is more suitable in heat exchanger optimizations involving only heat transfer processes. Furthermore, the entropy generation rate induced by dumping used streams into ambient surroundings has to be taken into account, except for that originating from the hot and cold-ends of heat exchangers, when using the entropy generation minimization to optimize heat exchangers undergoing a thermodynamic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aentropy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer1 aWu, Jing1 aWang, MoRan1 aPan, N.q(Ning),1 aGuo, Zengyuan,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Feb., v. 56, no. 4-5 p.449-454dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-010-4297-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170300001800289520033100307592002800638650001800666650002800684650001100712650001300723650001300736653005400749653002500803653003100828653001100859653002200870700001900892700002100911700002000932700001800952700001700970773011200987856008401099852000901183655001201192IND60599495620221119023130.0180702e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059949562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.05.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatae, Noriyuki10aHalogen effect on tandem [4+2] cycloaddition/aromatization sequence of allenyl 2-halo-3-vinylcyclohex-2-enyl ether  ap. 4146-4148.  aSteric and enthalpic effects of substituents on diene moieties play a crucial role in intramolecular cycloaddition reactions.

This study investigated the nutrient composition of so-called organic fertilizers in Vietnam&rsquo;s markets and issues related to their production, and evaluated their potential to contaminate the groundwater. We analyzed the physicochemical properties of 12 domestic and four imported products of the fertilizers, and conducted a cultivation experiment in sandy soil with the fertilizer applied at a rate of 200 mg N kg&minus;1 soil using an automatic watering apparatus in a greenhouse. We further studied the production of an &ldquo;organic fertilizer&rdquo; from coffee by-products. The nutrient content greatly varied among domestic products, whereas they were quite similar among imported products. The product packaging of the collected samples lacked information regarding raw materials. Two thirds of the domestic products contained over 30% of the total N in the inorganic form, implying that the N content dramatically increased in the fertilizers rather than in their supposed raw materials. The stages involved in the production were composting, the addition of extra soil as a bulking agent, and the mixing-in of chemical substances to increase the nutrient content before packing. The remarkably high ratio of inorganic N to total N was attributed to excessive N leaching from soil by the application of domestic fertilizers. These results suggested the need for quality criteria guidelines for organic fertilizers in Vietnam that underline not only nutrient levels, but also the control of raw materials and production process of compost, because they are closely related to nutrient uptake and the leaching loss of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abyproducts 3acomposting 3acomposts 3adeveloping countries 3agovernance 3agreenhouses 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3aleaching 3amarkets 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3apackaging 3araw materials 3asandy soils 3atotal nitrogen 3aVietnam1 aKazuto, Shima0 tSustainability.g2018 July 12, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100724373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007200167300001400239520143400253592002801687650002401715650002301739650001601762650001101778650001301789650001001802650001301812650002101825650002401846651001101870653001301881653002301894653001301917653002001930653003001950700001701980700001801997700001402015700001602029773010002045856008502145852000902230655001202239IND60479364120170621000000.0160121e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047936412DNAL7 a10.1556/Agrokem.55.2006.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzegi, Tamás10aQuantitative Rheological Indicators for Soil Physical Degradation   ap. 69-78.  aA lot of attention is being paid to the understanding of the influence of soil degradation on human life at the beginning of the 21 <sup>st</sup> century. Among the many types of degradation processes, structural degradation is widespread on huge areas in Europe. For better control, it is needed to get familiar with all the driving forces, the main reasons that lead to soil degradation (Várallyay, 2003; ESB, 2002). In addition to unfavourable natural conditions, inappropriate land use has an important impact on micro-aggregate stability and the rate of tolerance to deformation forces, such as cultivation and erosion. Rheological measurements provide new quantitative information on particle-particle interaction, the colloidal stability and structure of concentrated suspensions in general. Field samples from loess derived agricultural soils were investigated. In addition to general laboratory analyses (soil organic matter content, CaCO <sub>3</sub> content, CEC), conventional, simple aggregate stability, and water retention measurements and rheology were applied for investigating the micro-aggregate stability of the samples. The evaluation of pseudoplastic flow curves indicated close relationships between the strength and stability of the physical network and the composition of the suspensions. These soil properties have strong, well-defined connection with tolerating cultivation and capability for erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aagricultural soils 3adeformation 3ahumans 3aland use 3aloess 3arheology 3asoil degradation 3asoil organic matter 3aEurope 0aland use 0acohesive structure 0arheology 0ashear tolerance 0amicro-aggregate stability1 aTombácz, E.1 aCzibulya, Zs.1 aAkagi, J.1 aZsolnay, A.0 tAgrokémia és talajtan.g2006 Mar. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.69-78dAkadémiai Kiadóx0002-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAgrokem.55.2006.1.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245017900163300001800342520204700360592002802407650001202435650001602447650001302463651001002476700001702486700001902503700001902522700001802541700002002559700001202579773010202591856004802693852000902741655001202750IND4483836820221120224313.0120715e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448383682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4668-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wenzhi,10aComparative study of gas accumulations in the Permian Changxing reefs and Triassic Feixianguan oolitic reservoirs between Longgang and Luojiazhai-Puguang in the Sichuan Basin  ap. 3310-3320.  aReef and oolitic gas reservoirs in the Permian Changxing and Triassic Feixianguan formations have been discovered in both the Luojiazhai-Puguang and Longgang areas of the Sichuan Basin, but the accumulation scale, abundance and distribution patterns differ greatly. In fact, the two areas have more differences than they have similarities. Similarities include: (1) the lithology, properties and types of porosity of the reef and oolitic reservoirs are primarily consistent in the two areas; (2) well-developed regional caprocks that seal the fluid system; and (3) accumulation process histories, with liquid hydrocarbon charging at an early stage, cracking into gas at a high to over-mature stage, adjustment of gas reservoirs at an uplifting stage, and final reservoir generation at a late stage. Differences include: (1) gas accumulations in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area that are dominated by oil-type cracked gas, with multiple and sufficient gas sources, contrasting with gas accumulations in the Longgang area that are dominated by coal-sourced gas with insufficient gas sources; (2) heterogeneity and horizontal diversity of reservoirs in the Longgang area that are stronger than in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area; and (3) the development of deep and large faults in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area that link source, reservoir and migration pathways, contrasting with poorly developed faults in Longgang area, where laterally variable fractures are the major migration pathway. Because of these differences, abundant large-scale structurally-controlled gas accumulations are developed in the Luojiazhai-Puguang area, whereas lithology plays a more important role in gas accumulation in the Longgang area where accumulations are smaller-scale and have lower gas-bearing abundance. We suggest that future exploration for reef and oolitic gas accumulations should be strengthened in NE Sichuan and NW Sichuan Jiulongshan. In particular, the transitional zone between Longgang and Kaijiang-Liangping Bay has the best potential for new discoveries.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageology 3anatural gas 3aporosity 3aChina1 aXu, ChunChun1 aWang, TongShan1 aWang, Hongjun,1 aWang, ZeCheng1 aBian, CongSheng1 aLi, Xia0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Nov., v. 56, no. 31 p.3310-3320dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4668-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001800185245006300203300001200266520118100278592002801459650001201487650001501499650000901514650001101523650000901534650000901543650001401552650001201566650001501578650001001593651001801603700002901621700002101650700002101671773012501692856008101817852000901898655001201907IND60586043620221122015134.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058604362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3640-x2doi7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3640-x2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraber, Kayla10aIs Oil-Well Produced Water Effective in Abating Road Dust?  ap. 449.  aEnergy development in the Bakken and Three Forks formations of the USA has led to an increase in fugitive dust from unpaved roads. A dust abatement alternative that has been considered in this region is oil-well produced waters. The objectives of this study were to compare dust loading at sites abated with produced water to non-abated control sites and to determine if the elemental constituents in released dust are different compared to control roads. Three previously untreated unpaved roads were selected, and passive dust collectors were placed at 10, 20, 40, and 60 m from the road on the downwind side of the dominant prevailing wind in each mile section. Eighty-four days post-application, two sections treated with produced waters failed to reduce dust when compared to the controls. Dust elemental changes were found on two of the three roads. Elements that were found to have differences included Mo, Mn, Fe, As, Au, and Hg. Overall results indicated that oil-well produced water is not effective at controlling road dust. Results of this study are important to road managers who are contemplating the usage of produced waters to reduce dusts from unpaved roads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acollectors 3adust 3aenergy 3agold 3airon 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolybdenum 3aroads 3aUnited States1 aHargiss, Christina L.

Spatio-temporal control using a surface functionalized nano-carrier seems to be the best alternative for guided drug delivery and release. This manuscript provides a broad spectrum about the drug carrier interface modification to cover the need for temporal drug delivery control under neglect side effects. On the other hand, recent advances related to the drug vehicle are highlighted, besides physical (Electric field, magnetic field, light) or mechanical (Ultrasound, mechanical strain), chemical (pH, redox gradient, enzyme) stimuli mediated DDS. Precisely, the paper focus on the NIR light as an effective external stimulus for remotely-triggered DDS. NIR responsive drug delivery systems are considered as novel drug modality that ensures an eco-friendly spatiotemporal control and an administrated meditation. This study also investigated the NIIR spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with partial least square (PLS) for quantitative analysis of a polyvinyl alcohol based prodrug (PVA-DOX) in order to reveal the high potential of NIRS for drug release monitoring and the extraction of concise calibration models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3adrugs 3aelectric field 3aleast squares 3amagnetic fields 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ananocarriers 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 0aNIR light 0aNIR spectroscopy 0aSpatiotemporal triggered release 0aNano structures 0aAuNCs 0aAuNPs 0aAuNSs 0aAuNTs 0aAuNFs 0aAuNShs 0aAuNRs, GNRs 0aATP 0aBNs 0aCA 0aCOFs 0aCNTs 0aCTAB 0aDCA 0aDDS 0aDOX 0aEF 0aFA 0aIONPs 0aICPs 0aMCNs 0aMMSSN 0aMOFs 0aMF 0aMWNTs 0aMTNs 0aMSNs 0aNDs 0aNPs 0aNIRS 0aNMOFs 0aORP 0aOPH 0aPTT 0aPDT 0aPTX 0aPTT 0aPDT 0aPCL 0aPLA 0aPLG, PLGA 0aPEG 0aPEA 0aPVA 0aPPGDMA 0aPEGDMA 0aPPGDA 0aPEGDMA 0aPEG-DTT 0aPVA–HNT 0aPDPA 0aPSiNPs 0aPLS 0aROS 0aRMSEC 0aSOD1 0aSP 0aSWNHs 0aSWNCs 0aSWNTs 0aSWNTs 0aTSL 0aUCNPs1 aJiang, Bo1 aTaloub, Nadia1 aHuang, Yu Dong0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006200188245010700250300002000357506007600377520131600453592002801769596005201797506003701849650002001886650002001906650001501926650001901941650001501960650001101975650002001986650000702006650001802013650002102031650001002052650001802062700002202080700002202102773016902124856008102293852000902374655001202383IND60601063220221207101531.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060106322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2049-42doi7 aPMC60615112pmcid7 a297059072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieczerzak, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3848-203910aImpact of selected drugs and their binary mixtures on the germination of Sorghum bicolor (sorgo) seeds  ap. 18717-18727.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to assess the toxicological potential of binary drug mixtures and individual drugs under different pH conditions with different inorganic ion additions on the germination of Sorghum bicolor (sorgo) seeds. To assess whether the given drug mixtures were more phytotoxic than the individual compounds, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) approaches were applied to estimate the predicted phytotoxicity values, followed by calculations of the MDR (model deviation factor) to determine the deviation from the predicted values. Binary mixtures of chloramphenicol with ketoprofen, diclofenac sodium, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride proved to be synergistic. The pH changes had the largest impact on the phytotoxicity of the diclofenac sodium and ketoprofen solutions, elevating their toxicity toward S. bicolor, and the co-presence of inorganic ions was shown to have an impact on ketoprofen, chloramphenicol, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Most of the interactions between sorgo plants and pharmaceuticals with added ions were antagonistic in nature, particularly those calculated using the IA model, with a few cases (one case for ketoprofen and chloramphenicol, two cases for oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and four cases for diclofenac sodium) of overestimation.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEC-2013/09/N/NZ8/03247cNarodowe Centrum Nauki0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSorghum bicolor 3achloramphenicol 3adiclofenac 3ainorganic ions 3aketoprofen 3amodels 3aoxytetracycline 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asweet sorghum1 aKudłak, Błażej1 aNamieśnik, Jacek0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 19 p.18717-18727dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2049-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010200169300001600271520127500287592002801562650004401590650001501634650002301649650001501672650001001687650001001697650002501707650001901732650003301751650002001784700002701804700002501831700002501856773010201881856008201983852000902065655001202074IND60091581320221122070432.0141103e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009158132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.02.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Ashutosh10aDetection of p53 gene point mutation using sequence-specific molecularly imprinted PoPD electrode  ap. 224-229.  aAn amperometric sequence-specific molecularly imprinted single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ss-ODN) biosensor was fabricated and characterised in this study. Using ss-ODN as the template and o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer, the ODN biosensor was fabricated by an electropolymerisation process on an indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The template ss-ODN was washed out of the ss-ODN/poly(o-phenylenediamine)(PoPD)/ITO electrode using sterilised basic ethanol-water. The resulting ss-ODN imprinted PoPD/ITO electrode was characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The amperometric responses, i.e., Δi as a function of the target ss-ODN concentration was studied. The biosensor using ss-ODN imprinted PoPD/ITO as the working electrode showed a linear Δ current response to the target ss-ODN concentration within the range of 0.01–300fM. The biosensor showed a sensitivity of 0.62μA/fM, with a response time of 14s. The present novel molecularly imprinted ss-ODN biosensor could greatly benefit in terms of cost-effectiveness, storage stability, ultra sensitivity and selectivity together with the potential for improved commercial genetic sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3agenes 3aglass 3amolecular imprinting 3apoint mutation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage quality1 aDeshpande, Swapneel R.1 aKobayashi, Hisatoshi1 aTurner, Anthony P.F.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 May 15, v. 35, no. 1 p.224-229dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.02.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04199naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174300001600287520276900303592002803072650001503100650001403115650001203129650000903141650001603150650002003166650002503186650001803211650000903229650002203238650002603260650001803286650001803304650001903322650002303341650002503364651001803389653001503407653000903422653005003431653001603481653001603497773010703513856008803620852000903708655001203717IND60525807120221117202739.0190319e20160224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052580712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatsumi, Kenichi10aEffects of automatic multi-objective optimization of crop models on corn yield reproducibility in the U.S.A.  ap. 124-137.  aThis study presents a detailed analysis relating to the effectiveness and efficiency of the multi-objective complex evolution (MOCOM-UA) algorithm on the reproducibility of corn yield for the period 1999–2010 in the United States of America. The algorithm was coupled with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and is capable of solving the multi-objective calibration problem for crop models. Understanding how model parameters are determined from past research work is especially difficult because parameter determination is usually performed by manual trial and error methods and still remains a black box. Single-objective functions are often inadequate to properly measure all characteristics of the observed datasets and do not usually provide parameter estimates that are considered acceptable. In contrast, a multi-criteria optimization would allow the analysis of the trade-offs among different criteria, and would indicate the limitations of the current crop model structure better. Therefore, a multi-objective algorithm was used in this study to identify the critical model parameters and to glean a better understanding of model uncertainties. The uncertainty analysis of the model was performed by comparing simulation results obtained using randomly generated initial parameters and inputs with the attainable calibrated parameters and inputs. Three model parameters (biomass to energy ratio (BE), harvest index (HI), potential heat units (PHU)) and two inputs (planting dates (PDAY), planting density (PDENS)) were optimized on a grid-scale to capture a more realistic spatial pattern and temporal variability of corn yield. The conclusions derived from this study are: (1) the critical parameters needed to reproduce corn yield with EPIC are BE, HI, and PHU; (2) the MOCOM-UA calibration procedure is highly effective in improving the spatial agreement and temporal variability of corn yield and for reducing the width of the uncertainty band; (3) by using the calibrated parameter sets, measurement errors of spatial-averaged ensemble mean yield are significantly improved; (4) simulation using the EPIC model showed better performance in the major corn area with relatively accurate input datasets, but performed poorly in the minor corn area with lower yield and corn area ratio. This study highlights the projected contribution of the multi-objective optimization procedure in identifying critical model parameters in reducing the width of the uncertainty band, and in improving the spatial agreement and temporal variability of corn yield. Future work should focus on the effect of optimizing more appropriate parameters such as those that affect water availability or soil fertility status on crop yield reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abioenergy 3aclimate 3acorn 3acrop models 3adata collection 3aenvironmental policy 3aharvest index 3aheat 3amodel uncertainty 3aplant available water 3aplant density 3aplanting date 3asoil fertility 3atemporal variation 3auncertainty analysis 3aUnited States 0aCorn yield 0aEPIC 0aMulti-objective complex evolution calibration 0aReliability 0aUncertainty0 tEcological modelling.g2016 Feb. 24, v. 322 p.124-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009700169500000900266520130900275592002801584650001601612650002001628650001401648650001401662650001001676650002301686650001701709650003001726650001701756650002801773650001601801650001301817700001701830700002001847700002201867700002101889700001201910700002101922700001401943700001901957700001701976773011601993856008802109852000902197655001202206IND60669729620221119062543.0191126e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066972962DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2013.03.00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yulin,10aIdentification of Quantitative Trait Loci Underlying Plant Height and Seed Weight in Soybean  aepub  aFor clarifying the genetic base of the variation of yield-related traits in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for plant height and seed weight using a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between Chinese elite line Zhongpin03-5373 and cultivar Zhonghuang13. We detected 11 QTLs for plant height and 18 QTLs for seed weight across six diverse environments. These included three pairs of plant height- vs. seed weight-related QTLs located in close proximity to each other, with two pairs, qPH-7 vs. qSW-7-2 and qPH-19-2 vs. qSW-19, sharing the same direction of additive effects. Individual QTLs explained 2.02 to 47.60% of the variation in plant height and 2.13 to 14.35% in seed weight. Two and five of the major QTLs discovered for plant height and seed weight, respectively, that were stable across environments in our study have been reported previously. Among them, four QTLs, qPH-13, qSW-11, qSW-12-2, and qSW-18, were not involved in digenic epistatic interaction in our biparental population, indicating that these QTLs will be useful for marker-assisted selection and should be targeted for the future identification of candidate genes. Moreover, eight QTLs for both plant height and seed weight were newly identified in our population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aadditive effect 3acultivars 3aepistasis 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ainbred lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3aplant height 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed weight 3asoybeans1 aLi, Yinghui,1 aReif, Jochen C.1 aMette, Michael F.1 aLiu, Zhang-xiong1 aLiu, Bo1 aZhang, Shan-shan1 aYan, Long1 aChang, Ru-zhen1 aQiu, Li-juan0 tThe plant genome.g2013 Nov., v. 6, no. 3dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2013.03.00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010400169300001600273520094400289592002801233650003101261650001401292650002101306650002101327650001801348650001101366650001601377650000901393650001701402650001101419650002301430653002401453653002301477653002001500653002001520700001801540700003201558700003501590700001901625700003001644773011201674856008201786852000901868655001201877IND60527298620221119021119.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalhaoui, Nassima10aPhenolic compounds and in vitro immunomodulatory properties of three Andalusian olive leaf extracts  ap. 270-277.  aPhenolic compounds in extracts of three olive leaf cultivars were determined using HPLC-DAD-TOF-MS. The determination of the immunomodulatory properties of the whole phenolic extracts was then carried out on RAW 264 mouse macrophages as a preliminary in vitro study. Twenty-eight phenolic compounds were determined in the olive leaf extracts and high contents of total phenolics were shown, particularly for ‘Picual’ cultivar. In addition, all olive leaf extracts inhibited the release of the pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells revealing their immunomodulatory properties. As a preliminary result, it could be deduced that the inhibition of NO by the olive leaf extract may depend on the type of phenolic compounds rather than on the total phenolic contents. This is the first time that whole phenolic extracts of olive leaves have been used in in vitro study of their anti-inflammatory properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acultivars 3aimmunomodulators 3ain vitro studies 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3aolives 3aphenolic compounds 0aOlive leaf extracts 0aPhenolic compounds 0aHPLC-DAD-TOF-MS 0aIn vitro assays1 aVezza, Teresa1 aGómez-Caravaca, Ana María1 aFernández-Gutiérrez, Alberto1 aGálvez, Julio1 aSegura-Carretero, Antonio0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.270-277dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009400188300001800282500001500300520143900315592002801754650001601782650001401798650001501812650001401827650001601841650001201857650001301869650001501882650001101897650002001908650001301928650002801941650002301969650001701992650001602009650001502025650001402040650003602054653001802090700001902108700002102127700002202148700002402170773009402194856008102288990002302369852000902392655001202401IND60093934920221123023250.0141104e20120710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009393492DNAL7 a227899972pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanouškovec, Jan10aGlobal analysis of plastid diversity reveals apicomplexan-related lineages in coral reefs  ap. R518-R519.  a2019-12-06  aThe presence of relict non-photosynthetic plastids in obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites (e.g. Plasmodium) has proved puzzling in many ways, but the recent discovery of their photosynthetic relative, Chromera velia, has begun to shed much-needed light on the origin and evolution of these plastids [1,2]. The intense interest that this single species has generated demonstrates how surprisingly little we know about photosynthetic relatives of apicomplexans as a whole. Here, we investigate global plastid diversity and distribution by comprehensively searching existing prokaryotic sequence surveys for eukaryotic plastids. From more than 1.6 million bacterial sequences, we identified 9,799 plastid-derived sequences, most of which were previously mis-labeled as ‘novel bacteria’ sequences. 98.8% of these plastid-derived sequences could be assigned to well-defined algal lineages, most often green algae, diatoms, and haptophytes. The exceptions were 121 sequences, all of which were related to apicomplexan parasites, and nearly all of which were derived from coral reef environments. Close relatives of C. velia were rare, but two other clusters were more common and globally distributed, one of which was tightly associated with corals. Overall, all of the major new lineages of algae we discovered were related to apicomplexans, suggesting that apicomplexans represent a large pool of unexplored algal diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3aparasites 3aPlasmodium 3aevolution 3aChlorophyta 3asurveys 3aplastids 3aHaptophyta 3acorals 3aBacillariophyta 3abacteria 2aApicomplexaxphysiology 2aBacteriaxgenetics 2aBiodiversity 2aCoral Reefs 2aHaplotypes 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aChlorophycota1 aHorák, Aleš,1 aBarott, Katie L.1 aRohwer, Forest L.1 aKeeling, Patrick J.0 tCurrent biology.g2012 July 10, v. 22, no. 13 p.R518-R519dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245012500201300001600326506007600342520149100418592002801909506003701937650000801974650002701982650002602009650001002035650001302045650004202058650001302100650001402113650002102127653003102148653002402179653003202203653002102235653002402256653003002280653001302310653002402323700001702347700002002364773013002384856007402514852000902588655001202597IND60624530920221207045916.0181204e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062453092DNAL7 a10.1093/bib/bbv0682doi7 aPMC49458272pmcid7 a263070612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Feixiong10aAdvances in computational approaches for prioritizing driver mutations and significantly mutated genes in cancer genomes  ap. 642-656.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCancer is often driven by the accumulation of genetic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions, gene fusions, copy-number variations, and large chromosomal rearrangements. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have helped investigators generate massive amounts of cancer genomic data and catalog somatic mutations in both common and rare cancer types. So far, the somatic mutation landscapes and signatures of >10 major cancer types have been reported; however, pinpointing driver mutations and cancer genes from millions of available cancer somatic mutations remains a monumental challenge. To tackle this important task, many methods and computational tools have been developed during the past several years and, thus, a review of its advances is urgently needed. Here, we first summarize the main features of these methods and tools for whole-exome, whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing data. Then, we discuss major challenges like tumor intra-heterogeneity, tumor sample saturation and functionality of synonymous mutations in cancer, all of which may result in false-positive discoveries. Finally, we highlight new directions in studying regulatory roles of noncoding somatic mutations and quantitatively measuring circulating tumor DNA in cancer. This review may help investigators find an appropriate tool for detecting potential driver or actionable mutations in rapidly emerging precision cancer medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achromosome aberrations 3acopy number variation 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amedicine 3aneoplasms 3asomatic mutation 0anext-generation sequencing 0acancer driver genes 0asignificantly mutated genes 0adriver mutations 0astructural genomics 0aprecision cancer medicine 0apanomics 0acomputational tools1 aZhao, Junfei1 aZhao, Zhongming0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2016 July, v. 17, no. 4 p.642-656dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009000165300001600255520119100271592002801462650002101490650001801511650002501529650002101554650001501575650002201590650001601612650001101628650001801639650001601657650001401673650001801687651001301705653002101718653003101739653001901770653003201789653001401821700001701835700001401852773011201866856008401978852000902062655001202071IND60122529420221118052225.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012252942DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2014.9607912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTubatsi, G10aWater quality dynamics in the Boro-Thamalakane-Boteti river system, northern Botswana  ap. 351-360.  aThe quality of water in aquatic systems is subject to temporal and spatial variations due to varying effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. This study assessed the dynamics of water quality in the Boro-Thamalakane-Boteti river system along an upstream–downstream gradient above and below Maun during February, May, September and December 2012. Temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, Escherichia coli and faecal streptococci were monitored in the settlements of Boro, Maun, Xobe, Samedupi, Chanoga and Motopi along the river system. Comparisons of water quality among settlements using ANOVA and Tukey's honest significant difference test highlighted a significant decline in water quality from upstream to downstream, indicated by increases in microbial numbers and turbidity. The quality of water improved as the water level rose during the peak flooding season in September and declined thereafter. This study highlights the possible influence of human settlements and associated developments on waterbodies, and lends strong support to management efforts to maintain river water quality to ensure the suitability of the water for various ecosystem uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus 3aanalysis of variance 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3ahuman settlements 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3aBotswana 0ahuman activities 0amicrobiological indicators 0aOkavango Delta 0aphysico-chemical indicators 0apollution1 aBonyongo, MC1 aGondwe, M0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 39, no. 4 p.351-360dTaylor & Francisx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.9607913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001800234520148100252592002801733650001001761650002201771650001101793650001601804650002501820650001301845650002301858650002401881650001101905650002701916650001701943650001601960650001001976650001101986650001901997700002202016773010502038856008102143852000902224655001202233IND60082051720221118160559.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-014-1643-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGantait, Saikat10aIn vitro direct rhizogenesis from Gerbera jamesonii Bolus leaf  ap. 3081-3087.  aThe present report describes an original protocol for in vitro direct induction of roots from leaf explants of gerbera for the first time. Since gerbera has immense potential as a premium cut-flower, the major attempts were made on in vitro mass propagation chiefly through in vitro multiple shoot proliferation or callus regeneration. Nevertheless, rhizogenesis could be impending an unattempted method with its yet-to-be known advantages. In our study, the optimum conditions for direct root induction from leaf explants were assessed employing tissue culture technique. Leaves were inoculated to MS medium containing no or variable auxin sources and concentrations namely, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid or α-naphthaleneacetic acid for root induction. It was evident that the maximum root induction (with a frequency of 92.6 %) occurred on MS media fortified with 1.5 mg l⁻¹ IAA, wherein root induction was observed as early as 11 days of culture and an average of ~19 roots with ~13 mm length was obtained from 4 cm² leaf segment after 45 days of culture. Stereo microscopic observation revealed the induction of roots and gradual developmental stages of rhizogenesis. The efficiency of direct root induction without any interim growth stages (such as, callus or shoots) in our study offers a reproducible system that could provide a model protocol for more comprehensive developmental studies on root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aGerbera jamesonii 3acallus 3acut flowers 3adevelopmental stages 3aexplants 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3arhizogenesis 3aroot growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3atissue culture1 aSinniah, Uma Rani0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.3081-3087dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1643-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100001600159245012500175300001600300520150000316592002801816650001801844650001601862650001101878650001201889650001901901650003101920650001201951650001001963650001101973650003001984650002402014650002502038650001402063650002202077650003402099650001102133650001102144650001302155653002302168653002202191653002302213653001302236653002502249653003402274653003702308653002502345700002102370700001602391700001802407700002402425700002302449700002802472773012902500856007502629852000902704655001202713IND60597680020221119194710.0180625e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059768002DNAL7 a10.7589/2016-12-2742doi4 ajwdi-54-01-24  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKent, Alice10aGenital tract screening finds widespread infection with mustelid gammaherpesvirus 1 in the european badger (meles meles)  ap. 133-137.  a: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be important drivers of population dynamics because of their negative effects on reproduction. However, screening for STDs, especially in wildlife populations, is widely neglected. Using the promiscuous, polygynandrous European badger (Meles meles) as a model, we investigated the presence and prevalence of herpesviruses (HVs) in a wild, high-density population and assessed potential differences in somatic fitness and female reproductive condition between infected and uninfected individuals. We collected n=98 genital swabs from 71 females (51 adults and 20 cubs) and 27 males (26 adults and 1 cub) during spring and summer 2015. Using a PCR specific for a mustelid α-HV, all genital-swab samples tested negative. In a panherpes PCR, a γ-HV was found in 55% (54/98; 39 adults and 15 cubs), identified as mustelid gammaherpesvirus 1 (MusGHV-1) using DNA sequencing. This contrasts with the results of a previous study, which reported MusGHV-1 in 98% (354/361) of blood samples taken from 218 badgers in the same population using PCR. The detection of MusHV-1 in the female reproductive tract strongly indicates the potential for a horizontal and, likely also a vertical, route of transmission. Our results suggest a potential linkage of genital HVs and impaired future reproductive success in females, but because reproductive failure can have many reasons in badgers, the causative link of this negative relationship remains to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpesviridae 3aMeles meles 3aadults 3abadgers 3ablood sampling 3afemale reproductive system 3afemales 3amales 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3areproductive success 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asexually transmitted diseases 3aspring 3asummer 3awildlife 0aAlphaherpesvirinae 0aBetaherpesvirinae 0aGammaherpesvirinae 0aMusAHV-1 0amustelid herpesvirus 0asexually transmitted diseases 0ahorizontal/vertical transmission 0areproductive success1 aEhlers, Bernhard1 aMendum, Tom1 aNewman, Chris1 aMacdonald, David W.1 aChambers, Mark A.,1 aBuesching, Christina D.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2018 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.133-137dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2016-12-2743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001600271520128500287592002801572650001401600650003501614650001101649650001401660650001501674650001501689650001501704651001701719653002501736653002501761653002501786653000801811653002301819700001701842700001801859773011201877856008401989852000902073655001202082IND60122529620221118052243.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012252962DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2014.9733572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasefield, VA10aDoes estuarine health relate to catchment land-cover in the East Kleinemonde system, South Africa?  ap. 395-402.  aTemporarily open/closed estuaries in South Africa are being subjected to varying degrees of catchment land-cover transformation. Natural landscapes and hydrological functions are integral to the functioning of estuaries. The relationship between catchment land-cover and the health of the East Kleinemonde Estuary was investigated between 2011 and 2013, using geographic information system (GIS) techniques to delineate and quantify land-cover in the whole catchment, in the lower section of the catchment, and in the 1 km and 100 m buffer zones surrounding the estuary. Human activities, as outlined by the Department of Water Affairs resource directed measures (RDM) studies, and their associated land-cover classes are described. Possible links between catchment and buffer zone land-cover class composition and the health of the East Kleinemonde Estuary were explored. There was a relationship between catchment land-cover and estuarine health within all assessed catchment delineations. Natural land-cover was determined to be the best predictor of estuarine health for the East Kleinemonde system. The methods employed in this study can be applied to other temporarily open/closed estuaries in South Africa to prioritise these systems for rehabilitation and/or conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3awatersheds 3aSouth Africa 0abuffer zone analysis 0aestuarine management 0aestuary conservation 0aGIS 0anatural land-cover1 aMcGregor, GK1 aWhitfield, AK0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 39, no. 4 p.395-402dTaylor & Francisx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.9733573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008600164300001800250500001900268520111800287592002801405650002501433650002101458650001301479650002501492650001301517650001301530650001401543650001501557650002201572650001601594650001701610650003301627650002201660650001501682700002801697700005301725773014801778856008201926961001302008852000902021655001202030IND60712266420221118060734.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02904-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yifei10aMetabolomic profiling and comparison of major cinnamon species using UHPLC–HRMS  ap. 7669-7681.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe metabolomic profiles of four major species of cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum, C. burmannii, C. loureiroi, and C. cassia) were investigated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC–HRMS). Thirty-six metabolites were tentatively characterized, belonging to various compound groups such as phenolic glycosides, flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, terpenes, alkaloids, and aldehydes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on the HRMS data matrix resulted in a clear separation of the four cinnamon species. Coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, methoxycinnamaldehyde, cinnamoyl-methoxyphenyl acetate, proanthocyanidins, and other components varied among the four species. Such variations were used to develop a step-by-step strategy for differentiating the four cinnamon species based on their levels of pre-selected components. This study suggests a significant variation in the phytochemical compositions of different cinnamon species, which have a direct influence on cinnamon’s health benefit potentials.

Nowadays, many patients wanting to treat themselves by herbal medicine are increasing. Therefore, surveying of medicinal plants for treating diabetes and disseminating the knowledge, might give people more choice to consume herbs. The purposes of this qualitative study were to compile the medicinal plants and their folk use to treat diabetes by local healers in Chana and Nathawee district, Songkhla province.Semi-structured interviews were used to gather about the local names, parts of plants used, preparation and use method, and local properties. Descriptive statistics, use value and interpretation were used to analyze the data.A total of 38 species belonging to 37 genera in 28 families were used as herbs for treating diabetes. The family mostly used as herbal medicine was Rubiaceae (4 species; 10.53%). The part of herbal medicine mostly used was the root (8 speciess; 21.05%). Decoction and drinking were the most favorite preparation form and use method. Interestingly, the most used herbal plant is Lagerstraemia speciose Pers (0.83 of Use Value).It was found that the local healers possess the different knowledge based on their experience received secretly from the family and adapted by themselves. Thus, this study is important due to assistance for collecting the variety of knowledge before disappearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubiaceae 3achronic diseases 3acommon names 3adescriptive statistics 3adiabetes mellitus 3adrinking 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ainterviews 3amedicinal plants 3apatients 3asurveys 3atraditional medicine 3aThailand 0aMedicinal plant 0aDiabetes 0aSongkhla1 aMadeebing, Nareerat1 aMah, Latepah1 aLateh, Wasana0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Nov. 04, v. 174 p.82-90dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005300140245016100193300001400354500002000368520167400388592002802062596004002090596001202130596003902142596003602181650001002217650001702227650001202244650001902256650001002275650001402285650002302299650002602322650001102348650001102359650001902370650001402389650001302403650001702416650001102433650001002444650001702454651001002471700001902481700001502500700001702515700005202532700001902584700002302603773015502626856007402781852000902855655001202864IND60626739220221120094551.0181226e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062673922DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.123682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuesa, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2962-214810aDelaying berry ripening of Bobal and Tempranillo grapevines by late leaf removal in a semi‐arid and temperate‐warm climate under different water regimes  ap. 70-82.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Climate change is advancing grape ripening and decoupling sugar and phenolic maturity, impacting wine typicity. The aim of this study was to test whether late leaf removal (LLR) under different watering regimes delayed harvest of two Spanish red cultivars in a semi‐arid and temperate‐warm climate. METHODS AND RESULTS: In two trials carried out in eastern Spain with the Bobal and Tempranillo cultivars, vines were partially defoliated above the bunch zone shortly before veraison under rainfed and deficit irrigation conditions during two seasons. The rate of grape ripening in both cultivars was significantly affected by LLR under either watering regime, consequently delaying harvest. Vine water status and leaf photosynthetic rate were improved by LLR. The reduction in leaf area‐to‐fruit ratio resulting from the LLR treatments was found to be more limiting for the accumulation of anthocyanin than for TSS. Consequently, LLR negatively affected wine colour intensity. In addition, yield was constrained by LLR in Tempranillo due to a reduction in bunch and berry mass. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the rate of accumulation of grape TSS provoked by LLR did not necessarily result in a more balanced berry maturity. The effectiveness of the LLR technique appears to depend on its final impact on leaf area‐to‐fruit ratio and vine water status, the cultivar photosynthetic compensation capacity and the environmental conditions. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Late leaf removal might not be effective for coupling anthocyanin and TSS in berries under moderate water stress conditions, given the observed reductions in red wine colour.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2014‐54201‐C4‐4‐RcFEDER  cCajamar  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  cLucio Gil de Fagoaga Foundation 3aVitis 3aanthocyanins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acolor 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3aenvironmental factors 3agrapes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3ared wines 3aripening 3asmall fruits 3asugars 3avines 3awater stress 3aSpain1 aCaccavello, G.1 aBasile, B.1 aMerli, M.

Br.)  ap. 63-74.  aThe mechanisms that allow broadly distributed aquatic plants to inhabit variable resource environments are unclear, yet understanding these mechanisms is important because broad environmental tolerance is often linked to invasiveness in terrestrial and aquatic plants. In an experimental stream, we examined the effects of different nutrient concentrations on the growth rate, biomass, and foliar nutrient concentrations of a cosmopolitan and potentially invasive aquatic plant, Nasturtium officinale (R. Br.). Nasturtium seedlings were grown under six nutrient treatment levels ranging from 0.64 μm N:0.09 μm P to 1531 μm N:204.13 μm P, for 8 weeks. Absolute and relative growth rates, and biomass of seedlings increased along a gradient of increasing nutrient concentrations but the effect of nutrient concentration was dependent on growing time. Seedling biomass varied among nutrient treatments in weeks 4 through 8 of the experiment, but did not differ in week 2. By week 8, the two highest nutrient treatments had greater biomass than the two lowest nutrient treatments. Foliar nitrogen concentration increased, whereas carbon concentration and C:N ratios decreased in response to increasing nutrients. Nasturtium grows slowly in nutrient-poor conditions but rapidly increases its growth, biomass accrual, and nitrogen storage as conditions become nutrient-rich. The response of Nasturtium to enhanced nutrient conditions may indicate how aquatic nuisance species successfully invade and dominate plant communities in streams, where resources often vary both temporally and spatially.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNasturtium officinale 3aaquatic plants 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aenvironmental factors 3ainvasive species 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aplant communities 3aseedlings 3astorage conditions 3astreams 3awatercress1 aEven, Thomas1 aSimpson, Juliet0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Mar., v. 705, no. 1 p.63-74dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1380-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011200169300001800281500001900299520151300318592002801831650000801859650002501867650001701892650001301909650001901922650001501941650001601956650002001972650001101992650002602003650002302029650004002052700002602092700002102118700005902139773014802198856008202346852000902428655001202437IND60712266520221118060837.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02901-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezaei, Zahra S.10aDevelopment of a phage display-mediated immunoassay for the detection of vascular endothelial growth factor  ap. 7639-7648.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBecause of the critical role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in angiogenesis and its significantly increased serum levels in early stages of cancer, VEGF is considered an important prognostic biomarker in different cancers. Herein, the amplification power of PCR combined with phage displaying anti-VEGF VHH, a sensitive real-time immunoassay, was precisely designed based on phage display-mediated immuno-PCR (PD-IPCR) for the detection of VEGF. This system benefits from strong and specific binding of antigen and antibody in a sandwich immunosorbent assay platform using avastin (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) as the capture antibody. The anti-VEGF phage particles were used as both anti-VEGF agent and DNA template in the PD-IPCR. Anti-VEGF phage ELISA showed a linear range of 3–250 ng/ml and a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.1 ng/ml. Using the PD-IPCR method, the linear range of VEGF detection was found to be 0.06–700 ng/ml, with a detection limit of 3 pg/ml. The recovery rate in serum ranged from 83% to 99%, with a relative standard deviation of 1.2–4.9%. These values indicate that the method has good sensitivity for use in clinical analysis. The proposed method was successfully applied to the clinical determination of VEGF in human serum samples, and the results showed excellent correlation with conventional ELISA (R² = 0.995).

Therefore, understanding the genetic architecture of grain quality has become a key objective of rice breeding programs. Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) using large diversity panels have successfully identified genomic regions associated with complex traits in diverse crop species. Our main objective was to identify genomic regions associated with grain quality and to identify and characterize favorable haplotypes for selection. We used two locally adapted rice breeding populations and historical phenotypic data for three rice quality traits: yield after milling, percentage of head rice recovery, and percentage of chalky grain. We detected 22 putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the same genomic regions as starch synthesis, starch metabolism, and cell wall synthesis‐related genes are found. Additionally, we found a genomic region on chromosome 6 in the tropical japonica population that was associated with all quality traits and we identified favorable haplotypes. Furthermore, this region is linked to the OsBEI gene that codes for a starch branching enzyme I, which is implicated in starch granule formation. In tropical japonica, we also found two putative QTL linked to OsBEII, OsDEP1, and OsDEP2. Our study provides an insight into the genetic basis of rice grain chalkiness, yield after milling, and head rice, identifying favorable haplotypes and molecular markers for selection in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aL2 AZ_12cINIA  aANII‐POS_NAC_2012_1_8560cAgencia Nacional de Investigación Agropecuaria 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aOryza sativa 3abreeding programs 3acell walls 3achromosomes 3aconsumer demand 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agrain quality 3ahaplotypes 3ametabolism 3amilling 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3astaple crops 3astarch granules1 aGutiérrez, Lucía1 aMonteverde, Eliana1 aBlanco, Pedro1 aPérez de Vida, Fernando1 aRosas, Juan1 aFernández, Schubert1 aGaraycochea, Silvia1 aMcCouch, Susan1 aBerberian, Natalia1 aSimondi, Sebastián1 aBonnecarrère, Victoria0 tThe plant genome.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 3 p.e170076-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2017.08.00763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015700165300001600322500001900338520134400357592002801701650000801729650001901737650001501756650000901771650001601780651001001796653002901806653002501835653003701860653002201897700001901919773012201938856008202060852000902142655001202151IND60705652520221119061444.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070565252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xiaorui10aInvestigation of exhaled pollutant distribution in the breathing microenvironment in a displacement ventilated room with indoor air stability conditions  ap. 336-345.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study experimentally studied the dispersion of exhaled pollutant in the breathing microenvironment (BM) in a room equipped with a displacement ventilation (DV) system and indoor air stability conditions (i.e., stable and unstable conditions). The vertical temperature differences and the carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration in the BM were measured. Results show that when DV is combined with the stable condition (DS), pollutant tends to accumulate in the BM, leading to a high pollutant concentration in this region. Whereas, when DV is combined with the unstable condition (DU), pollutant diffuses to a relatively wider area beyond the BM, thus the pollutant concentration in the BM is substantially reduced. Moreover, increasing the flow rate can reduce the pollutant concentration in the BM of the DS but yields little difference of the DU. In addition, personal exposure intensity increases with time, and the DS has a relatively higher increase rate than DU. The results suggest that indoor air stability will affect the performance of DV systems. DS will lead to a higher health risk for people when they stay in the indoor environment with pollutant sources, and DU is recommended for minimizing pollutant level in the BM in order to reduce the pollutant concentration and providing better air environments for the occupants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3apollutants 3arisk 3atemperature 3aChina 0aDisplacement ventilation 0aIndoor air stability 0aHuman breathing microenvironment 0aPersonal exposure1 aGong, Guangcai0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Jan., v. 99 p.336-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008800163300002000251520120900271592002801480650001701508650001401525650002301539650002101562650001301583650001901596650000901615650002001624650001101644650001501655650001701670700002101687700001701708700001801725773014301743856007401886852000901960655001201969IND60671074220221120110307.0191002e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067107422DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta00970g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazmjooei, Fatemeh12aA new class of electroactive Fe- and P-functionalized graphene for oxygen reduction  ap. 11031-11039.  aWhile metal and electronegative N-containing carbon has aroused great interest as an efficient catalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), no combination of metal with other heteroatom-containing carbon has received considerable attention. This has motivated us to explore the performance of carbon functionalized with metal and electropositive phosphorous. Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of a new class of electroactive Fe- and P-functionalized graphene (GPFe) and its electrocatalytic properties in alkaline and acidic media. The introduction of Fe causes remarkable synergistic effects on P-doped reduced graphene oxide by increasing surface area, enhancing the P doping level due to the interaction between Fe and P and generating electrochemically active Fe–P species. N-oxides are known to be in-active for ORR in Fe–N systems, whereas in present Fe–P systems, oxides of Fe and P are found to be beneficial for ORR. Interestingly, after the introduction of Fe, mostly inactive P-doped carbon becomes active in acidic medium. We propose that this study will surely provide renewed insights into active sites for ORR in metal and heteroatom-doped carbon systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airon 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3asurface area1 aSingh, Kiran Pal1 aBae, Eun Jin1 aYu, Jong-Sung0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 12, v. 3, no. 20 p.11031-11039dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta00970g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012100162300002000283520081600303592002801119650002101147650001901168650001101187650001901198650002201217650001501239650001101254650001601265650002401281650001301305650001601318700002101334700002401355700002201379773013701401856007501538852000901613655001201622IND60537572020221118072031.0160809e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053757202DNAL7 a10.1021/ie40170722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeis, Niels

K₂CO₃ loaded on three different supports, carbon nanofibers (CNF), alumina (γ-Al₂O₃), and activated carbon (AC), was investigated. K₂CO₃–CNF revealed excellent properties as CO₂ sorbent, displaying capacities of 1.2–1.6 mmol g–¹ and fast desorption kinetics at low temperatures (423 K). This temperature was too low to completely regenerate K₂CO₃–Al₂O₃ and K₂CO₃–AC, and consequently, these sorbents lost 8% and 50%, respectively, of their capacity after the first absorption–desorption cycle. K₂CO₃–CNF could be regenerated to restore 80% of its capacity with a low energy input, estimated at 2–3 GJ/ton CO₂, which is competitive to currently used amines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaluminum oxide 3aamines 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanofibers 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aengineering 3apotassium carbonate 3asorbents 3atemperature1 aFrey, Anne Mette1 aBitter, Johannes H.1 ade Jong, Krijn P.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 52, no. 36 p.12812-12818dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie40170723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245014600194300001600340500002000356520169200376592002802068596003602096596002902132650001002161650001902171650001402190650002002204650001902224650001702243650001402260650001302274650001602287650001402303650001602317650001702333650001002350651001402360700001902374700001602393700001902409700001502428773015702443856007402600852000902674655001202683IND60626739620221120103733.0181226e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062673962DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.123732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8980-639810aAdvancement of winegrape maturity continuing for winegrowing regions in Australia with variable evidence of compression of the harvest period  ap. 101-108.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Grapevine phenology is closely linked with growing season temperature. Rising temperature related to anthropogenic climate change has the potential to advance winegrape ripening. This study updated and validated previous research that considered changes to the timing of winegrape maturity and to the warming temperature of the growing season as well as added several new vineyard data sets. Length of the harvest period was assessed to determine if time between harvests of different cultivars has shortened. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vineyard records from 31 vineyard blocks in 13 Australian wine regions, in conjunction with gridded temperature data, were used to assess changes to maturity timing and mean growing season temperature. Trends towards earlier maturity were evident as were increases to mean growing season temperature for all vineyard blocks and regions considered. Trends varied in magnitude as well as by cultivar and region. Compression of the harvest period occurred for half of the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: Winegrape maturity in Australia has continued to advance in line with warming temperature, which has implications for grape composition and wine quality. Compression of the harvest period was found in some cases, though varied by region and cultivars grown. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This study validated the trend towards earlier winegrape maturity with continued warming temperature and extended a valuable phenological data set. In light of record warming, earlier maturity is becoming the new norm. The method used to investigate compression of the harvest period in this study is applicable to other winegrowing regions worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a681554cUniversity of Melbourne  aTP820332cWine Australia 3aVitis 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adata collection 3agrowing season 3aharvest date 3aphenology 3aripening 3atemperature 3avineyards 3awine grapes 3awine quality 3awines 3aAustralia1 aDarbyshire, R.1 aGoodwin, I.1 aBarlow, E.W.R.1 aEckard, R.0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2019 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.101-108dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl4138516x1322-71307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.123733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001600284520108600300592002801386650001801414650002601432650002101458650001901479650002601498650002201524650001101546650001201557650001301569650002201582650001901604653000801623653000701631653000701638653000901645653000901654653001101663653000801674653001001682653001001692653000701702653000801709653001001717653000801727653000801735653000801743653000901751653000901760653000701769653000801776653001001784653001101794653001701805653001801822653000801840653001101848653002301859700002601882700002101908700002101929700002001950700002101970700001701991700005902008700001802067773011202085856008202197852000902279655001202288IND60527299520221119022009.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogt, Leonie M.14aThe impact of lemon pectin characteristics on TLR activation and T84 intestinal epithelial cell barrier function  ap. 398-407.  aSufficient dietary fibre intake reduces the risk of several diseases, but the mechanisms linking fibre structure and health effects remain unclear. To analyse the influence of the amount of methyl groups esterified to the backbone, lemon pectins of different degrees of methyl esterification (30, 56, and 74DM) were studied for immune receptor activating potential and epithelial barrier protection. In reporter assays, the pectins demonstrated TLR/MyD88 dependent activation of NF-κB/AP-1, which increased with increasing pectin DM. To analyse the importance of backbone structure, the pectins were enzymatically digested into oligomers, which abrogated TLR activating potential. The 30 and 74DM pectins induced strong protection of the epithelial barrier measured by T84 transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These results indicate that activation of immune cells by lemon pectins is TLR dependent, and the intact polymer backbone is indispensable for activation. In addition, DM is a determining factor in activating potential and epithelial barrier protective effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary fiber 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelial cells 3aesterification 3aimmunologic receptors 3aintestinal mucosa 3alemons 3apectins 3apolymers 3aprotective effect 3arisk reduction 0aDDM 0aDM 0aDP 0aECIS 0aGalA 0aGM-CSF 0aHEK 0aHPAEC 0aHPSEC 0aMw 0aAP1 0aNSAID 0aOVA 0aPMA 0aPRR 0aSEAP 0aTEER 0aTJ 0aTLR 0auGalA 0aPectin 0aChain length 0aMethyl groups 0aTLR 0aNF-κB 0aEpithelial barrier1 aSahasrabudhe, Neha M.1 aRamasamy, Uttara1 aMeyer, Diederick1 aPullens, Gerdie1 aFaas, Marijke M.1 aVenema, Koen1 aSchols, Henk A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5712-15541 aDe Vos, Paul,0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.398-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245017700201300001600378506007600394520050500470592002800975506003701003650002101040650001201061650002701073650001001100650004201110650002201152653001301174653001001187700002101197700001701218700002601235700002501261700002101286700002401307700002001331700002401351700002401375700002501399700001901424700002101443700001801464773013001482856007401612852000901686655001201695IND60624531620221207051559.0181204e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062453162DNAL7 a10.1093/bib/bbv0752doi7 aPMC49458292pmcid7 a263581322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Steven N.10aCollaborative science in the next-generation sequencing era: a viewpoint on how to combine exome sequencing data across sites to identify novel disease susceptibility genes  ap. 672-677.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this article is to inform readers about technical challenges that we encountered when assembling exome sequencing data from the ‘Simplifying Complex Exomes' (SIMPLEXO) consortium—whose mandate is the discovery of novel genes predisposing to breast and ovarian cancers.

We have previously shown that binge drinking alters mitochondrial dynamics and induces neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of adolescent rats. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is regularly linked to alcohol consumption and share mechanisms of brain damage. In this context, we hypothesized that adolescent binge drinking could prime the development of brain damage generated by mTBI. We found that alcohol binge drinking induced by the “drinking in the dark” (DID) paradigm increases oxidative damage and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus of adolescent mice. Interestingly, adolescent animals submitted to DID showed decreased levels of mitofusin 2 that controls mitochondrial dynamics. When mTBI was evaluated as a second challenge, hippocampi from animals previously submitted to DID showed a reduction in dendritic spine number and a different spine profile. Mitochondrial performance could be compromised by alterations in mitochondrial fission in DID-mTBI animals. These data suggest that adolescent alcohol consumption can modify the progression of mTBI pathophysiology. We propose that mitochondrial impairment and oxidative damage could act as priming factors, modifying predisposition against mTBI effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3aastrocytes 3abrain damage 3adendrites 3ahippocampus 3amitochondria 3apathophysiology 3aresearch 0aAlcohol 0aTraumatic brain injury 0aOxidative stress 0aDendritic spine 0a4-HNE 0a8OHdG 0aCypD 0aDID 0afEPSP 0aFis1 0aGFAP 0aMfn2 0amTBI 0aNrf2 0apDrp1 0aVDAC1 aLira, Matías,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3698-45531 aQuintanilla, Rodrigo A.1 aCerpa, Waldo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7344-01440 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 July 30, v. 528, no. 3 p.514-519dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013400165300001600299520109500315592002801410650001801438650002501456650001601481650001801497650002301515650001201538650001801550650001401568650001501582650000901597650003401606650002001640650000901660650001101669653001001680653001201690653000901702653000901711653000801720653001001728653000801738653001101746653000801757653000801765653000801773653000701781653001401788653000901802653000801811653000801819653000901827653001401836653002101850653001901871653003401890653003001924653002501954653003501979700001802014700001902032700001702051700001802068700002102086773011202107856008202219852000902301655001202310IND60527299620221119021939.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasunaga, Sho10aEffect of concurrent administration of nobiletin and β-lactoglobulin on the symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis models in mice  ap. 389-397.  aNobiletin and β-lactoglobulin were previously demonstrated to suppress mast cell de-granulation in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the multiple anti-allergic effects of both substances by simultaneous treatment were examined in order to determine if they could further mitigate allergic symptoms. Concurrent treatment with nobiletin and β-lactoglobulin effectively suppressed de-granulation of RBL-2H3 cells by inhibiting increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and Syk in RBL-2H3 cells was all inhibited by the concurrent presence of nobiletin and β-lactoglobulin. Moreover, concurrent administration of nobiletin and β-lactoglobulin reduced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in mice compared with nobiletin or β-lactoglobulin administered alone. In addition, the concurrent administration of freeze-dried Citrus unshiu peel powder and yogurt whey containing these bioactive substances also reduced PCA reaction and allergic symptoms of a murine model of Japanese cedar pollinosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus unshiu 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aanaphylaxis 3aanimal models 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acalcium 3afreeze drying 3ahay fever 3amast cells 3amice 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3awhey 3ayogurt 0aβ-LG 0a[Ca2+]i 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aDNP 0aELISA 0aFBS 0aFcεRI 0aHRP 0aHSA 0aIgE 0aIL 0aMT buffer 0aNaPB 0aPBS 0aPCA 0aPI3K 0aNobiletin 0aβ-lactoglobulin 0aDe-granulation 0aPassive cutaneous anaphylaxis 0aJapanese cedar pollinosis 0aConcurrent treatment 0aNobiletin (PubChem CID: 72344)1 aKadota, Ayumu1 aKikuchi, Taizo1 aKubo, Chiaki1 aNishi, Kosuke1 aSugahara, Takuya0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.389-397dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014000165300001600305520124600321592002801567650002501595650001101620650001701631650002601648650002301674650002901697650001401726650001101740650002301751650001201774650001101786651001701797653003101814653001801845653002301863653001801886700001501904700001501919773011201934856008402046852000902130655001202139IND60122530220221119163838.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253022DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2014.9782562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourie, HE10aDo SASS5 scores vary with season in the South African highveld? A case study on the Skeerpoort River, North West province, South Africa  ap. 369-376.  aMacroinvertebrate assemblages can vary with season as a result of changing environmental conditions and phenology of individual species. The objective of this study was to determine whether results from the South African Scoring System version 5 (SASS5) are affected by season. The standard SASS5 protocol was used to sample three sites on the Skeerpoort River, South Africa, in autumn, winter and spring 2013, and summer 2014. At each site, stream morphology was characterised and physico-chemical variables were measured. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare SASS indices in relation to site and season, and a one-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of season using both current and historical data. Macroinvertebrate assemblage similarity of sites was determined using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, followed by analysis of similarity. Whilst macroinvertebrate assemblages differed between seasons and sites, there was no seasonal variation in the values of SASS indices, but they did differ between sites. SASS5 appears to be robust to seasonal variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage and seems suitable for use throughout the year in a perennial river draining the South African highveld region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aautumn 3acase studies 3aenvironmental factors 3amacroinvertebrates 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphenology 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3astreams 3awinter 3aSouth Africa 0aaquatic macroinvertebrates 0abioassessment 0aseasonal variation 0awater quality1 aThirion, C1 aWeldon, CW0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 39, no. 4 p.369-376dTaylor & Francisx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.9782563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002000140245009000160300001400250500000900264520144000273592002801713650002001741650001701761650002501778650001101803650001501814650002801829650002001857650001801877650001801895650001701913650002101930650002401951700001601975700001701991700001702008773019902025852000902224856007702233990002302310655001202333IND2048437120221120140059.0191122e199101  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204843712DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1991.00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiRienzo, D. B.10aEffect of Spring Nitrogen Application on Barley Forage Yields and Silage Fermentation  ap. 39-44.  aepub  aField experiments were conducted between 1983 and 1985 to determine the effects of rate and time of spring N application on yields and composition of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage and fermentation characteristics for silage. Treatments consisted of 12 combinations of rate and timing of spring N. Rates were 0, 40, 80, and 120 lb N/acre. Nitrogen was applied at Zadoks growth stage (GS) 25, 30, and 45 (tillering, pre-jointing, and heading, respectively) in either single or split applications. Rate and timing of N application increased forage dry matter (DM) yields and crude protein (CP) but had no significant affect on NO₃, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), or acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentrations. Application at a rate of 120 lb N/acre increased yields of DM and CP both years. The greatest influence of N fertilization on CP was associated with application at GS 30. Split N applications generally increased DM yields and quality. Ensiling at the soft dough stage (30–35% DM) resulted in a final mean silage pH of 5.54 with no apparent treatment effects due to N application. When ensiled at the hard dough stage (45–48% DM), poor compaction resulted in frequent surface mold. Acid production and pH were influenced by the DM content of forages ensiled which was related to N application.

Recent advances in genomic technology, impetus to exploit natural diversity, and development of robust statistical analysis methods make association mapping appealing and affordable to plant research programs. Association mapping identifies quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by examining the marker-trait associations that can be attributed to the strength of linkage disequilibrium between markers and functional polymorphisms across a set of diverse germplasm. General understanding of association mapping has increased significantly since its debut in plants. We have seen a more concerted effort in assembling various association-mapping populations and initiating experiments through either candidate-gene or genome-wide approaches in different plant species. In this review, we describe the current status of association mapping in plants and outline opportunities and challenges in complex trait dissection and genomics-assisted crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresearch programs 3astatistical analysis1 aGore, Michael1 aBuckler, Edward S.1 aYu, Jianming0 tThe plant genome.g2008 July, v. 1, no. 1 p.5-20dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2008.02.00893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245017100204300001600375500001900391520127800410592002801688650001001716650003101726650002201757650001301779650002201792650001301814653001501827653001101842653001501853653002901868653001001897700001801907700001901925773014601944856008302090852000902173655001202182IND60697708620221122034641.0200621e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069770862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Tingting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5759-855810aMolecular mechanism of reward treatment ameliorating chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior assessed by sequencing miRNA and mRNA in medial prefrontal cortex  ap. 520-527.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChronic stress and lack of reward may reduce the function of the brain’s reward circuits, leading to major depressive disorder. The effect of reward treatment on chronic stress-induced depression-like behaviors and its molecular mechanism in the brain remain unclear. In this study, companion communication was used as a reward to study the effect of reward on CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, and mRNA and miRNA profiles in the medial prefrontal cortex harvested from mice with depression-like and resilient behaviors were established by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that accompanying with companion ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. Furthermore, 45 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with depression-like behaviors, 8 DEGs associated with resilience and 59 DEGs associated with nature reward (companion) were identified, and 196 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be associated with companion. Based on the differentially expressed miRNAs and DEGs data, miRNA-mRNA network was established to be associated with companion. Taken together, our data here provided a method to ameliorate depression-like behaviors, and numerous potential drug targets for the prevention or treatment of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3agene expression regulation 3amental depression 3amicroRNA 3aprefrontal cortex 3aresearch 0aDepression 0aReward 0aResilience 0aMedial prefrontal cortex 0amiRNA1 aSong, Zhenhua1 aWang, Jin-Hui,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 July 30, v. 528, no. 3 p.520-527dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020100165300001600366520095600382592002801338650001801366650002601384650001701410650001401427650002101441650001301462650002201475650002001497650001001517650001401527650003101541650002301572650001501595650002601610650003901636650004301675650005201718650002401770650002501794650001201819653001701831653001801848653000801866653002001874653001401894653001401908700002001922700002501942700002301967700002401990700001802014700003102032700001602063773011202079856008202191852000902273655001202282IND60527299920221119022038.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyam, Suvitha10aβ-Mangostin suppresses LA-7 cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo: Involvement of antioxidant enzyme modulation; suppression of matrix metalloproteinase and α6β4 integrin signalling pathways  ap. 504-517.  aβ-mangostin (βM) was isolated from Cratoxylum arborescens to investigate anti-breast cancer effect in vitro and in vivo. βM exhibited an inhibitory effect on the growth of LA-7 cells in vitro with apoptosis formation. In the animal model, βM treatment was found to be effective in improving the tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase activity (P < 0.05). βM treatment clearly exhibited apoptosis in mammary tumour tissues, and it was associated with regulation of PCNA and p53. The cDNA microarray gene expression followed by qRT-PCR based validation demonstrated that βM could mediate tumour reduction and prevent metastasis by reduction of MMP-9, MMP-13, and MMP-27. Moreover, the reduction of both 14-3-3β and ITGB4 genes indicated the involvement of α6β4 integrin signalling pathway. These findings showed that β-mangostin is a promising compound candidate as an anti-tumour agent against breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acatalase 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aintegrins 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametalloproteinases 3ametastasis 3amicroarray technology 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 0aβ-Mangostin 0aBreast cancer 0aMMP 0aα6β4 integrin 0aApoptosis 0aTamoxifen1 aBustamam, Ahmad1 aHashim, Najihah Mohd1 aGhaderian, Mostafa1 aHobani, Yahya Hasan1 aMakeen, Anwar1 aAbdelwahab, Siddig Ibrahim1 aMohan, Syam0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.504-517dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012300167300001600290520131200306592002801618650001501646650001501661650000901676650001901685650002001704650001401724650001501738650001401753650001301767650001901780650001601799650001501815650001201830650003001842650002401872650001501896650002301911650001001934650001201944650002201956650001801978650001801996650001002014650002002024650001502044700002202059700003302081700002302114700001802137700002102155773010202176856008102278852000902359655001202368IND60082052720221118160119.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-014-9329-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Silma L.10aQuality control by leaf-cutting ants: evidence from communities of endophytic fungi in foraged and rejected vegetation  ap. 485-493.  aLeaf-cutting ants of the genera Acromyrmex and Atta forage vegetation for incorporation into their mutualistic fungal gardens. However, the presence of certain endophytic fungi in this predominantly leaf-based material could affect the fungal garden and thus the choice of material by the ants. The present study was conducted to document the endophytic fungal communities occurring in the vegetation being transported by workers of Atta laevigata into their nests and to compare this community structure with that of the vegetative material subsequently rejected from the nests. We found considerable diversity in the fungi isolated. Acremonium, Cylindrocladium, Drechslera, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Ulocladium and two unidentified morphospecies were significantly more common in rejected compared with foraged material, and some of these genera include mycoparasites, which could represent a threat to the fungal gardens. Conversely, Colletotrichum, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Xylaria and an unidentified morphospecies were more common in carried compared with rejected material. The possibility that ants have a ‘quality-control’ mechanism based on the presence of antagonistic fungal endophytes is discussed, as is the potential use of these fungi as biocontrol agents against Attini pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium 3aAcromyrmex 3aAtta 3aColletotrichum 3aCylindrocladium 3aDiaporthe 3aDrechslera 3aEpicoccum 3aFusarium 3aPestalotiopsis 3aTrichoderma 3aUlocladium 3aXylaria 3abiological control agents 3acommunity structure 3aendophytes 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agardens 3aleaf-cutting ants 3amorphospecies 3amycoparasites 3anests 3aquality control 3avegetation1 aJorge, Vanessa L.1 aDella Lucia, Terezinha M.

M.10aFarming Soils, Not Fields: A Strategy for Increasing Fertilizer Profitability  ap. 57-61.  aepub  aFarm fields are traditionally fertilized as one homogeneous soil unit. Most fields, however, contain two or more soils with different crop yield potentials. This study was conducted to (i) measure crop yield differences between contrasting soils within fields, and (ii) compare the economics of “farming soils, not fields,” where contrasting soils in a field receive different vs. uniform rates and formulations of fertilizer. Crop yield variability studies were conducted along 1600 ft transects across several soil units in each of four fields during 1987. Grain yield, test weight, and returns over variable costs varied greatly among soil units in each field (P < 0.05). Soil fertility studies also revealed differences in grain yield, test weight, and returns among soil units in five fields during 1987 and 1988. Fertility studies indicated yields were similar for small grains when recommended fertilizer treatments were applied as soil unit treatments rather than as a field treatment. Returns were $2.06 to $5.14 greater per acre for the soil treatment than for the field treatment in three of five fields, but overall, the returns were not significantly different. A recommended fertilizer treatment was not always the optimum treatment, however. In two fields, additional returns of $21.68 to $23.51 /acre resulted when optimum soil treatments were applied rather than the field treatment. The data reveal the importance of appropriate crop yield goals, accurate soil tests, and reliable fertilizer recommendations when developing a strategy for generating greater returns by farming soil, not fields. Given these caveats, our work suggests that farming soils, not fields will increase fertilizer profitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative farming 3afields 3asoil fertility 3acrop yield 3asoil heterogeneity 3afertilizers 3aprofitability 3aapplication rate 3aprecision agriculture 3aMontana1 aCarlson, G.

Our previous genome‐wide association study (GWAS) for stripe rust resistance in a set of PNW winter wheat accessions (Panel‐2) identified multiple marker‐trait associations (MTAs) for both all‐stage and field resistance. In this study, we conducted additional GWAS using a different set of PNW winter wheat accessions (Panel‐1) that contained recently bred soft white winter wheat breeding lines and cultivars. A total of 12 all‐stage resistance MTAs and eight field resistance MTAs were identified. Within these MTAs, nine MTAs for all‐stage resistance and two MTAs for field resistance were located distinctly from previously characterized genes and likely represent novel loci. Markers IWB60567 (1B), IWB24342 (2A), and IWB46564 (2B) explained the largest phenotypic variances for disease responses. The analysis confirmed that MTAs on chromosome 1B were indeed the same as Qyr.wpg‐1B.2 identified in Panel‐2 and that MTAs on chromosome 2A were likely Yr17 and closely linked to another field resistance QTL, Qyr.wpg‐2A.2 (Panel‐2). Haplotypes for MTAs on chromosome 1B, Yr17, and linked loci on chromosome 2A provide useful information for marker development and introgression of these QTL into wheat breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3agenome-wide association study 3ahaplotypes 3aintrogression 3aphenotype 3astripe rust 3awinter wheat 3aPacific States1 aNaruoka, Yukiko1 aMiller, Kaitlin1 aGarland‐Campbell, Kimberly A.1 aCarter, Arron H.0 tThe plant genome.g2018 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.e170087-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2017.10.00873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011400171300001800285500001900303520109400322592002801416596004101444650002501485650001601510650001201526650001601538650001201554650002401566650001301590650001701603650003501620650002501655700002201680700002001702773014801722856008301870852000901953655001201962IND60712264120221118060958.0201112e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02859-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibault-Lefebvre,10aEvaluation of the extraction and stability of chlorophyll-rich extracts by supercritical fluid chromatography  ap. 7263-7273.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, a rapid (less than 10 min) analytical method by reverse-phase supercritical fluid chromatography was developed with an isocratic mobile phase, enabling the separation of 11 compounds, chlorophyll a and b, pheophytin a and numerous allomers or epimers. This method was used to examine the stability of chlorophyll pigments of plant extracts obtained with various extraction methods including microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), with ethanol as solvent or modifier. The effect of storage was studied for both liquid and dried extracts. Irrespective of the extraction method, the evaporation of the extracts induced partial degradation of the chlorophyll pigments. It was found that liquid extracts could be stored at 4 °C for 3 weeks without a dramatic change in allomer forms of chlorophylls. However, during this storage period, epimerization appears to be important, leading to a significant decrease in the chlorophyll b native form.

Whereas the life cycle of the dicotyledonous model species Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by two epistatic genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FRIGIDA [1–3], three unrelated loci (VERNALIZATION 1–3) determine the spring and winter habits of monocotyledonous plants such as temperate cereals [4–6]. In the core eudicot species Beta vulgaris, whose lineage diverged from that leading to Arabidopsis shortly after the monocot-dicot split 140 million years ago [7, 8], the bolting locus B [9] is a master switch distinguishing annuals from biennials. Here, we isolated B and show that the pseudo-response regulator gene BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BvBTC1), through regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T genes [10], is absolutely necessary for flowering and mediates the response to both long days and vernalization. Our results suggest that domestication of beets involved the selection of a rare partial loss-of-function BvBTC1 allele that imparts reduced sensitivity to photoperiod that is restored by vernalization, thus conferring bienniality, and illustrate how evolutionary plasticity at a key regulatory point can enable new life cycle strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBeta vulgaris 3aalleles 3aannuals 3abeets 3abiennials 3abolting 3adomestication 3aepistasis 3agrains 3aloci 3aphotoperiod 3aregulator genes 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3atemperature 3avernalization 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aBase Sequence 2aBeta vulgarisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aFlowersxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenes, Regulatorxgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aImmunoblotting 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPhotoperiod 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSeasons 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aZhang, Wenying1 aVogt, Sebastian H.1 aDally, Nadine1 aBüttner, Bianca1 aSchulze-Buxloh, Gretel1 aJelly, Noémie S.1 aChia, Tansy Y.P.1 aMutasa-Göttgens, Effie S.1 aDohm, Juliane C.1 aHimmelbauer, Heinz1 aWeisshaar, Bernd1 aKraus, Josef1 aGielen, Jan J.L.1 aLommel, Murielle1 aWeyens, Guy1 aWahl, Bettina1 aSchechert, Axel1 aNilsson, Ove1 aJung, Christian1 aKraft, Thomas1 aMüller, Andreas E.,0 tCurrent biology.g2012 June 19, v. 22, no. 12 p.1095-1101dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002500159245008500184300001600269520118400285592002801469650002101497650002301518650002501541650001501566650001101581650001601592650001501608650001401623650001301637650001901650650001301669650001201682650001501694650001101709651001801720653001701738653001701755653001701772653002101789653002401810653002401834700002101858700002101879700002101900700002801921700002101949700002001970700002001990700002102010773012902031856007502160852000902235655001202244IND60597678420221122234153.0180625e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059767842DNAL7 a10.7589/2016-10-2372doi4 ajwdi-53-04-14  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallard, Jennifer R.10aDetection of Wellfleet Bay Virus Antibodies in Sea Birds of the Northeastern USA  ap. 875-879.  aWellfleet Bay virus (WFBV) is a recently described orthomyxovirus isolated from the tissues of Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) collected during recurrent mortality events on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, US. Coastal Massachusetts is the only location where disease or mortality associated with this virus has been detected in wild birds, and a previous seroprevalence study found a significantly higher frequency of viral exposure in eiders from this location than from other areas sampled in North America. This suggests that coastal Massachusetts is an epicenter of WFBV exposure, but the reason for this is unknown. Opportunistic sampling of sympatric species and testing of banked serum was used to investigate potential host range and spatiotemporal patterns of WFBV exposure. Antibodies were detected in Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus), Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis), a White-winged Scoter (Melanitta fusca), and a Black Scoter (Melanitta nigra). These findings demonstrate the likely occurrence of fall/winter transmission, expand our understanding of the host range of the virus, and provide further insight into the epidemiology of WFBV in the northeastern US.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus argentatus 3aLarus delawarensis 3aSomateria mollissima 3aantibodies 3aautumn 3ablood serum 3ahost range 3amortality 3aseabirds 3aseroprevalence 3asympatry 3aviruses 3awild birds 3awinter 3aMassachusetts 0aBlack Scoter 0aCommon Eider 0aHerring Gull 0aRing-billed Gull 0aWellfleet Bay virus 0aWhite-winged Scoter1 aMickley, Randall1 aBrown, Justin D.1 aHill, Nichola J.1 aRunstadler, Jonathan A.1 aClark, Daniel E.1 aEllis, Julie C.1 aMead, Daniel G.1 aFischer, John R.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2017 Oct., v. 53, no. 4 p.875-879dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2016-10-2373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245010300158300001600261500000900277500001500286520184400301592002802145650002402173650002102197650002502218650001302243650001202256650001602268650002002284650001102304650002002315650001402335651001102349653003002360700001702390700001602407773020102423852000902624856007702633990002302710655001202733IND2048431220221121044815.0191122e199010  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204843122DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1990.04152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoffey, K.

However, subsequent feedlot performance by these cattle has been variable. This study was conducted to compared grazing and subsequent feedlot performance of steers that grazed N-fertilized, A. coenophialum-infected ‘Kentucky 31’ tall fescue (IF); IF interseeded with ladino clover (Trifolium repens L.; IFL); or endophyte-free ‘Missouri 96’ tall fescue (MO). Grazing experiments were conducted from 1986 to 1988 and followed by a dry lot phase with the cattle offered high-concentrate rations for 124 to 134 d. Significant (P < 0.05) year effects and interactions were detected for weight and gain parameters and carcass quality grade. A pasture type × phase (grazing vs. feedlot) interaction also was observed for daily gain in 1986 (P = 0.07), 1987 (P < 0.05), and 1988 (P < 0.05). Cattle grazing IF had lower pasture daily gain than those grazing IFL in 1987 (P < 0.01) and MO in 1988 (P < 0.05), but higher feedlot daily gain from than from MO in 1986 (P < 0.10) and IFL in 1987 (P < 0.05). Feed-to-gain ratios from cattle previously grazing IF were lower (P < 0.05) than those from cattle previously grazing IFL and MO. Cattle that previously grazed IFL had greater (P < 0.01) fat thickness and USDA yield grades. Those cattle also had higher (P < 0.05) USDA quality grades than cattle that previously grazed IF and MO in 1986 and IF in 1988. Therefore, while steer performance was reduced while grazing A. coenophialum-infected fescue compared with those grazing low-endophyte fescue or infected fescue interseeded with ladino clover, those steers apparently recovered from the endophyte effects such that feedlot gain and feed efficiency were enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aTrifolium repens 3aEpichloe coenophiala 3afeedlots 3agrazing 3abody weight 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3acarcass quality 3apoisoning 3aKansas 0aNeotyphodium coenophialum1 aLomas, L.

To identify novel foods and food ingredients with potential anti-ageing functions, a novel system for screening substances that activate the SIRT1 promoter in human colorectal cancer cells was established. We screened several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and identified Lactobacillus brevis T2102 as a SIRT1-activating strain of LAB. T2102 inactivated β-catenin through SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and consequently suppressed the growth of the human colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1. Furthermore, T2102-induced degradation of β-catenin repressed transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, one of the target genes of β-catenin, which led to the induction of cellular senescence and concomitant growth suppression of DLD-1. These results indicate that SIRT1-activating T2102 might be a promising candidate for developing novel functional foods with anti-cancer properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell senescence 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afunctional foods 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman cell lines 3aingredients 3alactic acid bacteria 3aneoplasm cells 3anovel foods 3ascreening 3atelomerase 3atissues 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aSIRT1 0aColorectal cancer 0aβ-catenin 0ahTERT 0aAPC 0aCR 0ahTERT 0aLAB1 aPattarawat, Pawat1 aItō, Kenji,1 aMatsumoto, Takashi1 aHasegawa, Takanori1 aKatakura, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9678-96020 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 May, v. 23 p.444-452dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012400164300001400288500001900302520176200321592002802083650001702111650001902128650002002147650001602167650000902183650001302192650001302205650001402218650001702232650001602249650002002265650001802285650001302303650000902316653001802325653001402343653002302357653000902380653001102389700001902400700001702419773014402436856008302580852000902663655001202672IND60697705920221120220318.0200621e20200813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069770592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jungao10aOsteoclastic miR-301-b knockout reduces ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss by regulating CYDR/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 35-42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPostmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a frequent bone disorder responsible for an increased risk of disability to millions of individuals in the world. For identifying novel and effective targets to treat this disease, it is essential to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely investigated due to their involvement in the pathophysiology of bone loss. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the role of miR-301-b in murine osteoclastogenesis. We found that miR-301-b expression was increased in the bone tissues from PMOP patients, along with up-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATC1), which were confirmed in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced mouse bone specimens and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Osteoclastogenesis was found to be obviously suppressed by miR-301-b inhibitor, whereas being further promoted in BMMs transfected with miR-301-b mimic. The animal studies showed that osteoclastic miR-301-b knockout markedly up-regulated the bone mass by reducing osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that cylindromatosis (CYLD) was a direct target of miR-301-b at the post-transcriptional level during osteoclastogenesis. The enhanced expression of CYLD led to a reduction of phosphorylated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), along with remarkably decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Finally, osteoclastic miR-301-b ablation evidently inhibited OVX-induced osteoclastogenesis, exhibiting protective effects against bone loss in rodent animals. Therefore, results in the study reported an important mechanism for osteoclastogenesis progression regulated by miR-301-b/CYLD/NF-κB pathway, which may be an effective therapeutic target for PMOP treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicroRNA 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3apathophysiology 3apostmenopause 3aresearch 3arisk 0aBone disorder 0amiR-301-b 0aOsteoclastogenesis 0aCYLD 0aNF-κB1 aWang, Haisheng1 aLiu, Huashun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 13, v. 529, no. 1 p.35-42dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00831naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245002800156300001200184520004400196592002800240650001300268650001300281650001900294650001900313773014800332856007600480852000900556655001200565IND60765346120221118231223.0220419e20111121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076534612DNAL7 a10.17221/6082-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoudek, I.10aCommon Bentgrass Polana  ap. 126.  aThis article does not have an abstract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis 3ajournals 3aplant breeding 3aplant genetics0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 41, no. 3 p.126-126dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6082-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011800187300001800305520144800323592002801771650001501799650002201814650002001836650001101856650001901867650001901886650001901905650002601924650003401950650001201984650002401996650005202020650002702072650002802099650002302127650003902150650004002189650002902229650003802258700002202296773009402318856008102412990002302493852000902516655001202525IND60093933320221117173314.0141104e20120619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009393332DNAL7 a226338072pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Martin,10aTranssynaptic Control of Presynaptic Ca²⁺ Influx Achieves Homeostatic Potentiation of Neurotransmitter Release  ap. 1102-1108.  aGiven the complexity of the nervous system and its capacity for change, it is remarkable that robust, reproducible neural function and animal behavior can be achieved. It is now apparent that homeostatic signaling systems have evolved to stabilize neural function [1–3]. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of organisms ranging from Drosophila to human, inhibition of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function causes a homeostatic increase in presynaptic release that precisely restores postsynaptic excitation [4]. Here we address what occurs within the presynaptic terminal to achieve homeostatic potentiation of release at the Drosophila NMJ. By imaging presynaptic Ca²⁺ transients evoked by single action potentials, we reveal a retrograde, transsynaptic modulation of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx that is sufficient to account for the rapid induction and sustained expression of the homeostatic change in vesicle release. We show that the homeostatic increase in Ca²⁺ influx and release is blocked by a point mutation in the presynaptic CaV2.1 channel, demonstrating that the modulation of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx through this channel is causally required for homeostatic potentiation of release. Together with additional analyses, we establish that retrograde, transsynaptic modulation of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx through CaV2.1 channels is a key factor underlying the homeostatic regulation of neurotransmitter release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aaction potentials 3aanimal behavior 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3anervous system 3apoint mutation 3asynaptic transmission 2aAction Potentialsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Channels, N-Typexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophilaxphysiology 2aHomeostasisxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aNeuromuscular Junctionxphysiology 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxmetabolism 2aPoint Mutationxgenetics 2aPresynaptic Terminalsxmetabolism1 aDavis, Graeme W.0 tCurrent biology.g2012 June 19, v. 22, no. 12 p.1102-1108dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008200161300001800243520070800261592002800969650001700997650001201014650001101026650003601037650001401073650002301087650002101110650002001131650001301151650001101164650001801175650001701193650001101210650001701221700001401238700001701252700001601269700001901285700002201304773014101326856007401467852000901541655001201550IND60671071920221122085949.0191002e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067107192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta00898k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoykal, I.

The processing of sequencing data involves read alignment, variant calling, variant annotation and variant filtering. The standard file format to hold variant calls is the variant call format (VCF) file. According to the format specifications, any arbitrary annotation can be added to the VCF file for downstream processing. However, most downstream analysis programs disregard annotations already present in the VCF and re-annotate variants using the annotation provided by that particular program. This precludes investigators who have collected information on variants from literature or other sources from including these annotations in the filtering and mining of variants. We have developed VCF-Miner, a graphical user interface-based stand-alone tool, to mine variants and annotation stored in the VCF. Powered by a MongoDB database engine, VCF-Miner enables the stepwise trimming of non-relevant variants. The grouping feature implemented in VCF-Miner can be used to identify somatic variants by contrasting variants in tumor and in normal samples or to identify recessive/dominant variants in family studies. It is not limited to human data, but can also be extended to include non-diploid organisms. It also supports copy number or any other variant type supported by the VCF specification. VCF-Miner can be used on a personal computer or large institutional servers and is freely available for download from http://bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/research/vcf-miner/.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputers 3adatabases 3afamily studies 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 0abioinformatics 0agenomics 0aanalysis 0asoftware 0auser interface 0aVCF1 aDuffy, Patrick1 aQuest, Daniel J.1 aHossain, Asif1 aMeiners, Mike A1 aKocher, Jean-Pierre0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2016 Mar., v. 17, no. 2 p.346-351dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245005600174300001400230500000900244520098300253592002801236650000801264650001501272650001001287650001801297650001001315650002401325650001301349650001401362650001501376650002201391700002201413700002201435773012401457856008801581852000901669655001201678IND60669727920221119062545.0191126e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066972792DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtin, Shaun J.10aGenome Engineering of Crops with Designer Nucleases  ap. 42-50.  aepub  aRecent advances in the field of genome engineering indicate that it will soon be routine to make site-directed modifications to the genomes of crop species, including targeted mutations, gene insertions, and gene replacements. This new technology will be used to help elucidate gene function and develop new and valuable traits. Key to enabling site-directed genome modifications are sequence-specific nucleases that generate targeted double-stranded DNA breaks in genes of interest. To date, three different sequence-specific nuclease systems have been used in crop plants: zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases, also termed “meganucleases.” In this review, we report on the current state of genome engineering in crop plants, comparing the different nuclease and gene delivery systems. We also consider some of the limitations that nuclease-mediated crop improvement technologies may encounter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acrops 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amutation 3anucleases 3atechnology 3azinc finger motif1 aVoytas, Daniel F.1 aStupar, Robert M.0 tThe plant genome.g2012 July, v. 5, no. 2 p.42-50dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00826naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245002000155300001600175520004400191592002800235650001300263650001900276650001900295650001300314773014800327856007600475852000900551655001200560IND60765346320221118231131.0220419e20111121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076534632DNAL7 a10.17221/6084-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoral, V.10aPotato Nikoleta  ap. 173-174.  aThis article does not have an abstract.  aPublisher supplied data 3ajournals 3aplant breeding 3aplant genetics 3apotatoes0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 41, no. 4 p.173-174dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6084-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008000163300001600243520086400259592002801123650001901151650002001170650001201190650001101202650000901213650001101222650000901233650001401242650001101256650001501267650000901282651001801291653002001309653001401329653001801343700001401361773011201375856008401487852000901571655001201580IND60122527920221118052414.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012252792DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2014.9262652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTate, RB10aBioaccumulation of metals in Tilapia zillii from Badeni Dam, Côte d'Ivoire  ap. 199-202.  aGiven the importance of fish as a source of protein and the potential for exposure of humans to metal elements, metal bioaccumulation concentrations in Tilapia zillii from four sites in the Badeni Dam on the Badeni River, Côte d'Ivoire, were analysed in March 2013. There were no significant differences between sites and therefore mean values for the impoundment as a whole were used to compare data with those from the literature. Comparative analysis showed elevated levels of manganese, iron, zinc, copper and cadmium from fish in this study. Due to the absence of human influence in the catchment area, these elevated levels are attributed to the unique geological characteristics of the catchment, compounded by the impoundment conditions. Further studies on fish condition to ascertain the effects of the elevated metal concentrations are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilapia zillii 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acopper 3afish 3ahumans 3airon 3amanganese 3arivers 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aCote d'Ivoire 0abioaccumulation 0aCichlidae 0aecotoxicology1 aHusted, A0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 39, no. 2 p.199-202dTaylor & Francisx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.9262653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002000140245007300160300001600233500000900249500001500258520176900273592002802042650001702070650001702087650000902104650001502113650002302128650001702151650002102168650001502189650001802204650002002222650002302242650001302265651001302278653001102291700003002302700002002332700002102352773020102373852000902574856007702583990002302660655001202683IND2048431620221121061333.0191122e199010  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204843162DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1990.04362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCounce, Paul A.10aTime of Draining and Harvest Effects on Rice Grain Yield and Quality  ap. 436-445.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aIn the dry-seeded, flooded rice (Oryza sativa, L.) production areas of the southern USA, a flood is normally maintained until shortly before harvest to minimize rice yield or milling quality reduction due to water deficits. Research conducted in Arkansas on Crowley (fine, montmorrillonitic, thermic Typic Albaqualfs) silt loam and Sharkey (very-fine, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquepts) clay soils indicated no reduction in rough rice yields when flooding was ceased at heading, but effects of early cessation of flooding on rice milling quality were not assessed. The primary objective of this research was to determine if early cessation of flooding would reduce rice grain yield or milling quality. Field experiments were conducted at three Arkansas locations in 1987 and 1988. The experimental design was split-plot, randomized complete block. Main plot treatments were times of draining (TD) which were 0, 2, and 4 wk after the 50% heading date. Subplot treatments were times of harvest (TH) which were 3, 4, 5, and 6 wk after heading. Draining at 2 wk after heading did not reduce rough rice yields or head rice yields over draining at 4 wk after heading at any location in any year. On the Crowley soil, draining at heading reduced rough rice by 15 to 40 cwt/acre and head rice yields by 0 to 40% depending on year and TH. In 1987, draining at heading on the Sharkey soil reduced rough rice yields from 0 to 25 cwt/acre, and reduced head rice yields 0 to 30% depending on TH. Draining at heading decreased neither rough rice yields nor head rice yields on the Calhoun soil or in 1988 on the Sharkey soil. It appears that rice growers producing rice in the Mid-South on these or similar soils may safely cease flooding 2 wk after heading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvest date 3acrop quality 3arice 3aclay soils 3asoil water content 3aOryza sativa 3awater management 3acrop yield 3awater content 3asilt loam soils 3aflooded conditions 3adrainage 3aArkansas 0agrains1 aSiebenmorgen, Terrence J.1 aVories, Earl D.1 aPitts, Donald J.0 tJournal of production agriculture.g1990 Oct., v. 3, no. 4 p.436-445dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:21088x0890-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jpa1990.04363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01296naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007100163300001600234520038100250592002800631650001500659650001300674650004400687650001900731700001500750700001700765700001900782700001900801773010500820856004800925852000900973655001200982IND4464784120221120140203.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446478412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-012-0095-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xian-li10aIdentification of a new flavone glycoside from Codonopsis nervosa   ap. 888-890.  aA new flavone glycoside, luteolin 7-O-[(6″′-caffeoyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), was isolated from Codonopsis nervosa, along with three other known compounds, luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), luteolin 7-O-gentiobioside (3), and tangshenoside VI (4).

In this research, a C-repeat binding factor (CBF)-like gene (GenBank accession number JQ339740) has been isolated from cassava, and named as MeCBF1. The full-length DNA of MeCBF1 is 1,037 base pair (bp), without intron. The 5′ untranslated region is 102 bp, the 3′ untranslated region is 239 bp, and the open reading frame is 696 bp encoding 231 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of MeCBF1 contains two CBF conserved motifs of PKK(P/R)AGRxKFxETRHP and DSxWR. The MeCBF1 shows 83 % homology to the CRT/DRE binding factor 1 from Hevea brasiliensis (Accession no. AAY43213.1). However, in cassava, the MeCBF1 target genes showed low similarity to the CBF/DREB regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the MeCBF1 was highly expressed in stems and leaves, and lowly expressed in roots. In addition, the expression of the MeCBF1 quickly responded to low temperature stress (4 °C). These results suggest that, the MeCBF1 is functional in cassava. Further studies on the MeCBF1 might be helpful to reveal molecular mechanism of cassava’s high sensitivity to low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3achilling injury 3acassava 3aopen reading frames 3astems 3aDNA 3acold stress 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aleaves 3atemperature 3aintrons 3aroots 3aManihot esculenta 0agenes1 aJi, Yimeng1 aFan, Jie1 aYang, Chenglong1 aYao, Yuan1 aZhou, Yang1 aDuan, Ruijun1 aLiu, Jiao1 aFu, Shaoping1 aHu, Xinwen1 aGuo, Jianchun0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.3089-3093dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1664-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006800185300001200253520149700265592002801762650001501790650001201805650001101817650001701828650001501845650001101860650001301871650001401884650001901898650001801917650001001935650001201945650002101957650001501978650001401993650002302007650002402030700002102054700001702075773008202092856004802174852000902222655001202231IND4468318220221118180658.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446831822DNAL7 a214319392pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-011-1968-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrians, Colin M.10aHerbivore-induced resource sequestration in plants: why bother?  ap. 1-9.  aHerbivores can cause numerous changes in primary plant metabolism. Recent studies using radioisotopes, for example, have found that insect herbivores and related cues can induce faster export from leaves and roots and greater partitioning into tissues inaccessible to foraging herbivores. This process, termed induced resource sequestration, is being proposed as an important response of plants to cope with herbivory. Here, we review the evidence for resource sequestration and suggest that associated allocation and ecological costs may limit the benefit of this response because resources allocated to storage are not immediately available to other plant functions or may be consumed by other enemies. We then present a conceptual model that describes the conditions under which benefits might outweigh costs of induced resource sequestration. Benefits and costs are discussed in the context of differences in plant life-history traits and biotic and abiotic conditions, and new testable hypotheses are presented to guide future research. We predict that intrinsic factors related to life history, ontogeny and phenology will alter patterns of induced sequestration. We also predict that induced sequestration will depend on certain external factors: abiotic conditions, types of herbivores, and trophic interactions. We hope the concepts presented here will stimulate more focused research on the ecological and evolutionary costs and benefits of herbivore-induced resource sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3aleaves 3alife history 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aontogeny 3aphenology 3aplant response 3aradionuclides 3aroots 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Chain 2aHerbivory 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aResource Allocation1 aThorn, Alexandra1 aGomez, Sara,0 tOecologia.g2011 Sept., v. 167, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-1968-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245007400159300001600233500000900249500001500258520229200273592002802565650001702593650001602610650001502626650002102641650001502662650002202677650002402699650002102723650002002744651001602764653001202780700002302792773020102815852000903016856007703025990002303102655001203125IND2048431820221121045012.0191122e199010  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204843182DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1990.04532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, David R.10aWeed Control in Soybean under Different Cropping and Tillage Systems1  ap. 453-460.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aStudies were established in 1987 and 1988 near Brooksville and Poplarville, MS, to evaluate six weed-control systems in monocrop soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Nash.] control was achieved with all systems except metribuzin [4-Amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-1,2, 4-triazin-5(4H)-one] plus alachlor [2-Chloro-2′-6′-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl)-acetanilide] preemergence (PRE) followed by either bentazon [3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide] plus acifluorfen [sodium 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoate] postemergence (POE) or cultivation in the monocrop no-till system. Southern crabgrass [Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.)Koel.] control was greater than 80% in all systems with metribuzin plus alachlor PRE followed by cultivation, pendimethalin [N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-benzenamine] plus imazaquin [2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-quinoline carboxylic acid] PRE followed by imazaquin POE, or pendimethalin plus metribuzin plus chlorimuron [Ethyl 2-[[[[(4-chloro-6-methoxypyrimidin 2-yl)amino]carbonyl]aminojsulfonyl]benzoate] PRE followed by chlorimuron POE in 1987. Pitted morningglory (Ipomoea lacunosa L.) and smallflower morningglory [Jacquemontia tamnifolia (L.)Griseb.] control varied, but was best with treatments containing imazaquin or metribuzin plus 2,4-DB [4-(2,4-Dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid]. Sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia L.) control was generally better in doublecrop than in monocrop systems, and in no-till than tilled systems. Control of prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.) and prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L.) was greater than 90% with all weed control systems used in combination with tillage, but control was more erratic without tillage. Soybean yield at Poplarville was lowest in the monocrop no-till system and highest in the doublecrop no-till system in 1988. Soybean yield at Brooksville was better with tillage in both cropping systems in 1987, but in 1988 yields were very low in all cropping, tillage, and herbicide combinations, indicating the extremely dry conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aweed control 3aGlycine max 3ano-tillage 3acultural control 3aherbicides 3aTriticum aestivum 3acontinuous cropping 3achemical control 3adouble cropping 3aMississippi 0atillage1 aRainere, Hector P.0 tJournal of production agriculture.g1990 Oct., v. 3, no. 4 p.453-460dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:21088x0890-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jpa1990.04533Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02778naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016700166300001600333520116300349592002801512650002001540650001401560650002001574650001501594650001401609650001301623650001301636650000801649650001901657650001501676653000701691653001101698653000901709653000901718653001101727653001101738653000901749653001101758653000801769653001901777653002001796653001401816653004101830700001901871700001801890700002001908700001601928700001701944700001801961700001801979773011201997856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60527297020221119015321.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Li-Ching10aPu-erh tea attenuates smoking-induced foam cell formation through inhibition of the α9-nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor expression in monocytes: An ex vivo study  ap. 132-144.  aTo assess whether drinking tea can effectively prevent smoking-induced atherosclerosis, a clinical trial ex vivo study was performed. The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups (n = 55 per group) that received either Pu-erh tea powder or a cellulose placebo (0.5 g/capsule, T.I.D.) for two months. The circulating monocytes were isolated from the tested individuals after 0, 1, and 2 months of tea-capsule administration. We found that monocytes displaying high α9-nicotinic-acetylcholine-receptor (α9-nAchR) expression that were isolated from heavy smokers before consuming tea capsules tended to form foam cells in response to nicotine (1 µL for 24 h, *P < 0.001). In contrast, long-term tea consumption significantly downregulated the monocytic α9-nAchR expression (0 months vs. 1 and 2 months; #P = 0.013 and ##P = 0.004, respectively) which causes circulating monocytes to resist nicotine-induced foam cell formation even in heavy-smokers (*P < 0.001). This study suggests that tea-drinking effectively attenuates the initial step (foam-cell formation) of smoking-induced atherosclerosis in circulating monocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acellulose 3aclinical trials 3afoam cells 3amonocytes 3anicotine 3aplacebos 3atea 3atea (beverage) 3avolunteers 0aC6 0aICAM-1 0aIL-6 0aEGCG 0anAchRs 0aox-LDL 0aPBMC 0aVCAM-1 0aWBC 0aTea components 0aAtherosclerosis 0aFoam cell 0aα9-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor1 aChen, Ming-Yao1 aTu, Shih-Hsin1 aPan, Min-Hsiung1 aLo, Chih-Yu1 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aWu, Zhixiong,1 aHo, Yuan-Soon0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.132-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300001800284520102000302592002801322650001401350650002101364650001401385650002301399650001501422650002101437650001501458650001901473650001701492650001301509650002401522700001401546700001901560700002001579773014201599856007401741852000901815655001201824IND60671072320221120170549.0191002e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067107232DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta00906e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin Xin10aPorous-structured platinum nanocrystals supported on a carbon nanotube film with super catalytic activity and durability  ap. 7862-7869.  aCurrent Pt catalysts suffer from low durability, which is hindering the implementation of fuel cells, metal–air batteries and electrochemical sensors. Here, we report Pt catalysts with not only high activity but also high durability. This was achieved by the electrodeposition of Pt crystal aggregates with a porous structure on a carbon nanotube film. Accelerated degradation testing shows that the new catalysts degrade very little even after 8000 potential cycles under harsh cycling conditions, while the typical commercial Pt/C catalyst loses most of its activity in the first 1000 cycles. Based on the microstructure evolution and electrochemical evidence, the outstanding durability is attributed to the faceted nanocrystals and their interconnected porous network, both of which limit the pathways for Pt dissolution, migration, and agglomeration. The technique reported here provides new opportunities for developing next-generation electrocatalysts for promoting their real applications in many devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3aplatinum 3asensors (equipment)1 aChen, Yun1 aWang, Xiao Xia1 aWang, Jian Nong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Mar. 31, v. 3, no. 15 p.7862-7869dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta00906e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245016500185520201700350592002802367650002202395650001702417650001102434650001602445650001402461650002002475650000902495650001802504650001002522650001302532650001302545650002002558650001802578650002002596650001402616650001402630650003002644650001802674653002402692653001802716653002802734653002202762653002202784700002502806700002702831773009902858856009002957852000903047655001203056IND60756415220221117220648.0211219e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075641522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7376602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaruboonyakorn, Phonkawin10aMultiplex PCR development for the simultaneous and rapid detection of two pathogenic flukes, Dactylogyrus spp. and Centrocestus formosanus, in ornamental fishes  aBoth monogenean Dactylogyrus spp. and digenean Centrocestus formosanus are major pathogens for aquaculture and the fish industry, especially in goldfish (Carassius auratus). The resulting infections in the fish cause extensive morbidity and mortality. However, the accurate detection of both parasitic diseases requires highly experienced personnel and takes a long time. Reliable and sensitive diagnostic methods are needed for detecting the infections in various fish species. To overcome this problem, this study developed the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-PCR) assay to rapidly identify and diagnose Dactylogyrus spp. and C. formosanus simultaneously on the target genes (18S and cytb gene) in field-collected samples under one reaction. Two pairs of species-specific primers were manually designed. The optimal reaction conditions, specificity, and sensitivity of the m-PCR assay were investigated. The results demonstrated that the multiplex PCR assay can be used to detect Dactylogyrus spp. and C. formosanus specifically, without cross-amplification with other parasite-related species and their host. The sensitivity showed that the m-PCR system could amplify the two target genes with the lowest DNA concentration at 0.078 ng/μL for Dactylogyrus spp. and 0.625 ng/μL for C. formosanus. The detection limit in the case of genomic combination between samples with goldfish was detected at the ratios of 1:13 and 1:2 ng/μL for Dactylogyrus spp. and C. formosanus, respectively. Moreover, this assay can also be developed and applied to detect the adult, metacercariae, cercariae, and egg stages of C. formosanus as well. Additionally, a total of 50 goldfish samples collected from several farms were found to be positive for Dactylogyrus spp., C. formosanus, and co-infection (fifteen, fourteen, and eighteen, respectively). The developed multiplex PCR shows advantages in specificity and sensitivity which prove to be an invaluable tool for diagnoses and monitoring the epidemic situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aDactylogyrus 3aadults 3aaquaculture 3acercariae 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3afish industry 3agenes 3agenomics 3agoldfish 3ahuman resources 3ametacercariae 3amixed infection 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 0aMolecular detection 0aMultiplex PCR 0aCentrocestus formosanus 0aDactylogyrus spp. 0aCytochrome b gene1 aTejangkura, Thanawan1 aChontananarth, Thapana0 tAquaculture.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.737660-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7376603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165300001800265500001900283520120700302592002801509650002501537650001101562650002101573650002001594650001501614650001401629650001401643650002001657650001701677650001301694700001901707700001901726700001601745700001701761773014801778856008301926852000902009655001202018IND60712264920221118060755.0201112e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02854-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Wen-Zhi10aDetection of biotin with zeptomole sensitivity using recombinant spores and a competition assay  ap. 7219-7226.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetection of protein-binding analytes is important for many applications. Currently, various instrument-based techniques are used for detecting protein-binding analytes. However, such techniques have several limitations including high cost and time-consuming sample processing. In order to overcome these limitations, we developed a sensitive competition assay for the detection of protein-binding analytes using recombinant endospores as a sensing element. The method is based on the competition between the biotin, the model analyte, and a biotin-magnetic bead complex to bind the recombinant spores containing the biotin binding region of streptavidin. After magnetic attraction, the residual spores in the suspension are spread on plates to form colonies which are used to count the amount of the residual spores; the higher the residual ratio of spores, the more biotin in the samples. The linear range was from 150 zmol to 1.5 fmol and the limit of detection of the assay was 150 zmol. The assay proposed herein is sensitive and does not require any expensive equipment. It is suitable for qualitative or semi-quantitative analysis such as screening tests for the detection of toxic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiotin 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aendospores 3aequipment 3amagnetism 3aprotein binding 3astreptavidin 3atoxicity1 aLiao, Wan-Chun1 aChen, Fang-Hsi1 aMa, I-Cheng1 aHou, Shao-Yi0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 412, no. 26 p.7219-7226dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02854-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009800162500001400260520137900274592002801653650002001681650002301701650001401724650001001738650001201748650003801760650001401798650001301812650000901825650001701834650001801851650002301869650001201892650002501904650002401929650001601953650001201969650001501981650001001996650001802006651002902024700002402053700002102077700002402098700002502122700002102147700002702168773011802195856007602313852000902389655001202398IND60702882920221122085403.0200719e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070288292DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90607722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahari, Izalin 10aDevelopment of High-Moisture Meat Analogues with Hemp and Soy Protein Using Extrusion Cooking  aNAL-light  aThe interest in plant-based products is growing in Western countries, mostly due to health and environmental issues that arise from the consumption and production of animal-based food products. Many vegan products today are made from soy, but drawbacks include the challenges of cultivating soy in colder climates such as northern Europe. Therefore, the present study investigates whether industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) could substitute soy in the production of high moisture meat analogues (HMMA). A twin screw co-rotating extruder was used to investigate to what extent hemp protein concentrate (HPC) could replace soy protein isolate (SPI) in HMMAs. The substitution levels of HPC were 20 wt%, 40 wt% and 60 wt%. Pasting properties and melting temperature of the protein powders were characterized by Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) and Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), respectively and the produced HMMA was analysed by determining the texture and colour attributes. The results showed that it is possible to extrude a mixture with up to 60% HPC. HPC absorbed less water and needed a higher denaturing temperature compared to SPI. Increasing the moisture content by 5% would have resulted in a reduction of hardness and chewiness. The lightness (L* value) was found to be significantly higher in SPI product and decreased in the mixture with higher HPC (p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aanimal-based foods 3achewiness 3acolor 3acooking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aextrusion 3ahardness 3ahemp 3ameat analogs 3amelting point 3apasting properties 3apowders 3aprotein concentrates 3asoy protein isolate 3atemperature 3atexture 3avegan diet 3awater 3awater content 3aNorthern European region1 aFerawati, Ferawati 1 aHelstad, Amanda 1 aAhlström, Cecilia 1 aÖstbring, Karolina 1 aRayner, Marilyn 1 aPurhagen, Jeanette  K.0 tFoods.g2020 June 11, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90607723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007800166300001600244500001900260520161100279592002801890650001601918650002101934650001001955650001601965650001401981650001301995650001202008650000902020650001202029653001002041653002202051653001502073653002402088700001702112700001302129700001602142700001702158700001802175700001402193700001302207700001902220700001402239773012402253856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60705651020221119055751.0201104e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070565102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhi-Yi10aIsolation and functional characterization of three MiFTs genes from mango  ap. 169-176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a key integrator of environmental signals and internal cues and plays a central role in the photoperiod response mechanism in Arabidopsis. However, the function of FTs in Mangifera indica L. is unknown. In this study, we identified three MiFTs genes from mango and characterized their role in flowering regulation. The open reading frames of MiFT1, MiFT2, and MiFT3 are 540, 516, and 588 bp in length and encode 180, 172, and 196 amino acids, respectively; the genes belong to the PEBP family. MiFTs share the conserved exon/intron structure of FTs. The nucleotide sequence of MiFT1 is 90% identical to that of MiFT2 and 82% identical to that of MiFT3; MiFT2 and MiFT3 share 81% homology with each other. According to expression analysis, MiFTs were detected at different expression levels in all tested tissues. The expression levels of the three MiFTs were significantly different in leaves during flower development, and MiFT1 expression increased sharply in leaves and was significantly higher than that of the other two MiFTs during flower bud development. All three MiFTs showed daily cycles. Ectopic expression of the three MiFTs in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in an earlier flowering genotype under long-day conditions, and MiFT1 had the strongest effect in promoting flowering. Additionally, overexpression of three MiFTs in Arabidopsis upregulated the expression levels of several flowering-related genes. Our results suggest that the three MiFTs have positive roles in promoting flowering and suggest that MiFT1 may acts as a key regulator in the flowering pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aMangifera indica 3aexons 3aflower buds 3aflowering 3agenotype 3aintrons 3aloci 3amangoes 0aMango 0aFLOWERING LOCUS T 0aExpression 0aFunctional analysis1 aHe, Xin-hua,1 aFan, Yan1 aYu, Hai-Xia1 aWang, Yi-Han1 aXie, Xiao-Jie1 aLiu, Yuan1 aMo, Xiao1 aWang, Jin-Ying1 aLuo, Cong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 155 p.169-176dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100001600198245007500214300001800289500000900307506017300316520168300489592002802172650002302200650003202223650002202255650002002277650002502297650002302322650002302345650002102368650002002389650001202409650002602421650001802447650002802465650001902493650001202512650002802524650002002552651001702572651001402589700002002603700001702623773013202640856011202772856008402884956014102968961000903109852000903118655001203127IND60006245220221214225601.0191122e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000624522DNAL7 a3102262aris7 a10113/624522hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2014.09.06662doi8 ans9858  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrink, G.E.10aGrass and Legume Effects on Nutritive Value of Complex Forage Mixtures  ap. 1329-1337.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aDry matter productivity of complex forage mixtures is typically influenced by a dominant species, but nutritive value may be a function of multiple components. Two experiments were conducted in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin during 2 yr. Each experiment consisted of 15 mixtures and monocultures of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), quackgrass (Elymus repens (L.) Gould), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), or of meadow fescue [Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv.], reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.). Vegetative-stage mixtures and monocultures were harvested five times each year. Botanical composition was used to calculate the additive effect of each species, or the expected change in nutritive value associated with a change in proportion of a species in the mixture from 0 to 100%. Nutritive value differences among mixtures attributed to abundance of sown species were evident the first year, but except for monocultures, had largely disappeared in the second year. White clover and meadow fescue had a positive additive effect on forage digestibility (range of 36 to 80 g kg⁻¹), but alfalfa and reed canarygrass had no additive effect on digestibility. Legumes generally had a negative additive effect (range of −179 to −81 g kg⁻¹) and grasses a positive effect (range of 81 to 166 g kg⁻¹) on forage neutral detergent fiber concentration. The results suggest that species with high nutritive value relative to other species within the same functional group have a disproportionate effect on nutritive value of complex mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aElymus repens subsp. repens 3aFestuca pratensis 3aMedicago sativa 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aTrifolium ambiguum 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aadditive effect 3aalfalfa 3abotanical composition 3adigestibility 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage legumes 3agrasses 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3aPennsylvania 3aWisconsin1 aSanderson, M.A.1 aCasler, M.D.0 tCrop science.g2015 May, v. 55, no. 3 p.1329-1337dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/624523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.09.06663Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Grass%20and%20Legume%20Effects%20on%20Nutritive%20Value_310226.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520099400313592002801307650002501335650001701360650003901377650001701416650001601433650001601449650001401465650001101479650001901490650001101509650002101520650001701541650002201558653001601580653001601596653002401612653002501636653002701661653003901688700001601727700001401743773011201757856008201869852000901951655001201960IND60527297520221119015647.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052729752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Songbai10aAntioxidant activities of novel galloyl phytosterols evaluated by human erythrocytes with the aid of confocal microscopy imaging  ap. 224-231.  aNotable protective effect of the novel galloyl phytosterol antioxidant on human erythrocytes was disclosed in this study. 2,2′-Azo-bis (2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) induced haemolysis of erythrocytes, and depletion of cellular glutathione were effectively inhibited by the galloyl phytosterol antioxidant.

The morphology of erythrocytes obtained through laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging provided structural details for haemolysis and glutathione investigation and was more sensitive than the level of glutathione. The liposome model exhibited that the novel antioxidant preferred to anchor in the membrane and had better performance for membrane protection than gallic acid. The strategy of integrated use of biochemical and visual methods developed in this study is valuable for investigation on mechanistic behaviours of antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aerythrocytes 3agallic acid 3aglutathione 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aphytosterols 3aprotective effect 0aPhytosterol 0aGallic acid 0aGalloyl phytosterol 0aAntioxidant activity 0aErythrocyte haemolysis 0aLaser scanning confocal microscopy1 aHu, Huiying1 aLi, Cheng0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.224-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001500176245012300191300001500314520084600329592002801175650002001203650001901223650001501242650002001257650002101277650002601298650001601324650000901340650001801349650001101367650001201378650001601390700001801406700001701424700001701441700001701458700001801475700002001493773015301513856006901666856009801735990002301833852000901856655001201865IND60643187920221119132534.0190510e20180916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318792DNAL7 a10.3791/576402doi7 aPMC62351912pmcid7 a302726632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jun-O10aImmunostimulatory agent evaluation: lymphoid tissue extraction and injection route-dependent dendritic cell activation  ap. e57640.  aFor evaluation of a new therapeutic agent for immunotherapy or vaccination, analysis of immune cell activation in lymphatic tissues is essential.

These injections will directly influence the immune response, and harvesting lymphatic tissues and analysis of dendritic cell (DC) activation in the tissues are crucial parts of these evaluations.

The aim of the present study was to explore the role of zinc, and zinc transporters Zip10 and Znt1a in zebrafish hatching gland development and larval hatching. In the study, knockdown of genes for Zip10 and Znt1a in zebrafish embryos was achieved using morpholino-modified oligonucleotides. A partial loss-of-function Znt1a mutant (Znt1aˢᵃ¹⁷) allowed comparison with the Znt1a morphant. Free Zn²⁺ in embryos and apoptosis were investigated using fluorescent dyes whereas gene expression was investigated by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). The results showed high levels of free Zn²⁺ in the hatching gland cells (HGC) along with abundant expression of zip10 and znt1a in normal embryo. Knockdown of zip10 reduced free Zn²⁺ in HGC, ceased their normal developmental apoptosis, and resulted in displacement and later disappearance of hatching glands and hatching enzymes he1a and catL1b, and inability to hatch. Conversely, knockdown of znt1a or the Znt1aˢᵃ¹⁷ mutation accelerated hatching and coincided with high expression of hatching enzymes and free Zn²⁺ in the HGC. Thus, Zip10 and free Zn²⁺ in the HGC are required both for their development and function. This study also demonstrated the opposite functions of the two zinc transporters, ZIP10 and ZnT1 as well as shedding light on the role of Zn²⁺ in regulation of the human hatching enzyme homologue, ovastacin, which is activated by zinc and cleaves the zona pellucida protein, ZP2, to prevent polyspermy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aapoptosis 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3alarvae 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3aoligonucleotides 3apolyspermy 3aresearch 3azinc 3azona pellucida 0aZebrafish 0aSlc30a1 0aSlc39a10 0aZn 0ahe1a 0acatL1b1 aMaret, W.q(Wolfgang),1 aBury, Nicolas R.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6048-63381 aHogstrand, Christer0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 06, v. 528, no. 4 p.698-705dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014800169300001800317500001900335520181700354592002802171650002202199650002302221650002402244650002702268650002502295650001302320650001502333650001502348650001802363650004602381650001502427650001602442650001602458650002002474650001202494650001302506700002102519700002302540700002002563700002402583700002502607773014802632856008202780852000902862655001202871IND60712265420221118060948.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02872-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Pogam, Pierre12aA thorough evaluation of matrix-free laser desorption ionization on structurally diverse alkaloids and their direct detection in plant extracts  ap. 7405-7416.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlkaloids represent a major group of natural products (NPs), derived from highly diverse organisms. These structurally varied specialized metabolites are widely used for medicinal purposes and also known as toxic contaminants in agriculture and dietary supplements. While the detection of alkaloids is generally facilitated by GC- or LC-MS, these techniques do require considerable efforts in sample preparation and method optimization. Bypassing these limitations and also reducing experimental time, matrix-free laser desorption ionization (LDI) and related methods may provide an interesting alternative. As many alkaloids show close structural similarities to matrices used in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), they should ionize upon simple laser irradiation without matrix support. With this in mind, the current work presents a systematic evaluation of LDI properties of a wide range of structurally diverse alkaloids. Facilitating a direct comparison between LDI and ESI-MS fragmentation, all tested compounds were further studied by electrospray ionization (ESI). Moreover, crude plant extracts of Atropa belladonna, Cinchona succirubra, and Colchicum autumnale were analyzed by LDI in order to evaluate direct alkaloid detection and dereplication from complex mixtures. Finally, dose-dependent evaluation of MALDI and LDI detection using an extract of Rosmarinus officinalis spiked with atropine, colchicine, or quinine was conducted. Overall, present results suggest that LDI provides a versatile analytical tool for analyzing structurally diverse alkaloids as single compounds and from complex mixtures. It may further serve various potential applications ranging from quality control to the screening for toxic compounds as well as the build up of MS databases.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) could be the key to accelerated diagnosis and enhanced prediction of disease and therapy outcomes as well as the design of advanced therapeutic strategies to overcome yet unsatisfactory approaches. In this review, we discuss the state of the art in RNA systems biology with focus on the application in the systems biomedicine field. We propose guidelines for analysing the role of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in human pathologies. We introduce RNA expression profiling and network approaches for the identification of stable and effective RNomics-based biomarkers, providing insights into the role of ncRNAs in disease regulation. Towards this, we discuss ways to model the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and signalling pathways that involve ncRNAs. We also describe data resources and computational methods for finding putative mechanisms of action of ncRNAs. Finally, we discuss avenues for the computer-aided design of novel RNA-based therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acomputational methodology 3acomputer-aided design 3agene regulatory networks 3aguidelines 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amechanism of action 3amedicine 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3anon-coding RNA 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 0alncRNA 0amiRNA 0aRNA function prediction 0aRNA systems medicine 0atarget prediction 0ancRNA network modeling1 aNaderi-Meshkin, Hojjat1 aGupta, Shailendra K.1 aWolkenhauer, Olaf1 aVera, Julio0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2016 May, v. 17, no. 3 p.380-392dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245009100191300001800282500001500300520130000315592002801615650002101643650001701664650000801681650001001689650002201699650001201721650001001733650001801743650002001761650002001781650001901801650002201820650002801842650001401870650001701884650002701901653001001928700002201938700002801960700002401988773009402012856008102106990002302187852000902210655001202219IND60093934320221123023334.0141104e20120710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009393432DNAL7 a226585962pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Burgt, Ate10aBirth of New Spliceosomal Introns in Fungi by Multiplication of Introner-like Elements  ap. 1260-1265.  a2019-12-06  aSpliceosomal introns are noncoding sequences that separate exons in eukaryotic genes and are removed from pre-messenger RNAs by the splicing machinery. Their origin has remained a mystery in biology since their discovery [1, 2] because intron gains seem to be infrequent in many eukaryotic lineages [3, 4]. Although a few recent intron gains have been reported [5, 6], none of the proposed gain mechanisms [7] can convincingly explain the high number of introns in present-day eukaryotic genomes. Here we report on particular spliceosomal introns that share high sequence similarity and are reminiscent of introner elements [8]. These elements multiplied in unrelated genes of six fungal genomes and account for the vast majority of intron gains in these fungal species. Such introner-like elements (ILEs) contain all typical characteristics of regular spliceosomal introns (RSIs) [9, 10] but are longer and predicted to harbor more stable secondary structures. However, dating of multiplication events showed that they degenerate in sequence and length within 100,000 years to eventually become indistinguishable from RSIs. We suggest that ILEs not only account for intron gains in six fungi but also in ancestral eukaryotes to give rise to most RSIs by a yet unknown multiplication mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeukaryotic cells 3aspliceosomes 3aRNA 3aexons 3asequence homology 3aintrons 3afungi 2aBase Sequence 2aFungixgenetics 2aGene Components 2aGenome, Fungal 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA Splicing 2aSpliceosomesxgenetics 0agenes1 aSevering, Edouard1 ade Wit, Pierre J.G.M.1 aCollemare, Jérôme0 tCurrent biology.g2012 July 10, v. 22, no. 13 p.1260-1265dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245013500155300001500290520189900305592002802204650002202232650001602254650001202270650001002282650002002292650001502312650001202327650001602339650001002355650001102365650001902376650001502395650002202410650001302432650001902445650001302464650001302477650001202490700002202502700001902524700002302543700001902566700002102585700001702606773015202623856006902775856010602844990002302950852000902973655001202982IND60643188120221119132425.0190510e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318812DNAL7 a10.3791/576452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkegawa, Masaya10aVisualization of amyloid β deposits in the human brain with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry  ap. e57645.  aThe neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides into extracellular plaques of the brain. The Aβ peptides, composed of 40 amino acids, are generated from amyloid precursor proteins (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. Aβ is deposited not only in cerebral parenchyma but also in leptomeningeal and cerebral vessel walls, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While a variety of Aβ peptides were identified, the detailed production and distribution of individual Aβ peptides in pathological tissues of AD and CAA have not been fully addressed. Here, we develop a protocol of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-based imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) on human autopsy brain tissues to obtain comprehensive protein mapping. For this purpose, human cortical specimens were obtained from the Brain Bank at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Frozen cryosections are cut and transferred to indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides. Spectra are acquired using the MALDI system with a spatial resolution up to 20 µm. Sinapinic acid (SA) is uniformly deposited on the slide using either an automatic or a manual sprayer. With the current technical advantages of MALDI-IMS, a typical data set of various Aβ species within the same sections of human autopsied brains can be obtained without specific probes. Furthermore, high-resolution (20 µm) imaging of an AD brain and severe CAA sample clearly shows that Aβ1-36 to Aβ1-41 were deposited into leptomeningeal vessels, while Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-43 were deposited in cerebral parenchyma as senile plaque (SP). It is feasible to adopt MALDI-IMS as a standard approach in combination with clinical, genetic, and pathological observations in understanding the pathology of AD, CAA, and other neurological diseases based on the current strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamino acids 3aamyloid 3abrain 3adata collection 3adesorption 3aenzymes 3agerontology 3aglass 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anecropsy 3aneuropathology 3apeptides 3asprayers 3atissues1 aNirasawa, Takashi1 aKakuda, Nobuto1 aMiyasaka, Tomohiro1 aKuzuhara, Yuki1 aMurayama, Shigeo1 aIhara, Yasuo0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Mar. 07, , no. 145 p.e57645-e57645dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/576453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57645/visualization-amyloid-deposits-human-brain-with-matrix-assisted-laser  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012300179300001800302500001900320520121400339592002801553596007201581650002201653650002501675650001101700650001501711650001801726650002001744650002101764700002401785700002201809700002001831773014801851856008201999852000902081655001202090IND60712265620221118060850.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02910-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAristizabal-Henao, Juan J.10aNontargeted lipidomics of novel human plasma reference materials: hypertriglyceridemic, diabetic, and African-American  ap. 7373-7380.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe unavailability of appropriate quality assurance/quality control materials in many lipidomics applications poses a significant challenge for lipidomics research. It is recommended that samples with certified values and/or consensus estimates, such as NIST SRM 1950–Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma, be implemented in routine analyses to enable community-wide comparisons of lipidomics results and analytical workflows. Herein, we applied a nontargeted lipidomics method for the analysis of a new human plasma reference material suite developed by NIST (hypertriglyceridemic, diabetic, and African-American plasma pools), in addition to SRM 1950. We identified specific lipidomics fingerprints associated with each sample type, including lauric acid–containing lipids and elevated triacylglycerol levels in hypertriglyceridemic plasma, palmitoleic acid–containing lipids in diabetic plasma, and oxidized fatty acid–containing phospholipids in African-American plasma. This work highlights the importance of developing and profiling application-specific reference materials, while establishing reference data that may be used for system suitability and/or quality control metrics.Graphical abstract  aPublisher supplied data  aStartup grantcUniversity of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine 3aAfrican Americans 3aanalytical chemistry 3ahumans 3alipidomics 3aphospholipids 3aquality control 3atriacylglycerols1 aJones, Christina M.1 aLippa, Katrice A.1 aBowden, John A.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 412, no. 27 p.7373-7380dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02910-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00900naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245003200160300001400192520004400206592002800250650001300278650001900291650001900310650001700329650001400346700001900360773014600379856007600525852000900601655001200610IND60765347520221118231417.0220422e20111123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076534752DNAL7 a10.17221/6097-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanišová, A.10aSpring wheat variety Zuzana  ap. 25-26.  aThis article does not have an abstract.  aPublisher supplied data 3ajournals 3aplant breeding 3aplant genetics 3aspring wheat 3avarieties1 aHorčička, P.0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 39, no. 1 p.25-26dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6097-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009600176500000900272520135200281592002801633650000801661650002001669650001301689650002501702650001401727650000901741650001401750650001601764650002001780650003101800650001001831650001301841650001501854650001101869650001201880650001201892700002301904700002401927700002401951773011601975856008802091852000902179655001202188IND60669729120221119062351.0191126e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066972912DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEichten, Steven R.10aVariation in DNA Methylation Patterns is More Common among Maize Inbreds than among Tissues  aepub  aChromatin modifications, such as DNA methylation, can provide heritable, epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the absence of genetic changes. A role for DNA methylation in meiotically stable marking of repetitive elements and other sequences has been demonstrated in plants. Methylation of DNA is also proposed to play a role in development through providing a mitotic memory of gene expression states established during cellular differentiation. We sought to clarify the relative levels of DNA methylation variation among different genotypes and tissues in maize (Zea mays L.). We have assessed genomewide DNA methylation patterns in leaf, immature tassel, embryo, and endosperm tissues of two inbred maize lines: B73 and Mo17. There are hundreds of regions of differential methylation present between the two genotypes. In general, the same regions exhibit differential methylation between B73 and Mo17 in each of the tissues that were surveyed. In contrast, there are few examples of tissue-specific DNA methylation variation. Only a subset of regions with tissue-specific variation in DNA methylation show similar patterns in both genotypes of maize and even fewer are associated with altered gene expression levels among the tissues. Our data indicates a limited impact of DNA methylation on developmental gene regulation within maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aZea mays 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3acorn 3aendosperm 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3aleaves 3ameiosis 3amitosis1 aVaughn, Matthew W.1 aHermanson, Peter J.1 aSpringer, Nathan M.0 tThe plant genome.g2013 July, v. 6, no. 2dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009500164500001400259520085900273592002801132650003201160650001001192650001501202650002101217650001401238650001201252700002501264700003201289700001901321773011801340856007601458852000901534655001201543IND60702883620221122122522.0200719e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070288362DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90607772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustos, Atma-Sol 10aInteraction between Myricetin Aggregates and Lipase under Simplified Intestinal Conditions  aNAL-light  aMyricetin, a flavonoid found in the plant kingdom, has previously been identified as a food molecule with beneficial effects against obesity. This property has been related with its potential to inhibit lipase, the enzyme responsible for fat digestion. In this study, we investigate the interaction between myricetin and lipase under simplified intestinal conditions from a colloidal point of view. The results show that myricetin form aggregates in aqueous medium and under simplified intestinal condition, where it was found that lipase is in its monomeric form. Although lipase inhibition by myricetin at a molecular level has been reported previously, the results of this study suggest that myricetin aggregates inhibit lipase by a sequestering mechanism as well. The size of these aggregates was determined to be in the range of a few nm to >200 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3afoods 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3amyricetin 3aobesity1 aHåkansson, Andreas,1 aLinares-Pastén, Javier  A.1 aNilsson, Lars 0 tFoods.g2020 June 11, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90607773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002300159245013000182300001600312520112500328592002801453650001601481650001601497650001101513650002301524650001901547650002101566650001401587650001401601650001401615650001401629650002401643650001301667650004401680651001201724651002201736653001401758653002701772653001101799653001201810653002001822700002301842700002501865700002501890773012901915856007502044852000902119655001202128IND60597679720221122202120.0180625e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059767972DNAL7 a10.7589/2016-12-2642doi4 ajwdi-53-04-30  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTompkins, Emily M.10aAvian Pox Discovered in the Critically Endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata) from the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador  ap. 891-895.  aThe Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata) is a critically endangered seabird in a rapidly shrinking population in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. The introduction of novel pathogens and parasites poses a threat to population persistence. Monitoring disease prevalence and guarding against the spread of such agents in endemic taxa are conservation priorities for the Galápagos, where recent increases in the prevalence of avian pox may have contributed to population declines and range contractions in other bird species. During November 2013–January 2014, we identified 14 Waved Albatross nestlings at our study site on Española Island with avian pox-like lesions and clinical signs. Other seabirds, landbirds, and adult Waved Albatrosses were apparently unaffected. Histopathology of tissue samples from five infected nestlings revealed inclusion bodies in all samples, consistent with avipoxvirus infection. We documented higher mortality (6 of 14 nestlings) in affected nestlings than in unaffected young in this small outbreak of avian pox, the first report of its kind in the world's only tropical albatross.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvipoxvirus 3aPhoebastria 3aadults 3adisease prevalence 3ahistopathology 3ainclusion bodies 3amortality 3anestlings 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3aseabirds 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aEcuador 3aGalapagos Islands 0aAvian pox 0aGalápagos Archipelago 0alesion 0aseabird 0aWaved Albatross1 aAnderson, David J.1 aPabilonia, Kristy L.1 aHuyvaert, Kathryn P.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2017 Oct., v. 53, no. 4 p.891-895dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2016-12-2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009100169300001800260500001500278520188200293592002802175650001402203650001002217650000902227650001002236650001502246650002402261650001602285650002002301650002202321650002502343650001802368650001602386650002502402650001202427650002002439650002602459650003502485650002302520650002202543650001302565650002502578650002902603650001502632650001902647653004302666700002602709700002102735700002102756773010502777856008102882852000902963655001202972IND60082051220221118160523.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-014-1673-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstrowski, Maciej10aIAA–amido synthetase activity and GH3 expression during development of pea seedlings  ap. 3029-3037.  a2019-12-06  aIndole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conjugation is an integral component of a sensitive mechanism for the regulation of free auxin level in the cell, in addition to hormone synthesis, degradation and transport. One mechanism of regulating both the level and biological activity of hormone involves the conjugation of IAA to amino acids through IAA–amido synthetases. These enzymes belong to the family of GH3 proteins encoded by early-auxin responsive genes, which are conserved in monocots and dicots. In this investigation, we identified pea IAA–Asp synthetase as a member of the GH3 family proteins based on amino acid sequence determined by tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). IAA–Asp synthetase was highly homologous (54–84 % amino acid identity) to the GH3 proteins from Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, Riccinus communis, Nicotiana tabacum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, we studied the subcellular distribution and activity of IAA amido synthetase in developing pea seedlings. The cytoplasmic localization of GH3 IAA amido synthetase was indicated in 12-day-old pea seedlings by immunofluorescence method using anti-AtGH3.5 antibodies. This finding was confirmed by the measurement of the enzyme activity in the subcellular fractions collected by differential centrifugation. The most of IAA–Asp synthetase activity (88 % of the total activity) was detected in the 100,000×g supernatant fluid fraction containing soluble cytoplasmic proteins. 3- and 6-day-old pea seedlings showed a weak IAA–Asp synthetase activity and GH3 mRNA level. Twelve-day-old pea stems exhibited 19-fold, and 4-fold higher levels of transcript and the enzyme activity, respectively than 3-day-old plants. We hypothesized that IAA–amido synthetase expression and activity depend on developmental stage of vegetative tissues and this is associated with changes in free IAA level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseedlings 3agenes 3apeas 3astems 3aantibodies 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aamino acids 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aGlycine max 3aamino acid sequences 3aligases 3aenzyme activity 3asubcellular fractions 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aindole acetic acid 3avegetative growth 3aproteins 3abioactive properties 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aLiliopsida 3acentrifugation 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa1 aŚwidziński, Michał1 aCiarkowska, Anna1 aJakubowska, Anna0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.3029-3037dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1673-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04042naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245026300178520211100441592002802552650002102580650002302601650002102624650001302645650001102658650001602669650001902685650001602704650001202720650001702732650001502749650002402764650002302788650001902811650001402830650001402844650001402858650001202872650002302884650001002907650001302917650001702930650002102947650002402968650001902992650002503011650001103036650001803047650001603065653001303081653001803094700002903112700002703141700002603168700002403194773009903218856009003317852000903407655001203416IND60756416120221117220914.0211219e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075641612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7376932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Houseiny, Walaa14aThe single or combined Silybum marianum and co-enzyme Q10 role in alleviating fluoride-induced impaired growth, immune suppression, oxidative stress, histological alterations, and reduced resistance to Aeromonas sobria in African catfish (Clarias gariepinus)  aHigh fluoride (FL) concentration in many areas of the world is of great concern. It poses a threat to aquatic life. Therefore, the current study was operated to scrutinize the efficiency of Silybum marianum (SM) and/or coenzyme Q10 (CQ10) dietary supplementation to rescue FL negative effects on the growth, hematological indicators, liver and kidney function, serum protein profile, innate immune parameters, oxidative status, vital organ architecture, and disease resistance to Aeromonas sobria. Two hundred and forty healthy Clarias gariepinus fish were alienated into eight groups in triplicate. The control group was fed a non-supplemented basal diet. The SM, CQ10, and SM + CQ10 groups were fed a basal diet fortified with 10 g SM/kg diet, 40 mg CQ10/kg diet, or SM + CQ10, respectively. The FL group was exposed to 73.45 mg FL/L water. The FL + SM, FL + CQ10, and FL + SM + CQ10 were exposed to FL concomitantly with SM, CQ10, and SM + CQ10, respectively. The experiment continued for 60 successive days. The results showed lower weight gain and specific growth rate but higher hepatosomtic index in the FL-exposed fish. An obvious leukopenic and anemic condition was detected. Also, a significant increase in the serum levels of hepatic enzymes and kidney damage products was apparent in FL-exposed fish. Nevertheless, exhaustion of the non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants but elevated lipid peroxidation product (MDA) was noted. The FL exposure exhausted lysozyme activity, complement 3, nitric oxide, total proteins, albumin, and γ globulin contents in the serum of C. gariepinus. Moreover, diverse pathological alterations were detected in the liver, kidney, and spleen. After 14 days of A. sobria challenge, the relative survival rate percentage was significantly reduced in FL-exposed fish. On the contrary, the SM and/or CQ10 addition significantly reduced most FL-associated negative impacts. Conclusively, SM and/or CQ10 dietary supplements could be beneficial for alleviating FL deleterious impacts, thus affording advantageous aqua feed additive for C. gariepinus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas sobria 3aClarias gariepinus 3aSilybum marianum 3aalbumins 3aanemia 3aaquaculture 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acatfish 3acoenzyme Q10 3acomplement 3adietary supplements 3adisease resistance 3afeed additives 3afluorides 3aglobulins 3ahistology 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alysozyme 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein composition 3arenal function 3aspecific growth rate 3aspleen 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain 0aFluoride 0aCo-enzyme Q101 aAbd El-Hakim, Yasmina M.1 aMetwally, Mohamed M.M.1 aAbdel Ghfar, Sayed S.1 aKhalil, AlShimaa A.0 tAquaculture.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.737693-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7376933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010000167300001600267500000900283520148500292592002801777650002001805650001201825650001601837650001101853650002801864650001501892650001401907650001801921650001301939650001401952650001301966650001101979650001101990650001202001650001102013700002102024700001702045700002302062700002102085700002802106773012102134856008102255852000902336655001202345IND60665560520221121234108.0191228e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066556052DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.14402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhont, Catherine10aUntimely Fall Harvest Affects Dry Matter Yield and Root Organic Reserves in Field-Grown Alfalfa  ap. 144-157.  aepub  aThe regrowth interval between the last summer harvest and the fall harvest is a major determinant of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) persistence and spring regrowth. This study assessed the impact of the timing of a fall harvest on persistence, dry matter yield (DMY), and root carbohydrate and N reserves of field-grown alfalfa. Two cultivars (AC Caribou and WL 225) were harvested either only twice during the summer or three times with the third harvest taken 400, 500, or 600 growing degree days (GDD) after the second summer harvest. Plant density was not affected by a fall harvest across three production years (1997 to 1999). The DMY of the first harvest in the second production year (1998) was significantly reduced by prior fall harvests taken at 400 or 500 GDD. However, the seasonal DMY in 1998 was higher with the 500 or 600 GDD harvest management than with the two harvest system. Root dry weight (DW) was generally reduced by a third harvest in the fall, especially when taken at 400 GDD. Amounts of root carbohydrate reserves (raffinose family oligosaccharides [RFO], sucrose, and starch), as well as the amounts of total amino acids and soluble proteins were significantly reduced by harvesting at 400 or 500 GDD. Untimely fall harvest reduced alfalfa spring regrowth by impeding the accumulation of both carbohydrate and N reserves. Seasonal DMY remained advantageous as long as an interval of 500 or 600 GDD was kept between the last summer and the fall harvests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aamino acids 3aautumn 3adry matter accumulation 3aharvesting 3aheat sums 3aplant density 3aproteins 3araffinose 3aregrowth 3aspring 3astarch 3asucrose 3asummer1 aCastonguay, Yves1 aNadeau, Paul1 aBélanger, Gilles,1 aDrapeau, Raynald1 aChalifour, François-P.0 tCrop science.g2004 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.144-157dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.14403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245005600176520093900232592002801171650001401199650002301213650001001236650002301246650001001269650000901279650001701288650000701305650001001312653001101322653001801333653001601351653000901367700001901376773009401395856008601489852000901575655001201584IND60678509820221120163053.0200228e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067850982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.1080342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAaslyng, Margit Dall10aMeat quality in the Danish pig population anno 2018  aThe level of meat quality was assessed in a random sample of the Danish pig population. No PSE was found in m. semimembranosus, and, depending on the definition of PSE, no pigs or only 2% of the pigs were categorised as having PSE in the M. longissimus lumborum. The ultimate pH had a low variability in M. longissimus lumborum (2.5%), m. semimembranosus (2.7%) and m. semispinalis capitis (4.9%) indicating that the quality of the meat with respect to these attributes was uniform. The drip loss was as high as 7%, although on average (2.23%) its value was lower than that previously found in a sample of the Danish pig population. A gender difference between entire male pigs and castrates was seen for drip loss and tenderness (shear force), with loins from castrates being less exudative (P < .001) and more tender (P < .01) than those from entire males. In conclusion, the Danish pig population showed a uniform meat quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrip loss 3agender differences 3aloins 3alongissimus muscle 3amales 3ameat 3ameat quality 3apH 3aswine 0aColour 0aBelly quality 0aShear force 0aPork1 aHviid, Marchen0 tMeat science.g2020 May, v. 163 p.108034-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.1080343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011700182300001600299500001500315520151600330592002801846650002101874650002201895650001701917650001101934650001501945650001701960650001401977650000701991650002201998650001602020650002402036650002302060650001602083650001502099650001302114650001502127653003002142653001002172653002602182653002402208653002102232700001902253700001802272700002002290773013502310856008402445852000902529655001202538IND60121952620221119045158.0150324e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012195262DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2013.8765262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, V.K.q(Vinod Kumar),12aA Critical Analysis on the Efficiency of Activated Carbons from Low-Cost Precursors for Heavy Metals Remediation  ap. 613-668.  a2019-12-04  aA vast array of industrial waste products, agricultural by-products, and biological materials, such as bacteria, algae, yeasts, and fungi have received increased attention for heavy metal removal and recovery due to their good performance, low cost, and availability in large quantities. Such materials are cheaper, more effective alternatives to commercial activated carbon (AC) for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution. The authors review in greater detail the various factors affecting the adsorption capacity and cost efficiency based on the literatures and present research results. Special emphasis has been made on nature of the precursors, their pretreatment and modification, the activation conditions of time and temperature, pH of aqueous media, and regeneration/reuse potential. The authors present some of the latest important results and give a source of up-to-date literature on the ACs prepared from various low-cost precursors from agro-industrial wastes as well as from biological materials. The evolution of adsorption has turned from an interesting alternative approach into a powerful standard technique by offering a numbers of advantages: better performance in terms of ulterior adsorption capacity, rate of adsorption, solving wastewaters pollution in a cost-effective way, and overcoming part of the solid wastes problem around the world. Various advantages and challenges have been identified and a widespread and great progress in this area can be expected in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaqueous solutions 3aheavy metals 3ayeasts 3abyproducts 3asolid wastes 3apollution 3apH 3aindustrial wastes 3aremediation 3aagricultural wastes 3acost effectiveness 3atemperature 3awastewater 3abacteria 3aadsorption 0alow-cost activated carbon 0aAlgae 0achemical modification 0aadsorption capacity 0atoxic metal ions1 aNayak, Arunima1 aBhushan, Brij1 aAgarwal, Shilpi0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2015 Mar. 19, v. 45, no. 6 p.613-668dTaylor & Francisx1547-65377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2013.8765263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100007100189245008800260300001600348506007600364520147000440592002801910506003701938650003901975650001502014650002002029650001902049650001602068650001602084650001302100650001102113650002402124650002202148650001902170650001102189650002702200650003102227650001402258650002002272650001602292650001802308650001902326650001302345700002502358700002802383700003002411700003002441700003002471773011702501856008302618852000902701655001202710IND60675876620221207100552.0220225e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067587662DNAL7 a317495462pmid7 aPMC68417782pmcid7 a10.1007/s12639-019-01135-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares Filho, Paulo Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3239-227810aBovine cervical bursitis co-infection caused by Brucella abortus and Onchocerca sp.  ap. 730-732.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe presence of Onchocerca guturosa in cattle is responsible for lesions similar to those observed in cases suspected of brucellosis, however, Onchocerca sp. is not a trade barrier, although it is also responsible for economic losses due to the removal of the affected parts of the carcasses. Brucella sp. is a zoonotic agent transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated animal products, the contact with infected animals and the handling of carcasses. This agent is also responsible for non-tariff trade barriers. Cervical bursitis is Brucella sp. suggestive lesions in bovine carcasses that requires laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. The objective of this study was to record the co-infection of Brucella abortus and Onchocerca sp. as a first report of co-infection of these two agents in the same lesion. The sample constituted of a nuchal bursitis in the cervical ligament, a suggestive lesion common to these two agents, submitted to histopathology and Brucella spp. isolation in the Brucellosis reference laboratory of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. Brucellosis serological diagnosis were also performed in the animal’s serum sample. B. abortus was isolated from the lesion and filarid nematode structures were identified in histopathology. All serological tests were positive for brucellosis. Further studies are needed, however, to understand the co-infection by Onchocerca sp. and B. abortus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aOnchocerca 3aanimal products 3abeef carcasses 3ablood serum 3abrucellosis 3abursitis 3acattle 3afinancial economics 3afood availability 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunologic techniques 3alaboratory experimentation 3aligaments 3amixed infection 3aparasitoses 3aserodiagnosis 3atrade barriers 3azoonoses1 aDias, Anderson Silva1 aCastro, Ingred S.

Despite the broad interest, establishing what type of vacancy defects is created and therefore whether this material is n-type or p-type has not yet been confirmed. In this article, we examine the defect chemistry of this ternary compound β-NiOOH using density functional theory with three different approaches: PBE + U as well as the nonlocal screened-exchange hybrid functionals PBE0 and HSE06. We have used thermodynamic laws with various materials as secondary materials to analytically determine the constraints that yield effective chemical potentials for calculating the vacancy formation energies at varying reservoir conditions. In addition, we have also examined the effect of the Fe doping on the vacancy formation energy of β-NiOOH. Neutral and charged vacancy formation energy results have shown that the vacancy formation is energetically most favorable for the O and OH vacancies. Therefore, we conclude that β-NiOOH is n-type under relevant reservoir conditions. These results based on defect chemistry analysis reveal a basic conductivity property for a most widely used material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy conversion 3airon 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aToroker, Maytal Caspary1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1449-29770 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 09, v. 123, no. 31 p.18895-18904dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b017503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245012900168300001800297520106500315592002801380650001601408650001001424650001801434650001701452650001301469650001301482650001401495650002201509653001801531653001701549653001701566653001301583653002401596700001401620700001401634700001401648700001701662700001701679773010201696856009001798852000901888655001201897IND60599712420221121042150.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059971242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yu10aEngineered, self-assembled near-infrared photothermal agents for combined tumor immunotherapy and chemo-photothermal therapy  ap. 6646-6656.  aNew combination therapy strategy, which takes the advantages of co-delivery two or more therapeutic agents in one nanocarrier platform, has been widely used in the clinic and achieved immense popularity in cancer treatment. Here, we have rationally developed a multifunctional platform using a self-assembly strategy to incorporate materials with specific functions of chemotherapeutics, hyperthermia, and especially immunotherapy, which can collectively contribute to the effective cancer treatment. We design the immunomodulatory CpG ODNs based platform that is conjugated with NIR-responsive gold nanorods and doxorubicin for cancer therapy. The gold nanorods can be applied as the nanocarrier to simultaneously address the three kinds of treatments, which lead to a significant benefit relative to the use of each method alone. Both in vitro and in vivo assays reveal that this engineered vehicle exhibits significant antitumor efficacy. Our studies provide strong evidence that the AuNRs-CpG-Dox conjugates can be utilized as efficient antitumor agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3afever 3aimmunotherapy 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3ananorods 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 0aImmunotherapy 0aHyperthermia 0aChemotherapy 0aCpG ODNs 0aCombination therapy1 aJu, Enguo1 aLiu, Zhen1 aDong, Kai1 aRen, Jinsong1 aQu, Xiaogang0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Aug., v. 35, no. 24 p.6646-6656dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245019600175520099900371592002801370650001601398650001201414650001601426650001801442650000801460650001701468650003601485650002401521650001201545650001401557650001001571650001601581653001401597653002401611653001601635653003701651653002801688700002101716700002601737700002001763700002001783773009501803856008601898852000901984655001201993IND60678510120221120092336.0200128e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067851012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.1080122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDall'Olio, Stefania10aEffects of 17 performance, carcass and raw ham quality parameters on ham weight loss at first salting in heavy pigs, a meat quality indicator for the production of high quality dry-cured hams  aHam weight loss at first salting (HWLFS) is a meat quality parameter used to assess the suitability of the hams for salting and seasoning. The relationships between HWLFS and 17 performance, carcass and raw ham quality parameters were investigated in 260 performance tested Italian Large White heavy pigs. HWLFS was affected by slaughter day and visible intermuscular fat of trimmed hams whereas sex did not affect its variability. Residual correlations of HWLFS with backfat thickness (BFT; r = −0.51) and lean cuts (LC; r = +0.51) were stronger than with ham weight at trimming (r = +0.40) and after first salting (r = +0.37). Significant correlations of HWLFS with fresh ham quality traits ranged from +0.16 to −0.25. BFT, LC and pH₂₄ₕ were the main predictors of HWLFS in the regression model.

This paper explores the effects of interfacial bonding on the structure, dynamics and mechanical properties of CNT-geopolymer nanocomposites via molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings from the structural analysis reveal that the interfacial bonding decreases the thickness of the “interfacial van der waals (vdW) excluded volume” and interphase (inner) region, and condenses the interfacial structure. Remarkably, it is found that the interfacial bonding provides a new “restrictive mechanism” limiting the diffusion of components in the geopolymer matrix. A dynamical heterogeneous character is found as the atom mobility of the inner region is slower than that of the outer region. Furthermore, the pull-out test reveals about 15 times increase in the interfacial shear strength of CNT-geopolymer nanocomposite with 10.0% interfacial bonding concentration, which is beneficial for the enhancement of its mechanical properties and hinders crack formation under tensile loading. The tensile test reveals about 60% and 80% increase in the nanocomposite’s Young’s modulus and tensile strength, respectively. This study provides, for the first time, valuable insight into the role of the interfacial bonding on the performance of CNT-geopolymer nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical bonding 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3ashear strength 3asimulation models 3atensile strength 3avan der Waals forces1 aZhang, L.W.1 aLiew, K.M.0 tCarbon.g2020 May, v. 161 p.772-783dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011200176300001600288520092500304592002801229650002601257650002201283650002501305650001701330650001601347650001601363650002201379650001201401650001001413650001001423650001301433650001701446650001901463653001801482653001801500653002901518653001801547653001901565700001601584700001901600773009201619856009001711852000901801655001201810IND60603507720221117230407.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060350772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, Yi-Ting10aReactive oxygen species and glutathione dual redox-responsive micelles for selective cytotoxicity of cancer  ap. 150-161.  aThis study developed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) dual redox-responsive micelles, which encapsulate anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT), protect CPT activity, and trigger CPT release in cancer cell H2O2- or GSH-rich surroundings. Experimental results show that CPT-loaded dual redox-responsive micelles remain stable at low levels of ROS and GSH in blood circulation, have high redox sensitivities needed to CPT release in cancer cells with high ROS or GSH (e.g., lung, gastric, and colon cancer cells), and prevent undersigned CPT toxicity in ROS/GSH balanced normal cells (e.g., fibroblast cells, etc.) or normal organs (e.g., liver, kidney, etc.).

Their small size, fast development, and ability to breed in the lab make them an ideal species to use in research, especially in toxicology. Behaviour in general is poorly studied in FM. The aim of this study was to characterize the normal behaviour of fathead minnow at 3 different stages of development in a light-dark box and in a social behaviour test. Fish larvae showed a preference for the light area, and then an increase in dark preference was seen as the fish aged. FM preferred to be with conspecifics at each age, but this preference was much stronger at the adult stage. The time of first entry into the conspecific area was reduced with increasing age of the fish. The time spent in the conspecific area increased between the juvenile and adult stage, and adults stayed more in this area when they entered it. Maturation of behavior in FM was demonstrated in our study. The FM is another good model fish to assess behavioral effects of chemicals, and this study helps to define the appropriate ages for behavioral studies with FM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPimephales promelas 3aadults 3afish larvae 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3asocial behavior 3atoxicology 3aNorth America 0aEcotoxicological context 0aFathead minnow 0aLight dark test 0aMaturation of behaviour 0aSocial preference1 aParrott, Joanne0 tBehavioural processes.g2017 May, v. 138 p.15-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2017.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245020500161300001400366520118500380592002801565650001201593650001901605650001901624650001201643650001901655650001501674650000901689651001101698653001901709653001201728653001801740653002001758653004101778653002301819653002001842653001001862653001001872653004101882700002301923773011301946856007802059852000902137655001202146IND60485917920221119110558.0160218e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048591792DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2014-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBąk, Bogdan10aPrediction of precipitation deficit and excess in Bydgoszcz Region in view of predicted climate change/ Prognoza niedoboru i nadmiaru opadu w rejonie Bydgoszczy w świetle przewidywanej zmiany klimatu  ap. 11-19.  aThe paper presents the prediction of rainfall shortage and excess in Bydgoszcz region in the growing seasons (April-September) in 2011-2050 in the perspective of climate change. Based on the predicted monthly sum of precipitations for the percentile 50%, calculated by the regional climate model RM5.1 for Poland with boundary values taken from global model ARPEGE, a decrease in the amount of rainfall during the growing season by approximately 55 mm is predicted, compared to 1971-2000 taken as a reference period. The qualification of rainfall shortage and excess was made using the standardised precipitation index (SPI). According to the predicted values of SPI, the occurrence of 38 months of rainfall excess and 40 months of rainfall deficit in the period 2011-2050 is predicted. Dry months will constitute 16% of all months, wet months - 13%, and normal months - 71%. The occurrence of 13 several-month long periods of rainfall excess and 14 such periods of drought are predicted. The longest periods of both wet and dry weather will last 5 months. So long wet periods are expected in 2020, 2022 and 2031, and drought periods in 2017-2018, 2023-2024 and from 2046 to 2049.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrought 3agrowing season 3aprediction 3arain 3aPoland 0aclimate models 0adrought 0aprecipitation 0arainfall excess 0astandardized precipitation index SPI 0amodele klimatyczne 0anadmiar opadów 0aopady 0asusza 0awskaźnik standaryzowanego opadu SPI1 aŁabędzki, Leszek0 tJournal of water and land development.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 23, no. 1 p.11-19dDe Gruyter Openx2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2014-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04177naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245013100208300002000339520255600359592002802915650001602943650001102959650000802970650001902978650001102997650001703008650002303025650003303048650001203081650003703093700002403130700002603154700001803180700002103198700002403219700001703243700002303260700001803283700002403301700002103325700002603346700006203372700002203434773013803456856008003594852000903674655001203683IND60655990120221116165735.0190808e20190709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065599012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b026922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammons, Joshua A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0107-195410aResolving Detonation Nanodiamond Size Evolution and Morphology at Sub-Microsecond Timescales during High-Explosive Detonations  ap. 19153-19164.  aCharacterization of the initial morphology of detonation nanodiamond (DND) has been the focus of many research studies that aim to develop a fundamental understanding of carbon condensation under extreme conditions. Identifying the pathways of DND formation has the potential for significant impact on many of the controlled synthesis of nanoscale carbon with a tailored functionality; currently, a wide range of possible (and conflicting) mechanisms of nucleation and growth have been proposed, and further research is essential. Building a comprehensive understanding of DND formation is challenging because it requires in situ characterization on the sub-microsecond (sub-μs) timescale during a high-explosive detonation. In this study, time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) is used to reveal the early-stage DND morphology from <0.1 to 6 μs after the detonation front passes through the X-ray beam path. We address the ambiguity of models previously reported for the analysis of small-angle scattering from DND by comparing (i) in situ, TR-SAXS recorded during early-stage particulate formation and (ii) ex situ SAXS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of products recovered from detonation of the same high explosive within a carefully designed ice chamber. The SAXS from both late-time (>1 μs) in situ and recovered DND exhibits consistent features in the I(q) curve. Such a close similarity allows a high-fidelity SAXS model derived from the ex situ SAXS and TEM measurements to be applied to the in situ data, which yields new insight into the early-stage (<1 μs) morphology of DND. Our analysis indicates that the size distribution of DND particles is observed within 0.1 μs postdetonation, which indicates that carbon is condensed within the reaction zone. Between 0.1 and 0.3 μs, the mean size of the diamond particles increases slightly toward 4 nm, and evidence of surface texture is observed. Based on TEM imaging, this surface texture consists of hemispherical protrusions that extend ∼1 nm from the surface. Beyond 0.3 μs, neither the mean size of the diamond core nor the surface texture changes significantly for several microseconds after the detonation. Combined with thermochemical simulations, these results indicate that during detonation of composition B, carbon is condensed into nanoscale diamond much faster than that previously reported in other studies. Furthermore, the surface texture of the DND is shown to arise during condensation rather than via subsequent graphitization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3aice 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3ananodiamonds 3aphysical chemistry 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atexture 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNielsen, Michael H.1 aBagge-Hansen, Michael1 aBastea, Sorin1 aShaw, William L.1 aLee, Jonathan R.

Three independent genes harboring SMV resistance have been identified: Rsv1, Rsv3, and Rsv4. Although the resistance genes (R‐genes) have been found in some germplasm, usually they provide protection to some, but not all, viral strains. The objective of this research was to identify a new source of SMV resistance in Korean soybean accession PI 438307. The soybean genotype PI 438307 was crossed with susceptible parent ‘Essex’ (rsv), and differential parents PI 96983 (Rsv1), L29 (Rsv3), and V94‐5152 (Rsv4). F₂ plants and F₂:₃ lines derived from all four cross combinations were screened with SMV‐G7 strain. Additionally, F₂ plants obtainSed from PI 438307 (R) × Essex (S) were genotyped with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on chromosome 2 (MLG D1b). Inheritance and allelic studies revealed that resistance to SMV in PI 438307 is controlled by a single dominant gene allelic to the Rsv4 locus. PI 438307 exhibited unique symptomology when compared to reported Rsv4 alleles in V94‐5152, PI 88788 and Beeson. PI 438307 was resistant to SMV‐G1 through G6 and resistant at seedling stages to SMV‐G7. Therefore, it was proposed that the new allele Rsv4‐v might be assigned to the SMV resistance in this soybean accession. Soybean sources carrying Rsv4 alleles are rare among the soybean germplasm and confer resistance to all or most SMV strains; therefore, this allele may be a good choice for breeding programs in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  cUnited Soybean Board  cArkansas Soybean Promotion Board 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3aalleles 3adominant genes 3agenetic analysis 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3aloci 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3asoybeans1 aChen, Pengyin1 aWu, Chengjun0 tCrop science.g2016 Nov., v. 56, no. 6 p.3016-3023dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.03.01463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245023600161300001400397520100200411592002801413650002001441650001201461650001901473650001901492650001501511653002001526653001901546653002701565653003901592653002601631653001901657700002301676773011301699856007801812852000901890655001201899IND60485918020221119110443.0160218e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048591802DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2014-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBąk, Bogdan10aThermal conditions in Bydgoszcz Region in growing seasons of 2011–2050 in view of expected climate change/ Warunki termiczne w rejonie Bydgoszczy w okresie wegetacyjnym w latach 2011–2050 w świetle przewidywanej zmiany klimatu  ap. 21-29.  aThe paper presents an analyse of the scenario of expected changes in monthly mean air temperature of months in the growing season (April-September) and growing seasons of 2011-2050 in Bydgoszcz Region. Prediction of thermal conditions is made using regional climate model RM5.1 with boundary values taken from global model ARPEGE. When compared with the reference period 1971-2000, an increase of mean air temperature should be expected in most months and growing seasons of the years 2011-2050. The biggest positive change in the mean monthly temperature is predicted for July (1.5°C) and August (1.2°C). In 2011-2050 significant increase trends of air temperature change can be expected in April, June and August. According to the thermal classification proposed by Lorenc, normal, slightly warm and slightly cool months and growing periods will dominate. The frequency of normal and slightly cool growing periods will decrease and the frequency of slightly warm growing periods will increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3agrowing season 3aprediction 0aair temperature 0aclimate change 0athermal classification 0aklasyfikacja termiczna temperatury 0atemperatura powietrza 0azmiana klimatu1 aŁabędzki, Leszek0 tJournal of water and land development.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 23, no. 1 p.21-29dDe Gruyter Openx2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2014-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245011100164300001600275520167900291592002801970650001501998650002802013650003002041650001102071650002802082650001902110650001902129650001302148650001502161650001502176650000702191650001602198650001702214651001102231651001202242653002802254653002102282653001402303653001702317700002202334700002002356700002002376700002002396700002202416773012402438856007602562852000902638655001202647IND60517308720221122153820.0160329e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051730872DNAL7 a10.4141/cjss2013-0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Catherine A.10aEnhanced A Horizon Framework and Field Form for detailed field scale monitoring of dynamic soil properties  ap. 189-208.  aFox, C.

Soil Sci. 94: 189–208. Taxonomic protocols for A horizon description are limited when detailed monitoring of soil change in dynamic soil properties is required for determining the effectiveness of best management practices, remediation efforts, and assessing subtle impacts on soil properties from environmental and anthropogenic stressors. The A Horizon Framework was designed by consolidating protocols from national and international description systems and expert opinion to optimize descriptive capability through use of additional enhanced lowercase designators. The Framework defines new protocols and syntax resulting in a unique soil fingerprint code. Five levels of enhanced lowercase A horizon designators are defined: Level 1, Soil processes and environmental context; Level 2, Soil structure-bulk density; Level 3, Organic carbon; Level 4, pH and electrical conductivity; and, Level 5, Soil and landscape context (i.e., soil texture, surface conditions, current land use, slope character). An electronic Field Form based on the new Framework syntax automatically records the soil fingerprint code in an enhanced (all Levels included) and a minimum detail mode focused on the key dynamic properties. The soil fingerprint codes become a powerful tool by which to identify trends of soil change and small alterations in the dynamic soil properties. Examples of soil fingerprint codes from selected Canada and Germany long-term experimental studies are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aanthropogenic stressors 3abest management practices 3acarbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexpert opinion 3aexpert systems 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apH 3aremediation 3asoil texture 3aCanada 3aGermany 0aDynamic soil properties 0asoil description 0aA horizon 0asoil quality1 aTarnocai, Charles1 aBroll, Gabriele1 aJoschko, Monika1 aKroetsch, David1 aKenney, Elizabeth0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2014 May, v. 94, no. 2 p.189-208dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjss2013-0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245012200175300001800297520154000315592002801855650002101883650002201904650002001926650001201946650002601958650001301984650001701997650002102014650001902035650001402054653002202068653004402090653002002134653002102154653002302175700001902198700001702217700001802234700001302252700001902265773010202284856009002386852000902476655001202485IND60599712820221121042001.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059971282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yan-Fei10aMechanical properties and biocompatibility of melt processed, self-reinforced ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene  ap. 6687-6697.  aThe low efficiency of fabrication of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)-based artificial knee joint implants is a bottleneck problem because of its extremely high melt viscosity. We prepared melt processable UHMWPE (MP-UHMWPE) by addition of 9.8 wt% ultralow molecular weight polyethylene (ULMWPE) as a flow accelerator. More importantly, an intense shear flow was applied during injection molding of MP-UHMWPE, which on one hand, promoted the self-diffusion of UHMWPE chains, thus effectively reducing the structural defects; on the other hand, increased the overall crystallinity and induced the formation of self-reinforcing superstructure, i.e., interlocked shish-kebabs and oriented lamellae. Aside from the good biocompatibility, and the superior fatigue and wear resistance to the compression-molded UHMWPE, the injection-molded MP-UHMWPE exhibits a noteworthy enhancement in tensile properties and impact strength, where the yield strength increases to 46.3 ± 4.4 MPa with an increment of 128.0%, the ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus rise remarkably up to 65.5 ± 5.0 MPa and 1248.7 ± 45.3 MPa, respectively, and the impact strength reaches 90.6 kJ/m². These results suggested such melt processed and self-reinforced UHMWPE parts hold a great application promise for use of knee joint implants, particularly for younger and more active patients. Our work sets up a new method to fabricate high-performance UHMWPE implants by tailoring the superstructure during thermoplastic processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acrystal structure 3aimpact strength 3amelting 3amodulus of elasticity 3apatients 3apolyethylene 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics 3aviscosity 0aArtificial joints 0aUltrahigh molecular weight polyethylene 0aMelt processing 0aFlow accelerator 0aSelf-reinforcement1 aXu, Jia-Zhuang1 aLi, Jian-Shu1 aHe, Ben-Xiang1 aXu, Ling1 aLi, Zhong-Ming0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Aug., v. 35, no. 25 p.6687-6697dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245006800207300001400275520149900289592002801788650002301816650001401839650001101853650001801864650001301882650001901895650002601914650001401940650001101954700005301965773008502018856008502103852000902188655001202197IND60684028920221118123945.0200419e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068402892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, D.D.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4746-627610aElectric poling of carbon fiber with and without nickel coating  ap. 25-35.  aThis paper reports for the first time electric poling in a carbon material. The material is carbon fiber (polyacrylonitrile-based, 12,000-fiber tow, 40-mm inter-electrode distance) with/without nickel coating. The poling involves passing a fixed DC current. The resulting polarization causes an electric field that opposes the applied field, thus increasing the apparent direct-current electrical resistance. For the uncoated fiber, at 80 s of 10.000-mA current application, the apparent resistance or effective electric permittivity is increased by 1.3%, corresponding to 2800 electrons participating in the polarization (5.3 × 10⁻¹⁶) of the carriers, which include the inherent carriers and injected electrons. The nickel coating enhances the polarization, but decreases the fraction of carriers that participate. This fraction increases monotonically with increasing current application time for the nickel-coated fiber, but increases and then decreases for the uncoated fiber. Upon instantaneous polarity reversal, the apparent resistance decreases instantaneously, with the values immediately before and after the reversal being asymmetrical about the true resistance. The electrical asymmetry is due to an inherent electret (without poling). The polarization associated with the electret is much higher than the additional polarization that the poling provides. Nevertheless, the poling increases the polarization through the interaction of the injected electrons with the atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication timing 3aasymmetry 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acoatings 3aelectric field 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrons 3anickel1 aXi, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1744-624X0 tCarbon.g2020 June, v. 162 p.25-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245014900171300001400320520099100334592002801325650000901353650002101362650001201383650001801395650002101413650001201434650001101446650002201457650001201479650001801491650001201509650002101521650001601542650001501558650001001573653001201583653001001595653001501605653001701620653002001637653001701657653001901674653002501693653002001718700002101738700002501759773011301784856007801897852000901975655001201984IND60485918220221119110216.0160218e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048591822DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2014-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMioduszewski, Waldemar14aThe analysis of the impact of small retention on water resources in the catchment/ Analiza oddziaływania małej retencji na zasoby wodne zlewni  ap. 41-51.  aThe aim of this study was to analyse the impact of selected small water retention measures on surface and groundwater level in river basins. The study was limited to the analysis of measures like small water reservoirs, restoration of bogs and reconstruction of drainage systems in the river valleys. A few study cases were described. Dutch SIMGRO numerical model describing the regional surface water and groundwater flow has been used for simulation modelling of different cases. The result of the study has shown that small retention measures are a good and effective method to increase the ability to retain water in the small river basins. Construction of small water reservoirs and weirs on ditches and creeks and restoration of drained bogs can limit the fast outflow of precipitation and melting water from the catchment. The study has proved that the small water retention measures can be helpful for flood protection and in decreasing of drought threats in small river basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abogs 3adrainage systems 3adrought 3aflood control 3agroundwater flow 3amelting 3arivers 3asimulation models 3astreams 3asurface water 3avalleys 3awater reservoirs 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aweirs 0adrought 0aflood 0areservoirs 0ariver basins 0awater retention 0abilans wodny 0amała retencja 0asystemy melioracyjne 0azbiorniki wodne1 aQuerner, Erik P.1 aKowalewski, Zbigniew0 tJournal of water and land development.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 23, no. 1 p.41-51dDe Gruyter Openx2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2014-00283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012700170300001600297520127200313592002801585650003001613650004401643650002301687650002601710650002801736650001301764650001401777650003701791650004401828650001601872653002501888653003301913653001501946653002401961653003301985700002002018700001502038700001502053700001502068700001502083700001302098700001802111773011802129856008602247852000902333655001202342IND60568003020221121224052.0170627e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056800302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Wenqiang10aDesign, synthesis of novel chitosan derivatives bearing quaternary phosphonium salts and evaluation of antifungal activity  ap. 704-711.  aTwo novel chitosan derivatives modified with quaternary phosphonium salts were successfully synthesized, including tricyclohexylphosphonium acetyl chitosan chloride (TCPACSC) and triphenylphosphonium acetyl chitosan chloride (TPPACSC), and characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectra. The degree of substitution was also calculated by elemental analysis results. Their antifungal activities against Colletotrichum lagenarium, Watermelon fusarium, and Fusarium oxysporum were investigated in vitro using the radial growth assay, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration assay. The fungicidal assessment revealed that the synthesized chitosan derivatives had superior antifungal activity compared with chitosan. Especially, TPPACSC exhibited the best antifungal property with inhibitory indices of over 75% at 1.0mg/mL. The results obviously showed that quaternary phosphonium groups could effectively enhance antifungal activity of the synthesized chitosan derivatives. Meanwhile, it was also found that their antifungal activity was influenced by electron-withdrawing ability of the quaternary phosphonium salts. The synthetic strategy described here could be utilized for the development of chitosan as antifungal biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum orbiculare 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aantifungal properties 3abiocompatible materials 3achitosan 3achlorides 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3awatermelons 0aChitosan derivatives 0aQuaternary phosphonium salts 0aFunctional 0aAntifungal activity 0aElectron-withdrawing ability1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aLuan, Fang1 aWei, Lijie1 aChen, Yuan1 aDong, Fang1 aLi, Qing1 aGuo, Zhanyong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Sept., v. 102 p.704-711dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129245010800147300001600255520136800271592002801639650001901667650002001686650002301706650002701729650001901756650001701775650001101792650001601803650000901819650001701828650001001845650002101855650000901876650001501885700001601900700001601916700001401932700001401946700001601960700001601976700001401992700001602006700001702022700001602039710002602055773009602081856008102177852000902258655001202267IND60086507520221122032701.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008650752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2011.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL12aA toxicological and dermatological assessment of aryl alkyl alcohols when used as fragrance ingredients  ap. S52-S99.  aThe aryl alkyl alcohol (AAA) fragrance ingredients are a diverse group of chemical structures with similar metabolic and toxicity profiles. The AAA fragrances demonstrate low acute and subchronic dermal and oral toxicity. No carcinogenicity in rats or mice was observed in 2-year chronic testing of benzyl alcohol or α-methylbenzyl alcohol; the latter did induce species and gender-specific renal adenomas in male rats at the high dose. There was no to little genotoxicity, mutagenicity, or clastogenicity in the mutagenic in vitro bacterial assays, and in vitro mammalian cell assays. All in vivo micronucleus assays were negative. NOAELs for maternal and developmental toxicity are far in excess of current human exposure levels. At concentrations likely to be encountered by consumers, AAA fragrance ingredients are non-irritating to the skin. The potential for eye irritation is minimal. With the exception of benzyl alcohol and to a lesser extent phenethyl and 2-phenoxyethyl AAA alcohols, human sensitization studies, diagnostic patch tests and human induction studies, indicate that AAA fragrance ingredients generally have no or low sensitization potential. Available data indicate that the potential for photosensitization is low. It is concluded that these materials would not present a safety concern at current levels of use as fragrance ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzyl alcohol 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical structure 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aeye irritation 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3aingredients 3amice 3amutagenicity 3aodors 3aphotosensitivity 3arats 3atoxicology1 aBelsito, D.1 aBickers, D.1 aBruze, M.1 aCalow, P.1 aDagli, M.L.1 aFryer, A.D.1 aGreim, H.1 aMiyachi, Y.1 aSaurat, J.H.1 aSipes, I.G.2 aThe RIFM Expert Panel0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Sept., v. 50S2 p.S52-S99dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2011.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245012800213300001600341520114600357592002801503650002001531650004401551650002201595650002101617650001401638650001901652650003701671650001401708650000901722650001301731650001801744650001101762650000701773650001501780650003301795650001601828650003701844653003301881653006301914653002201977653001901999653001802018700001702036700001202053700002002065700001602085700001902101773009102120856008902211852000902300655001202309IND60590714320221121014550.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059071432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Xiao-Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7870-866110aKinetic research on dechlorinating dichlorobenzene in aqueous system by nano-scale nickel/iron loaded with CMC/NFC hydrogel  ap. 297-305.  aIn this study, we reported on the nano-scale nickel/iron particles loaded in carboxymethyl/nanofibrillated cellulose (CMC/NFC) hydrogel for the dechlorination of o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) in aqueous solution. The biodegradable hydrogel may provide an ideal supporting material for fastening the bimetallic nano-scale particles, which was examined and characterized by TEM, SEM-EDX, FT-IR and BET. The performance of the selected bimetallic particles was evaluated by conducting the dechlorination of DCB in the solution under different reaction conditions (e.g., pH, dosage of nickel/iron nanoparticles and temperature). The results showed that about 70% of DCB could be dechlorinated at 20 °C in 8 h, which indicated that the immobilized reactive material had a high reduction activity when Ni/Fe loading dosage in the hydrogel (18 wt%) was considered. Moreover, the reduction behavior agreed to the pseudo-first order reaction, in which the dechlorination rate was irrelative to the pH aqueous solution. A kinetic model for predicting the concentration of DCB during the reduction reaction was established based on the experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDCB (herbicide) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3adechlorination 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogels 3airon 3akinetics 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3apH 3aprediction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNickel/iron (0) nanoparticle 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose/nanofibrillated cellulose hydrogel 0ao-dichlorobenzene 0aDechlorination 0aKinetic model1 aGuo, Congbao1 aLiu, Yu1 aChai, Xin-Sheng1 aLi, Youming1 aChen, Guangxue0 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 194 p.297-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520131100296592002801607650001101635650001601646650002401662650001601686650002501702650000901727650001801736653001701754653002501771653002001796653002201816653001401838653001001852773009701862856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60761192320221118111610.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076119232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDao, Phong B.10aCondition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines based on structural break detection in SCADA data  ap. 641-654.  aThis paper presents a new approach – based on structural break detection in SCADA data – for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Chow test – a commonly used testing method for structural breaks in economic and financial data – has been adapted for this purpose. A five-step Chow's test-based computation procedure is proposed. The method is applied for condition monitoring of a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW using temperature-related SCADA data. A multiple linear regression model is formed using gearbox and generator temperature data as the independent variables and generator speed data as the dependent variable. The Chow test is used to assess the stability of regression coefficients in the model. Any coefficient instability means a structural change in the regression model, which can be interpreted as the occurrence of a fault in the wind turbine. The scheme used to detect structural changes is based on control charts, where sequences of the calculated probability (p-values) are plotted together with the critical line, defined by the significance level. The method is validated using two known fault events. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively monitor the wind turbine and reliably detect abnormal problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3atransmission systems 3awind 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aCondition monitoring 0aFault detection 0aStructural change 0aChow test 0aSCADA0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.641-654dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002800189245013600217300001600353506007600369520128100445592002801726506003701754650001201791650002001803650002501823650001301848650001701861650001101878650001401889650001201903650000901915650000901924650002301933650002601956650001401982650001201996650002002008650001602028650001902044650001802063650001702081651001602098700003002114700003002144773011702174856008302291852000902374655001202383IND60675877620221207112144.0220225e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067587762DNAL7 a317495372pmid7 aPMC68418882pmcid7 a10.1007/s12639-019-01144-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVizon, Khryst Celine C.10aContamination of food-borne parasites from green-leafy vegetables sold in public markets of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija, Philippines  ap. 651-657.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVegetables contribute a significant portion of the typical Filipino diet. Hence, it is a concern that based on previous studies, vegetables could potentially act as vectors for parasitic transmission. This study aimed to further investigate these occurrences by assessing the food-borne parasitic contamination of vegetables sold in the public markets of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. A total of 288 vegetable samples (cabbage, lettuce and Chinese cabbage) were collected from March to August 2018 in the wet market and supermarkets of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. Results showed that 116 out of 288 (40.28%) vegetable samples were positive of food-borne parasites such as Ascaris sp., Hymenolepis diminuta, Isospora sp., Hookworm/Strongylid sp./free-living nematode larvae, Strongylid sp. egg, Taenia sp., and Trichuris sp. Isospora sp. has the highest contamination rate (16.67%) and mean density (13 eggs/g) from the sampled vegetables. Possible sources of these identified parasites are contaminated soil and water harbored by the sampled vegetables during cultivation, transport and handling/preparation by vendors. Further studies are needed to establish a more reliable information that could lead to public health improvement and food safety awareness for the community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscaris 3aChinese cabbage 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aIsospora 3aStrongylidae 3aTaenia 3aTrichuris 3acabbage 3adiet 3aeggs 3afood contamination 3afree-living nematodes 3ahookworms 3alettuce 3anematode larvae 3aparasitoses 3apolluted soils 3apublic health 3asupermarkets 3aPhilippines1 aBattad, Zosimo G., IIcII1 aCastillo, Diane Shiela C.0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2019 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.651-657dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-019-01144-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245012600161300001400287520144800301592002801749650001901777650002501796650001401821650001701835650001501852650001001867650001301877650001901890650001301909650001701922650001401939650002401953650002501977650002202002650001702024653002902041653001902070653002702089653002802116653001702144700001702161700001602178700001702194773010902211856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60564176120221119145544.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056417612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bo10aAzide-assisted crosslinked quaternized polysulfone with reduced graphene oxide for highly stable anion exchange membranes  ap. 84-94.  aAs an important component for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs) should possess good mechanical strength and relatively high stability in alkaline environment. Besides, fuel permeation as a serious issue which may lead to the potential decrease and catalyst poisoning could also affect the application for AEMs. Herein, we prepared a series of crosslinked composite membranes which using reduced graphene (rGO) as both inorganic nanofillers and crosslinkers. During a simple thermal crosslinking at 160°C, a covalently cross-linked structure was formed between side chains with azide groups and rGO with alkenyl groups without sacrificing ionic groups. Properties such as water uptake (WU) and swelling ratio were significantly decreased after crosslinking, which caused the decline of ion conductivity for the membranes. However, it was found that when only a small amount of rGO (less than 0.5wt%) was incorporated into QPSU to induced crosslinking, the methanol permeability of membranes obviously decreased by two orders of magnitude, and the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the composite membranes were enhanced. Moreover, the crosslinked membrane maintained stable in Fenton's reagent and exhibited high alkaline resistance in 1M of KOH at 60°C for more than 500h. Therefore, the crosslinked membranes with rGO demonstrate great potential as anion exchange membrane for fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3aartificial membranes 3acatalysts 3acrosslinking 3afuel cells 3afuels 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amethanol 3apermeability 3apoisoning 3apotassium hydroxide 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal stability 3awater uptake 0aAnion exchange membranes 0aAzide-assisted 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aQuaternized polysulfone 0aCrosslinking1 aMiao, Luyang1 aZhao, Yanxu1 aLü, Changli0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 May 15, v. 530 p.84-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004800168300001800216520159500234592002801829650001301857650001201870650002001882650001701902650001601919650001001935650002101945650002401966650002201990650002002012650001502032700001402047700001802061700001402079773009802093856008102191852000902272655001202281IND60086507720221122032649.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008650772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2011.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScognamiglio, J.10aFragrance material review on anisyl alcohol  ap. S134-S139.  aA toxicologic and dermatologic review of anisyl alcohol when used as a fragrance ingredient is presented. Anisyl alcohol is a member of the fragrance structural group Aryl Alkyl Alcohols and is a primary alcohol. The AAAs are a structurally diverse class of fragrance ingredients that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl alcohols covalently bonded to an aryl (Ar) group, which may be either a substituted or unsubstituted benzene ring. The common structural element for the AAA fragrance ingredients is an alcohol group –C–(R1)(R2)OH and generically the AAA fragrances can be represented as an Ar–C–(R1)(R2)OH or Ar–Alkyl–C–(R1)(R2)OH group. This review contains a detailed summary of all available toxicology and dermatology papers that are related to this individual fragrance ingredient and is not intended as a stand-alone document. Available data for anisyl alcohol were evaluated then summarized and includes physical properties, acute toxicity, skin irritation, skin sensitization, elicitation, toxicokinetics, repeated dose, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity data. A safety assessment of the entire Aryl Alkyl Alcohols will be published simultaneously with this document; please refer to Belsito et al. (2012) for an overall assessment of the safe use of this material and all Aryl Alkyl Alcohols in fragrances.

Findings indicate that the increase in process temperature (300–600 °C) negatively impacted biochar yield while positively affected bio-oil and pyrolysis gas yield. The HHV, fixed carbon and fuel ratio of biochar was improved at higher pyrolysis temperature while energy yield decreased. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 500 °C, and it contains a high fraction of phenolic compounds (35.54%) followed by aromatics (23.01%). The concentration of H₂ (7.21–19.88%) and CH₄ (1.89–2.59%) and Py-gas heating value (4.98–7.89 MJ Nm⁻³) improved with an increase in process temperature. The pyrolysis system's energy (76.97–84.54%) and exergy efficiency (67.41–83.38%) were enhanced with process temperature, and the GRA optimization was attained at 600 °C. The sustainability index, environmental factor, and improvement potential positive impact the environment at a higher temperature. It is recommended to produce superior quality of biochar, bio-oil and Py-gas in the temperature range of 500–600 °C with minimal environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis juliflora 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aFuel ratio 0aEnergy and exergy efficiency 0aSustainability indicators1 aSakhiya, Anil Kumar1 aKaushal, Priyanka0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.538-551dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004600137040001800183100005900201245011000260300001600370506007600386506003100462520100200493592002801495596008801523506003701611650001201648650001201660650002601672650001501698650001801713650001301731650002201744650001401766650000701780650002701787650002601814650002101840650000901861650001301870650001801883653001301901653001301914653002501927653003801952653003901990700001802029700002002047773009102067856009002158856004502248961000902293852000902302655001202311IND60590714820221215143355.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059071482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1512doi7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1512chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakshi, Santanu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9708-803410aQuantification and characterization of chemically-and thermally-labile and recalcitrant biochar fractions  ap. 247-255.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe C:N ratios of biochar labile fractions is important for assessing biochar stability and N cycling in soil. Here we compare chemically and thermally labile fractions for nine biochars produced from five biomass feedstocks using four production techniques. Biochar fractionation methods included proximate analysis, hot water extraction, acid and base extractions (0.05 M, 0.5 M, 1 M, 2 M, 3 M, and 6 M of either H2SO4 or NaOH), and oxidation with 15% H2O2 and 0.33 M KMnO4 (pH 7.2). Results show chemical addition reactions cause underestimation of mass of the labile fraction for chemical extraction and oxidation procedures but not the thermal procedure. Estimates of C and N in labile and recalcitrant fractions were not adversely affected by addition reactions, because solvents were independent of C or N. Results indicate that herbaceous biochars may be a source of N fertility while hardwood biochars may immobilize N during the first few years after biochar application to soils.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afeedstocks 3afractionation 3ahardwood 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium permanganate 3aproximate composition 3asodium hydroxide 3asoil 3asolvents 3asulfuric acid 0aLabile C 0aLabile N 0aC:N ratio of biochar 0aThermally-labile biochar fraction 0aChemically-labile biochar fraction1 aBanik, Chumki1 aLaird, David A.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 194 p.247-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1513Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5907148  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010600167300001400273520197300287592002802260650002502288650002902313650001802342650001202360650000902372650001502381650001102396650002102407650001902428650001502447650002502462650001702487650002302504653003202527653001502559653002102574653002302595653002902618653002802647653002202675653002902697700002302726700002002749773011302769856007802882852000902960655001202969IND60485919020221119110429.0160218e20150821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048591902DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2015-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiziński, Tadeusz10aApplication of CVM method in the evaluation of flood control and water and sewage management projects  ap. 41-49.  aTraditional methods of economic evaluation of projects in the field of environmental protection do not reflect the full value of these projects. In particular, it doesn’t take into account non-market effects that have an impact on the level of social welfare. The issue of valuation of natural resources and related services is also related to this problem. The evaluations and valuations of areas generally ignored the value of natural resources or take into account only the part which has the market value.The article presents the results of study the economy of non-market goods using contingent valuation method. The first part of the results concerns the willingness to pay for improvement of safety sense from flood risk. The second part concerns willingness to pay for the use of municipal sewage treatment plants. The population living of the area of the Żuławy of Vistula delta valued their improvement of safety sense from flood risk of at more than twice the value of the compared to current expenditures incurred flood protection. The vast majority of respondents considered it reasonable protection of polder areas. Indicating simultaneously that in the reduction of flood risk allows possible resettlement and restoration polder parts. The majority of residents (98%) agreed to the construction of wastewater treatment plants and were willing to pay for its construction and operation. The majority of respondents (especially those in middle age and older) found that the collective sewage development would contribute to improving the environment quality and thus the residents living standard. However, not all were willing to pay for the use of collective sewage collection and treatment. 18% of respondents did not want to pay an amount greater than the current charges for the sewage removal and treatment. In addition, the residents of the municipality cannot afford to pay, or believe that water supply and sanitation services should be free.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3aenvironmental protection 3aflood control 3amarkets 3arisk 3asanitation 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asocial welfare 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater supply 3awillingness to pay 0acontingent valuation method 0aflood risk 0asewage treatment 0awillingness to pay 0ametoda wyceny warunkowej 0aodprowadzenie ścieków 0aryzyko powodziowe 0askłonność do zapłaty1 aWróblewska, Anna,1 aRauba, Krystyna0 tJournal of water and land development.g2015 Aug. 21, v. 24, no. 1 p.41-49dDe Gruyter Openx2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2015-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010100167520146600268592002801734650001801762650002101780650001601801650001001817650001901827650001101846650001301857650001501870650002501885650001001910700002401920700002101944700002701965700002301992700002302015700002202038700003202060773011902092856007402211852000902285655001202294IND60763617220221120101713.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076361722DNAL7 a10.3390/w140201402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlazaiza, Motasem Y. D.10aApplication of Natural Coagulants for Pharmaceutical Removal from Water and Wastewater: A Review  aPharmaceutical contamination threatens both humans and the environment, and several technologies have been adapted for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The coagulation-flocculation process demonstrates a feasible solution for pharmaceutical removal. However, the chemical coagulation process has its drawbacks, such as excessive and toxic sludge production and high production cost. To overcome these shortcomings, the feasibility of natural-based coagulants, due to their biodegradability, safety, and availability, has been investigated by several researchers. This review presented the recent advances of using natural coagulants for pharmaceutical compound removal from aqueous solutions. The main mechanisms of natural coagulants for pharmaceutical removal from water and wastewater are charge neutralization and polymer bridges. Natural coagulants extracted from plants are more commonly investigated than those extracted from animals due to their affordability. Natural coagulants are competitive in terms of their performance and environmental sustainability. Developing a reliable extraction method is required, and therefore further investigation is essential to obtain a complete insight regarding the performance and the effect of environmental factors during pharmaceutical removal by natural coagulants. Finally, the indirect application of natural coagulants is an essential step for implementing green water and wastewater treatment technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3abiodegradability 3acoagulation 3adrugs 3aneutralization 3asludge 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater1 aAlbahnasawi, Ahmed 1 aAli, Gomaa A.

The objective of the research covered herein is a comparison study between two liquid fuels, a biodiesel (in a pure form) and the biodiesel as a saturated mixture with a pyrolysis by-product; these two fuels were compared against a standard kerosene as a baseline. The research methodology involved two stages: firstly atomization patterns and injection regimes were obtained using a high speed imaging method, secondly a combustion test campaign was undertaken using a swirl burner to quantify the operational behaviour, species production and exhaust gas compositions of the fuels. Emissions, flame stability trends and power outputs were measured at gas turbine relevant equivalence ratios. Excess oxygen and atomization trends in the biodiesel seem to be playing a major role in the production of emissions and flame stability when compared to kerosene. Also, heavy organics seem to be acting as catalytic substances for OH production close to the burner mouth. In terms of stability and combustion, it is proposed that the saturated blend would be a viable candidate for power generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3abiodiesel 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aimage analysis 3akerosene 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apower generation 3apyrolysis 3aresearch methods 3aturbines 0aAtomization 0aCombustion 0aGas turbine 0aBiodiesel1 aValera-Medina, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1580-71331 aRunyon, J.1 aGiles, A.1 aPugh, D.1 aMarsh, R.1 aCerone, N.1 aZimbardi, F.1 aValerio, V.0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Dec., v. 99 p.443-451dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03972naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245014400202300002000346520198900366592002802355596009402383596009402477596009402571650001502665650002102680650001302701650002302714650001602737650002802753650002402781650001502805650002102820650001602841650001302857650001302870650001902883650001102902650001902913650001502932650001502947650001802962650000902980653002502989653001703014653003003031653002203061700002103083700005503104700001603159773014303175856007903318852000903397655001203406IND60793793120221121234329.0220921e20220909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c117242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, Chih-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2258-245410aFlexible Hybrid Electronics Nanofiber Electrodes with Excellent Stretchability and Highly Stable Electrical Conductivity for Smart Clothing  ap. 42441-42453.  aIn this paper, a side-by-side, dual-nozzle electrospinning process was used to prepare a flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) material with excellent stretchable properties. A highly stable electrical conductivity was also imparted to the resulting membrane electrodes using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and carbon-based nanomaterials of different structures. The AgNP/carbon-based nanomaterials were coated onto bicomponent polymer nanofibers (composed of polyurethane (PU) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)) on the nanofiber membrane. The FHE nanofiber electrodes were finally integrated into clothing designed to accurately measure human body sensing signals (e.g., electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals). To effectively increase the high electrical conductivity, a polymer-type dispersant (polyisobutylene-b-poly(oxyethylene)-b-polyisobutylene, a triblock copolymer) was used to effectively and stably disperse AgNPs with different particle sizes and carbon-based nanomaterials with different geometric dimensions (e.g., zero-dimensional carbon black, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional graphene) through non-covalent adsorption. Moreover, the bicomponent PVDF–PU nanofibers were immersed in a mixed dispersant of AgNPs and carbon-based nanomaterials at low concentrations, and thermal post-treatment was conducted to improve the electrical conductivity. The AgNP/graphene oxide (GO) nanofiber electrode exhibited a continuous phase with a stable material microstructure after 5000 repetitions of 50% tension–tension fatigue testing. The waveform pattern obtained from the proposed AgNP/GO nanofiber electrode was compared with those of traditional ECG and EMG electrodes. The nanofiber web electrode treated with organic/inorganic mixed dispersants and verified via tests of its electrical and fatigue properties was found to be suitable for long-term ECG and EMG monitoring, and it has excellent potential in wearable smart sensors.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3aclothing 3acomposite polymers 3adispersants 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrocardiography 3aelectrodes 3aelectromyography 3aelectronics 3ageometry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3apolyurethanes 3asoot 0asilver nanoparticles 0apolyurethane 0apolyvinylidene difluoride 0aelectrocardiogram1 aHuang, Chen-Yang1 aLi, Jia-Wun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5033-28291 aLi, Jialin,0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 09, v. 14, no. 37 p.42441-42453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c117243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011700179300001400296520177300310592002802083650001802111650001102129650001402140650001402154650002102168650001402189650002302203650001902226650001302245650001102258650001902269650001402288650002202302650002002324650001602344650001602360650001002376650001502386651001102401653002002412653002002432653001302452653001502465653001702480653001302497700002302510700002302533700002002556700002002576700001902596700002402615773009902639856008502738852000902823655001202832IND60598118920221117103536.0201202e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059811892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2018.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez A., Cristian E.,10aRelevance of using whole-ring stable isotopes of black spruce trees in the perspective of climate reconstruction  ap. 64-69.  aStudies in dendroisotope chemistry suggested that latewood cellulose contains better climatic records than whole-ring cellulose. However, this approach has never been tested on northeastern Canadian spruce trees. This study compares dendroisotopic series of cellulose from late and whole ring, and analyses their statistical relationships with hydro-climatic variables with the aim of selecting the best suited protocol for future hydro-climatic reconstruction in the downstream sector of Churchill River basin of Labrador, Canada. To this end, δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O series from latewood (LW) and whole ring (WR) α-cellulose of black spruce trees (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) were produced for the 1940–2010 period. The results show strong correlations between LW and WR isotopic series suggesting that there are no important variation in the isotopic ratios during the growing year and that black spruce trees use photosynthates of the current growing season to form their earlywood. Moreover, LW and WR δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O show similar relationships with both maximum temperature (Tₘₐₓ) and Churchill River discharge. Correlations are higher when combining δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O for LW and WR. Overall, those correlations support the indirect relationship between tree-ring isotopic series and river discharge, as they are integrators of several climatic variables and derived parameters (Tₘₐₓ, relative humidity, evapotranspiration, etc.). The LW and WR isotopic series give similar statistical relationships with hydro-climatic variables, and the WR treatment is faster (separation easier compared to LW). Thus, for black spruce the use of combined isotopic series in WR can be favored over LW for hydro-climatic reconstruction in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3acarbon 3acellulose 3achemistry 3aclimatic factors 3aearlywood 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3alatewood 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthates 3aprotocols 3arelative humidity 3astable isotopes 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atrees 3awatersheds 3aCanada 0aCarbon isotopes 0aOxygen isotopes 0aLatewood 0aWhole ring 0aBlack spruce 0aLabrador1 aBégin, Christian,1 aSavard, Martine M.1 aDinis, Lauriane1 aMarion, Joëlle1 aSmirnoff, Anna1 aBégin, Y.q(Yves),0 tDendrochronologia.g2018 Aug., v. 50 p.64-69dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2018.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011200173300002000285520164900305592002801954596009401982650001802076650002102094650002802115650002202143650001102165650002202176650001402198650001802212650001302230650001702243650001202260651001002272700002602282700006102308773015402369856008302523852000902606655001202615IND60763788620221120050751.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076378862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16129-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiṃha, Śailendra,10aAnalysis of Critical Success Factors to Design E-waste Collection Policy in India: A Fuzzy DEMATEL Approach  ap. 10585-10604.  aThe design of an e-waste collection policy is challenging, especially for a country like India, where the economy is a developing state, and there is a large diversity in socio-economic factors. The e-waste collection policy impacts the various stakeholders such as the manufacturer, the raw material producers, the assemblers, the retailers, the generator (households and bulk consumers), the scrap dealers, the smelters, the recyclers, and the regulators. The design of an e-waste collection policy needs to consider the appropriate set of Critical Success Factors (CSFs), which will maximise the e-waste collection providing business sustainability to the stakeholders while satisfying the environmental regulations in the operating locations. Twenty-three CSFs identified and categorised in six implication dimensions for the e-waste collection policy framework based on a literature survey and experts committee view. The fuzzy DEMATEL approach is employed to analyse the CSFs to design an e-waste collection policy in India from a comprehensive perspective. Cause and effect interrelationship is established among the CSFs, and also their impacts are evaluated to segregate the CSFs into cause group (prominent influencing and independent) and effect group (influenced and dependent). The CSFs such as technology involvement, green practices, environmental program, certification and licensing, public ethics and stakeholder's awareness for circular economy are prominent influencing CSFs for e-waste collection policy in India. The current study is expected to provide a platform for policymakers to design the e-waste collection policy.  aPublisher supplied data  aP 7(3) Vpro/R&D/2016/3262.cDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of Rajasthan 3acertification 3acircular economy 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectronic wastes 3aethics 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3araw materials 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aDasgupta, Mani Sankar1 aRoutroy, Srikanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4592-00090 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 7 p.10585-10604dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16129-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168300001600256520160800272592002801880650002001908650001701928650001501945650001201960650001901972650002001991650002302011650002602034650002802060650001502088653003202103653002402135653002502159653002502184653002902209653002702238700002502265700002002290700002602310700001802336700002002354700002402374700001902398700002102417700002502438700006002463773011402523856008502637852000902722655001202731IND60625071720221119082555.0190206e20190222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062507172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriskot, Till10aPrediction uncertainty assessment of chromatography models using Bayesian inference  ap. 101-110.  aMechanistic modeling of chromatography has been around in academia for decades and has gained increased support in pharmaceutical companies in recent years. Despite the large number of published successful applications, process development in the pharmaceutical industry today still does not fully benefit from a systematic mechanistic model-based approach. The hesitation on the part of industry to systematically apply mechanistic models can often be attributed to the absence of a general approach for determining if a model is qualified to support decision making in process development.In this work a Bayesian framework for the calibration and quality assessment of mechanistic chromatography models is introduced. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to assess parameter uncertainty by generating samples from the parameter posterior distribution. Once the parameter posterior distribution has been estimated, it can be used to propagate the parameter uncertainty to model predictions, allowing a prediction-based uncertainty assessment of the model. The benefit of this uncertainty assessment is demonstrated using the example of a mechanistic model describing the separation of an antibody from its impurities on a strong cation exchanger. The mechanistic model was calibrated at moderate column load density and used to make extrapolations at high load conditions. Using the Bayesian framework, it could be shown that despite significant parameter uncertainty, the model can extrapolate beyond observed process conditions with high accuracy and is qualified to support process development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aantibodies 3acations 3achromatography 3adecision making 3amechanistic models 3aparameter uncertainty 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprediction 0aIon-exchange chromatography 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aMechanistic modeling 0aParameter estimation 0aMarkov Chain Monte Carlo 0aPrediction uncertainty1 aStückler, Ferdinand1 aWittkopp, Felix1 aWilliams, Christopher1 aYang, Jessica1 aKonrad, Susanne1 aDoninger, Katharina1 aGriesbach, Jan1 aBennecke, Moritz1 aHepbildikler, Stefan1 aHubbuch, Jürgen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6258-41260 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Feb. 22, v. 1587 p.101-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009600166300001800262520145800280592002801738650001501766650001601781650001201797650001501809650001401824650001501838650001301853650002001866650001901886650001301905651001801918700002001936700002001956700003101976700001802007700002002025700002202045773014502067856007402212852000902286655001202295IND60662024020221117024739.0190904e20111102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066202402DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10553a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuchalski, Melissa A.10aPassive ammonia monitoring in the United States: Comparing three different sampling devices  ap. 3156-3167.  aThe need for ambient gaseous ammonia (NH₃) measurements has increased in the last decade as reactive NH₃ concentrations and deposition fluxes show little change even with tightening standards on nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) emissions. Currently, there are several networks developing methods for adding NH₃ measurements in the U.S. Gaseous NH₃ measurements will provide scientists and policymakers data which can be used to estimate ecosystem inputs, validate air quality models including trends and regional variability, and evaluate changes to the environment based on additional emission reduction requirements and estimates of critical nitrogen load exceedances. The passive samplers described in this paper were deployed in duplicate or triplicate and collocated with annular denuders or continuous instruments to determine their accuracy. The samplers assessed included the Adapted Low-Cost Passive High Absorption (ALPHA), Radiello®, and Ogawa passive samplers. The median relative percent differences (MRPD) between the reference method and passive samplers for the ALPHA, Radiello® and Ogawa were −2.4%, −37% and −44%, respectively. The precision between duplicate samplers for the ALPHA and Ogawa samplers, was 7% and 6%, respectively. Triplicate Radiello® precision was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV for the Radiello® samplers was 10%.

We have synthesized and studied a new amphiphilic ABA-type triblock copolymer whose hydrophobic middle block contains two types of stimuli-sensitive functionalities regularly and repeatedly positioned in the main chain. Using a two-step click chemistry approach, disulfide and o-nitrobenzyle methyl ester groups are inserted into the main chain, which react to reducing agents and light, respectively. With the end blocks being poly(ethylene oxide), micelles formed by this BCP possess a core that can be disintegrated either rapidly via photocleavage of o-nitrobenzyl methyl esters or slowly through cleavage of disulfide groups by a reducing agent in the micellar solution. This feature makes possible either burst release of an encapsulated hydrophobic species from disintegrated micelles by UV light, or slow release by the action of a reducing agent, or release with combined fast-slow rate profiles using the two stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aencapsulation 3aesters 3aethylene oxide 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3apolyethylene glycol 3areducing agents 3aultraviolet radiation1 aTong, Xia1 aZhao, Yue0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 07, v. 28, no. 5 p.2327-2331dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla204930n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245020000159300001600359520159400375592002801969650003301997650001602030650001702046650002102063650001602084650001402100650001602114650001602130650002402146650002702170650001602197650002802213650001802241650001702259650001602276650002102292650001002313650001802323650000902341650004302350650001202393650001702405650001302422650002502435650002102460650003202481653001602513653003302529653002502562653002102587653003702608653001902645700001402664700002002678773011002698856007902808852000902887655001202896IND60523190220221117225959.0160607e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052319022DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2015.36042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Jihye10aHepatoprotective Effects of Soybean Embryo by Enhancing Adiponectin-Mediated AMP-Activated Protein Kinase α Pathway in High-Fat and High-Cholesterol Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  ap. 549-559.  aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by >5% deposition of triglycerides in hepatocytes, is often referred as a major risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of whole soybean embryos containing bioactive substances such as isoflavones and soyasaponins. For this study, mice were randomly allocated into four groups that were fed different diets for 10 weeks: normal diets and high-fat and high-cholesterol diets (HD), and HD with 10% or 20% soybean embryo powder (10SE-HD and 20SE-HD). Hepatic superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity of the experimental groups increased during the period of the study (P < .05). Hepatic mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor α, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, and Caspase 3 were decreased when soybean embryos were increased in the mice's diets. Both of the soybean embryo-treated groups showed significantly decreased serum and liver triglyceride and total cholesterol. Adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and apolipoprotein B mRNA expressions were decreased in the mice that were fed soybean embryos. We suggest that the regular supplementation of soybean embryos might be a useful treatment for preventing NAFLD and associated complications through upregulation of adiponectin-mediated AMPKα pathway parameters, which are implicated in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid metabolism activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aadiponectin 3aantioxidants 3aapolipoprotein B 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acholesterol 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertension 3aisoflavones 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3arisk factors 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aadiponectin 0aAMP-activated protein kinase 0aantioxidant activity 0alipid metabolism 0anonalcoholic fatty liver disease 0asoybean embryo1 aKim, Sera1 aKim, Hyun Sook,0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2016 June 01, v. 19, no. 6 p.549-559dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2015.36043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245010600202300001800308520046900326592002800795650002300823650002300846650002300869650001300892700001800905700001400923700001800937773013400955856007401089852000901163655001201172IND60638759720221120195733.0190430e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063875972DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc01990k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuThese authors contributed equally to this work., Weitao10aNanoscale mapping of intrinsic defects in single-layer graphene using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy  ap. 8227-8230.  aNon-gap mode tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is used for the first time to successfully map the intrinsic defects in single-layer graphene with 20 nm spatial resolution.

Although shale oxidant stimulation can dissolve unstable composition to enhance permeability, the shale-fluids interaction during this stimulation process is still not yet clear. In this study, the organic-rich shale collected from the Cambrian Shuijingtuo Formation of Yichang, Hubei province, China was selected to react with three oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and sodium persulfate (Na₂S₂O₈) at formation temperature. Variation of water chemistry, mineral composition and micromorphology were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of shale oxidative dissolution and evaluate its influence on shale permeability enhancement. Results showed that pyrite and OM can be discrepantly oxidized with different oxidants. At the same oxidation duration, the acidic environment was beneficial for carbonate dissolution, while the alkaline environment was favorable to the dissolution of dolomite and tectosilicate minerals such as quartz, albite, illite and chlorite. Nevertheless, the serious thermal decomposition of H₂O₂, precipitation of gypsum and ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃) occurred during shale-fluids interaction at formation temperature might impede the enhancement of shale permeability. The oxidative dissolution of shale also brought about the release of trace elements, which might result in groundwater pollution. For the in-situ application of shale oxidative dissolution, difficulties such as thermal decomposition, secondary minerals precipitation and possible groundwater pollution should be considered further in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3acarbonates 3adolomite 3aferric hydroxide 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater contamination 3agypsum 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aillite 3amicrostructure 3amineral content 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3apyrite 3aquartz 3ashale 3ashale gas 3asodium 3asodium hypochlorite 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atrace elements 3aChina 0aOrganic matter 0aOxidative dissolution 0aWater chemistry1 aYang, Sen1 aLiu, Danqing1 aYang, Cong1 aYang, Zhe1 aLi, Hai1 aTang, Zhi0 tApplied geochemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 113 p.104503-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1045033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007500157300001800232520123500250592002801485650001201513650001101525650001901536650002101555650001701576650001401593650001801607650001201625650001801637650001701655650001701672650001201689650001701701650003701718700003601755700002101791773009801812856007501910852000901985655001201994IND60576698320221120051003.0170806e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057669832DNAL7 a10.1021/la204991n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaliva, Maria10aMicroporous Polystyrene Particles for Selective Carbon Dioxide Capture  ap. 2690-2695.  aThis study presents the synthesis of microporous polystyrene particles and the potential use of these materials in CO₂ capture for biogas purification. Highly cross-linked polystyrene particles are synthesized by the emulsion copolymerization of styrene (St) and divinylbenzene (DVB) in water. The cross-link density of the polymer is varied by altering the St/DVB molar ratio. The size and the morphology of the particles are characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Following supercritical point drying with carbon dioxide or lyophilization from benzene, the polystyrene nanoparticles exhibit a significant surface area and permanent microporosity. The dried particles comprising 35 mol % St and 65 mol % DVB possess the largest surface area, ∼205 m²/g measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and ∼185 m²/g measured by the Dubinin–Radushkevich method, and a total pore volume of 1.10 cm³/g. Low pressure measurements suggest that the microporous polystyrene particles exhibit a good separation performance of CO₂ over CH₄, with separation factors in the range of ∼7–13 (268 K, CO₂/CH₄ = 5/95 gas mixture), which renders them attractive candidates for use in gas separation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acopolymerization 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3afreeze drying 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3apolystyrenes 3aporous media 3astyrene 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aArmatas, G.

In this approach, the turbine farm is represented by a turbine density function that specifies the number of turbines per unit area and an associated continuous locally-enhanced bottom friction field. The farm design question is formulated as a mathematical optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations and solved with efficient, gradient-based optimisation methods. The resulting method is accurate, computationally efficient, allows complex installation constraints, and supports different goal quantities such as to maximise power or profit. The outputs of the optimisation are the optimal number of turbines, their location within the farm, the overall farm profit, the farm's power extraction, and the installation cost.We demonstrate the capabilities of the method on a validated numerical model of the Pentland Firth, Scotland. We optimise the design of four tidal farms simultaneously, as well as individually, and study how farms in close proximity may impact upon one another.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afarms 3afriction 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3asystem optimization 3aturbines 3aScotland 0aMarine renewable energy 0aTidal stream turbines 0aOptimisation 0aShallow water equations 0aResource assessment 0aPentland Firth1 aKramer, S.C.1 aPiggott, M.D.0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Dec., v. 99 p.1046-1061dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245018200169300002000351520141200371592002801783650000801811650001601819650002001835650001201855650000901867650000901876650002901885650002201914650001301936650001901949650002601968650003301994650001302027650000902040650001402049651001002063700005802073773015402131856008302285852000902368655001202377IND60763788920221120050633.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076378892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16153-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Sharfaa10aBiomonitoring of metallic air pollutants in unique habitations of the Brahmaputra Valley using moss species—Atrichum angustatum: spatiotemporal deposition patterns and sources  ap. 10617-10634.  aIn this paper, we have evaluated the bioaccumulation of metals by Atrichum angustatum, which is a readily available moss species in the Brahmaputra valley, India. A systematic investigation of metallic pollutants in the atmosphere was carried out using A. angustatum as a biomonitor collected from representative locations during three seasons viz. winter, pre-monsoon, and monsoon (n = 99) during the year 2018. The study was done in four unique habitations of the Brahmaputra Valley, which were further divided into three landuse areas: residential, roadside, and industrial. The highest accumulations were seen against Ca, Mg, Zn, and Fe. The calculated contaminant factors and ecological risk indices suggest that the Brahmaputra Valley is mostly contaminated by Cr, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Pb, and these metals pose a maximum ecological risk. The accumulation trend of metallic pollutants was site-specific, but most metals showed positive seasonal accumulation. A significant difference in spatial and seasonal accumulation patterns was specific to metal species. Principal component analysis (PCA) and inter-species correlations revealed that the air quality of Brahmaputra valley was greatly affected by coal burning, vehicular emission, biomass burning, road dust, and crustal dust. Finally, the study led us to the conclusion that A. angustatum can serve as a potential biomonitor for metallic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass 3acoal 3adust 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aindicator species 3aland use 3amonsoon season 3amosses and liverworts 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3aroadsides 3aIndia1 aHoque, Raza R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6375-94310 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 7 p.10617-10634dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16153-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245011900200520109700319592002801416596001001444596002401454596006301478650001801541650002001559650001301579650001201592650001101604650001501615650002201630650001201652650001301664650001501677650001201692650001301704651001101717700007101728700002301799773011701822856007701939852000902016655001202025IND60758531420221120054812.0211130e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075853142DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/88606432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutesi, Fatuma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6476-080510aExtent and Rate of Deforestation and Forest Degradation (1986–2016) in West Bugwe Central Forest Reserve, Uganda  aUnderstanding the extent of land cover change and the forces behind land cover changes is essential in designing appropriate restoration strategies. Land cover changes at local scales or the factors that lead to cover change have not been documented for much of Uganda. We undertook this study in West Bugwe Central Forest Reserve (WBCFR) to fill this gap. We used remote sensing to determine land cover changes for a 30-year period, 1986–2016, and an interview survey to investigate the drivers of these changes. Our results show that the forest in this reserve has declined extensively by over 82% from 1,682 ha to 311 ha corresponding to an average change of −1.18% per year. The wetland has also been extensively degraded. Both the forest and wetland have transitioned into shrub land. The key drivers that have been highlighted by the survey are poverty (86%), population growth (56%), and associated harvesting of woody products (86%) for subsistence and income generation. We conclude that the forest in WBCFR has been extensively and rapidly deforested and degraded by humans.  aPublisher supplied data  cNORAD  aUGA-13/0019cNORHED  aNS 511cUganda National Council for Science and Technology 3adeforestation 3aforest reserves 3aforestry 3aforests 3aincome 3aland cover 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3aresearch 3ashrublands 3asurveys 3awetlands 3aUganda1 aTabuti, John Robert Stephen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9024-91811 aMfitumukiza, David0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:J000000092x1687-93767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/88606433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100008400148245013800232300002000370520131800390592002801708650001101736650001701747650001001764650001101774650001201785650001601797650001301813650001701826650001001843650000701853650001301860650001401873650001301887700001801900700001901918700002201937700002001959700001601979700002401995773015402019856008302173852000902256655001202265IND60763789020221122032617.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076378902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16447-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, 
                              
                              Mahmood ul10aSustainable application of Cassia obovata–based chrysophanic acid as potential source of yellow natural colorant for textile dyeing  ap. 10740-10753.  aIn the current pandemic scenario, sustainable green products particularly antiviral, antioxidant, and antibacterial in nature are gaining worldwide fame in almost every walk of life. Cassia obovata (C. obovata) has been valorized as a source of yellow natural dye for nylon dyeing. For the isolation of dye extracts and for surface tuning, nylon fabrics were treated with microwave rays up to 10 min. For getting new shades with good to excellent fastness characteristics, sustainable bio-mordants in comparison with chemical mordants have been used at 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80°C. It has been found that for getting effective colorant yield, acidic extract should be exposed to MW ray treatment up to 6 min, and for getting improved fastness rating, bio-mordants have given excellent color characteristics. Statistical optimization of dyeing variable shows that application of 40 mL of C. obovata acidic extract of RE of 6 pH containing 3 g/100 mL of salt when employed at 55 °C for 45 min has given excellent results onto irradiated nylon fabric (RNF). It is inferred that Cassia obovata has an excellent potential for coloration of surface-modified fabrics, where the application of low amount of bio-mordants under statistical optimized conditions has made process more ecological, economical, and sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCassia 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3adyeing 3afabrics 3airradiation 3amordants 3anatural dyes 3anylon 3apH 3apandemic 3apollution 3aresearch1 aAdeel, Shahid1 aBatool, Fatima1 aAḥmad, Tanvīr,1 aTang, Ren-Cheng1 aAmin, Nimra1 aKhan, Shahid Rehman0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 7 p.10740-10753dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16447-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245008600204300002000290520102400310592002801334596009901362596010701461596010301568650002101671650001601692650002301708650002001731650002001751650002901771650001501800650001501815650002101830650001901851650003001870650001401900653002401914653001901938653001801957653003701975653001902012653002002031700006002051700002702111700001802138700006802156700001702224700006602241700005902307773014302366856007902509852000902588655001202597IND60793793420220921000000.0220921e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c118642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3085-779610aHyaluronan Brush-like Copolymers Promote CD44 Declustering in Breast Cancer Cells  ap. 41779-41789.  aWe report on the synthesis of hyaluronan (HA) brush-like copolymers and their application as antagonists of tumorigenic CD44-HA interactions. HA (4.8 kDa, ca. 24 saccharides) was grafted on 2-hydrohyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) by end-on oxime ligation. The obtained copolymers were compared with low and high molecular weight HA in terms of hydrolysis kinetics in the presence of hyaluronidase (isothermal titration calorimetry) and interactions with CD44 (surface plasmon resonance). The results evidenced that the high molecular weight HA and HA-g-HEMA have a much higher affinity to CD44 than low molecular weight HA. Additionally, slower enzymatic degradation was observed for the copolymer, making it an excellent candidate for active targeting of tumorigenic CD44-HA interactions. We, therefore, investigated the effect of the copolymer on cancer cell lines with different expression of CD44 and observed an efficient declustering of CD44 that is usually associated with reduction of metastasis and drug resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  aCEECIND/00814c, Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871  aPTDC/QUI-POL/28117/2017cFunda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871  aSFRH/BD/114847/2016cFunda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871 3abreast neoplasms 3acalorimetry 3acomposite polymers 3adrug resistance 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3ahydrolysis 3ametastasis 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atitration 0aend-on modification 0aoxime ligation 0ahyaluronidase 0aisothermal titration calorimetry 0acancer therapy 0aCD44 antagonist1 aValcarcel, Jesus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7336-40491 aSoares da Costa, Diana1 aGomes, Marisa1 aVázquez, José Antonio,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1122-47261 aReis, Rui L.1 aNovoa-Carballal, Ramon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0422-80481 aPashkuleva, Iva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6818-33740 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 14, no. 37 p.41779-41789dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c118643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011500164300001800279520135000297592002801647650001601675650001501691650001901706650001301725650001301738650002301751700001801774700001701792700005301809700001301862773013601875856008102011852000902092655001202101IND60772141020221121071203.0220331e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077214102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c098342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaojie10aEffect of Transition Metal and Nitrogen Co-Doping on Quantum Capacitance of Silicene-Based Electrode Materials  ap. 5682-5690.  aExploring 2D electrode materials with high quantum capacitance (CQ) is particularly important to improve the energy density of electrical double-layer capacitors. Generally, the structure and composition of materials determine their capacitance characteristics. In this paper, the effects of co-doping of N and transition metal (TM = Sc–Zn) atoms on the structure, stability, electronic, and capacitive properties of silicene were studied by first-principles calculation. Our results show that the co-doped TMNₓ–Si systems, especially TMN₃–Si, are more stable than the silicene system doped with N or TM atoms. TMNₓ–Si systems have more advantages than single-doped silicene and co-doped graphene in improving CQ and surface charge density (Q). Among all TMNₓ–Si systems studied, ScN₂–Si has the best CQ and Q performance, with maximum values 224.88 μF/cm² and 74.41 μC/cm², respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that the CQ and Q values of ScN₂–Si increase monotonically with the increase of doping concentration, but the bias position corresponding to the maximum CQ does not change and remains at −0.6 V, which is obviously better than the co-doped graphene system. In the studied systems, except Sc and Ti, the CQ and Q values of TMN₃–Si are obviously higher than those of TMN₂–Si and TMN₁–Si.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3anitrogen 3aphysical chemistry1 aWang, Peixian1 aJin, Jiaming1 aSong, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3955-32491 aHe, Pimo0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 21, v. 126, no. 12 p.5682-5690dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c098343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010900167300001800276500002000294520156300314592002801877650002201905650002401927650001601951650001201967650004301979650002002022650001802042650001102060650001902071650001502090650001402105650001702119700002302136700002602159773013102185856007902316852000902395655001202404IND60588010820221119055301.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058801082DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.133732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido, José L.10aPigment variations in Emiliania huxleyi (CCMP370) as a response to changes in light intensity or quality  ap. 4412-4425.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany studies on photoacclimation examine the pigment responses to changes in light intensity, but variations in light climate in the aquatic environment are also related to changes in spectral composition. We have employed a high‐performance liquid chromatography method with improved resolution towards chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin‐related xanthophylls to examine the pigment composition of Emiliania huxleyi CCMP 370 under different light intensities and spectral qualities. To maintain its photosynthetic performance, E. huxleyi CCMP370 promotes drastic pigment changes that can be either the interconversion of pigments in pools with the same basic chromophoric structure (Fucoxanthin type or chlorophyll c type), or the ex novo synthesis (Diatoxanthin). These changes are linked either to variations in light quality (Fucoxanthin related xanthophylls) or in light intensity (chlorophyll c₃/Monovinyl chlorophyll c₃, Diadinoxanthin/Diatoxanthin, β,ɛ−carotene/ β,β‐carotene). Fucoxanthin and 19′‐hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin proportions were highly dependent on spectral conditions. Whereas Fucoxanthin dominated in green and red light, 19′‐hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin prevailed under blue spectral conditions. Our results suggest that the huge pigment diversity enhanced the photoacclimative capacities of E. huxleyi to efficiently perform under changing light environments. The ubiquity and success in the global ocean as well as the capacity of E. huxleyi to form large surface blooms might be associated to the plasticity described here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3aaquatic environment 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alight intensity 3alight quality 3aoceans 3aphotosynthesis 3aplasticity 3ared light 3axanthophylls1 aBrunet, Christophe1 aRodríguez, Francisco0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.4412-4425dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.133733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011300166300001600279520122700295592002801522650000801550650001901558650001601577650001701593650002301610650001701633650002101650650001001671650001701681650002201698650003101720700002101751700002501772700002201797773014201819856007401961852000902035655001202044IND60662024420221117024736.0190904e20120202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066202442DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10559k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheepers, Paul T.

Air samples were collected in an undisturbed setting on weekend days and in an occupied setting during teaching hours. In the first week PATUs were turned off and in the second week they were turned on. On weekend days PATUs reduced indoor levels of PM-10 by 87% in February and by 70% in June compared to weekend days when PATUs were turned off. On schooldays, indoor PM-10 was increased by 6% in February and reduced by 42% in June. For PM-2.5 reductions on weekend days were 89% in February and 80% in June. On school days PM-2.5 was increased by 15% in February and reduced by 83% in June. Turning on the PATUs reduced total VOC by 80% on weekend days and by 57% on school days (but not in June). No influence on formaldehyde, NO₂, O₃ and molds was observed. PATUs appeared to be less effective in removal of air pollutants when used in an occupied classroom compared to an unoccupied setting. Our study suggests that such devices should be tested in real-life settings to evaluate their influence on indoor air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair quality 3aair sampling 3aelementary schools 3aformaldehyde 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3avolatile organic compounds1 aCremers, Robbert1 avan Hout, Stef P.

The oxidation of reduced compounds dissolved in the venting fluids fuels primary production providing the basis for extensive life. Until recently studies of microbial vent communities have focused primarily on chemolithoautotrophic organisms. In our study, we targeted the change of microbial community compositions along mixing gradients, focusing on distribution and capabilities of heterotrophic microorganisms. Samples were retrieved from different venting areas within the Menez Gwen hydrothermal field, taken along mixing gradients, including diffuse fluid discharge points, their immediate surroundings and the buoyant parts of hydrothermal plumes. High throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and targeted metagenome analysis were combined with geochemical analyses. Close to diffuse venting orifices dominated by chemolithoautotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria, in areas where environmental conditions still supported chemolithoautotrophic processes, we detected microbial communities enriched for versatile heterotrophic Alpha‐ and Gammaproteobacteria. The potential for alkane degradation could be shown for several genera and yet uncultured clades. We propose that hotspots of chemolithoautotrophic life support a ‘belt’ of heterotrophic bacteria significantly different from the dominating oligotrophic microbiota of the deep sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3abacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3aepsilon-Proteobacteria 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3ahabitats 3aheterotrophs 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amixing 3aoxidation 3aprimary productivity 3aribosomal RNA 3atemperature1 aBach, Wolfgang1 aGirguis, Peter R.1 aGruber‐Vodicka, Harald R.1 aReeves, Eoghan P.1 aRichter, Michael1 aVidoudez, Charles1 aAmann, Rudolf1 aMeyerdierks, Anke0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.4348-4368dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.133043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168300001600282520071900298592002801017650002101045650002701066650002101093650002101114650001501135650001101150650001801161650001401179650001301193650001501206700001701221700001701238700001701255700001701272773010801289856008501397852000901482655001201491IND60087260920221122043932.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008726092DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61081-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhigang10aContinuous electrochemical oxidation of methyl orange waste water using a three-dimensional electrode reactor  ap.

The effluent path of the electrochemical cell was optimized, using the anode effluent instead of the top effluent, where the COD removal was increased to 93% and the corresponding energy consumption was decreased from 15.5 to 14.6 kW-hr/kg COD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amethyl orange 3aoxidation 3atitanium 3awastewater1 aWang, Feifei1 aLi, Yansheng1 aXu, Tianlong1 aZhu, Shaomin0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 June, v. 23S p.S70-S73dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61081-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010800169300001800277520080900295592002801104650001301132650001401145650001601159650001101175650002301186650001501209650001101224650003001235650003701265700002601302700001501328700001401343700002001357773012701377856008201504852000901586655001201595IND60567764420180615000000.0170425e20170330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056776442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b007692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaccin, Giovani M.10aComputational Modeling for the Ag Nanoparticle Coalescence Process: A Case of Surface Plasmon Resonance  ap. 7030-7036.  aMotivated by recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments on α-Ag₂WO₄, the coalescence process of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These Ag NPs are formed by irradiation of α-Ag₂WO₄ crystals by electrons from a TEM gun. This behavior can be considered as a clear example of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which Ag NP coalescence processes are controlled by dipole–dipole interaction forming larger clusters. The interactions between Ag NPs along the coalescence processes are studied using MD simulations with embedded atom method (EAM) effective potentials for Ag. With these choices of methods, coalescence is studied by addressing different scenarios for the interacting NPs, which all could possibly occur in experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3aelectrons 3airradiation 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSan-Miguel, Miguel A.1 aAndres, J.1 aLongo, E.1 ada Silva, E.

Likewise, mistletoes via input of nutrient-rich litter alter nutrient and water availability increasing environmental heterogeneity in semi-arid savanna. Despite this recognition, the influence of termitaria and mistletoe on soil properties and plant community have not been investigated together. We established eight 100 m² plots each on termitaria, under mistletoe-infected trees and in the surrounding savanna and examined the soil properties and the structure of Securinega virosa (Euphorbiaceae) and Euclea divinorum (Ebenaceae) in semi-arid savanna, southwest Zimbabwe. Soil properties significantly differed among the sampling sites (p = 0.001) with soils of increasing clay, soil moisture, pH and phosphorus, calcium and ammonium concentrations occurring on termite mounds. Soils under mistletoe-infected trees were associated with silt, organic matter, sodium, potassium, magnesium and nitrate and the surrounding savanna was associated with soils of increasing sand content. Plant structure also differed significantly between sites with greater basal area of both S. virosa and E. divinorum on termitaria relative to mistletoe-infected trees and the surrounding savanna. However, the stem density of S. virosa was greater under mistletoe-infected trees than on termitaria and in the surrounding savanna. Plant structural variables of individuals of the same species were affected by different soil properties across treatments. The major patterns showed that plant structure was influenced positively by soil moisture and nitrate and negatively by phosphorus on termitaria; positively by clay, soil moisture and ammonium and negatively by potassium under mistletoe-infected trees; and by phosphorus and calcium in the surrounding savanna. These findings show that soil properties, plant structure and their relationships differ between termitaria, mistletoe-infected trees and surrounding savanna, and these differences are suggested to increase heterogeneity in soil resources availability and vegetation structure in semi-arid savanna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuclea divinorum 3aorganic matter 3aclay 3atrees 3aphosphorus 3anutrients 3asoil resources 3aFlueggea virosa 3asoil heterogeneity 3asodium 3asavannas 3asilt 3avegetation structure 3aEuphorbiaceae 3atermite mounds 3acalcium 3apotassium 3aammonium 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3asand fraction 3aSantalales 3amagnesium 3apH 3astand basal area 3anitrates 3aZimbabwe 0aTermitaria 0aMistletoe 0aHeterogeneity 0aSavanna 0aVegetation structure1 aMaponga, Tsitsi S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9933-19151 aDube, Beauty1 aNzuma, Tendai M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8008-67341 aMuvengwi, Justice1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9117-18650 tActa oecologica.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.35-42dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013800165300001600303520064000319592002800959650001300987650003101000650001401031650001101045650001301056700001901069700002001088700002301108773010601131856004801237852000901285655001201294IND4468759020221118021242.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446875902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-011-0003-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovganko, N.

However, using a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, we found that the R3m phase persists from ambient pressure up to pressures of about 15.8 GPa, in contrast to previous reports. Neither was the B1 phase observed in a heating X-ray powder diffraction experiment. The spurious transformation from R3m to B1 is caused by changes to the compression ratio of lattice parameters in the R3m phase under high pressure/temperature. These findings provide insight into transitions of PCMs, relevant to other materials undergoing displacive transitions under high pressure/temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient pressure 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature1 aZhang, Junran1 aLin, Chuanlong1 aLi, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2290-11981 aPeng, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6501-51481 aLi, Gong1 aLi, Yanchun0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 28, v. 122, no. 50 p.28460-28465dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b065113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011000164300002000274520131700294592002801611596008001639596008501719596008501804596007101889596007101960650002802031650001802059650001702077650001802094650000902112650001202121650001302133650000702146650001602153650001102169653001402180653002902194653002502223653002002248653002802268700002002296700005602316700005902372700005802431700001502489700005902504700006002563700006902623700001602692700003002708700001802738700002602756700006302782773014302845856007902988852000903067655001203076IND60793793620220921000000.0220921e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c120292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Sing Yee10aReversible Self-Assembled Monolayers with Tunable Surface Dynamics for Controlling Cell Adhesion Behavior  ap. 41790-41799.  aCells adhering onto surfaces sense and respond to chemical and physical surface features. The control over cell adhesion behavior influences cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, which are important considerations in biomaterial design for cell culture, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Here, we report on a supramolecular-based approach to prepare reversible self-assembled monolayers (rSAMs) with tunable lateral mobility and dynamic control over surface composition to regulate cell adhesion behavior. These layers were prepared by incubating oxoacid-terminated thiol SAMs on gold in a pH 8 HEPES buffer solution containing different mole fractions of ω-(ethylene glycol)₂₋₄- and ω-(GRGDS)-, α-benzamidino bolaamphiphiles. Cell shape and morphology were influenced by the strength of the interactions between the amidine-functionalized amphiphiles and the oxoacid of the underlying SAMs. Dynamic control over surface composition, achieved by the addition of inert filler amphiphiles to the RGD-functionalized rSAMs, reversed the cell adhesion process. In summary, rSAMs featuring mobile bioactive ligands offer unique capabilities to influence and control cell adhesion behavior, suggesting a broad use in biomaterial design, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a757797cH2020 European Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010663  a658953cH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  a752604cH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  a2018-03872cVetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  a2018-04930cVetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359 3abiocompatible materials 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell movement 3agold 3aligands 3amedicine 3apH 3asurfactants 3athiols 0aECM mimic 0areversible cell adhesion 0adynamic multivalency 0acell modulation 0asupported lipid bilayer1 aSergeeva, Yulia1 aPan, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5187-796X1 aMittler, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8998-18771 aEderth, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1639-57351 aDam, Tommy1 aJonsson, Peter,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2994-80171 aEl-Schich, Zahra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0841-58041 aWingren, Anette Gjörloff1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2993-03541 aTillo, Adam1 aHsiung Mattisson, Sabrina1 aHolmqvist, Bo1 aStollenwerk, Maria M.1 aSellergren, Börje,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2392-33050 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 14, no. 37 p.41790-41799dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c120293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300001800268520166400286592002801950650001801978650001601996650001702012650002302029650002502052650001902077650001502096650001102111650001502122650002302137650002502160651001002185700002002195700001602215700001702231700001702248773014502265856007402410852000902484655001202493IND60662024520221117024656.0190904e20111102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066202452DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10560d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Junyu10aSite location optimization of regional air quality monitoring network in china: methodology and case study  ap. 3185-3195.  aRegional air quality monitoring networks (RAQMN) are urgently needed in China due to increasing regional air pollution in city clusters, arising from rapid economic development in recent decades. This paper proposes a methodological framework for site location optimization in designing a RAQMN adapting to air quality management practice in China. The framework utilizes synthetic assessment concentrations developed from simulated data from a regional air quality model in order to simplify the optimal process and to reduce costs. On the basis of analyzing various constraints such as cost and budget, terrain conditions, administrative district, population density and spatial coverage, the framework takes the maximum approximate degree as an optimization objective to achieve site location optimization of a RAQMN. An expert judgment approach was incorporated into the framework to help adjust initial optimization results in order to make the network more practical and representative. A case study was used to demonstrate the application of the framework, indicating that it is feasible to conduct site optimization for a RAQMN design in China. The effects of different combinations of primary and secondary pollutants on site location optimization were investigated. It is suggested that the network design considering both primary and secondary pollutants could better represent regional pollution characteristics and more extensively reflect temporal and spatial variations of regional air quality. The work shown in this study can be used as a reference to guide site location optimization of a RAQMN design in China or other regions of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic development 3aexpert opinion 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apopulation density 3asecondary pollutants 3aChina1 aFeng, Xiaoqiong1 aLiu, Panwei1 aZhong, Liuju1 aLai, Senchao0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 Nov. 2, v. 13, no. 11 p.3185-3195dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10560d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245012500207300001400332520141500346592002801761650001301789650001201802650000901814650002601823650002401849650001301873650001201886650001501898650001801913650001901931650002001950650001201970650002601982650001402008650002602022650002202048650002202070650001602092653001602108653001502124653002702139653001302166653001902179653001502198700005702213700001802270773009902288856008402387852000902471655001202480IND60598119420221117103117.0200210e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059811942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2018.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoud, Ellie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5494-588410aPlant community composition along a peatland margin follows alternate successional pathways after hydrologic disturbance  ap. 65-72.  aHydrological disturbances can alter the structure and function of ecosystems by changing plant species composition over time. Peatlands in the northern hemisphere are particularly sensitive to global change drivers related to soil water availability, such as drought and drainage, because of important ecohydrological feedbacks between species composition and water table position. Here, we examined the plant community structure and environmental drivers of species distributions over two growing seasons along a bog – margin gradient, pre- and post-disturbance by beaver activity. Pond drainage resulted in seasonal average water table depth 8–24 cm lower in the second season. Five plant communities corresponded to changes in water table depth and acidity: bog, poor fen, meadow, mudflat and pond. Plant cover increased in meadow and mudflat communities, decreased in the pond community and did not differ between years in bog and poor fen communities. Changes in species abundance between years showed signs of alternate successional pathways: one that favors Sphagnum moss and bog community expansion and another pathway that favors meadow and mudflat expansion. This study highlights the non-linear successional trajectory of plant communities with changes in water table depth, which has implications for land management goals that aim to conserve the ecological integrity of peatland ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aacidity 3abogs 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3adrainage 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aglobal change 3agrowing season 3aland management 3ameadows 3amosses and liverworts 3apeatlands 3aplant available water 3aplant communities 3aspecies abundance 3awater table 0aBeaver pond 0aBog margin 0aHydrologic disturbance 0aPeatland 0aSpecies shifts 0aSuccession1 aWatt, Caitlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8439-94631 aMoore, Tim R.0 tActa oecologica.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.65-72dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245018200161300001800343520105300361592002801414650001401442650002201456650001701478650001301495650001501508650001601523650001301539653003301552653001301585653002101598653003801619653001801657700001601675700001801691700001901709700001801728700001901746700005601765700001701821773013901838856007801977852000902055655001202064IND60631286120221119091727.0190220e20190128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063128612DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b204662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianfeng10aEnhanced Organic Photovoltaic Performance through Modulating Vertical Composition Distribution and Promoting Crystallinity of the Photoactive Layer by Diphenyl Sulfide Additives  ap. 7022-7029.  aTo understand the vertical phase separation in the bulk junction active layer of organic photovoltaic devices is essential for controlling the charge transfer behavior and achieving effective charge collection. Here, diphenyl sulfide (DPS) was introduced as a novel additive into the PTB7-Th:PC₇₁BM-based inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs), and the effect of additives on active blend films and photovoltaic characteristics was carefully studied. The results show that DPS could not only modulate the vertical composition distribution but also promote the ordered molecular packing of the photoactive layer, thus effectively improving exciton dissociation, charge transport, and collection, and thus exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of 9.7% with an improved fill factor (>70%) after using 3% DPS additive. The results show that the DPS solvent additive can effectively adjust the vertical phase distribution and crystallinity of blend films and improve the photovoltaic performance of the inverted organic photovoltaic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acrystal structure 3adissociation 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolar cells 3asolvents 0aorganic photovoltaic devices 0aadditive 0adiphenyl sulfide 0avertical composition distribution 0acrystallinity1 aWang, Yufei1 aLiang, Zezhou1 aWang, Ningning1 aTong, Junfeng1 aYang, Chunming1 aBao, Xichang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7325-75501 aXia, Yangjun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 28, v. 11, no. 7 p.7022-7029dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b204663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002200185245010600207300001600313520165700329592002801986650001702014650001902031650002102050650002102071650001402092650001802106650001302124650001402137650002102151650001102172650002202183650001302205650002102218650001402239650001402253650003502267650002202302700002102324773012702345856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60523888020221117220138.0160630e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052388802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-016-9750-02doi7 a10.1007/s11627-016-9750-02chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoothong, Sukalya10aOptimizing shoot culture media for Rubus germplasm: the effects of NH4 +, NO3 −, and total nitrogen  ap. 265-275.  aA mixture component design was applied to testing the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium nitrogen salts (NH₄NO₃ and KNO₃) in order to optimize growth medium nitrogen for shoot cultures of red raspberries and a range of Rubus germplasm. All other components were those of MS medium with 2.5× MS mesos (CaCl₂, MgSO₄, KH₂PO₄) nutrients developed in an earlier study. Eight red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) cultivars and one accession of Rubus odoratus L. were evaluated for overall quality, shoot length, proliferation, leaf characteristics, and physiological disorders after 9-wk growth on each treatment. Twelve Rubus genotypes were later tested with the five best treatments. The concentration of NO₃ ⁻ in the medium was the most significant factor for improved shoot quality for most cultivars. The effects of the two-component mixture (NH₄ ⁺ and K⁺) and interactions between the mixture components and NO₃ ⁻ were found in many growth responses. Combinations of intermediate or high NO₃ ⁻ (40–60 mM), and intermediate to high NH₄ ⁺ (30–45 mM) produced the best growth in most cultivars. The 2.5× mesos MS medium with standard MS nitrogen (20 mM NH₄ ⁺ and 40 mM NO₃ ⁻) produced significantly better growth for most genotypes than unmodified MS. Three other nitrogen treatments also improved shoot quality for many genotypes: lower NH₄ ⁺ with lower total nitrogen (10 mM NH₄ ⁺ and 40 mM NO₃ ⁻) or intermediate or high concentrations of both nitrogen components and higher total nitrogen (30 mM NH₄ ⁺ and 60 mM NO₃ ⁻; 45 mM NH₄ ⁺ and 60 mM NO₃ ⁻) than that of MS medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3aRubus odoratus 3aammonium nitrate 3acalcium chloride 3acultivars 3aculture media 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3amagnesium sulfate 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3apotassium 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3apotassium nitrate1 aReed, Barbara M.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2016 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.265-275dSpringer USwJournal:27215x1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-016-9750-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012900173300002000302520224600322592002802568650001602596650003402612650002302646650001102669650002502680650001702705650001902722650001102741650001602752650001102768650001102779650001202790650002302802650001302825650001102838700002702849700006302876700002602939700006102965773013803026856008003164852000903244655001203253IND60626288920190312000000.0181220e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062628892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b072882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, Cleverson A.

The selective fragmentation of a potential extreme ultraviolet resist, poly(4-(methacryloyloxy) phenyldimethylsulfoniumtriflate) (MAPDST), was examined using inner shell-polarized SR excitation. Selective bond dissociation processes were studied using a combination of carbon K-edge excitation, angle-resolved irradiation, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Detailed theoretical calculations carried out with the FEFF9 modeling program allowed the interpretation of all the observed experimental features. NEXAFS results indicated that the aromatic group of the polymer lies parallel to the substrate surface. FEFF9 theoretical calculations confirmed the origin of the splitting of the main C 1s → πC═C* resonances observed. The transition C 1s → παC═C* (285.3 eV) can be associated with the four internal carbons of the aromatic ring. The transition C 1s → πβC═C* (286.9 eV) was assigned to the carbon atoms attached to the oxygen and sulfur atoms. According to the theoretical calculations, the origin of the splitting is due to the different absolute energy of C 1s. The results showed a strong selective dissociation effect when the excitation energy was tuned to the C 1s → παC═C* transition and the electric field vector of the photon was perpendicular to the substrate plane (grazing angle). On the contrary, other transitions were in general less affected. When the SR irradiation angle changed from grazing to normal incidence, the intensity of the C 1s → πC═C* transitions was almost unaffected by 285.3 eV photons. The experimental results suggest that site-specific core excitation combined with the direction of the electric field vector of the incidence SR can efficiently control the localization of the photon energy to produce selective bond dissociation in MAPDST thin films. The results presented here can also be useful to guide new processing lithographic methods for extreme ultraviolet lithography using the polarization properties of light in ordered polymeric thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adissociation 3aelectric field 3aenergy 3airradiation 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphotons 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asulfur1 aBelmonte, Guilherme K.1 aSegala, Maximiliano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1583-28651 aGonsalves, Kenneth E.1 aWeibel, Daniel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9104-47910 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 122, no. 50 p.28619-28628dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b072883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009900162300001800261520118700279592002801466650001201494650001801506650001501524650001501539650002201554650001101576653002001587653002101607653002101628653002001649653003101669700006001700700001601760700001901776700001901795700001601814700005601830773013901886856007802025852000902103655001202112IND60631286220221119091508.0190220e20190123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063128622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b205092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen-Jing10aDifferent Protonic Species Affecting Proton Conductivity in Hollow Spherelike Polyoxometalates  ap. 7030-7036.  aPolyoxometalates (POMs), which possess strong acidity and chemical stability, are promising solid proton conductors and potential candidates for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications. To investigate how factors such as proton concentration and carrier affect the overall proton conduction, we have synthesized new compounds HImMo₁₃₂ (Im, imidazole), HMeImMo₁₃₂, ILMo₁₃₂, and TBAMo₁₃₂ with hollow structures and HImPMo₁₂ with a solid spherelike structure. These crystal models were prepared by encapsulating POM with organic molecules with different proton contents. Among them, the single-crystal sample of the hollow structure HImMo₁₃₂ containing more proton sources shows a high proton conductivity of 4.98 × 10–² S cm–¹, which was approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than that of the solid cluster HImPMo₁₂ with the same proton sources and 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of the proton-free organic cation-encapsulated giant ball TBAMo₁₃₂. This study provides a theoretical guidance toward designing and developing new-generation proton conductors and studying their performances at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aencapsulation 3afuel cells 3aimidazoles 3amaterials science 3amodels 0apolyoxometalate 0aproton conductor 0ahollow structure 0asingle crystals 0ainorganic−organic hybrid1 aDong, Long-Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9276-51011 aLi, Run-Han1 aChen, Yong-Jun1 aSun, Sheng-Nan1 aLi, Shun-Li1 aLan, Ya-Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2140-79800 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 23, v. 11, no. 7 p.7030-7036dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b205093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007900165300001500244520144500259592002801704650001601732650001101748650001301759650001401772650001101786650001301797650001501810650001301825650001901838650001901857700001401876773010701890856008501997852000902082655001202091IND60087261220221122043850.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008726122DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61068-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, S.W.10aProspects of DLC coating as environment friendly surface treatment process  ap. S8-S13.  aAfter first commercialization in 90's, the applications of diamond-like carbon (DLC) have been significantly expanded to tool, automobile parts, machineries and moulds to enhance wear and friction properties. Although DLC has many advantages like high hardness, low friction electrical insulating and chemical stability and has the possible market, its application in the field is still very limited due to the gaps of understanding between end-user and developer of its advantage of costing. Recently, one of the most popular issues in the surface modification is providing the long lasting super-hydrophilic or -hydrophobic properties on the material surface for the outdoor usage. A lot of material loss is caused due to water corrosion which has to do with the flow and contacts of water like fuel cell separator and air conditioner parts. The consequence of development of functional surface based on the hydrophilic or hydrophobic design for the important parts would be really helpful for materials to be cleaner and more energy effective. Here, we first reviewed the DLC technology and then examined the kind of surface modification as well as its merits and disadvantage. We also looked at how we can improve super-hydrophilic and super hydrophobic for the DLC coating layer as well as current status of technology and arts of DLC. In the end, we would like to suggest it as one of the environmental friendly industrial technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3afriction 3afuel cells 3ahardness 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity1 aKim, S.G.0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 June, v. 23S p.S8-S13dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61068-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012200169300001400291520197600305592002802281650001402309650001502323650001602338650001202354650002202366650001302388650002602401650002402427650001402451650001002465650001202475650001502487650002202502650001502524650001402539650002202553650002502575650002002600650002102620650002102641650002802662650002102690651001402711653002102725653002502746653003402771653001202805653001602817653002102833700002302854700002802877700002002905773009902925856008403024852000903108655001203117IND60598119720221117103615.0200210e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059811972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilardo, Gimena10aSoil arthropod composition differs between old-fields dominated by exotic plant species and remnant native grasslands  ap. 57-64.  aSecondary succession after agriculture abandonment (old-fields) is mostly dominated by exotic grass species. Non-native plant invasions may alter soil fauna, potentially inducing plant-soil feedbacks. Despite their importance in nutrient cycling and plant-soil interactions, meso and macrofauna received less attention than bacteria or fungi. Here we compared the composition of the soil arthropod community in native remnants and plant exotic-dominated old-fields grasslands in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. We sampled independent remnants and old-field grassland plots within a 100 km² agricultural landscape to test the hypothesis that the abundance of soil arthropod organisms is related to the quality of the plant biomass, whereas the diversity of the soil biota is related to plant species richness, resulting in a different soil biota composition because of differing plant communities. When compared to non-invaded remnant grasslands, soil activity and soil food-web characteristics of the old-fields sites included: 1. Higher total arthropod abundance, particularly of Isopoda, Pseudoescorpionida and Blattaria; 2. Lower abundance of Hymenoptera and Enthomobryomorpha (Collembola); 3. Lower diversity, and evenness, but similar richness of soil organisms orders; 4. Higher soil respiration rates and soil temperature; and 5. Higher total soil N and K⁺content, but lower soil P content. These results illustrate that soil arthropod composition can vary widely within grasslands patches depending on plant species composition. Also, the more diverse plant community of remnant grasslands supports a more diverse soil biota, although soil activity is slower. Our results support the strong linkage between plant community and soil arthropod composition and suggest that changes in soil biota composition might promote plant-soil feedback interactions inducing the persistence of these alternative grassland states in new agricultural human-modified landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlattodea 3aCollembola 3aHymenoptera 3aIsopoda 3aagricultural land 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aecological invasion 3afood webs 3afungi 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aintroduced plants 3alandscapes 3aphytomass 3aplant communities 3asecondary succession 3asoil arthropods 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil-plant interactions 3aspecies richness 3aArgentina 0aPampa grasslands 0aBiological invasions 0aSoil invertebrate composition 0aIsopods 0aHymenoptera 0aSoil respiration1 aTognetti, Pedro M.1 aGonzález-Arzac, Adelia1 aYahdjian, Laura0 tActa oecologica.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.57-64dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2018.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245021600162300001800378500002000396520154600416592002801962650001601990650001702006650001302023650000902036650001502045650002502060650001402085650001402099650003302113650001602146650001202162650000902174650001302183650001602196700001902212700001802231700002502249700001802274773013102292856007902423852000902502655001202511IND60588011320221119055150.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058801132DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.135342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYücel, Onur13aAn unexplored pathway for degradation of cholate requires a 7α‐hydroxysteroid dehydratase and contributes to a broad metabolic repertoire for the utilization of bile salts in Novosphingobium sp. strain Chol11  ap. 5187-5203.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBile salts such as cholate are surface‐active steroid compounds with functions for digestion and signaling in vertebrates. Upon excretion into soil and water bile salts are an electron‐ and carbon‐rich growth substrate for environmental bacteria. Degradation of bile salts proceeds via intermediates with a 3‐keto‐Δ¹,⁴‐diene structure of the steroid skeleton as shown for e.g. Pseudomonas spp. Recently, we isolated bacteria degrading cholate via intermediates with a 3‐keto‐7‐deoxy‐Δ⁴,⁶‐structure of the steroid skeleton suggesting the existence of a second pathway for cholate degradation. This potential new pathway was investigated with Novosphingobium sp. strain Chol11. A 7α‐hydroxysteroid dehydratase encoded by hsh2 was identified, which was required for the formation of 3‐keto‐7‐deoxy‐Δ⁴,⁶‐metabolites. A hsh2 deletion mutant could still grow with cholate but showed impaired growth. Cholate degradation of this mutant proceeded via 3‐keto‐Δ¹,⁴‐diene metabolites. Heterologous expression of Hsh2 in the bile salt‐degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain Chol1 led to the formation of a dead‐end steroid with a 3‐keto‐7‐deoxy‐Δ⁴,⁶‐diene structure. Hsh2 is the first steroid dehydratase with an important function in a metabolic pathway of bacteria that use bile salts as growth substrates. This pathway contributes to a broad metabolic repertoire of Novosphingobium strain Chol11 that may be advantageous in competition with other bile salt‐degrading bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3abile 3abile salts 3abiochemical pathways 3adigestion 3aexcretion 3aheterologous gene expression 3ametabolites 3amutants 3asoil 3asteroids 3avertebrates1 aDrees, Steffen1 aJagmann, Nina1 aPatschkowski, Thomas1 aPhilipp, Bodo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.5187-5203dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.135343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01029naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006000157520018100217592002800398650000900426650002100435650001000456700001700466700001900483700001800502700001700520773011900537856007400656852000900730655001200739IND60763618420221120111741.0220120e20220111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076361842DNAL7 a10.3390/w140202042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Naicheng 10aIntegrated Ecohydrological Models in Aquatic Ecosystems  aAs a critical component of the global environment, aquatic ecosystems support a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, invertebrates, plants, and fish [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3ahydrologic cycle 3awater1 aWang, Yixia 1 aWang, Yaochun 1 aCai, Qinghua 1 aOuyang, Wei 0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 11, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140202043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100009200148245011800240300002000358520148200378592002801860596006001888650001701948650001701965650001901982650001802001650002502019650001402044650001702058650003202075650001902107650001302126650002602139650002502165651001002190700002202200700002202222700002402244700002102268700003102289700002002320700001802340773015402358856008302512852000902595655001202604IND60763789820221120070041.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076378982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16453-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalafassi,

Among the wastewater treatment steps, disinfection has not been characterized for its potential MPs retention activity, although it has been reported that processes used to abate the bacterial load could also affect MPs concentration. For this reason, we evaluated the MPs concentration across the overall wastewater treatment process and before and after the disinfection step in four small/medium WWTPs located in the north of Italy. Most of the MPs found in the samples were fibers or fragments, smaller than 500 μm, mainly composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyethylene terephthalate. The retention efficiency at the outlets was higher than 94% in all the plants analyzed. More interestingly, the disinfection treatments adopted by the different WWTPs reduced MPs concentration from a minimum of 9.1% (UV treatment) to a maximum of 67.6% (chlorination), promoting a further increase of the overall retention efficiency of the WWTPs from 0.4 to 0.7%. Quantitatively, the disinfection contributes to the MPs reduction in the outlets by retaining 0.5–6.7 million MPs per day, in WWTPs that discharge 2.7–12 million MPs per day. The results of the present work underline the importance of a careful choice of the steps that constitute the wastewater treatment, including disinfection, in order to minimize MPs discharge into the natural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a335559/6 2019-1-RD–NanobiotechcJoint Research Centre 3achlorination 3adisinfection 3amicrobial load 3amicroplastics 3amunicipal wastewater 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3aresearch 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment 3aItaly1 aDi Cesare, Andrea1 aDi Nardo, Lorenzo1 aSabatino, Raffaella1 aValsesia, Andrea1 aFumagalli, Francesco Sirio1 aCorno, Gianluca1 aVolta, Pietro0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 7 p.10535-10546dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16453-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012200160300002000282520121800302592002801520650001301548650002001561650002301581650001501604650002401619650001101643650002201654700002101676700002301697700001601720700002001736773010101756856007501857852000901932655001201941IND60576699020221123033118.0170806e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057669902DNAL7 a10.1021/la30233752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYiapanis, George10aEffect of Substrate on the Mechanical Response and Adhesion of PEGylated Surfaces: Insights from All-Atom Simulations  ap. 17263-17272.  aResponsive surfaces show potential for many applications; however, the molecular mechanisms of their responsive behavior are often dependent on the nature and properties of the substrate and this dependence is not fully understood. We present a molecular dynamics study on the mechanical response of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafted on substrates of varying flexibility in “dry” conditions. Our in silico surface loading tests show that when PEG is grafted onto a hard substrate (silica), there is a significant reduction in adhesion to a solid surface, owing to augmented steric repulsions at the interface. However, when the same chains are tethered onto a soft substrate (polyester), interfacial adhesion is strengthened. We find that the deformable substrate allows significant rearrangement of the subsurface and grafted segments during loading. Asperities along the rough soft surface also provide free volume for the tethered chains to occupy, enabling them to carpet the surface and increasing the density at the interface. Our results explain the molecular basis of the mechanical response of PEG when grafted onto hard and soft substrates and provide a rationale for surface protection using PEG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aethylene glycol 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilica 3asimulation models1 aHenry, David J.,1 aMaclaughlin, Shane1 aEvans, Evan1 aYarovsky, Irene0 tLangmuir.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 28, no. 50 p.17263-17272dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30233753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245006400161300001600225500001100241520110200252592002801354650002201382650001701404650001601421650001501437650000901452650001901461650001601480650001201496650001201508651001401520700002001534773010501554856007301659852000901732655001201741IND60571817520221119185950.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057181752DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.128582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlik, Joseph R.10aBiogeographical homogeneity of Caribbean coral reef benthos  ap. 960-962.  aLETTER  aCaribbean reef benthic assemblages have been considered biogeographically homogeneous at regional scales, but this concept was recently challenged by Williams et al. (2015, Journal of Biogeography, 42, 1327–1335). These authors concluded that benthic assemblages exhibit considerable biogeographical variability at regional and smaller scales, that rugosity and wave exposure play key roles in structuring assemblages, and that homogenization has yet to occur at a regional scale. We reassess their conclusions using recently published benthic and fish surveys that targeted sites either protected from fishing or intensively overfished. For sponges, regional variation in assemblages is mostly attributable to the removal of chemically undefended species by sponge‐eating fishes at sites protected from overfishing. We maintain that Caribbean benthic assemblages are remarkably homogeneous when compared to reefs in other tropical regions, and were likely more homogeneous before the localized effects of intensive fishing resulted in top‐down ecosystem alterations in benthic assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3abiogeography 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3afish 3ahomogenization 3aoverfishing 3asurveys 3atropics 3aCaribbean1 aLoh, Tse‐Lynn0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Apr., v. 44, no. 4 p.960-962dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.128583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009400162300002000256520138300276592002801659650001101687650001901698650001401717650002301731650001101754650002101765650001501786650000901801650001301810650001301823650001201836650001101848650001101859650001401870650002301884650001301907650001101920700002701931700006101958700005602019773013802075856008002213852000902293655001202302IND60626289320221118200848.0181220e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062628932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b078872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Haiying10aGraphene-Supported Monometallic and Bimetallic Dimers for Electrochemical CO₂ Reduction  ap. 28629-28636.  aBimetallic catalysts are attractive alternatives to extend the parameter space that can be tuned for support interactions and catalytic performance. In this study, we have investigated the smallest bimetallic catalysts—dimers—supported on defective graphene for the electrochemical reduction of CO₂ to CH₄ based on a first-principles approach and the computational hydrogen electrode model. The monometallic and bimetallic dimers formed from Group 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt) and group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) elements are characterized by a positively charged anchoring atom occupying the vacancy site of graphene and a neutral or slightly negatively charged antenna atom sticking out from the graphene surface. The strong selective binding of these dimers ensures their high stability. Possible rate-limiting steps are identified from the full reaction pathways to generate CH₄. Overall, Pt₂, AgNi, Pd₂, and AgPt are the best candidates with the lowest overpotential values of 0.37, 0.69, 0.69, and 0.76 V, respectively. It is found that the alloy effect and the interaction with support help to optimize the property. These metallic dimers, however, retain nonmonotonous property relationships that give opportunity to go beyond scaling behavior and look for a few atom catalysts that have unique properties to reduce rate-limiting potentials and improve the catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amodels 3anickel 3apalladium 3aphysical chemistry 3aplatinum 3asilver1 aMorrissey, Christopher1 aCurtiss, Larry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8855-80061 aZapol, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0570-91690 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 122, no. 50 p.28629-28636dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b078873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008000156300001600236500002000252520189700272592002802169650002002197650001502217650001702232650002402249650001102273650002202284650001302306651001502319651002002334651001802354700002402372700002202396700001802418700002502436700001502461700002102476773010502497856007302602852000902675655001202684IND60571817620221119185747.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057181762DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.128982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupin, Julia10aBayesian estimation of the global biogeographical history of the Solanaceae  ap. 887-899.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The tomato family Solanaceae is distributed on all major continents except Antarctica and has its centre of diversity in South America. Its worldwide distribution suggests multiple long‐distance dispersals within and between the New and Old Worlds. Here, we apply maximum likelihood (ML) methods and newly developed biogeographical stochastic mapping (BSM) to infer the ancestral range of the family and to estimate the frequency of dispersal and vicariance events resulting in its present‐day distribution. LOCATION: Worldwide. METHODS: Building on a recently inferred megaphylogeny of Solanaceae, we conducted ML model fitting of a range of biogeographical models with the program ‘BioGeoBEARS’. We used the parameters from the best fitting model to estimate ancestral range probabilities and conduct stochastic mapping, from which we estimated the number and type of biogeographical events. RESULTS: Our best model supported South America as the ancestral area for the Solanaceae and its major clades. The BSM analyses showed that dispersal events, particularly range expansions, are the principal mode by which members of the family have spread beyond South America. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: For Solanaceae, South America is not only the family's current centre of diversity but also its ancestral range, and dispersal was the principal driver of range evolution. The most common dispersal patterns involved range expansions from South America into North and Central America, while dispersal in the reverse direction was less common. This directionality may be due to the early build‐up of species richness in South America, resulting in large pool of potential migrants. These results demonstrate the utility of BSM not only for estimating ancestral ranges but also in inferring the frequency, direction and timing of biogeographical events in a statistically rigorous framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSolanaceae 3abiogeography 3acenter of diversity 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atomatoes 3aAntarctica 3aCentral America 3aSouth America1 aMatzke, Nicholas J.1 aSärkinen, Tiina,1 aKnapp, Sandra1 aOlmstead, Richard G.1 aBohs, Lynn1 aSmith, Stacey D.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Apr., v. 44, no. 4 p.887-899dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.128983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245006700206300001800273520108600291592002801377650001601405650003701421650001201458650003601470650001601506650001701522650000901539650000901548650002401557650001401581650001401595650002201609653002201631653001401653653001501667653001601682653001601698653002101714700002201735700002101757700001901778700002401797700001801821700003001839700002401869700006301893700002201956773013901978856007802117852000902195655001202204IND60631286720190314000000.0190220e20190123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063128672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b206252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamed, Mai Hussein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8165-121610aTunable Magnetic Phases at Fe₃O₄/SrTiO₃ Oxide Interfaces  ap. 7576-7583.  aWe demonstrate the emergence and control of magnetic phases between magnetite (Fe₃O₄), a ferrimagnetic halfmetal, and SrTiO₃, a transparent nonmagnetic insulator considered the bedrock of oxide-based electronics. The Verwey transition (TV) was detected to persist from bulk-like down to ultrathin Fe₃O₄ films, decreasing from 117 ± 4 K (38 nm) to 25 ± 4 K (2 nm), respectively. Element-selective electronic and magnetic properties of the ultrathin films and buried interfaces are studied by angle-dependent hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism techniques. We observe a reduction of Fe²⁺ ions with decreasing film thickness, accompanied by an increase of Fe³⁺ ions in both tetrahedral and octahedral sites and conclude on the formation of a magnetically active ferrimagnetic 2 u.c. γ-Fe₂O₃ intralayer. To manipulate the interfacial magnetic phase, a postannealing process causes the controlled reduction of the γ-Fe₂O₃ that finally leads to stoichiometric and ferrimagnetic Fe₃O₄/SrTiO₃(001) heterointerfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abedrock 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectronics 3aferric oxide 3aions 3airon 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amaterials science 0aVerwey transition 0aMagnetite 0aFe3−δO4 0aspin moment 0aspintronics 0aheterointerfaces1 aHinz, Ronja Anika1 aLömker, Patrick1 aWilhelm, Marek1 aGloskovskii, Andrei1 aBencok, Peter1 aSchmitz-Antoniak, Carolin1 aElnaggar, Hebatalla1 aSchneider, Claus M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3920-62551 aMüller, Martina,0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 23, v. 11, no. 7 p.7576-7583dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b206253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016200165300002000327520107600347592002801423650001601451650001101467650001401478650001101492650001901503650002101522650002101543650002201564650001901586650002001605650001301625650002101638650001901659650001401678650001601692653001201708653002501720653001001745653001301755653002501768653003401793653002601827700001501853700001301868700001701881700001701898700001701915700001501932700002001947700005601967700002102023700005302044700005402097700005702151773014602208856008602354852000902440655001202449IND60758529220221121224017.0211130e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075852922DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c061642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Tong10aCovalently Induced Grafting of C₂N Nanoflakes onto Reduced Graphene Oxide with Dominant Pseudocapacitive Behaviors for a High-Rate Sodium-Ion Battery Anode  ap. 15946-15956.  aNitrogen-doped carbon materials are widely used in sodium-ion batteries, but their uncertain doping structure, low nitrogen content, and sluggish sodiation kinetics hinder their practical application. Herein, thin-layer carbon nitride (C₂N) with accurate nitrogen bonding location, ultrahigh nitrogen content, and an inherent nanohole structure is covalently confined onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (C₂N/rGO) via an SN1 nucleophilic substitution reaction combined with in situ polymerization. Benefiting from the abundant active sites, a short ion/electron transfer distance, and good conductivity, the C₂N/rGO electrode delivers a capacity of 218.1 mAh g–¹ after 1000 cycles at 1 A g–¹. Moreover, the Na-storage mechanism is proven to be a capacity governed process through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) methods. This work demonstrates a viable strategy to design an atomically ordered porous nitrogen-containing two-dimensional (2D) carbon material with excellent electrochemical performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acarbon nitride 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3agreen chemistry 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apolymerization 3atitration 3avoltammetry 0aC2N/rGO 0asodium-ion batteries 0aanode 0agraphene 0acapacitance behavior 0anitrogen-containing materials 0ahigh-rate performance1 aChen, Peng1 aLiu, Lin1 aMa, Juanjuan1 aSun, Jingwen1 aDing, Yichen1 aXu, Jianbo1 aSong, Yuanqiang1 aChen, Haiqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7805-63951 aOuyang, Xiaoping1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4099-42681 aZhu, Junwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7518-96831 aFu, Yongsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2224-56100 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 9, no. 47 p.15946-15956dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c061643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245018800160300001600348500002000364520183800384592002802222650001502250650001202265650001702277650001002294650001602304650002302320650001502343650003102358650002202389651001902411700002002430700002102450700002002471700002202491700002202513700002002535773010502555856007302660852000902733655001202742IND60571815020221119184508.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057181502DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.128102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuart, Carol T.10aNestedness and species replacement along bathymetric gradients in the deep sea reflect productivity: a test with polychaete assemblages in the oligotrophic north‐west Gulf of Mexico  ap. 548-555.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To test the hypothesis that low productivity drives the nestedness component of β‐diversity in polychaetes at the deep‐sea floor. LOCATION: Western Gulf of Mexico. METHODS: We used A. Baselga's (2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134–143) metrics of species replacement and nestedness to assess their overall significance with differences in depth and particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to the seafloor. We used M. A. Rodríguez‐Gironés & L. Santamaría's (2006, Journal of Biogeography, 33, 924–935) BINMATNEST to calculate the significance and direction of nestedness with depth and POC flux. RESULTS: Nestedness was the most significant part of β‐diversity with depth and POC flux. The rank order of nestedness increased significantly with increasing depth, and decreased significantly with increasing POC flux. There was little endemism below 2000 m. MAIN CONCLUSION: The polychaete fauna in the deepest western Gulf of Mexico is largely a nested subset of the shallower upper to mid‐bathyal fauna. While the causes of β‐diversity in the deep sea are undoubtedly multivariate, the relative importance of turnover and nestedness appears to be modulated by productivity in the form of POC flux to the seafloor. Under circumstances of extremely low POC flux and animal density in the deepest reaches of the Gulf, nestedness may be caused by some populations being maintained by immigration from larger populations upslope, or by biogeographic filtering for tolerance to abyssal conditions. Resources at great depths in regions of exceptionally low productivity may be too limited to permit adaptation resulting in endemism and continued downslope turnover. If productivity helps to explain the nestedness part of β‐diversity, this may lead to a more unified theory of deep‐sea biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aanimals 3abiogeography 3afauna 3aimmigration 3aindigenous species 3anestedness 3aparticulate organic carbon 3aspecies diversity 3aGulf of Mexico1 aBrault, Solange1 aRowe, Gilbert T.1 aWei, Chih‐Lin1 aWagstaff, Martine1 aMcClain, Craig R.1 aRex, Michael A.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.548-555dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.128103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007800166300001800244520083800262592002801100650001501128650001401143650001401157650001101171650001201182650002001194650003401214650001001248650001701258650001701275700001801292700001901310700001501329700001801344773011001362856008501472852000901557655001201566IND60087258920221119191346.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008725892DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61099-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zhijun10aDisposal of low concentration fume with solid waste modified by microwave  ap.

The influences of operating parameters were also studied. Under the optimal operating conditions, the removal efficiencies of 65.9% and 65.0% were achieved for S0₂ and NOx respectively.

The microwave-modified absorbent in fact played the role of solid catalyst in the process of S0₂ and NOx treatment from fume. S0₂ and NOₓ were oxidized because of microwave-modified absorbent catalytic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aadditives 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3afly ash 3anitrogen oxides 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aslags 3asolid wastes 3aspectroscopy1 aJin, Yonglong1 aZhang, Junhong1 aLiu, Jihui1 aGuan, Zhigang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 June, v. 23S p.S149-S152dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61099-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009000154520126000244592002801504650002101532650001501553650001801568650001001586700001801596700001501614773011901629856007401748852000901822655001201831IND60763615520221122131237.0220120e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076361552DNAL7 a10.3390/w140201772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yu 10aEffects of Barrier Stiffness on Debris Flow Dynamic Impact—I: Laboratory Flume Test  aDebris flows often cause local damage to engineering structures by exerting destructive impact forces. The debris-flow–deformable-barrier interaction is a significant issue in engineering design. In this study, a large physical flume model test device was independently designed to repeatedly reproduce the flow and impact process of debris flow. Three physical flume tests were performed to investigate the effect of barrier stiffness on the debris flow impact. The flow kinematics of debris flow with three barrier stiffness values are essentially consistent with the process of impact–run-up–falling–pile-up. The development of a dead zone provided a cushion to diminish the impact of the follow-up debris flow on the barrier. The peak impact forces were attenuated as the barrier stiffness decreased. The slight deflections of a deformable barrier were sufficiently effective for peak load attenuation by up to 30%. It showed that the decrease of the barrier stiffness had a buffer effect on the debris flow impact and attenuated the peak impact force. And with the decrease of the barrier stiffness, when the barrier was impacted by the same soil types, the recoverable elastic strain will be larger, and the strain peak will be more obvious.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydraulic flumes 3akinematics 3amass movement 3awater1 aJin, Xiaoyan 1 aJi, Junji 0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 10, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140201773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012300166300001800289500002000307520146800327592002801795650001801823650001701841650001901858650001901877650001401896650001301910650001201923650001101935650001701946650001101963650001301974650001701987650002602004650002102030650001402051651002102065651001802086700002002104700002602124700002502150700002302175700002202198700002702220700002002247700001902267700001902286700002102305773013102326856007902457852000902536655001202545IND60588008120221119055448.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058800812DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.134332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, Marina N.10aMetagenomics unveils the attributes of the alginolytic guilds of sediments from four distant cold coastal environments  ap. 4471-4484.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlginates are abundant polysaccharides in brown algae that constitute an important energy source for marine heterotrophic bacteria. Despite the key role of alginate degradation processes in the marine carbon cycle, little information is available on the bacterial populations involved in these processes. The aim of this work was to gain a better understanding of alginate utilization capabilities in cold coastal environments. Sediment metagenomes from four high‐latitude regions of both Hemispheres were interrogated for alginate lyase gene homologue sequences and their genomic context. Sediments contained highly abundant and diverse bacterial assemblages with alginolytic potential, including members of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, as well as several poorly characterized taxa. The microbial communities in Arctic and Antarctic sediments exhibited the most similar alginolytic profiles, whereas brackish sediments showed distinct structures with a higher proportion of novel genes. Examination of the gene neighbourhood of the alginate lyase homologues revealed distinct patterns depending on the potential lineage of the scaffolds, with evidence of evolutionary relationships among alginolytic gene clusters from Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. This information is relevant for understanding carbon fluxes in cold coastal environments and provides valuable information for the development of biotechnological applications from brown algae biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aPhaeophyceae 3aProteobacteria 3aalginate lyase 3aalginates 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aenergy 3alatitude 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amultigene family 3asediments 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region1 aLozada, Mariana1 aAnselmino, Luciano E.1 aMusumeci, Matías A.1 aHenrissat, Bernard1 aJansson, Janet K.1 aMac Cormack, Walter P.1 aCarroll, JoLynn1 aSjöling, Sara1 aLundgren, Leif1 aDionisi, Hebe M.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.4471-4484dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.134333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011700158300002000275520158600295592002801881596009801909596009402007650001102101650001102112650003402123650002102157650001002178650001502188650001202203650001502215650001102230653002502241653002302266653002102289653002802310653002502338700005802363700001302421700001502434700001502449700002002464700001802484700005202502773014302554856007902697852000902776655001202785IND60793791420221121222331.0220921e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c109202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qiang10aFacile Replacement Reaction Enables Nano-Ag-Decorated Three-Dimensional Cu Foam as High-Rate Lithium Metal Anode  ap. 42030-42037.  aIn developing advanced lithium (Li) metal batteries with high-energy density, excellent cycle stability, and high-rate capability, it is imperative to resolve dendrite growth and volume expansion during repeated Li plating/stripping. 3D hosts featuring lithiophilic sites are expected to realize both spatial control and dendrite inhibition over Li nucleation. Herein, this work prepares silver (Ag) nanoparticle-decorated 3D copper (Cu) foam via a facile replacement reaction. The 3D host provides rigid skeleton to accommodate volume expansion during cycling. Ag nanoparticles show micro-structural affinity to guide efficient nucleation of Li, leading to reduced overpotential and enhanced electrochemical kinetics. As the result, under an ultrahigh current density of 10 mA cm–², Cu@Ag foam/Li half cells demonstrate outstanding Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97.2% more than 100 cycles. Also, Cu@Ag foam-Li symmetric cells sustain preeminent cycling over 900 h with a small voltage hysteresis of 32.8 mV at 3 mA cm–². Moreover, the Cu@Ag foam-Li||LiFePO₄ full cell demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 2.33 mAh cm–² over 200 cycles with an excellent CE up to 99.9% at 0.6C under practical conditions (N/P = 1.3, 17.4 mg cm–² LiFePO₄). Notably, the full cell with LiFePO₄ exhibits a higher areal capacity of 1 mAh cm–² over 700 cycles under a high rate of 5C, corresponding to capacity retention up to 100% (N/P = 3, 17.4 mg cm–² LiFePO₄). This study provides a novel and simple strategy for constructing high-rate and long-life Li metal batteries.  aPublisher supplied data  a21975087cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019M652634cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3aanodes 3acopper 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3afoams 3ahysteresis 3alithium 3ananosilver 3asilver 0areplacement reaction 0alithiophilic sites 0aAg nanoparticles 0alithium metal batteries 0ahigh-rate capability1 aQin, Mingsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8039-24401 aYan, Hui1 aZhong, Wei1 aZhang, Wei1 aLiu, Mengchuang1 aCheng, Shijie1 aXie, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8731-295X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 14, no. 37 p.42030-42037dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c109203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013800158300001600296500002000312520190300332592002802235650002102263650001502284650001602299650001102315650002302326650002202349650001502371650001102386650002202397650002002419650001202439650001202451650001502463650001502478650001102493651001602504700001702520700002002537700001702557773010702574856007302681852000902754655001202763IND60523187320221117225612.0160606e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052318732DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.124482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrummer, T.

LOCATION: Canterbury, New Zealand. METHODS: A regional, multiscale survey was conducted across 19 braided river floodplains in multiple catchments. We measured alien and native cover and richness across gradients of flow regime (flow magnitude, variability and high/low‐flow events), propagule pressure (inferred from land cover), climate and local‐scale floodplain substrate and topography. Boosted regression trees were used to determine the relative and absolute importance of these variables on plant cover and richness. RESULTS: The floodplain ecosystems were highly invaded with 154 alien species and only 31 natives. Alien cover was higher in rivers with larger maximum flows, in plots with fine substrate texture, and at higher local river bed elevations. Alien richness increased as the variability of winter flows increased and followed a hump‐shaped relationship with river bed elevation. In contrast, native species richness and cover were both shaped primarily by climate and by land cover, higher in cooler and wetter areas with more adjacent native vegetation. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Alien and native richness and cover were shaped by different variables, so managing the ecosystem (e.g. flow regime) to mitigate aliens would not necessarily promote natives. Promotion of natives will require considerations of propagule supply and whether extant native species are suited to low‐elevation climatic conditions. Aliens were associated with predictors that approximate disturbance processes. Increased flow variability in winter could lead to an increase in the number of aliens; conversely, flow stabilization is likely to allow problematic invaders to increase in cover locally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3agravel 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aland cover 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astream channels 3asurveys 3atexture 3atopography 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aNew Zealand1 aByrom, A.

A case study in lizards  ap. 605-614.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Conservation is often prioritized by identifying regional clusters of threatened or endemic species. Another approach is to assess the evolutionary distinctiveness of groups of taxa using phylodiversity measures. However, quantification of evolutionary history has traditionally not accounted for its uneven geographical distribution due to the variation in species ranges. We assess the efficacy of phylogenetic endemism (PE) to predict high extinction risk in comparison to estimates of species range restriction (weighted endemism, WE) and phylogenetic diversity (PD). PE measures the relative range restriction of evolutionary history (lineages), while WE concentrates on the tips of the tree of life, treating all such branches as being of equal length. LOCATION/METHODS: Using New Zealand's endemic skinks and geckos, we mapped the geographical variation in their extinction risk, PE, WE and PD and measured the extent to which extinction risk exhibited phylogenetic clustering for each group. Correlations between geographical concentrations of high skink and gecko extinction risk with PE, WE and PD were calculated. RESULTS: PE was predictive of spatial clusters of high extinction risk for geckos (r² = 0.34, P < 0.001) while WE was markedly less so (r² = 0.19, P < 0.001). The reverse applied to skinks, with WE most predictive of high risk (r² = 0.26, P < 0.001). The phylogenetic signal of extinction risk was significantly conserved for geckos, but was weaker and non‐significant for skinks. PE and WE were not predictive of low risk. PD was not predictive of risk. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: PE and related measures may be predictive of extinction risk when risk is phylogenetically conserved. Mapping the geographical variation in PE could be a useful first assessment of extinction risk for many groups because phylogenies are increasingly available, while full risk status categories are not. These findings might apply to other groups and locations and warrant further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekkonidae 3aScincidae 3acase studies 3aextinction 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3aindigenous species 3alizards 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3arisk 3aNew Zealand1 aLaffan, Shawn W.1 aNielsen, Stuart V.1 aChapple, David G.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.605-614dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.128753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012400160300001600284500002000300520223300320592002802553650001202581650001702593650001902610650002002629650001102649650000902660650001902669650002602688650001302714650001402727650002402741650001402765650002202779650001202801650001602813650001002829650001602839651001202855700001602867700001902883700002102902700002202923773010702945856007303052852000903125655001203134IND60523187620221117225938.0160606e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052318762DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.124422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Michael S.10aInferring implications of climate change in south Florida hardwood hammocks through analysis of metacommunity structure  ap. 783-796.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: In order to explore how variation in regional biogeography would affect forest responses to climate change, we analysed metacommunity structure of trees in natural forest fragments across a boundary between tropical and sub‐tropical temperature regimes. We wished to determine whether species assemblages were constrained by periodic cold temperatures, dispersal limitation and/or local processes associated with fragment size, and consider how these influences might affect future species migration and community reassembly. LOCATION: Southeastern Florida, USA. METHODS: We collected complete tree species lists for 144 forest fragments, from our own surveys supplemented by publicly available sources. The resulting species‐by‐site data matrix was re‐ordered based on an ordination that identified the latent environmental axis most responsible for variation in composition, and metacommunity structure was analysed for coherence, turnover and range boundary clumping. Matrix structure was tested for associations with site variables, and with community‐aggregated functional traits related to cold tolerance, dispersal limitation and fragment size. RESULTS: Forest patch size was the strongest single correlate with composition and species richness, but mean January temperature and a neighbourhood index denoting degree of isolation from other patches contributed significantly to regression models. The species‐by‐site matrix was highly nested, with trees common to small upland fragments in the Everglades interior representing a distinct subset of the richer assemblages found in sites closer to the coast. Interior forests were smaller, more isolated, and subject to cooler minimum temperatures than more coastal forests, and were comprised primarily of early‐successional, animal dispersed species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: While warming winter temperatures may relax some constraints on the northward migration of tropical species through the region, sea level rise will raise ground water levels, decreasing the size and number of suitable mesic patches, and increasing their isolation. The result will be a loss in tree species diversity, especially among late‐successional, edge‐sensitive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3acoastal forests 3acoasts 3acold 3acold tolerance 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahardwood 3ahighlands 3aregression analysis 3asea level 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater table 3aFlorida1 aSah, Jay P.1 aRuiz, Pablo L.1 aSpitzig, Adam A.1 aSubedi, Suresh C.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2016 July, v. 22, no. 7 p.783-796dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.124423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01622naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013300164300001800297520058200315592002800897650001600925650002500941650003000966650001400996651001001010651001001020651002101030700001801051700002301069773011001092856008501202852000901287655001201296IND60087259320221119191317.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008725932DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61103-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Jia10aEnd-of-life vehicle recycling and international cooperation between Japan, China and Korea: Present and future scenario analysis  ap.

Marine bacteria of the Roseobacter clade harbor up to 11 extrachromosomal replicons, adding lifestyle‐relevant and possibly habitat success‐promoting functions to their genomic repertoire. Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 is a nutritionally versatile representative, carrying three stable and functionally distinct plasmids (65, 78, and 262 kb). The present study investigates the physiological and energetic consequences of plasmid carriage in P. inhibens DSM 17395, employing mutants cured from all native plasmids in every possible combination (seven different). Cultivation in process‐controlled bioreactors with casamino acids as organic substrate revealed a complex physiological response, suggesting existence of functional interconnections between the replicons. Deletion of the 262 kb plasmid boosted growth rate (>3‐fold) and growth efficiency (yields for carbon, O₂ and CO₂), which was not observed for the 65 or 78 kb plasmid. Carriage of the 262 kb plasmid was most costly for the wild type, i.e. contributing ∼50% to its energetic (dissimilatory) expenditures. Cost–benefit analysis of plasmid carriage reflects the high value of plasmids for niche specialization of P. inhibens DSM 17395 and most likely also for related Phaeobacter species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRoseobacter 3aaquatic bacteria 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acasamino acids 3acost benefit analysis 3ahabitats 3amutants 3aoxygen 3aphysiological response 3aplasmids1 aWill, Sabine Eva1 aHulsch, Reiner1 aMaschmann, Uwe1 aWiegmann, Katharina1 aHensler, Michael1 aMichael, Victoria1 aRuppersberg, Hanna1 aWünsch, Daniel1 aFeenders, Christoph1 aNeumann‐Schaal, Meina1 aKaltenhäuser, Sabine1 aUlbrich, Marcus1 aSchmidt‐Hohagen, Kerstin1 aBlasius, Bernd1 aPetersen, Jörn1 aSchomburg, D.q(Dietmar),1 aRabus, Ralf0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.4817-4829dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.133813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009000154520112000244592002801364650001801392650001501410650001801425650002401443650000901467650001001476700001801486700001501504773011901519856007401638852000901712655001201721IND60763616020221122131219.0220120e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076361602DNAL7 a10.3390/w140201822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yu 10aEffects of Barrier Stiffness on Debris Flow Dynamic Impact—II: Numerical Simulation  aThe destructive and impactful forces of debris flow commonly causes local damage to engineering structures. The effect of a deformable barrier on the impact dynamics is important in engineering design. In this study, a flow–structure coupled with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model was presented to investigate the effects of barrier stiffness on the debris impact. A comparison of the results of physical tests and simulation results revealed that the proposed smoothed particle hydrodynamics model effectively reproduces the flow kinematics and time history of the impact force. Even slight deflections of the deformable barrier lead to obvious attenuation of the peak impact pressure. Additionally, deformable barriers with lower stiffness tend to deform more downstream upon loading, shifting the deposited sand toward the active failure mode and generating less static earth pressure. When the debris flow has a higher frontal velocity, the impact force on the barrier is dominated by the dynamic component and there is an appreciable effect of the stiffness of the deformable barrier on load attenuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3akinematics 3amass movement 3amathematical models 3asand 3awater1 aJin, Xiaoyan 1 aJi, Junji 0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 10, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140201823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011000158300001800268520057400286592002800860650001300888650001500901650001100916650001700927700002900944700001900973700002100992700002101013700002001034773009801054856007501152852000901227655001201236IND60576697120171218000000.0170806e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057669712DNAL7 a10.1021/la204679u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalo, Hélène10aSite Selective Generation of Sol–Gel Deposits in Layered Bimetallic Macroporous Electrode Architectures  ap. 2323-2326.  aThe elaboration of an original composite bimetallic macroporous electrode containing a site-selective sol–gel deposit is reported.

Populations become isolated on either side of the newly established environmental barrier, and absence of gene flow promotes allopatric speciation, in a process that is known as ecological vicariance. If climate change altered the ancestral range gradually, such as along temporal temperature or moisture gradients, the age of divergence of disjunct species should be related to the lineage tolerance to climatic conditions. Here, we investigate this hypothesis using as a study model the African Rand Flora, a continental‐scale floristic pattern that relates sister taxa distributed on either side of the Saharan Desert. LOCATION: Africa, Macaronesia, Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. METHODS: We estimated the extant climatic tolerances of 14 Rand Flora lineages based on present occurrence data, and correlated the phylogenetic age of divergence between vicariant clades. We tested whether the tempo of the vicariance in the Rand Flora lineages was associated with the average values of their climatic niches in agreement with niche‐driven divergence. We hindcasted species ranges using species distribution models combined with palaeoclimate simulations to infer the potential distribution of each lineage's ancestors. RESULTS: We found a positive relationship between the lineage temperature niche and the age of the Rand Flora disjunction: lineages with subtropical affinities diverged first, whereas those with a higher tolerance to drier conditions (temperate or sub‐xeric adaptations) exhibited younger disjunctions. The range reconstructions showed the existence of climatic corridors south of the Sahara in the wetter Late Miocene, which became interrupted during the mid‐Pliocene warming event. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that climate change leading to the formation of the Sahara Desert drove Rand Flora lineages divergences along a temporal sequence that matched the climatic niche of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopatric speciation 3aancestry 3abasins 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aflora 3agene flow 3amodels 3aniches 3apaleoclimatology 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3aAfrica 3aMiddle East 3aSahara Desert1 aSanmartín, Isabel1 aPellissier, Loïc0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Apr., v. 44, no. 4 p.911-923dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001400285520099300299592002801292650004101320650002801361650001301389650001101402650002201413650003501435650002101470650002301491650001401514650001601528651001201544653001501556653001001571653001701581653001101598653001501609653001301624700001901637700001601656700002801672700002301700773012401723856008101847852000901928655001201937IND60598117620221117103510.0180628e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059811762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wsj.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallouz, Faiza10aModeling of discharge and sediment transport through the SWAT model in the basin of Harraza (Northwest of Algeria)  ap. 79-88.  aThe objective of this study is to model discharge and solid erosion quantification through a small agricultural watershed by applying the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) on the Wadi Harraza’s basin of which is part of Wadi Cheliff’s basin, with an average altitude of 500m, drains an area of 568sqkm.

The aim of this study is to develop regression equation for calculating AST and to analyze and investigate the effects of atmospheric parameters (O₃, CH₄, CO, H₂Ovapor, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)) on the AST value in Iraq. Dataset retrieved from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at EOS Aqua Satellite, spanning the years of 2003 to 2016, and multiple linear regression were used to achieve the objectives of the study. For the study period, the five atmospheric parameters were highly correlated (R, 0.855–0.958) with predicted AST. Statistical analyses in terms of β showed that OLR (0.310 to 1.053) contributes significantly in enhancing AST values. Comparisons among selected five stations (Mosul, Kanaqin, Rutba, Baghdad, and Basra) for the year 2010 showed a close agreement between the predicted and observed AST from AIRS, with values ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 K and for ground stations data, within 0.9 to 2.6 K. To make more complete analysis, also, comparison between predicted and observed AST from AIRS for four selected month in 2016 (January, April, July, and October) has been carried out. The result showed a high correlation coefficient (R, 0.87 and 0.95) with less variability (RMSE ≤ 1.9) for all months studied, indicating model’s capability and accuracy. In general, the results indicate the advantage of using the AIRS data and the regression analysis to investigate the impact of the atmospheric parameters on AST over the study area.  aPublisher supplied data  a203.PFIZIK.6711608cMinistry of Education, Malaysia. 3aair 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aequations 3ahydrology 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asatellites 3astatistical models 3asurface temperature 3aterrestrial radiation 3aIraq1 aRajab, Jasim1 aAl-Salihi, Ali1 aSalih, Zainab1 aMatJafri, Mohd.

The data are presented at three levels of detail: total body, specific body regions, and regional body tissue layers. Differences in the assignment of these quantities among the compared models increased with the level of detail, in the above order. The ranges of variability in the total body BMR was 6.5 % relative to the lowest value, with a mean of 84.3 ± 2 W, and in the BCO, it was 8 % with a mean of 4.70 ± 0.13 l/min. The least variability among the body regions is seen in the combined torso (shoulders, thorax, and abdomen: ±7.8 % BMR and ±5.9 % BBPR) and in the combined head (head, face, and neck ±9.9 % BMR and ±10.9 % BBPR), determined by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Much more variability is apparent in the extremities with the most showing in the BMR of the feet (±117 %), followed by the BBPR in the arms (±61.3 %). In the tissue layers, most of the bone layers were assigned zero BMR and BBPR, except in the shoulders and in the extremities that were assigned non-zero values in a number of models. The next lowest values were assigned to the fat layers, with occasional zero values. Skin basal values were invariably non-zero but involved very low values in certain models, e.g., BBPR in the feet and the hands. Muscle layers were invariably assigned high values with the highest found in the thorax, abdomen, and legs. The brain, lung, and viscera layers were assigned the highest of all values of both basal quantities with those of the brain layers showing rather tight ranges of variability in both basal quantities. Average basal values of the “time-seasoned” models presented in this study could be useful as a first step in future modeling efforts subject to appropriate adjustment of values to conform to most recently available and reliable data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3abioclimatology 3ablood 3abrain 3acardiac output 3aface 3afeet 3ahands 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amuscles 3aneck 3ashoulders 3athermoregulation 3athorax1 aArens, Edward1 aZhang, Hui0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2016 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.1051-1064dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-015-1096-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007300174300001600247520063000263592002800893650001900921650001700940650002200957650001100979650001900990650001701009650001101026650001101037650002001048650001701068650002001085650001701105651001201122653002301134653001701157653002001174653001701194700003801211773012601249856008101375852000901456655001201465IND60598117820221117103439.0180628e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059811782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wsj.2018.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImiete, Iikpoemugh Elo10aReverse osmosis purification: A case study of the Niger Delta region  ap. 129-137.  aThe Niger Delta region of Nigeria is faced with the problem of drinking water supply.

Here, we investigate the historical biogeography of sub‐Antarctic representatives of the genus Ranunculus. We aimed to establish when and from where the sub‐Antarctic ranunculi originated as well as to examine the extent to which ecomorphological traits explain contemporary biogeographical patterns. LOCATION: Southern temperate and sub‐Antarctic zones. METHODS: We first estimated a dated phylogeny for Ranunculus using combined chloroplast and nuclear data for 53 accessions; divergence times were inferred based on three temporal calibrations. We then used non‐parametric multidimensional scaling to evaluate the ecomorphological diversity of 67 austral ranunculi representing a combination of sub‐Antarctic species and those restricted to lower latitude landmasses. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses indicated that several Ranunculus lineages have colonized the sub‐Antarctic islands. Divergence time estimates suggest recent arrival from source areas in Australia, New Zealand or South America. Species exhibiting two distinct ecomorphological trait combinations occur in both sub‐Antarctic and lower latitude habitats; the proportions of each combination differed significantly between these areas. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Ranunculus has colonized the sub‐Antarctic on several occasions, most often arriving from the lower latitude landmasses prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Taken together our analyses suggest that chance effects are likely to have influenced species arrival. However, following arrival trait–environment interactions appear to have been important for the subsequent establishment and persistence of ranunculi in sub‐Antarctic habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRanunculus 3achloroplasts 3ahabitats 3aislands 3alatitude 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphylogeny 3aphytogeography 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth America1 aWinkworth, Richard C.1 aBecker, Matthias1 aLockhart, Peter J.1 aHennion, Françoise0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Apr., v. 44, no. 4 p.875-886dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013800174520084300312592002801155650002601183650000801209650002501217650001101242650000801253650002101261650002301282650001301305650001301318650001801331650002301349650002001372650002001392650001001412650001301422650001901435650003201454650001801486653001401504653001701518653001701535700002301552700002401575773010301599856008601702852000901788655001201797IND60679105120221117032013.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067910512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1039292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasoulpour, Rasoul10aOpuntin B, the antiviral protein isolated from prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.)

Flour  aReduction of postharvest losses through improved technique is studied in this work. Pretreatment and drying, in particular, are important methods for using various tuber-based food items to produce intermediate products that increase economic benefit and availability with a longer shelf life in the production and consumption communities. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pretreatment and drying methods on the proximate composition and physical and functional properties of flour developed from anchote. The treated anchote flour was prepared using hot distilled water for blanching and potassium metabisulphite solution and drying methods (sun, solar, and oven). The obtained data were statistically analyzed using SAS software at P<0.05. Accordingly, the untreated and sun-dried anchote had greater moisture content (10.34%) than the chemically treated and oven-dried anchote (8.71%). The samples treated with potassium metabisulphite and the solar-drying methods have higher protein content (4.02%) than the blanched and sun-dried samples (3.14%). Samples treated with blanching and solar drying have lower ash content (3.96%) than samples treated with potassium metabisulphite and dried (4.89%). The highest fiber content was recorded for samples treated with blanching and oven-drying methods, with a rating of 4.71%. Sun-dried samples had an increased fat content (1.14%) compared to blanch with all drying methods (0.72%). The untreated and sun-dried flour had lower carbohydrate content (80.95%) than blanched and oven-dried (83.03%). The potassium-metabisulphite-treated and oven-dried samples rated 2.66% with the highest water absorption value. The blanched and oven-dried samples had the lowest oil absorption capacity of 1.71%, a significantly different value from the highest value of 1.98% for the potassium-metabisulphite-treated and solar-dried samples. Oven-dried samples had higher swelling power than solar- and sun-drying methods. The anchote samples treated by blanching methods and dried in the oven had the highest solubility rating of 43.84% and the lowest value of 38.8% for control and sun-dried samples. The sun-dried anchote flour had the highest dispersibility value, which is significantly different from both the oven-dried and solar-dried versions. Along with that, the untreated samples had significantly lower dispersibility values than the potassium-metabisulphite-treated and blanched flour samples. The proximate values of anchote flour were significantly affected by pretreatment and drying methods. Additionally, the main and interactive effect of pretreatment and drying methods influenced the water absorption capacity, oil absorption capacity, swelling power, solubility, and dispersibility significantly. Further research is required to improve flour properties and characterize pasting properties to assess the suitability of the starch for different industrial inputs.  aPublisher supplied data  cWollega University 3aCoccinia 3aabsorption 3aash content 3acarbohydrate content 3acomputer software 3adispersibility 3afiber content 3afinancial economics 3aflour 3afood quality 3alipid content 3aoils 3aovens 3apotassium metabisulfite 3aprotein content 3aproximate composition 3ashelf life 3asolar drying 3asolubility 3astarch 3awater binding capacity 3awater content 3awater uptake1 aKibr, Gesessew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0297-01880 tJournal of food quality.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/31836293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003800145245010000183300001800283500002000301520131200321592002801633650001301661650002101674650002801695650001301723650001501736650002001751650002201771650001801793650001101811650001101822650001101833650001401844650002301858650001101881650001501892650001401907650001501921700003101936700001601967700003501983773013102018856007902149852000902228655001202237IND60588009320221119055314.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058800932DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.133892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez‐García, Pedro Manuel10aPrediction of bacterial associations with plants using a supervised machine‐learning approach  ap. 4847-4861.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent scenarios of fresh produce contamination by human enteric pathogens have resulted in severe food‐borne outbreaks, and a new paradigm has emerged stating that some human‐associated bacteria can use plants as secondary hosts. As a consequence, there has been growing concern in the scientific community about these interactions that have not yet been elucidated. Since this is a relatively new area, there is a lack of strategies to address the problem of food‐borne illnesses due to the ingestion of fruits and vegetables. In the present study, we performed specific genome annotations to train a supervised machine‐learning model that allows for the identification of plant‐associated bacteria with a precision of ∼93%. The application of our method to approximately 9500 genomes predicted several unknown interactions between well‐known human pathogens and plants, and it also confirmed several cases for which evidence has been reported. We observed that factors involved in adhesion, the deconstruction of the plant cell wall and detoxifying activities were highlighted as the most predictive features. The application of our strategy to sequenced strains that are involved in food poisoning can be used as a primary screening tool to determine the possible causes of contaminations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanimal pathogens 3aartificial intelligence 3abacteria 3acell walls 3aenteropathogens 3afoodborne illness 3afresh produce 3afruits 3agenome 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aintermediate hosts 3amodels 3aprediction 3ascreening 3avegetables1 aLópez‐Solanilla, Emilia1 aRamos, Cayo1 aRodríguez‐Palenzuela, Pablo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.4847-4861dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.133893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008800159300001800247520157600265592002801841650001201869650002001881650001701901650001201918650001701930650002901947650001801976650001401994650001802008650001202026650000702038650001102045650002302056650002402079650001802103650001702121650001902138650001602157651001702173700001302190773014502203856007402348852000902422655001202431IND60662023220221117025259.0190904e20111102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066202322DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10520e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sandeep10aMapping the organic carbon stocks of surface soils using local spatial interpolator  ap. 3128-3135.  aThe largest uncertainties are associated with estimating the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock because of natural soil variability and data scarcity. Thus, a local spatial geostatistical hybrid approach, the geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), was used in the present study to overcome some of these uncertainties. This study was designed to estimate the SOC stock (kg C m⁻²) for the surface 0 to 15 cm depth using the state of Pennsylvania as the study region. A total of 920 soil profiles were extracted from the National Soil Survey Center database and were divided into calibration (80%) and validation (20%) periods. Some soil parameters that include clay content, bulk density (ρb), total nitrogen (TN) content, pH, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, extractable acidity (EXACID), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were used as covariates for estimating the SOC stock. These covariates exhibited spatial autocorrelation (Moran's Index, I = 0.62 to 0.89). Further, residuals of geographically weighted regression were spatially autocorrelated, and hence support the use of the GWRK approach. Validation results concluded that the performance of the GWRK approach was the best with the lowest values of root mean square error, mean estimation error and mean absolute estimation error. The estimated SOC stock for the surface 0 to 15 cm depth ranged from 1.41 to 3.94 kg m⁻². Results from this study show that the GWRK captures spatial dependent relationships, and addresses spatial non-stationarity issues, hence this approach improves the estimations of SOC stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aautocorrelation 3abulk density 3acalcium 3acarbon sinks 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3adatabases 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3apH 3asodium 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil surveys 3atotal nitrogen 3auncertainty 3aPennsylvania1 aLal, R.,0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 Nov. 2, v. 13, no. 11 p.3128-3135dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10520e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008100163300002000244520168900264592002801953596007001981650002202051650001602073650001202089650001202101650002202113650001402135650002502149650002402174650000702198650001402205650001302219650000902232650001802241650001902259650001102278651001002289651001702299700001402316700002202330700001902352773015402371856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60763787720221122112801.0220202e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076378772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16442-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Hua,10aMechanical properties of Na-montmorillonite-modified EICP-treated silty sand  ap. 10332-10344.  aThe effects of Na-montmorillonite (Na-Mt) content and curing age on enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation (EICP)–treated soil were studied. First, the effects of Na-Mt addition on the urease activity, Ca²⁺ precipitation rate, and pH of the solution were analyzed through tube tests. Then, Na-Mt-modified EICP was used to reinforce silty sand in the Yellow River flooding area in China. The solidification effect and action mechanism of Na-Mt were investigated via the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, calcium carbonate content (CCC) measurement, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope analyses, wherein soil treated by conventional EICP and soil treated with Na-Mt alone were considered the control group. Na-Mt improved the urease activity and Ca²⁺ precipitation rate, lowered the pH, increased the CaCO₃ production through chelation, then regulated the morphology of the CaCO₃ crystals and facilitated the formation of densely aggregated calcite. The CCC and mechanical parameters increased rapidly during the first 7 days of curing, and then slowed down. The incorporation of 8% Na-Mt enhanced the UCS and Ca²⁺ utilization ratio at curing age of 7 days by 1.4 and 2.72 times, respectively, compared with that of traditional EICP; and the optimal Na-Mt content was identified to be 8%. At Na-Mt contents lower than 8%, the mathematically expressed improvement effect of the Na-Mt-modified EICP on the soil strength was greater than the arithmetic sum of that when these two approaches applied individually; this result confirms that the Na-Mt-modified EICP technique proposed herein is an efficient approach for solidifying fine-grained soil.  aPublisher supplied data  a202102310247cScience and Technology Department of Henan Province 3aX-ray diffraction 3aarithmetics 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3achelation 3acompression strength 3afine-textured soils 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3asand 3asoil strength 3asolidification 3aurease 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aLiu, Kang1 aZhang, Changguang1 aZhao, Zhiliang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 7 p.10332-10344dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16442-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245012400202300001800326520181000344592002802154650002902182650001802211650001702229650002302246650001302269650001302282650001602295700006802311773013602379856008102515852000902596655001202605IND60772139920221121195241.0220331e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077213992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Vikas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3287-019610aTranslational Jump-Diffusion of Hydroxide Ion in Anion Exchange Membrane: Deciphering the Nature of Vehicular Diffusion  ap. 2430-2440.  aEarlier, ab initio and reactive force-field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies suggested an overwhelming contribution of the vehicular diffusion in the total diffusion of hydroxide ions rather than structural diffusion. But does the vehicular diffusion occur via small-step displacement? This question is important to have an understanding of the real characteristics of vehicular diffusion. To answer this question, we perform a classical molecular dynamics simulation of a system containing a hydroxide ion exchange membrane polymer and hydroxide ion at different hydration levels and temperatures using the same molecular force field (Dubey, V.Chem. Phys. Lett.2020, 755, 137802), which successfully captured the microscopic structure and dynamics of the system. We use the translational jump-diffusion approach, used previously in supercooled water for understanding the origin of breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation, to calculate the jump-diffusion coefficient of hydroxide ion and water in the anion exchange membrane. We have seen a significant role of hydration level and temperature in the mechanism of vehicular diffusion. In overhydrated membrane, both hydroxide ions and water molecules diffuse via both small- and large-step displacement. With decreasing hydration level and temperature, the diffusion is increasingly governed by the jump-diffusion mechanism. The larger contribution of jump-diffusion comes from the stronger caging of the diffusing species by the solvent at lower hydration levels and temperature. These results, therefore, suggest that the hydration level and temperature of the hydroxide ion exchange membrane determine the detailed mechanism of the vehicular diffusion of hydroxide ion, especially whether the diffusion follows hydrodynamics or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3ahydrodynamics 3aion exchange 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aDaschakraborty, Snehasis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2694-71420 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 126, no. 12 p.2430-2440dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011900162300002000281520091400301592002801215596009801243596009801341596009801439596012601537596012801663596013701791650003401928650002201962650001301984650001601997650002202013653001302035653001402048653002802062653002502090653002702115653001402142700001302156700001702169700001202186700001902198700005702217773014302274856007902417852000902496655001202505IND60793792520221121222247.0220921e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c113902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Tianyuan10aF-doping-Enhanced Carrier Transport in the SnO₂/Perovskite Interface for High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 42093-42101.  aSnO₂ is widely used as the electron transport layer (ETL) in n–i–p perovskite solar cells. However, the deep-level defects at the interface between SnO₂ and the perovskite film will lead to energy loss, reducing the open-circuit voltage. Therefore, the interface optimization is essential to raise the efficiency and enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells. In this work, we introduce NH₄F into the SnO₂ electron transport layers, and the optimized SnO₂ films reduce the interface defect density, improve the charge extraction, and reveal a better energy-level arrangement. Compared to the conventional SnO₂ perovskite solar cell, the average Vₒc is improved by 70 mV with the champion efficiency up to 22.12%. Moreover, the unencapsulated F-doped SnO₂ perovskite solar cells show better thermal stability (maintained 86.2%) and humidity stability (maintained 80.8%) after 35 days.  aPublisher supplied data  a51402118cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a61674063cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a62074061cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2015CB258400cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2016YFB0700702cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  aJCYJ20210324142010030cScience, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010877 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectron transfer 3ahumidity 3asolar cells 3athermal stability 0aF-doping 0atin oxide 0ainterfacial passivation 0aopen-circuit voltage 0aperovskite solar cells 0astability1 aYe, Gang1 aChen, Xiayan1 aWu, Hao1 aZhang, Wenfeng1 aChang, Haixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9621-44570 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 14, no. 37 p.42093-42101dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c113903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002800180245009800208300001800306506007600324520140500400592002801805506003701833650001301870650002001883650001801903650002601921700002201947773009801969856007502067852000902142655001202151IND60576697720221207091641.0170806e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057669772DNAL7 a10.1021/la204777x2doi7 aPMC32866492pmcid7 a221917312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivaraman, Balakrishnan10aTime-Dependent Conformational Changes in Adsorbed Albumin and Its Effect on Platelet Adhesion  ap. 2745-2752.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have shown that platelets can adhere to adsorbed albumin (Alb) through a receptor-mediated mechanism, but only if the Alb undergoes more than a critical degree of adsorption-induced unfolding. The objectives of this research were to investigate whether Alb that was initially adsorbed in a manner that induced unfolding that was less than this critical level would undergo further unfolding with time and, if so, whether this would induce the onset of platelet adhesion once this critical level was exceeded. To address these questions, CD spectropolarimetry was used to monitor the structure of Alb on OH- and CH₃-functionalized alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer surfaces, with the Alb initially adsorbed under conditions resulting in degrees of unfolding that were below this critical level, and then the adsorbed Alb layers were aged over 6 months in sterile physiological saline at 37 °C. Platelet adhesion to Alb was quantified at selected time points via a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The results indicate that an adsorbed Alb layer does undergo further structural changes with increasing residence time and supports platelet adhesion once it unfolds beyond the previously determined critical level.

Using a minimal coarse-grained model that captures the shape, flexibility, and charge distributions of the molecules, we find that coacervates are readily formed at physiological ionic strengths, in agreement with experiment, with a progressive increase in local ordering at low ionic strength. Variation of the positions of charged residues in the protein tunes phase separation: for well-mixed or only moderately blocky distributions of charge, there is a modest increase of local ordering with increasing blockiness that is also associated with an increased propensity to phase separate. This ordering is also associated with a slowdown of rotational and translational diffusion in the dense phase. However, for more extreme blockiness (and consequently higher local charge density), we see a qualitative change in the condensed phase to become a segregated structure with a dramatically increased ordering of the DNA. Naturally occurring proteins with these sequence properties, such as protamines in sperm cells, are found to be associated with very dense packing of nucleic acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell nucleus 3ahistones 3aionic strength 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aprotamines 3aseparation 3aspermatozoa1 aBest, Robert B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7893-35430 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 23, v. 126, no. 12 p.2407-2419dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c004243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146242004700168245005800215300001500273520203200288592002802320650002202348650001902370650003502389650001802424650001102442650002002453650001702473650001602490651001202506653001902518653002302537653001402560653001902574653002902593700002402622773009902646856008002745852000902825655001202834IND60523189820170621000000.0160627e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052318982DNAL7 a10.1556/0088.2016.65.1.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzatmári, Gábor10aGeostatistics in soil mapping — A review10aGeostatisztika a talajtérképezésben – Szemle –  ap. 95-114.  aGeostatistical approaches and the underlying theory of regionalized variables have been increasingly used in general soil science and (digital) soil mapping since thebeginning of the 1980s. This can be attributed to the fact that soil is an ideal medium for practical geostatistics, which additionally has yielded many developments, reconsiderations and revisions from soil scientists addressed to theoretical and practical issues, such as non-stationarity, non-normality and the assessment of local and spatial uncertainty. The approach and practice of soil mapping have been drastically changed thanks to geostatistics, since many soil properties show a continuum in space (as well in time), which can be more properly modelled by geostatistics than by areal maps with discrete boundaries of soil classes. Nowadays digital soil mapping has been widely supported by geostatistics, as demonstrated by the extensive literature both internationally and in Hungary. The main aim of this study was to show how the approach and practice of soil mapping have changed since the 1980s, and how geostatistical considerations and the theory of regionalized variables have been successfully adopted in general soil science and in soil mapping. Additionally, it is shown how GIS (geographic information system) software products are able to support the geostatistical analysis and mapping of soil properties. On the other hand, it is pointed out that GIS tools have some limitations, which can lead to inappropriate results and decisions due to incomplete knowledge and/or misunderstandings. Some important notions (e.g. stationarity) are introduced, which are indispensable to geostatistical modelling but which commonly cause misunderstandings. Furthermore, the role of exploratory variography in the modelling process has been highlighted and the importance of expert knowledge in this field, which help to make geostatistics an appropriate tool for modelling and understanding the spatial (or even spatiotemporal) variability of soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aexpert opinion 3ageographic information systems 3ageostatistics 3amodels 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3auncertainty 3aHungary 0ageostatisztika 0atalajtérképezés 0avariogram 0astacionaritás 0aregionalizált változó1 aPásztor, László,0 tAgrokémia és talajtan.g2016 June, v. 65, no. 1 p.95-114dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-27137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0088.2016.65.1.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012200161300001800283520123100301592002801532650002201560650001101582650001101593650002301604650001701627650001501644650001001659650001301669650001201682650001801694650002101712650002101733650003801754653001001792653002601802653002301828653001601851653002301867653002701890700001801917700001301935700001501948700001401963700001501977700001401992700001802006700005702024700001602081773013902097856007802236852000902314655001202323IND60631285120221119091735.0190220e20190122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063128512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b199282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Nianjun12aA-Site Ordered Double Perovskite with in Situ Exsolved Core–Shell Nanoparticles as Anode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells  ap. 6995-7005.  aA highly active anode material for solid oxide fuel cells resistant to carbon deposition is developed. Co–Fe co-doped La₀.₅Ba₀.₅MnO₃₋δ with a cubic–hexagonal heterogeneous stucture is synthesized through the Pechini method. An A-site ordered double perovskite with Co₀.₉₄Fe₀.₀₆ alloy-oxide core–shell nanoparticles on its surface is formed after reduction. The phase transition and the exsolution of the nanoparticles are investigated with X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The exsolved nanoparticles with the layered double-perovskite supporter show a high catalytic activity. A single cell with that anode and a 300 μm thick La₀.₈Sr₀.₂Ga₀.₈Mg₀.₂O₃₋δ electrolyte layer exhibits maximum power densities of 1479 and 503 mW cm–² at 850 °C with wet hydrogen and wet methane fuels, respectively. Moreover, the single cell fed with wet methane exhibits a stable power output at 850 °C for 200 h, demonstrating a high resistance to carbon deposition of the anode due to the strong anchor of the exsolved nanoparticles on the perovskite parent. The oxide shell also preserves the metal particles from coking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopes 0aanode 0asolid oxide fuel cell 0ain situ exsolution 0ahydrocarbon 0alayered perovskite 0acore−shell structure1 aYao, Tongtong1 aLi, Ping1 aYao, Xueli1 aGan, Tian1 aFan, Lijun1 aWang, Jun1 aZhi, Xiaojing1 aZhao, Yicheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4389-60571 aLi, Yongdan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 22, v. 11, no. 7 p.6995-7005dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b199283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013800158300001800296520130200314592002801616650002201644650002201666650001301688650002501701650001501726650001701741650001901758650001801777650000901795650002101804650001901825650002001844700001901864700001801883773009801901856007501999852000902074655001202083IND60576697820221121061836.0170806e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057669782DNAL7 a10.1021/la20478832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinami, Hideto10aPhase-Transfer Behavior of Cross-Linked Poly(acrylic acid) Particles Prepared by Dispersion Polymerization from Ionic Liquid to Water  ap. 2523-2528.  aThe phase-transfer behavior of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) particles from the hydrophobic ionic liquid N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide phase to the water phase in the particle state, which we reported previously, was examined in more detail. PAA particles were prepared in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([Bmim][TFSA]) and the organic solvent chloroform and were extracted. The transfer of PAA particles to water in the particle state was also observed in [Bmim][TFSA] systems. In contrast, the transfer phenomenon was not observed in the chloroform system. It was clarified that water/oil interfacial tension γwₒ is an important parameter in the extraction of PAA in the particle state from the viewpoint of free energy. When the cationic surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, aqueous solution was used as the extraction medium, the PAA particles were extracted in the particle state from chloroform to water, in which γwₒ became as low as that of the ionic liquid. This suggests that the phase-transfer phenomenon of PAA particles in the particle state was induced by the ionic liquid’s unique property of low interfacial tension with water despite its high hydrophobic character.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aaqueous solutions 3abromides 3acationic surfactants 3achloroform 3acrosslinking 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3aoils 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolymerization 3asurface tension1 aMizuta, Yusuke1 aKimura, Akira0 tLangmuir.g2012 Feb. 07, v. 28, no. 5 p.2523-2528dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla20478833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001600276520146100292592002801753650002201781650000801803650001501811650005001826650001201876650001301888650001601901650001101917650002501928650002601953650002601979650001602005650002702021650001402048650000902062650004302071650001402114650000902128650001202137650001202149650001402161650001102175650002602186650000802212650002102220650000902241700002102250700001902271700002102290700002002311773011502331856008102446852000902527655001202536IND60575420220221119224811.0170908e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057542022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-5304-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Bilal10aEffect of pollution on DNA damage and essential fatty acid profile in Cirrhinus mrigala from River Chenab  ap. 572-579.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic pollution on DNA damage and the fatty acid profile of the bottom dweller fish (Cirrhinus mrigala), collected from the River Chenab, in order to assess the effect of the toxicants on the quality of the fish meat. The levels of Cd, Hg, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr and Sn and of phenols from this river were significantly higher than the permissible limits set by the USEPA. Comet assays showed DNA damage in Cirrhinus mrigala collected from three different sampling sites in the polluted area of the river. Significant differences were observed for DNA damage through comet assay in fish collected from polluted compared to control sites. No significant differences were observed for DNA damage between farmed and fish collected from upstream. The micronucleus assay showed similar trends. Fish from the highly polluted sites showed less number of fatty acids and more saturated fatty acids in their meat compared to fish from less polluted areas. Several fatty acids were missing in fish with higher levels of DNA in comet tail and micronucleus induction. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) was found missing in the fish from polluted environment while it was found in considerable amount in farmed fish 7.8±0.4%. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) also showed significant differences as 0.1±0.0 and 7.0±0.1% respectively, in wild polluted and farmed fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCirrhinus mrigala 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3acadmium 3achromium 3acomet assay 3acopper 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aessential fatty acids 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afish meat 3alead 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amanganese 3ameat 3amercury 3aphenols 3apollution 3arivers 3asaturated fatty acids 3atin 3atoxic substances 3azinc1 aSultana, Tayyaba1 aSultana, Salma1 aAl-Ghanim, K.

Our objective was to assess the effect of β-carotene supplementation during the close-up dry period on the colostrum and calf. The study was conducted on a large commercial dairy farm in Indiana during early summer of 2015. Ninety-four multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by calving data, parity, and previous production, and then randomly assigned to either control or β-carotene (BC) treatments. While locked in headgates each morning, each cow received a topdress of β-carotene (Rovimix, DSM Nutritional Products, 8 g/d; provided 800 mg β-carotene) or carrier from 21 d before expected calving until calving. Colostrum was collected within 2 h of parturition. Calf blood samples were obtained within 2 h of birth before receiving the dam's colostrum, at 24 h after birth, and at 7 d and 60 d of age. Blood serum was analyzed for β-carotene, retinol, α-tocopherol, and other metabolites and enzymes. Colostrum was analyzed for β-carotene, retinol, α-tocopherol, colorimetry profile, and milk components. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models in SAS (SAS Institute Inc.). Calf serum β-carotene data were analyzed using the FREQ procedure. Colostrum β-carotene was higher for BC cows. Colostrum from BC cows had increased a* [measures red (positive) to green (negative)] and b* [measures yellow (positive) to blue (negative)] colorimeter values, indicating that β-carotene altered colostrum color toward red and yellow. Supplementation did not affect colostral or calf IgG concentrations. Colostrum color indices were correlated with IgG concentrations as well as concentrations of β-carotene, retinol, and α-tocopherol. Before receiving colostrum, the concentration of β-carotene in calf serum was below the detectable threshold of 0.05 μg/mL. At 24 h of age, the number of calves with detectable β-carotene concentrations increased, with more calves from BC cows (52.1%) having detectable concentrations than calves from cows in the control group (6.1%). No differences in concentrations of retinol or α-tocopherol were observed in calf serum. Supplementation of β-carotene to cows decreased activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and glutamate dehydrogenase in calf serum. In pregnant cows already receiving adequate vitamin A, supplementation of β-carotene increased concentration of β-carotene in colostrum, altered colostrum color, and increased serum β-carotene in calves at birth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aabsorption 3aalpha-tocopherol 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acolostrum 3acows 3adairy farming 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3ametabolites 3amilk 3aparturition 3asummer 3avitamin A 3aIndiana 0aβ-carotene 0atransition cow 0acolostrum 0acolor1 aEngstrom, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0959-93901 aDrackley, J.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4560-55940 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 June 28, dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-222103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017200166300001600338520183200354592002802186596006602214596005902280596005902339596006002398596006102458650001202519650002002531650001202551650001402563650002102577650001402598650001202612650002402624650001202648650001802660651001002678700002102688700002402709700001702733700002302750773012802773856008202901852000902983655001202992IND60586745520221122092025.0190824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058674552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3404-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhaoping10aRecovery succession drives the convergence, and grazing versus fencing drives the divergence of plant and soil N/P stoichiometry in a semiarid steppe of Inner Mongolia  ap. 303-314.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Understanding the plant and soil elemental stoichiometry during grassland dynamics is important for developing measures to enhance the restoration of degraded grassland. A number of restoration practices have been applied in the degraded typical steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia, either for research purpose or as actual restoration projects. However, the effects of different restoration measures on soil and plant N/P stoichiometry remain unclear. METHODS: Here we explored the effects of three restoration measures (i.e., natural recovery, NR; shallow ploughing, SP; and harrowing HA) on the N, P stoichiometry of plant and soil in a typical steppe of Inner Mongolia, by comparing plant and soil N, P content and N/P ratio among the grasslands restored through NA, SP and HA, and that under sustained animal grazing (GR). RESULTS: Long-term restoration increased aboveground plant biomass, litter accumulation and changed soil and plant N/P ratio. Soil N and P contents in restored grassland (NR, SP or HA) were higher than those under grazing (GR); the restored grasslands shared a common slope of N-P linear regression, which was significantly greater than that of grazing grassland. Plant N content and N/P ratio decreased firstly and then increased during the restoration of degraded grassland. CONCLUSION: Soil N limitation is greater than soil P limitation in typical steppe of Inner Mongolia. Soil N limitation is smaller in naturally recovered grassland and grazing grassland than in the restored grassland following shallow ploughing and harrowing. The restoration succession over 26-years after the exclusion of animal grazing have changed the N-P coupling relation in grassland soil, with a common N-P relation converged under grassland that are treated with different restoration measures.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015BAC02B04cNational Science and Technology Support Program  a2014CB138805cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2015ZD05cNatural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia  a2016M601291cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation (CN)  a2017MS0316cNatural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia 3aanimals 3agrassland soils 3agrazing 3aharrowing 3anitrogen content 3aphytomass 3aplowing 3aregression analysis 3asteppes 3astoichiometry 3aChina1 aBaoyin, Taogetao1 aMinggagud, Hugjiltu1 aSun, Haipeng1 aLi, Frank Yonghong0 tPlant and soil.g2017 Nov., v. 420, no. 1-2 p.303-314dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3404-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245016200208300001800370500001900388520163000407592002802037650001802065650001502083650001102098650001202109650003702121650001402158650002002172650002002192650001502212650001302227650001302240653002002253653002102273653001002294653000802304653003102312653000902343653000902352653000802361700005902369773013202428856008502560852000902645655001202654IND60740714120221118035304.0210604e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074071412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c002392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChua, Xien Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2455-949310aOvalbumin Antigen-Specific Activation of Human T Cell Receptor Closely Resembles Soluble Antibody Stimulation as Revealed by BOOST Phosphotyrosine Proteomics  ap. 3330-3344.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aActivation of the T cell receptor (TCR) leads to a network of early signaling predominantly orchestrated by tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells. The TCR is commonly activated using soluble anti-TCR antibodies, but this approach is not antigen-specific. Alternatively, activating the TCR using specific antigens of a range of binding affinities in the form of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is presumed to be more physiological. However, due to the lack of wide-scale phosphotyrosine (pTyr) proteomic studies directly comparing anti-TCR antibodies and pMHC, a comprehensive definition of these activated states remains enigmatic. Elucidation of the tyrosine phosphoproteome using quantitative pTyr proteomics enables a better understanding of the unique features of these activating agents and the role of ligand binding affinity on signaling. Here, we apply the recently established Broad-spectrum Optimization Of Selective Triggering (BOOST) to examine perturbations in tyrosine phosphorylation of human TCR triggered by anti-TCR antibodies and pMHC. Our data reveal that high-affinity ovalbumin (OVA) pMHC activation of the human TCR triggers a largely similar, albeit potentially stronger, pTyr-mediated signaling regulatory axis compared to the anti-TCR antibody. The signaling output resulting from OVA pMHC variants correlates well with their weaker affinities, enabling affinity-tunable control of signaling strength. Collectively, we provide a framework for applying BOOST to compare pTyr-mediated signaling pathways of human T cells activated in an antigen-independent and antigen-specific manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3ahumans 3aligands 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aovalbumin 3aphosphoproteome 3aphosphorylation 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3atyrosine 0aT cell receptor 0aT cell signaling 0aBOOST 0aTMT 0aphosphotyrosine proteomics 0apMHC 0aOT-1 0aOVA1 aSalomon, Arthur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7223-89960 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 May 21, v. 20, no. 6 p.3330-3344dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c002393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245010300175300002000278520109200298592002801390650001301418650001201431650001701443650001801460650003501478650002001513650002001533650001901553650001301572650001401585650003101599650001301630650001601643650003301659650001101692650001301703653001701716653001901733653002201752700006301774700006001837700005801897773014201955856007902097852000902176655001202185IND60687556620200511000000.0200424e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068755662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c011722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuadarrama Bello, Dainelys10aNanoporosity Stimulates Cell Spreading and Focal Adhesion Formation in Cells with Mutated Paxillin  ap. 14924-14932.  aWe have evaluated the response to nanotopography of CHO-K1 cells that express wild-type paxillin or paxillin with mutations at serine 273 that inhibit phosphorylation. Cells were grown on nanoporous and polished titanium surfaces. With all cell types, immunofluorescence showed that adhesion and spreading were minimally affected on the treated surface and that the actin filaments were more abundant and well-aligned. Scanning electron microscopy revealed changes in cell shape and abundant filopodia with lateral nanoprotrusions in response to nanoporosity. Gene expression of proteins associated with cellular adhesion and protrusions was significantly increased on the nanoporous surface regardless of the cell type. In particular, α-actinin, Rac1, Cdc42, and ITGα1 were upregulated in S273 cells with alanine substitutions, whereas FAK, Pxn, and Src were downregulated, leading to improved focal adhesion formation. These findings suggest that the surface nanoporosity can “compensate for” the genetic mutations that affect the biomechanical relationship of cells to surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalanine 3abiomechanics 3acell adhesion 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afocal adhesions 3agene expression 3amicrofilaments 3amutation 3ananopores 3aphosphorylation inhibition 3aproteins 3apseudopodia 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aserine 3atitanium 0ananoporosity 0afocal adhesion 0apaxillin mutation1 aFouillen, Aurélien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0326-99321 aBadia, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1026-41361 aNanci, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0616-843X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 12, no. 13 p.14924-14932dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c011723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003500145245009100180506002800271520126200299592002801561506003701589650001101626650001301637650002401650650002301674650001301697650002001710650001701730650001301747650001501760651001401775653002801789653002601817653002401843653003101867653001401898773009201912856008002004852000902084655001202093IND60764674620221207081452.0211122e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076467462DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2104152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraptosuwiryo, Titien Ngatinem10aAssessing the conservation status of tree fern Cibotium arachnoideum (C.

Cibotium arachnoideum (C.Chr.) Holttum (Cibotiaceae), is a large terrestrial fern with an upright or prostrate rhizome having densely shining reddish-brown of rigid hairs and one or two pairs of sori with two indusia forming a small cup on each lamina-segment. This tree fern is a rare species and strictly distributed in the Malesian region. The study aims to assess the conservation status of C. arachnoideum by using the 2012 IUCN Red List Catagories and Criteria (version 3.1.). Population size was estimated and observed both based on specimens deposited at the Herbarium Bogoriense (BO) and field studies in Sumatra. The area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is 44 km2. Cibotium arachnoideum is occurred in severely fragmented locations in the West Malesian region, in 2 locations, viz. Sumatra and Borneo. Sumatra has only two subpopulations, and Borneo has nine subpopulations. The number of mature individuals was only found 372 in one location of North Sumatra and 19 individuals in one location of Bengkulu. Therefore, C. arachnoideum is proposed as an endangered species, En: B2ab (i,ii,iii) + C2a (ii).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aCibotium 3aconservation status 3aendangered species 3aherbaria 3apopulation size 3arare species 3arhizomes 3atree ferns 3aIndonesia 0aarea of occupancy (aoo) 0acibotium arachnoideum 0aconservation status 0aextent of occurrence (eoo) 0atree fern0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Mar., v. 21, no. 4dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2104153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245008600201300002000287520136900307592002801676650001401704650001601718650001201734650001301746650001101759650001601770653004001786653003601826653002401862653002101886653001901907653001701926700001101943700001701954700001101971700001801982773014202000856007802142852000902220655001202229IND60687556820221123032410.0200401e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068755682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c011792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1585-517010aStudy on the Twisted and Coiled Polymer Actuator with Strain Self-Sensing Ability  ap. 15716-15725.  aTwisted and coiled polymer actuators (TCAs) are a kind of efficient artificial muscles, which have good prospects for application in soft robots, bionic devices, and biological, medical, and other high-tech fields. However, the inability to dynamically sense and adjust the strain of the actuator will lead to uncertainty in the accuracy of deformation and strain, resulting in imprecise target action. Herein, TCAs with strain self-sensing ability (TCASA) are prepared by integrating the stretchable optomechanical film (SOMF) sensors into TCAs, which provides a simple strategy for dynamical strain sensing. These SOMFs have a wide range of color changes during deformation of TCAs, and the strain is perceived by observing the color change according to the corresponding relationship between color change and strain. Furthermore, the proposed TCASA maintain excellent cycling stability of strain self-sensing during cyclic tests (200 cycles) and excellent strain self-sensing performance to perform strain control compared to TCAs without SOMFs. The results indicate that the proposed structure is a promising soft actuator with excellent strain self-sensing ability, which is well suited for soft robots, bionic devices, biological and medical fields, smart wearable technologies, and so forth, especially when controlled, repetitive deformations are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3adeformation 3amuscles 3apolymers 3arobots 3auncertainty 0atwisted and coiled polymer actuator 0astretchable optomechanical film 0astrain self-sensing 0astructural color 0ananoimprinting 0acolor change1 aXu, Bo1 aZhang, Yakun1 aLi, Bo1 aChen, Hualing0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 12, no. 13 p.15716-15725dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c011793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011700166300001600283520066600299592002800965650001200993650001501005650001501020650001401035650001401049650002201063653002701085653002101112653002201133653001301155653002001168700002401188773011001212856008201322852000901404655001201413IND60564503520221120111353.0170713e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056450352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2015.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWentrup, Curt10aPyrolysis of annelated hexa- and heptamethylene-tetrazoles: Formation of 9- and 10-membered cyclic carbodiimides  ap. 214-219.  aA reinterpretation of the spectroscopic data for the products of flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) of 8- and 9-membered polymethylenetetrazoles 1, 3, 5, and 7 with annelated benzene rings indicates that these are not cyanamides 2, 4, 6, and 8, but 9- and 10-membered cyclic carbodiimides 9, 10, 11, and 12.

The following solvent systems were tested for extraction: direct methylation (CH₃OH/CH₃COCl/hexane); n-hexane; acetone; ethanol/water; hexane/ethanol; and direct saponification (KOH and ethanol). Direct methylation was performed as control of extraction yields and to evaluate the possible use of these fats as biodiesel. Insect lipids were extracted by ethanol in a similar extent as did other tested organic solvents, while direct methylation of the biomass provided the highest yields. L. sericata and Z. morio contained high percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids; A. aegyptium and L. migratoria were two polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched species, while H. illucens and Z. morio showed high proportions of medium-chain fatty acids. All extracted fats might be used in the alimentary industry, as evidenced by their low cholesterol content, as well as for biodiesel obtainment, as suggested by computed saponification, iodine and cetane values. Samples of H. illucens and L. migratoria showed exceptional cetane numbers (64.8 and 60.7, respectively), and all tested species except A. aegyptium exhibited an exceptional fatty acid profile for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcheta 3aAnacridium 3aHermetia illucens 3aLocusta migratoria 3aLucilia sericata 3aTenebrio molitor 3aacetone 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acholesterol 3aethanol 3afatty acid composition 3afood research 3afuel production 3ahexane 3ainsects 3aiodine 3amedium chain fatty acids 3amethylation 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apotassium hydroxide 3asaponification 3asolvents1 aGonzález-Fernández, María José1 aSánchez-Muros-Lozano, María José1 aGarcía-Barroso, Fernando1 aGuil-Guerrero, José Luis0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2016 Sept., v. 242, no. 9 p.1471-1477dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-016-2647-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008900171300001600260520200300276592002802279650001402307650001502321650001502336650001202351650001702363650001502380650001502395650002102410650001402431650002502445650001102470650001702481650001502498650002102513650001002534650001502544651001302559700003302572700002402605700002802629773009102657856008102748852000902829655001202838IND60517817420221117172548.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051781742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-015-1220-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoungparn, Sasitorn10aFine root production in three zones of secondary mangrove forest in eastern Thailand  ap. 467-474.  aKEY MESSAGE : High root productions, especially in the fine roots, estimated by ingrowth cores were confirmed in mangrove forests. The zonal variation in root production was caused by inundation regime and soil temperature. Mangrove forests have high net primary productivity (NPP), and it is well known that these trees allocate high amounts of biomass to their root systems. In particular, fine root production (FRP) comprises a large component of the NPP. However, information on root production remains scarce. We studied FRP in three zones (Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus) of a mangrove forest in eastern Thailand using ingrowth cores (0–30 cm of soil depth). The root biomass and necromass were periodically harvested from the cores and weighed during the one-year study. The FRP was determined by summation of the fine root biomass (FRB) and root necromass. The results showed that the FRB clearly increased in the wet and cool dry seasons. Magnitude of FRB in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones was 1171.07 and 764.23 g/m²/30 cm, respectively. The lowest FRB (292.74 g/m²/30 cm) was recorded in the Avicennia zone locating on the river edge where there is a greater frequency of inundation than the other zones. Root necromass was high in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones, and accumulated noticeably when soil temperatures rapidly declined during the middle of the wet season to cool dry season. However, root necromass in the Avicennia zone varied within a small range. We attributed the small accumulation of root necromass in the Avicennia zone to the relative high soil temperature that likely caused a high root decomposition rate. The average FRP (3.403–4.079 ton/ha/year) accounted for 74.4, 81.5, and 92.4 % of the total root production in the Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zone, respectively. The root production and causative factors (i.e., soil temperature and inundation regime) are discussed in relation to the carbon cycle of a mangrove forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia 3aRhizophora 3aXylocarpus 3abiomass 3acarbon cycle 3adry season 3afine roots 3amangrove forests 3anecromass 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3aroot systems 3asoil depth 3asoil temperature 3atrees 3awet season 3aThailand1 aCharoenphonphakdi, Thanyalak1 aSangtiean, Tanuwong1 aPatanaponpaiboon, Pipat0 tTrees.g2016 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.467-474dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1220-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245008800205300001600293506007600309520163700385592002802022506003702050650001702087650001102104650001902115650001102134650001402145650001402159650001502173650000902188650001202197650002602209650004402235650002002279650002902299650001602328700001402344700001902358700001702377700001902394773012502413856008102538852000902619655001202628IND60573867120221207122449.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057386712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-016-9996-82doi7 aPMC54448172pmcid7 a277964532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shiyue10aLC-MS/MS analysis of permethylated N-glycans facilitating isomeric characterization  ap. 453-466.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe biosynthesis of glycans is a template-free process; hence compositionally identical glycans may contain highly heterogeneous structures. Meanwhile, the functions of glycans in biological processes are significantly influenced by the glycan structure. Structural elucidation of glycans is an essential component of glycobiology. Although NMR is considered the most powerful approach for structural glycan studies, it suffers from low sensitivity and requires highly purified glycans. Although mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods have been applied in numerous glycan structure studies, there are challenges in preserving glycan structure during ionization. Permethylation is an efficient derivatization method that improves glycan structural stability. In this report, permethylated glycans are isomerically separated; thus facilitating structural analysis of a mixture of glycans by LC-MS/MS. Separation by porous graphitic carbon liquid chromatography at high temperatures in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry (PGC-LC-MS/MS) was utilized for unequivocal characterization of glycan isomers. Glycan fucosylation sites were confidently determined by eliminating fucose rearrangement and assignment of diagnostic ions, achieved by permethylation and PGC-LC at high temperatures, respectively. Assigning monosaccharide residues to specific glycan antennae was also achieved. Galactose linkages were also distinguished from each other by CID/HCD tandem MS. This was attainable because of the different bond energies associated with monosaccharide linkages.

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations [all results refer to wet weight (ww)] of 3.2–320 µg/kg were detected in all 40 fox livers tested, yielding an arithmetic mean of 46.6 µg/kg and a median of 29.8 µg/kg. Long-chain PFAAs were detected at concentrations of 1.7 µg/kg perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) to 2.4 µg/kg perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA). Of the short-chain PFAAs tested, only perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was found in 1 fox liver at a concentration of 1.4 µg/kg, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) was found in 2 fox livers at a concentration of 1 µg/kg each. PFOS and PFNA concentrations higher than limit of quantification (LOQ) were detected in 90.9 and 81.8 % of chamois livers, respectively. The arithmetic mean for PFOS concentrations was 2.2 µg/kg (median 2.4 µg/kg), a factor of 21 (median factor of 12) lower than in fox livers. The arithmetic mean for PFNA concentrations was 2.0 µg/kg (median 1.9 µg/kg). Perfluorobutanoic acid, PFHxA, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorobutanesulfonate, and PFHxS were not detected at concentrations higher than the LOQ in any of the samples. The various results are compared with one another and with the results of other studies of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous wild animals. The highest concentrations of PFAA, in particular PFOS, were found in omnivorous animals followed by carnivores. The lowest levels were present in herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3achamois 3aherbivores 3afoxes 3awild animals 3acarnivores 3aomnivores 3aarithmetics 3aVulpes vulpes 3aGermany 3aAustria 0aarithmetic1 aFalk, Sandy1 aGeorgii, Sebastian1 aBrunn, Hubertus1 aFailing, Klaus1 aStahl, Thorsten0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 July, v. 71, no. 1 p.7-15dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0250-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245007800208300001800286506007600304520052300380592002800903506003700931650001900968650001100987650002500998700002201023700001701045700002101062700002101083700002101104773012701125856008001252852000901332655001201341IND60128080920221207132114.0150501e20150226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012808092DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.01387-142doi7 aPMC42909902pmcid7 a255739372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomaki, Hisayuki10aDraft Genome Sequences of Six Type Strains of the Genus Streptacidiphilus  ap. e01387-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of the genus Streptacidiphilus are acidophilic actinomycetes with streptomycete-like features.

A total of five different transgenic lines were obtained. All transgenic lines were shown to be stably transformed and originate from different transgenic events. The transgenic lines express the FB_MR5 either driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter and the ocs terminator or by its native promoter and terminator sequences. Phenotyping experiments were performed with Mr5‐virulent and Mr5‐avirulent strains of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight. Significantly less disease symptoms were detected on transgenic lines after inoculation with two different Mr5‐avirulent E. amylovora strains, while significantly more shoot necrosis was observed after inoculation with the Mr5‐virulent mutant strain ZYRKD3_1. The results of these experiments demonstrated the ability of a single gene isolated from the native gene pool of apple to protect a susceptible cultivar from fire blight. Furthermore, this gene is confirmed to be the resistance determinant of Mr5 as the transformed lines undergo the same gene‐for‐gene interaction in the host–pathogen relationship Mr5–E. amylovora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErwinia amylovora 3aapples 3acultivars 3agene pool 3agenes 3amutants 3anecrosis 3aphenotype 3ashoots 3aterminator regions1 aWöhner, Thomas1 aFahrentrapp, Johannes1 aKost, Thomas D.1 aFlachowsky, H.q(Henryk),1 aPeil, Andreas1 aHanke, Maria‐Viola1 aRichter, Klaus1 aPatocchi, Andrea1 aGessler, Cesare0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 Aug., v. 12, no. 6 p.728-733dBlackwell Pub.wJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.121773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011500165300001400280500001500294520128200309592002801591650002501619650002201644650002201666650001401688650000901702650001601711650002101727650001901748650001201767650001901779650001101798650001801809650001101827653001201838700001701850700001901867700001501886700002101901773012001922856004102042852000902083655001202092IND50061732620221116155146.0130320e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006173262DNAL7 a10.1007/BF032631392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEswara Reddyl, N.

The Agrobacterium construct pBI101 used in the studies consists of the reporter gene gus under the control of Arabidopsis thaliana dhdps promoter with 3’ nos controlling sequences and nptll gene under the control of nos promoter and nos terminator. GUS expression in transformed Arabidopsis thaliana was found to be cell type-specific and expressed mainly in the fast growing tissues, where the protein synthesis is high. The histochemical analysis results indicate that the GUS expression was mainly observed in root meristem (elongation zone), emerging lateral roots and in the leaf vascular tissues. In reproductive organs, the GUS expression was observed in anthers, pollen grains and young immature embryos. Southern blot analysis results of T₂, progeny showed the presence of a single integration locus for both the nptll and dhdps promoter.The segregation analysis results showed that the kanamycin resistance gene has not followed the normal Mendelian inheritance.This might be due to the methylation of the nptll gene in some of the transformants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSouthern blotting 3aprotein synthesis 3akanamycin 3aloci 3amethylation 3avascular tissues 3aroot meristems 3aprogeny 3areporter genes 3apollen 3aAgrobacterium 3aleaves 0aanthers1 aAnuradha, M.1 aVauterin, Marc1 aJacobs, M.1 aOliver, David J.0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2002 July, v. 11, no. 2 p.73-77dSpringer-Verlagx0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03263139  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001200283520121600295592002801511650003101539650001401570650001501584650001901599650001501618650001501633650001101648650002101659650001401680650002301694650001001717650001601727650001501743650002401758650001301782650001001795650001301805650001301818651001201831700002401843700003401867773012101901856008102022852000902103655001202112IND60523338620221119164140.0160614e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052333862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-015-0260-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrock, John W.10aUrinary Phthalate Metabolites in American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from Selected Florida Wetlands  ap. 1-6.  aPhthalates have been shown to cause endocrine disruption in laboratory animals and are associated with altered development of the reproductive system in humans. Further, human have significant exposure to phthalates. However, little is known concerning the exposure of wildlife to phthalates. We report urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations from fifty juvenile alligators from three Florida lakes and a site in the Everglades. Urinary phthalate monoester concentrations varied widely among alligators from the different sites but also among alligators from the same site. Mono-2-ethylhexy phthalate and monobutyl phthalate were found in most samples of alligator urine with maximums of 35,700 ng/mL and 193 ng/mL, respectively. Monobenzyl phthalate was found in 5 alligators with a maximum of 66.7 ng/mL. Other monoesters were found in only one or two alligator urine samples. The wide variation within and among sites, in addition to the high levels of mEHP, mBP and mBzP, is consistent with exposure arising from the intermittent spraying of herbicide formulations to control invasive aquatic plants in Florida freshwater sites. Phthalate diesters are used as adjuvants in many of these formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3aadjuvants 3aalligators 3aaquatic plants 3afreshwater 3aherbicides 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory animals 3alakes 3ametabolites 3aphthalates 3areproductive system 3aspraying 3aurine 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aFlorida1 aBell, Jane Margaret1 aGuillette, Louis J., Jr.cJr.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 July, v. 71, no. 1 p.1-6dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0260-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245014000157300001600297520100500313592002801318596007801346650001001424650002601434650002701460650002001487650001301507700001401520700002001534700001801554700002101572773015501593856007701748852000901825655001201834IND60772716320221118004021.0220409s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077271632DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.125492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chi12aA Novel Method for Measuring the Color of Edible Oil on the Lovibond Scale Based on Spectral Detection and Convolutional Neural Network  ap. 839-847.  aA fast, high-precision method for measuring the color of edible oil on the Lovibond scale was developed and validated. It involves two components: spectral detection and data processing. The former was used for measuring the edible oil’s transmission spectrum in the visible range. The latter included a logarithmic method and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for calculating the color value from the transmission spectrum. The logarithmic method converted the multiplicative combination of spectra to an additive combination, which greatly improved the performance. A CNN with three convolutional layers was developed using Tensorflow. Validation tests of the method using ten different oil types showed a maximum error of 0.5, average error of 0.32, and error variance of 0.04. Thus, the proposed method can meet the needs of the edible oil industry, and it has great application potential.

The three reaches present, respectively, canyon, transition, and floodplain landscapes. The resulting data were used to compute the flow resistance. A downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that the exponent describing the velocity increases with the discharge and that these values were between 0.3043 and 0.3507. A downstream hydraulic geometry analysis indicates that changes in velocity with discharge are greater than the rate of change of width or depth. It is typically found in steep mountain streams laterally confined, and it was verified in the canyon reach. However, despite the transition presents a considerable lateral constriction and the floodplain reach presents mountain river characteristics, both reaches did not present such behavior. The findings are coherent with other mountain river datasets, although the Boi River presents distinct geomorphic units such as glide-runs. In contrast, other available datasets are usually characterized by step-pool channels. Flow resistance in the canyon and transition reaches differ in many ways from floodplain reach, indicating larger resistance inside the canyon than outside, probably related to the landform and grain size in the canyon. Regression analysis of the combined field dataset indicated that dimensionless unit discharge is an important independent variable to explain variations in velocity and flow resistance. We also verified that the use of Rickenmann's Equation can be helpful to estimate velocity in canyon rivers. Our findings include: i) canyon landscape presents higher friction factors than floodplain landscape; and ii) canyon and transition landscapes are similar in terms of flow resistance during high-flow conditions, while floodplain present remarkably differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aequations 3afloodplains 3aflow resistance 3afriction 3ageometry 3ahydrology 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3aBrazil 0aCanyon river 0aFriction factor 0aFlow resistance1 aKobiyama, Masato0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct., v. 613 p.128428-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1284283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008700173520111500260592002801375650002801403650001901431650003001450650002201480650002601502650002801528650002701556650001601583650001401599650001301613650001701626650001101643650001401654650001101668650001401679653001401693653001301707653001401720653001101734653002401745653001901769653002201788700002401810700002901834700002401863773011901887856008502006852000902091655001202100IND60719540920221122074401.0220103e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071954092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2020.1405772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, Vanina E.10aUpdate on relevant trypanosome peptidases: Validated targets and future challenges  aTrypanosoma cruzi, the agent of the American Trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the agents of Sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT), as well as Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the agent of the cattle disease nagana, contain cysteine, serine, threonine, aspartyl and metallo peptidases. The most abundant among these enzymes are the cysteine proteases from the Clan CA, the Cathepsin L-like cruzipain and rhodesain, and the Cathepsin B-like enzymes, which have essential roles in the parasites and thus are potential targets for chemotherapy. In addition, several other proteases, present in one or both parasites, have been characterized, and some of them are also promising candidates for the developing of new drugs. Recently, new inhibitors, with good selectivity for the parasite proteasomes, have been described and are very promising as lead compounds for the development of new therapies for these neglected diseases.

However, recent investigations have shown that other species, including passerine songbirds, may also be at risk from exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). We quantified Hg concentrations in eggs of two species of songbirds, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), nesting in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA. Geometric mean concentrations of total Hg (THg) were lower in red-winged blackbird eggs [218 and 107 ng/g dry weight (dw) for 2012 and 2013, respectively] than in tree swallow eggs (228 and 300 ng/g dw for 2012 and 2013, respectively), presumably reflecting differences in the trophic positions of these two species. Concentrations of MeHg averaged 98.4 % of THg in red-winged blackbird eggs. Levels of THg observed in this study were well below critical toxicological benchmarks commonly applied to eggs of avian species, suggesting these breeding populations were not adversely affected by exposure to MeHg. In red-winged blackbirds, concentrations of THg in eggs collected in 2012 were twice those in eggs collected in 2013. Hg levels in eggs of both species increased with date of clutch initiation. In red-winged blackbirds, for example, temporal patterns showed that a 3-week delay in clutch initiation increased egg THg by 60 %. These observations indicate that in ovo exposure of wetland birds to MeHg can vary significantly within nesting season as well as between years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgelaius phoeniceus 3aTachycineta bicolor 3aaquatic food webs 3abreeding 3aeggs 3afish 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3anational parks 3anesting 3apiscivores 3arisk 3asongbirds 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aMinnesota1 aRolfhus, Kristofer R.1 aWiener, James G.1 aWindels, Steve K.1 aCuster, Thomas W.1 aDummer, Paul M.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 July, v. 71, no. 1 p.16-25dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-016-0263-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245011500202300001800317506007600335520034500411592002800756506003700784650002400821650002000845650001100865650002900876650002500905650001400930650001300944650001100957700001800968700001900986700001901005700001801024700001901042773012701061856008001188852000901268655001201277IND60128081120221207133913.0150501e20150226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012808112DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.01389-142doi7 aPMC43195982pmcid7 a256572652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEe, Robson10aGenome Sequences of Two Pandoraea pnomenusa Isolates Recovered 11 Months Apart from a Cystic Fibrosis Patient  ap. e01389-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPandoraea is an emerging respiratory pathogen capable of causing chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), but the clinical significance of this infection is ambiguous.

However, the traditional decision-making methods are either completely subjective or neglect the decision-maker's preferences, making it essential to optimize these methods to address such unsatisfactory aspects. Therefore, through drawing on some universally acknowledged economic theories and studying the geometric relationships among the Pareto solutions to such multi-objective decision-making problems, the concepts of “replacement rate”, “profit-loss sensitivity ratio”, and “preference equilibrium degree” are introduced, deduced, and elaborated on in this paper. On the basis of them, the preference decision method (PDM), entrusted with strict mathematical and physical connotations, is constructed and derived in detail, especially for addressing the bi-objective and tri-objective scenarios. The PDM can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among various targets, providing objective support for decision-makers in the subjective trade-offs of the interests of multiple subjects and achieving the unity of subjective and objective. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to the Wujiang cascade reservoirs in China, through which the benefits of power generation, water supply and ecological protection are enabled to be considered simultaneously. The application shows that the PDM can effectively shrink the Pareto set, which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision-making, and the obtained results prove feasible and satisfactory. In addition, the PDM is based entirely on the Pareto set itself, making it simple to utilize, and can be extended into solving other multi-objective decision-making problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3ageometry 3ahydrology 3apower generation 3awater supply 3aChina 0aMulti-objective decision-making 0aTrade-off 0aPreference 0aReservoir operation 0aUtility 0aGini coefficient 0aRR 0aPLSR 0aN-PLSR 0aPD 0aPA 0aPV 0aPED 0aPG 0aWSGR 0aESD1 aDong, Zengchuan1 aJiang, Yong1 aXie, Wei1 aYao, Hongyi1 aChen, Mufeng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct., v. 613 p.128430-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1284303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245009700206300001400303506007600317520188400393592002802277506003702305650002002342650002702362650002002389650001102409650001302420650001302433650001502446650001902461650001402480650001002494650001902504650001402523650001302537651001202550700002002562700002302582700002002605700002202625773012302647856008102770852000902851655001202860IND60523338820221207105105.0160614e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052333882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-016-0264-x2doi7 aPMC69938412pmcid7 a268332022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Viet D.10aBioaccumulation of Legacy and Emerging Organochlorine Contaminants in Lumbriculus variegatus  ap. 60-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFreshwater sediment-dwelling Lumbriculus variegatus is known to serve as a vector for the transfer of contaminants from sediments to higher trophic level organisms, but limited data exist on the bioaccumulation of chemicals associated with sediments containing high total organic carbon (TOC). In the current study, sediments from the north shore area of Lake Apopka (Florida, USA), containing very high TOC [39 % (w/w)], were spiked with four chemicals—p,p′-dichlorordiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), dieldrin, fipronil, and triclosan—individually or in a mixture of the four and then used for bioaccumulation studies. Tissue concentrations of chemicals in L. variegatus were measured at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of exposure, and the bioaccumulation potential was evaluated using biosediment accumulation factors [BSAF (gₒc/gₗᵢₚᵢd)]. Increase in total body burdens of all four chemicals in L. variegatus was rapid at day 2 and reached a steady-state level after 7 days in both single and mixture experiments. Tissue concentrations of fipronil peaked after 2 days and then decreased by 70 % in sediment experiments suggesting that in addition to the degradation of fipronil that occurred in the sediment, L. variegatus may also be able to metabolize fipronil. The calculated 28-day BSAF values varied among the chemicals and increased in the order fipronil (1.1) < triclosan (1.4) < dieldrin (21.8) < p,p′-DDE (49.8) in correspondence with the increasing degree of their hydrophobicity. The relatively high BSAF values for p,p′-DDE and dieldrin probably resulted from lower-than-expected sorption of chemicals to sediment organic matter either due to the nature of the plant-derived organic matter, as a result of the relatively short equilibration time among the various compartments, or due to ingestion of sediment particles by the worms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aLumbriculus variegatus 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3adieldrin 3afipronil 3afreshwater 3ahydrophobicity 3aingestion 3alakes 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3asorption 3aFlorida1 aKroll, Kevin J.1 aSupowit, Samuel D.1 aHalden, Rolf U.1 aDenslow, Nancy D.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 July, v. 71, no. 1 p.60-69dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-016-0264-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245005300164300001600217520205800233592002802291650001502319650001302334650001802347650001402365650001002379650001102389650001502400650001802415650002102433650000702454650000902461650002002470700001802490700001802508773011002526856008202636852000902718655001202727IND60100904320221121232355.0141105e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010090432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Stanley10aCleansing dynamics of oily soil using nanofluids  ap. 293-306.  aWe explored the technological concept of the nanoparticle structuring in the wedge film with regards to its application to the oily soil removal phenomena. The experimental and theoretical investigations on the cleansing of canola oil from a glass substrate using commercially available nanofluids were pursued. Five commercially-available nanofluids with pHs varying from 9.3 to 9.9 were used in the experiments. Experimental results clearly indicated that the time to separate the oily soil from the glass surfaces by nanofluids was much shorter than that for the reference alkaline solution at the same pH. The positive contributions of the nanoparticles to the soil cleaning performance were rationalized in terms of the decrease in the contact angle and the interfacial tension, positive second virial coefficient, and high osmotic pressure of the nanofluid. The effective nanoparticle diameter and the effective volume (i.e., concentration) of the nanoparticles were determined using our novel capillary force balance technique in conjunction with the microinterferometric method. Using the experimentally measured values of the effective particle diameter, effective volume, and the osmotic pressure, the structural disjoining pressure in the wedge film was calculated from a theoretical model based on the statistical mechanics theory. The experimental data for the oil cleaning performance correlated well with the calculated values of the disjoining pressure, the spreading coefficient, and the film tension. We used the drop profile analysis based on the Laplace equation augmented with the extra term of the disjoining pressure to theoretically analyze the nanofluid spreading and wetting phenomena, and the detachment of the oil drop from the solid surface. These results confirm the novel mechanism of detergency using nanofluids based on the normal force (i.e., structural disjoining pressure) arising from the ordered nanoparticle structure formation in the confined space between the soil and the solid substrate (i.e., the wedge film).  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3acleaning 3acontact angle 3aequations 3aglass 3amodels 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3aosmotic pressure 3apH 3asoil 3asurface tension1 aNikolov, Alex1 aWasan, D.

As a model of infectious disease-related small DNA molecules, the spike glycoprotein (S) gene of the Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus was amplified using reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction. The amplified product of the FIP virus (223-bp) was analyzed within 10s by single-channel ME under a sieving gel of 0.3% poly(ethylene oxide) (Mᵣ=8,000,000) in 1x TBE buffer (pH 8.33) and a short effective channel length of 1.3cm with a programmed step electric field strength (PSEFS) condition as follows: 470.6V/cm for 9s, 294.1V/cm 1.5s, and 470.6V/cm for 9.5s. The single-channel ME/PSEFS method was 50 times faster than that obtained with conventional slab gel electrophoresis. When the single-channel ME method was applied to a multi-channel ME for high-throughput screening, the precision of migration time and peak area showed standard deviations of less than 1.0% without any loss of resolving power. The ME assay technique provides a simple, precise and accurate method for ultra-fast analysis of infectious disease-related DNA under 400-bp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aelectric field 3aethylene oxide 3afeline infectious peritonitis 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3amodels 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asieving 3aviruses1 aNan, He1 aLee, Mi-Jin1 aKang, Seong Ho0 tTalanta.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 106 p.388-393dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2013.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014600174300001600320520125600336592002801592650001601620650001301636650001401649650001601663650002301679650001201702650001401714650001001728650001601738700001601754700001501770773008301785856008901868990002301957852000901980655001201989IND60104282920221119130917.0141107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010428292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.measurement.2012.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingquan14aThe application and research of high-frequency ultrasonic reflection technique used in the measurement of small diameter’s tube cavity size  ap. 521-526.  aBased on the problems that the photoelectric detection method and the X-ray testing method cannot provide the ideal accuracy when they are applicated to detect the cavity of small workpiece with diameter Φ6mm and the general probes cannot stretch to the internal of the workpiece, we propose a high-frequency ultrasonic reflection technique which is used to measure the cavity size of diameter tube. The method uses ultrasound to measure the thickness. It can extract information about the wall size of workpiece through signal processing, feature extraction and other methods. By using this information, we can measure the size of cavity. Compared with the test results showed by a venire caliper and screw micrometer, we can get the conclusion that the immersion focusing probe with center frequency of 10MHz can accurately detect the cavity of the workpiece. The experiment shows that the method gives consideration to the accuracy and computational efficiency of the workpiece’s cavity parameters. It can get data supplely and effectively. There are other advantages of this method such as stable performance, easy installation, and lower power consumption and penetration ability. It is suitable for the precision measurement of the workpiece.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaccuracy 3adetection 3ameasurement 3aprobes (equipment) 3atesting 3athickness 3atubes 3aultrasonics1 aHan, Deshui1 aLi, Shilin0 tMeasurement.g2013 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.521-526dElsevier Ltdx0263-22417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300001400265520129900279592002801578650002501606650001601631650001101647650001901658650002101677650001301698650002101711650001801732650001401750700001701764700002001781773010301801856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60101824720221121231755.0141106e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010182472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManjula, S.10aFlux behavior in a hydrophobic dense membrane with undiluted and hexane-diluted vegetable oils  ap. 43-47.  aThe flux behavior of a hydrophobic dense membrane (NTGS-2200) with polydimethylsiloxane as active layer and polyimide as support layer was studied with various vegetable oils under undiluted and hexane-diluted conditions. Hexane dilution improved the permeate oil flux in all the vegetable oils by at least one order of magnitude and applied pressure increased the total flux as well as oil flux. The dense membrane did not reject triglycerides (TG) over a wide range of hexane dilution (5–80% oil concentration) and operating pressure (0.5–4MPa) due to a positive flow coupling with hexane. All the oils exhibited an inverse relationship between viscosity and total flux under undiluted and various levels of hexane-diluted conditions. The results revealed that the oil flux followed an inverse relationship with average molecular weights of TG despite their narrow range (670–961Da) of existence in various vegetable oils, interestingly even under hexane-diluted conditions. Although both viscosity and TG molecular weight showed good correlation with permeate flux, the latter displayed a much better correlation hitherto unexplored and unexploited. This remarkable observation could be supportive in characterizing hydrophobic dense membranes specifically for nonaqueous applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acorrelation 3ahexane 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3apressure 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetable oil 3aviscosity1 aNabetani, H.1 aSubramanian, R.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 366, no. 1-2 p.43-47dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167300001800299520039000317592002800707650002500735650002300760650002300783650002000806650002200826650002000848650002600868650002500894650001400919700001300933773009700946856008401043852000901127655001201136IND60109955220221117072328.0141109e20120711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jinyu10aChemical synthesis of bioactive siRNA in solution phase by using 2-(azidomethyl)benzoyl as 3′-hydroxyl group protecting group  ap. 3654-3657.  aA protecting group AZMB was introduced to ribonucleosides 3′-hydroxyl group to facilitate solution phase synthesis of siRNA.

As a well-recognized human carcinogen, its carcinogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood. Previous studies have emphasized on genetic changes. However, little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms of FA exposure. In this study, We not only characterized the epigenomic response to long-term low-dose FA exposure in 16HBE cells, but also examined the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and the methyl-CpG-binding protein DNA-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2). Each week the 16HBE cells were treated with 10μM FA for 24h (h). After 24 weeks (W) of exposure to FA, the level of genomic DNA methylation gradually decreased in a time-related manner. Moreover, our results showed that FA exposure down-regulated the expression of DNMT3a and DNMT3b at both mRNA and protein level, and up-regulated the levels of DNMT1 and MBD2 at both mRNA and protein level. Our study indicated that long-term FA exposure could disrupt genomic DNA methylation, which may be one of the possible underlying carcinogenic mechanisms of FA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA-binding domains 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aair 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinogens 3aepigenetics 3aformaldehyde 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3along term effects 3amessenger RNA 3amethyltransferases 3apollutants 3avolatile organic compounds1 aYang, Linqing1 aGong, Chunmei1 aTao, Gonghua1 aHuang, Haiyan1 aLiu, Jianjun1 aZhang, Huimin1 aWu, Desheng1 aXia, Bo1 aHu, Gonghua1 aWang, Kunpeng1 aZhuang, Zhixiong0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Sept. 10, v. 205, no. 3 p.235-240dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.05.10393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012700165300001600292520217900308592002802487650001202515650001202527650001302539650001102552650001602563650001502579650002602594650001602620650001702636650000902653650001102662650001202673650001302685650002602698650000902724650001702733650002202750650001502772650000902787651001002796653002602806653003402832653001002866653002302876653002402899700001502923700001602938700002302954700001802977700001802995700002403013773010703037856008403144852000903228655001203237IND60111682620221120151310.0160903e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yong10aAccumulation and health risk of heavy metals in vegetables from harmless and organic vegetable production systems of China  ap. 324-330.  aHeavy metal accumulation in vegetables is a growing concern for public health. Limited studies have elucidated the heavy metal accumulation characteristics and health risk of different vegetables produced in different facilities such as greenhouses and open-air fields and under different management modes such as harmless and organic. Given the concern over the aforementioned factors related to heavy metal accumulation, this study selected four typical greenhouse vegetable production bases, short-term harmless greenhouse vegetable base (SHGVB), middle-term harmless greenhouse vegetable base (MHGVB), long-term harmless greenhouse vegetable base (LHGVB), and organic greenhouse vegetable base (OGVB), in Nanjing City, China to study heavy metal accumulation in different vegetables and their associated health risks. Results showed that soils and vegetables from SHGVB and OGVB apparently accumulated fewer certain heavy metals than those from other bases, probably due to fewer planting years and special management, respectively. Greenhouse conditions significantly increased certain soil heavy metal concentrations relative to open-air conditions. However, greenhouse conditions did not significantly increase concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Zn in leaf vegetables. In fact, under greenhouse conditions, Pb accumulation was effectively reduced. The main source of soil heavy metals was the application of large amounts of low-grade fertilizer. There was larger health risk for producers′ children to consume vegetables from the three harmless vegetable bases than those of residents′ children. The hazard index (HI) over a large area exceeded 1 for these two kinds of children in the MHGVB and LHGVB. There was also a slight risk in the SHGVB for producers′ children solely. However, the HI of the whole area of the OGVB for two kinds of children was below 1, suggesting low risk of heavy metal exposure through the food chain. Notably, the contribution rate of Cu and Zn to the HI were high in the four bases, yet current Chinese standards provide no limit for the concentrations of Cu and Zn; thus a potential health risk concerning these metals exists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achildren 3acopper 3afertilizers 3afood chain 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaves 3amercury 3aplanting 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3asoil texture 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3azinc 3aChina 0aGreenhouse vegetables 0aManagement and planting years 0aSoils 0aHeavy metal source 0aSpatial variability1 aHu, Wenyou1 aHuang, Biao1 aWeindorf, David C.1 aRajan, Nithya1 aLiu, Xiaoxiao1 aNiedermann, Silvana0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 98 p.324-330dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245006900181300001600250520156600266592002801832650003701860650001501897650002501912650001701937650002801954650000901982650002601991650001902017650000702036650001302043650001102056650001802067650002002085700001902105700001702124700002702141700002102168773011002189856008202299852000902381655001202390IND60100904420221121225023.0141105e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010090442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.12.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuriyanarayanan, Subramanian10aProtein-resistant hyperbranched polyethyleneimine brush surfaces  ap. 307-315.  aA novel hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified gold surface has been designed, fabricated, and investigated with respect to its ability to resist non-specific adsorption of proteins. The facile synthesis strategy, based on self-assembly, involves immobilization of polyethyleneimine to gold surfaces modified with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MuDA) monolayers using traditional carbodiimide chemistry. The hyperbranched polymer brushes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and ellipsometry measurements showed the thickness of the PEI brushes increases with adsorption solution ionic strength. Polymer brush surface concentrations can be improved from 2560 to 3880chains/μm² by changing the ionic strength of the adsorption solution (PBS) by varying NaCl concentration from 0 to 650mM. Protein adsorption (pH 7.4) was evaluated under flow injection analysis (FIA) conditions using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The PEI brushes suppress protein adsorption, for example, cytochrome C, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and ribonuclease A, to less than 0.08μg/cm² and the protein resistance increases with increasing ionic strength of the carrier solution, performance comparable to that achieved with comparable PEG-coated surfaces. The PEI brushes were exceptionally stable, with adsorption characteristics maintained after 6months storage in aqueous conditions (pH 7.4, 25°C, PBS). The potential of hyperbranched PEI structures as protein-resistant surfaces is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3acytochrome c 3aflow injection analysis 3agold 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aionic strength 3apH 3apolymers 3aquartz 3aribonucleases 3asodium chloride1 aLee, Hung-Hsun1 aLiedberg, Bo1 aAastrup, T.q(Teodor),1 aNicholls, Ian A.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 396 p.307-315dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.12.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016300173300001400336520170500350592002802055650004402083650002302127650001902150650001902169650000902188650001902197650003302216650001102249650001302260650002102273650001202294700001602306773010602322856008402428990002302512852000902535655001202544IND60108952420221122001859.0141108e20131119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010895242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamvar-Mahboub, M.10aDevelopment of a novel thin film composite membrane by interfacial polymerization on polyetherimide/modified SiO₂ support for organic solvent nanofiltration  ap. 35-45.  aIn this study, nano thin-film composite (n-TFC) membrane was prepared via the interfacial polymerization for organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) process. Polyetherimide (PEI)/amino-functionalized silica nanocomposite membrane was used as support layer to fabricate n-TFC membrane. In order to obtain the stable support, nanocomposite membranes with different amount of modified silica (0–20wt.%) were prepared. The resultant membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), swelling test and tensile strength techniques. Results showed that mechanical and chemical stability attained their maximum when silica content was 5%. The solvent resistant n-TFC membranes were prepared using interfacial polymerization with m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) on the nanocomposite support. The prepared polyamide/modified PEI nanocomposite membrane was used in a selected OSN. A mixture containing dewaxed oil (Mw≈560g/mol) and dewaxing solvent (toluene and methyl ethyl ketone) was selected to investigate the separation performance of n-TFC membranes. The oil rejection of 94.72% and permeation flux of 10.4L/m²h (at 15bar) were achieved which suggest that newly prepared n-TFC membrane has potential in application of the dewaxing solvent separation from the dewaxed lube oil. Pressure dependency of the oil rejection, permeate flux and MEK to toluene mass ratio in permeate of the n-TFC membranes were studied in the pressure range of 10–20bar. The results revealed that the bulk modification has great effect on chemical stability of prepared membrane even at high pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3amembrane potential 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3aoils 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asolvents 3atensile strength 3atoluene1 aPakizeh, M.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2013 Nov. 19, v. 119 p.35-45dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245010100209300001600310520048600326592002800812650002100840650001700861650002000878650001100898650001200909773008500921856008301006990002301089852000901112655001201121IND60111358520221121060547.0141109e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011135852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0242doi7 aPMC30498552pmcid7 a212419972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Brian M.14aThe taking of the cytoskeleton one two three: How viruses utilize the cytoskeleton during egress  ap. 244-250.  aThe final assembly of nonlytic envelope viruses requires the coordinated transport of either subviral particles or fully formed virions to the plasma membrane for release from the cell.

The results of cyclic voltammetry and ¹¹boron (B) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirmed that NaBO₂ was converted into sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) by electroreduction and the electroreduction voltage ranged from −1.2V to −1.8V. The factors that influenced desulfurization efficiency were investigated and the desulfurization efficiency reached more than 95% for model gasoline and more than 97% for real gasoline. The components of model gasolines before and after desulfurization were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and the elements content of electrolytes and digestion solution of precipitate were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Results indicated that reductive desulfurization process mainly involved the cleavage of C–S bond and the hydrogenation of C–C double bond and B recycle was realized at the same time as desulfurization. Consequently, possible desulfurization mechanism was proposed. Desulfurization kinetics showed a pseudo-first-order toward thiophene or benzothiophene. All these results indicated that the gasoline desulfurization process via sodium metaborate electroreduction with pulse voltage using a BDD thin film electrode was feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasoline 3ahydrogenation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arecycling 3asodium 3aspectrometers 3athiophene 3atumor necrosis factors1 aSun, Tonghua1 aJia, Jinping1 aLou, Ziyang0 tFuel.g2013 Nov., v. 113 p.187-195dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0693Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001600285520119500301592002801496650002301524650001601547650002201563650001301585650003701598650001701635650002201652650001301674650001801687650002001705650003401725650001001759650002101769650001801790650001301808653003101821653002101852653001301873653001301886653001301899700002601912700002701938700002201965700002101987700002702008773010402035856008502139852000902224655001202233IND60101518720221118195956.0160903e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010151872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.11.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnoni, Raquel10aSubmerged-arc welding slags: Characterization and leaching strategies for the removal of aluminum and titanium  ap. 335-341.  aIn the present study, submerged-arc welding slags were characterized by applying a variety of methods, including X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, particle size, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The content of Al proved to be quite similar within neutral and acid slags (10–14%), while that of Ti proved to be much higher in acid slags (approximately 10%) than in neutral slags (<1%). The presence of spinel structures associated with Al species could also be identified in the analyzed samples. This characterization study was accompanied by leaching tests performed under changing operating conditions in an attempt to evaluate to what extent the Al and Ti bearing components could be removed from the slags. The leaching work involved three distinct strategies: (i) NaOH leaching followed by H2SO4 leaching, (ii) acid leaching (HCl and H2SO4) using oxidizing/reducing agents, and (iii) slag calcination followed by H2SO4 leaching. In the best result, 80% of Al was extracted in one single leaching stage after calcination of the acid slag with NaCl+C at 900°C. By contrast, the removal of Ti proved to be unsatisfactory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3ahydrochloric acid 3aleaching 3aparticle size 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aslags 3asodium hydroxide 3asulfuric acid 3atitanium 0aSubmerged-arc welding slag 0aCharacterization 0aLeaching 0aAluminum 0aTitanium1 aSouza, Poliana Santos1 aPetrániková, Martina1 aMiskufova, Andrea1 aHavlík, Tomáš1 aMansur, Marcelo Borges0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 244-245 p.335-341dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.11.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010800161300001400269520147900283592002801762650002401790650002001814650002401834650001601858700001301874700001801887700002001905700001901925773010701944856008102051990002302132852000902155655001202164IND60104190920221119224047.0141107e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010419092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2012.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiong12aA novel smart card and dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments  ap. 85-95.  aWith the purpose of using numerous different network services with single registration, various multi-server authentication schemes have been proposed. Furthermore, in order to protect the users from being tracked when they login to the remote server, researchers have proposed some dynamic ID based remote user authentication schemes for multi-server environments. Recently, Lee et al. have pointed out the security weaknesses of Hsiang and Shih’s dynamic ID based multi-server authentication scheme, and proposed an improved dynamic ID based authentication scheme for multi-server environments. They claimed that their scheme provided user anonymity, mutual authentication, session key agreement and can resist several kinds of attacks. In this paper, however, we find that Lee et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to forgery attack and server spoofing attack. Besides, their scheme cannot provide proper authentication if the mutual authentication message is partly modified by the attacker. In order to remove these security weaknesses, we propose a novel smart card and dynamic ID based authentication scheme for multi-server environments. In order to protect the user from being tracked, the proposed scheme enables the user’s identity to change dynamically when the user logs into the server. The proposed scheme is suitable for use in multi-server environments such as financial security authentication since it can ensure security while maintaining efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3adecision making 3amathematical models 3aresearchers1 aMa, Jian1 aWang, Wendong1 aXiong, Yongping1 aZhang, Junsong0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 July, v. 58, no. 1-2 p.85-95dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2012.06.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012100174300001600295520043800311592002800749650001400777650002300791650002300814650001500837650001300852650001700865653001700882653002700899653001800926653001400944700002000958700002400978773008701002856008401089852000901173655001201182IND60110038820221121080528.0161019e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011003882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.10.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelkar, Radheshyam10aAmberlyst-15 catalyzed synthesis of 5-substituted 1-H-tetrazole via [3+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and sodium azide  ap. 106-109.  aA mild and efficient method for the preparation of 5-substituted 1-H-tetrazole derivatives is reported using solid acidic resin Amberlyst-15 as an effective heterogeneous catalyst.

The quenching effect of single stranded G₉ over MB is favored over the other sequences. The analysis of the fluorescence data by Benesi–Hildebrand plot shows that MB forms 1:1 complex with G₉. Results from spectroscopic experiments, Stern-Volmer and van’t Hoff plots are consistent with a principal contribution of the static quenching on the overall quenching mechanism and with the electrostatic binding mode of MB-single stranded G₉ system. A quantum chemical modeling at DFT//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level confirms the experimental results. Asides from providing an insight into the underlying mechanism of the interaction between methylene blue and DNA, these results can be exploited for the design of novel DNA sensors using photoactive labels.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3asingle-stranded DNA 3aspectroscopy1 aFragoso, Alex1 aOrtiz, Pedro J.1 aO'Sullivan, Ciara K.0 tJournal of Photochemistry & Photobiology, A: Chemistry.g2011 Feb. 5, v. 218, no. 1 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.x1010-60307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2010.11.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014500171300001600316520168300332592002802015650001202043650001202055650002602067650001202093650001502105650002102120650000902141650001302150650001402163650002502177650001702202650001602219650003002235650001702265650001202282650001502294650002302309650000902332650001302341650001302354651001102367700002502378700002202403700002302425773007002448856008202518990002302600852000902623655001202632IND60102869120221119054025.0141106e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010286912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapusta, Krzysztof10aEnvironmental aspects of a field-scale underground coal gasification trial in a shallow coal seam at the Experimental Mine Barbara in Poland  ap. 196-208.  aA study on the environmental impacts of underground coal gasification (UCG) was conducted during a field-scale, in situ coal gasification experiment at the Experimental Mine “Barbara” in Poland. This two-week experiment was a part of a technological effort aiming to produce hydrogen-rich product gas using the UCG technology. As groundwater pollution is recognised to be the most serious environmental risk related to UCG, extensive investigations on the formation, release, and migration of contaminants were conducted. The study revealed a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants that were characteristic for the UCG. The main organic contaminants were phenolic compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons (mono- and polycyclic). Among the inorganic species, heavy metals, ammonia and cyanides were the most serious group of contaminants. These compounds were identified in the post-processing effluents and in groundwater near the test site. The impact of the gasification process on the groundwater, however, was small and tended to effectively decrease over the time and distance from the cavity zone. A possible negative environmental impact of the gasification by-products, including ash and char left underground, was also evaluated. This study revealed that these post-gasification residuals are the main source of toxic trace elements, but the most volatile species, such as Hg, As and Se, tended to escape the cavity zone with the product gas during gasification phase. Monitoring activities detected no chemical hazards on the surface during the course of the experiment and after its termination; however, UCG-induced thermal effects on surface were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbara 3aammonia 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aarsenic 3abyproducts 3achemical hazards 3acoal 3acyanides 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental impact 3agasification 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3amonitoring 3aphenolic compounds 3arisk 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3aPoland1 aStańczyk, Krzysztof1 aWiatowski, Marian1 aChećko, Jarosław0 tFuel.g2013 Nov., v. 113 p.196-208dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001600290520155300306592002801859650001301887650001401900650001201914650001201926650002801938650001701966650001601983650002401999650001802023650002002041650000902061650001802070650001302088650002102101700001802122700001702140700001702157700001902174700002102193700001702214700001902231773010302250856008402353990002302437852000902460655001202469IND60110590020221116142423.0141109e20110910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011059002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Kyung-Min10aPotentiation of vasoconstriction and pressor response by low concentration of monomethylarsonous acid (MMAᴵᴵᴵ)  ap. 250-256.  aA close link between arsenic exposure and hypertension has been well-established through many epidemiological reports, yet the mechanism underlying it remains unclear. Here we report that nanomolar concentrations of monomethylarsonous acid (MMAᴵᴵᴵ), a toxic trivalent methylated arsenic metabolite, can potentiate agonist-induced vasoconstriction and pressor responses. In freshly isolated rat aortic ring, exposure to nanomolar MMAᴵᴵᴵ (100–500nM) potentiated phenylephrine (PE)-induced vasoconstriction while at higher concentrations (≥2.5μM), suppression of vasoconstriction and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle were observed. Potentiation of agonist-induced vasoconstriction was also observed with other contractile agonists and it was retained in endothelium-denuded aortic rings, suggesting that these events are agonist-independent and smooth muscle cell dependent. Interestingly, exposure to MMAᴵᴵᴵ resulted in increased myosin light chain phosphorylation while PE-induced Ca²⁺ influx was not affected, reflecting that Ca²⁺ sensitization is involved. In line with this, MMAᴵᴵᴵ enhanced agonist-induced activation of small GTPase RhoA, a key contributor to Ca²⁺ sensitization. Of note, treatment of MMAᴵᴵᴵ to rats induced significantly higher pressor responses in vivo, demonstrating that this event can occur in vivo indeed. We believe that RhoA-mediated Ca²⁺ sensitization and the resultant potentiation of vasoconstriction by MMAᴵᴵᴵ may shed light on arsenic-associated hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic 3acalcium 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahypertension 3ametabolites 3amyosin light chains 3aphenylephrine 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asmooth muscle 3atoxicity 3avasoconstriction1 aShin, Yoo-Sun1 aKang, Seojin1 aNoh, Ji-Yoon1 aKim, Keunyoung1 aChung, Seung-Min1 aYun, Yeo-Pyo1 aChung, Jin Ho,0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Sept. 10, v. 205, no. 3 p.250-256dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245004200212300001600254520100900270592002801279650001901307650003301326650002601359650002001385650001701405650001101422650001301433650001501446650001501461700001801476700001801494773008501512856008301597990002301680852000901703655001201712IND60111358720221121060556.0141109e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011135872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0392doi7 aPMC30721662pmcid7 a212476122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitchen, Scott G.10aStem cell-based anti-HIV gene therapy  ap. 260-272.  aHuman stem cell-based therapeutic intervention strategies for treating HIV infection have recently undergone a renaissance as a major focus of investigation. Unlike most conventional antiviral therapies, genetically engineered hematopoietic stem cells possess the capacity for prolonged self-renewal that would continuously produce protected immune cells to fight against HIV. A successful strategy therefore has the potential to stably control and ultimately eradicate HIV from patients by a single or minimal treatment. Recent progress in the development of new technologies and clinical trials sets the stage for the current generation of gene therapy approaches to combat HIV infection. In this review, we will discuss two major approaches that are currently underway in the development of stem cell-based gene therapy to target HIV: one that focuses on the protection of cells from productive infection with HIV, and the other that focuses on targeting immune cells to directly combat HIV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantiretroviral agents 3aclinical trials 3agene therapy 3ahumans 3apatients 3astem cells 3atechnology1 aShimizu, Saki1 aAn, Dong Sung0 tVirology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 411, no. 2 p.260-272dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009500176300001400271520071600285592002801001650001201029650001101041650002201052700002201074700002101096773012801117856008801245990002301333852000901356655001201365IND60103033320221119221141.0141106e20110205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010303332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotochem.2010.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurel, François13aAn ab initio simulation of a dithienylethene/phenoxynaphthacenequinone photochromic hybrid  ap. 33-40.  aWe simulate the properties of a photochromic blend synthesized by Myles, Wigglesworth and Branda [Adv.

Diamond like carbon and two fluorocarbon materials with different fluorine content have been prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and characterized by X-ray photoemission, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopies. Very rough surfaces have been obtained by deposition of thin films of these materials on polymer substrates previously subjected to plasma etching to increase their roughness. A direct correlation has been found between roughness and water contact angles while a superhydrophobic behavior (i.e., water contact angles higher than 150° and relatively low adhesion energy) was found for the films with the highest fluorine content deposited on very rough substrates. A critical evaluation of the methods currently used to assess the roughness of these surfaces by atomic force microscopy (AFM) has evidenced that calculated RMS roughness values and actual surface areas are quite dependent on both the scale of observation and image resolution. A critical discussion is carried out about the application of the Wenzel model to account for the wetting behavior of this type of surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3afluorine 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aperfluorocarbons 3apolymers 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3avapors1 aAlvarez, Rafael,1 aBorrás, Ana1 aCotrino, José1 aYubero, Francisco1 aGonzález-Elipe, Agustín R.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 June 15, v. 376, no. 1 p.274-282dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009700172300001400269520136500283592002801648650001501676650001301691650001601704650001201720650001401732650001501746650001901761650001701780650000901797700002401806700002001830700001901850700002401869700002801893773010601921856008402027990002302111852000902134655001202143IND60108952720221121221246.0141108e20131119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010895272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsui, Yoshihiko10aAluminum concentrations of sand filter and polymeric membrane filtrates: A comparative study  ap. 58-65.  aThe residual aluminum concentration in treated water after aluminum coagulation and solid–liquid separation is one of the key factors in evaluating the effectiveness of water treatments. Polymeric membrane filters have been widely used to operationally define dissolved substances from particulate matter, and have sometimes been employed in laboratories and pilot studies to approximately simulate media filtration. A comparison between media and membrane filters, however, has not yet been fully investigated. This study compared aluminum concentrations in the filtrate after sand bed and membrane filtrations. The aluminum concentration after sand bed filtration was lower than that after filtration using a membrane with a pore size of 0.1μm, irrespective of the membrane material, with one exception. A PVDF membrane with a pore size of 0.1μm produced a similar residual aluminum concentration to that obtained using a sand bed. When the natural organic matter concentration was very low, the aluminum concentration in the PVDF membrane (pore size 0.1μm) and sand bed filtrates was lower than that obtained using other membranes with the same pore size. It is believed that adsorption of dissolved aluminum may enhance aluminum removal by the sand bed and the PVDF membrane when the aluminum exists in an uncomplexed form with natural organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acoagulation 3afilters 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3aorganic matter 3aparticulates 3asand1 aIshikawa, Tairyo B.1 aKimura, Masaoki1 aMachida, Kaori1 aShirasaki, Nobutaka1 aMatsushita, T.q(Taku),0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2013 Nov. 19, v. 119 p.58-65dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245022100165300001600386520120500402592002801607650001801635650002501653650003201678650001301710650001301723650002101736650002801757650003101785650001301816653001301829653001601842653001901858653002101877653002401898700001501922700001901937700001701956700001601973700001801989773010702007856008402114852000902198655001202207IND60111682820221120031853.0160903e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Suzhen10aToxicity assessments with Daphnia magna of Guadipyr, a new neonicotinoid insecticide and studies of its effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and chitobiase activities  ap. 339-344.  aGuadipyr is a novel neonicotinoid insecticide, developed by the China Agricultural University. This work investigated its aquatic toxicity on Daphnia magna. The acute immobilization test showed that guadipyr was slightly toxic to daphnids, with a 48h EC50 of 13.01mg/L. In addition, guadipyr significantly enhanced the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity (per gram of protein), but had no obvious impact on catalase (CAT) activity within 48h. The 21d chronic exposure of D. magna to guadipyr induced a significant decrease in body growth and reproduction; both share the same lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) at 0.10mg/L. In the 14d chronic test, a significant increase in chitobiase activity in test media was observed at day 8 (days to the first breeding), while a significant decrease was observed from days 10 to 14, which might be due to the endocrine imbalance resulting from guadipyr stress. These results demonstrated that guadipyr can induce notable negative ecotoxicological impacts on the aquatic system in long-term exposure at a sub-lethal dose. Further research in environmental behaviors is needed to regulate guadipyr use in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abreeding 3acatalase 3achronic exposure 3aglutathione transferase 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3atoxicity 0aGuadipyr 0aZooplankton 0aAcute toxicity 0aChronic toxicity 0aChitobiase activity1 aWang, Chen1 aChen, Xiaofeng1 aQin, Zhaohai1 aLi, Xuefeng1 aWang, Chengju0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 98 p.339-344dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245009800212300001600310500001500326520122300341592002801564650003301592650003101625650003101656650002001687650002201707650001901729650001501748653002801763700002001791700001901811700001901830700002001849700002701869700002501896700001901921700002201940773008501962856008302047990002302130852000902153655001202162IND60111387320221118035708.0141109e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011138732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.0272doi7 aPMC32688622pmcid7 a220999672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorandell, Dieter14aThe human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein targets Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein-1  ap. 242-253.  a2019-12-04  aWe demonstrate that HPV-16 E7 forms a complex with Miz-1. UV-induced expression of the CDK-inhibitor p21Cⁱᵖ¹ and subsequent cell cycle arrest depends upon endogenous Miz-1 in HPV-negative C33A cervical cancer cells containing mutated p53. Transient expression of E7 in C33A inhibits UV-induced expression of p21Cⁱᵖ¹ and overcomes Miz-1-induced G1-phase arrest. The C-terminal E7Δ79LEDLL83-mutant with reduced Miz-1-binding capacity was impaired in its capability to repress p21Cⁱᵖ¹ expression; whereas the pRB-binding-deficient E7C24G-mutant inhibited p21Cⁱᵖ¹ expression similar to wild-type E7. Using ChIP, we demonstrate that endogenous E7 is bound to the endogenous p21Cⁱᵖ¹ core-promoter in CaSki cells and RNAi-mediated knock down of Miz-1 abrogates E7-binding to the p21Cⁱᵖ¹ promoter. Co-expression of E7 with Miz-1 inhibited Miz-1-induced p21Cⁱᵖ¹ expression from the minimal-promoter via Miz-1 DNA-binding sites. Co-expression of E7Δ79LEDLL83 did not inhibit Miz-1-induced p21Cⁱᵖ¹ expression. E7C24G retained E7-wild-type capability to inhibit Miz-1-dependent transactivation. These findings suggest that HPV-16 E7 can repress Miz-1-induced p21Cⁱᵖ¹ gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman papillomavirus type 16 3atranscriptional activation 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3agene expression 3aoncogene proteins 3aneoplasm cells 3acell cycle 0aHuman papillomavirus 161 aKaiser, Andreas1 aHerold, Steffi1 aRostek, Ursula1 aLechner, Stefan1 aMitterberger, Maria C.1 aJansen-Dürr, Pidder1 aEilers, Martin1 aZwerschke, Werner0 tVirology.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 422, no. 2 p.242-253dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001800168245010100186300001800287500001500305520136500320592002801685650001501713650000901728650001001737650002001747650001701767650001401784650001101798650001001809650002101819650001301840650001501853650003101868650001401899650001901913650001701932650005001949650001201999650003502011650003702046650004002083650002802123650002402151650002802175653001802203700002302221700002002244700001302264700001802277700002102295700002202316700002302338700002302361773010002384856008302484852000902567655001202576IND60103186920221119025834.0141106e20120618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010318692DNAL7 a222006762pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBond, Jude J.10aCarbohydrate transporting membrane proteins of the rumen bacterium, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus  ap. 3138-3144.  a2019-12-04  aThe research was aimed at finding which membrane proteins of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus are involved in the uptake of carbohydrates resulting from extracellular enzymatic degradation of hemicellulose and fructan. The proteomic analysis of cells grown with fructose or xylan as the sole substrate identified 13 membrane proteins predicted to function as carbohydrate transporters. One protein detected was the membrane component of a fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system believed to be involved in the fructose uptake following extracellular fructan breakdown. The other 12 proteins were all ABC transport system substrate-binding proteins, nine of which belong to functional category COG1653 that includes proteins predicted to transport oligosaccharides. Four of the SBPs were significantly upregulated in xylan grown cells, and three of these were found in polysaccharide utilisation loci where they are clustered with other genes involved in hemicellulose breakdown and metabolism. It is possible that the carbon source available regulates a wider network of genes. The information on the mechanisms used by rumen bacteria to take up carbohydrates from their environment may improve our understanding of the ruminant digestion and facilitate strategies for improved pasture and stored feed utilisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3aloci 3axylan 3afeed conversion 3atransporters 3adigestion 3acarbon 3agenes 3aoligosaccharides 3afructose 3aproteomics 3agene expression regulation 3aruminants 3arumen bacteria 3aButyrivibrio 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxphysiology 2aClostridiumxmetabolism 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aRuminantsxmicrobiology 0ahemicellulose1 aDunne, Jonathan C.1 aKwan, Fiona Y-S1 aLi, Dong1 aZhang, Kunkun1 aLeahy, Sinead C.1 aKelly, William J.1 aAttwood, Graeme T.1 aJordan, T.

Comprehensive ligand- and species-comparative dose- and time-dependent studies were conducted to systematically assess the uterine physiological, morphological and gene expression responses elicited by o,p′-DDT and ethynyl estradiol (EE) in immature ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice and Sprague–Dawley rats. Custom cDNA microarrays were used to identify conserved and divergent differential gene expression responses. A total of 1256 genes were differentially expressed by both ligands in both species, 559 of which exhibited similar temporal expression profiles suggesting that o,p′-DDT elicits estrogenic effects at high doses when compared to EE. However, 51 genes exhibited species-specific uterine expression elicited by o,p′-DDT. For example, carbonic anhydrase 2 exhibited species- and ligand-divergent expression as confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The identification of comparable temporal phenotypic responses linked to gene expression demonstrates that systematic comparative gene expression assessments are valuable for elucidating conserved and divergent estrogen signaling mechanisms in rodent uterotrophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acomplementary DNA 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3aethane 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aovariectomy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats1 aForgacs, Agnes L.1 aWilliams, Kurt J.1 aZacharewski, Timothy R.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 273, no. 3 p.532-541dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.09.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012200175300001600297520125300313592002801566650002601594650002101620650002501641650001201666650001601678650001101694650002701705650002001732650001401752650001901766650001401785650001401799650002101813650001501834700001901849700002001868700002301888700002001911700002101931773010501952856008402057990002302141852000902164655001202173IND60108870120221118005136.0141108e20120503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010887012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez Loveira, Elsa10aTiO₂-photocatalytic treatment coupled with biological systems for the elimination of benzalkonium chloride in water  ap. 108-116.  aTiO₂ heterogeneous photocatalysis (HP) applied to the oxidation of benzalkonium chloride (BKC), a bactericide widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations and risky for the biota, is presented. Although BKC is rapidly degraded by HP, mineralization degree is low, indicating the formation of intermediate compounds more resistant to the photocatalytic treatment. Combination of HP with a biological treatment improves the treatment. Both, use of TiO₂-photocatalysis as a pretreatment to improve the biodegradability of wastewaters and as a polishing decontamination step after a biological treatment are analyzed. The biotreatment can be used when the effluent contains a relatively low BKC concentration and enough nutrients and carbon to sustain the life of the biomass. The bioreactor reduces both COD and BKC concentration. Once the level of COD is reduced, photocatalysis can be used for the total BKC elimination from the solution. On the other hand, HP can be used to reduce BKC concentration in effluents containing mostly this compound. Once the BKC concentration is low enough to be innocuous to the biomass, the effluent can be combined with a solution containing nutrients and carbon and treated by the biological method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzalkonium chloride 3abiodegradability 3abiological treatment 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecontamination 3aeffluents 3amineralization 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater1 aFiol, Paula S.1 aSenn, Alejandro1 aCurutchet, Gustavo1 aCandal, Roberto1 aLitter, Marta I.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2012 May 3, v. 91 p.108-116dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001600278520104700294592002801341650001501369650002201384650001201406650001001418650001601428650002201444650001301466650001301479650001601492700002401508700002101532700001901553773007001572856008201642990002301724852000901747655001201756IND60102869320221119053933.0141106e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010286932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco-Brieva, G.10aEfficient solvent regeneration of Basolite C300 used in the liquid-phase adsorption of dibenzothiophene  ap. 216-220.  aThe metal–organic framework (MOF) Basolite C300 displays excellent performance for the removal of dibenzothiophene (DBT) in a model system consisting in DBT in a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (TMP). With the aim to exploit this property in a continuous operation, it is imperative to develop a simple and effective regeneration procedure. Our previous work (Fuel 105 (2013) 459–465) demonstrated that there is only partial thermal regeneration of this system at 473K, which makes this approach of limited value. In the present work, we developed a significantly more effective regeneration procedure in which the DBT-saturated MOF C300 system was washed with polar solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. It was found that regeneration using methanol as a solvent at temperatures near ambient (304K) is highly effective and allows for the recovery of the initial adsorption capacity. After several regeneration cycles, both the crystallinity and the initial sorption capacity of the C300 system are essentially unchanged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acrystal structure 3aethanol 3afuels 3aiso-octanes 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aCampos-Martin, J.M.1 aAl-Zahrani, S.M.1 aFierro, J.L.G.0 tFuel.g2013 Nov., v. 113 p.216-220dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0653Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013200163300001400295520056400309592002800873650001100901650000900912650002000921700001700941700001600958773010700974856008101081990002301162852000901185655001201194IND60104191220221119222340.0141107e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010419122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2012.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Fengge10aCVaR measurement and operational risk management in commercial banks according to the peak value method of extreme value theory  ap. 15-27.  aManagement of operational risk is of prime importance in risk management for commercial banks, and many theoretical and practical studies of operational risk management have been carried out.

It appraises established and novel strategies for micro algal cultivation, downstream processing methods for product recovery, and recent progress in algal generation of the green energy carriers biogas and biohydrogen micro algae. The suitability of selected micro algal species for various final products, and the potential of different strains for abating environmental problems are discussed. Due to the fact that low cell densities and moderate growth rates are known as the major obstacles towards a broad market penetration of micro algal products, the article shows how high cell densities and reasonable volumetric productivities can be obtained. Here, the article deals with the improvements of process design and nutrient supply regimes that are needed to achieve these goals. As demonstrated by an integrated case study, mixotrophic cultivation results in increased biomass concentration in a first cultivation step for some micro algal strains like Nannochloropsis oculata. In a second step, the fresh active algal biomass accumulates desired products via CO₂ fixation, e.g. from industrial effluent gases, as the sole carbon source. This can be realized by a novel, two-stage, continuously operated closed photo-bioreactor system. After cell harvest and optimized product recovery, the value-added conversion of residual algal biomass for generation of green energy carriers, e.g. in biogas plants, constitutes another focal point of the ongoing research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3abiogas 3abiohydrogen 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3agases 3ahigh-value products 3aindustrial effluents 3amarkets 3aprocess design 3aprocessing technology 3avalue added1 aSalerno, Anna1 aTuffner, Philipp1 aKoinigg, Michael1 aBöchzelt, Herbert1 aSchober, Sigurd1 aPieber, Simone1 aSchnitzer, Hans1 aMittelbach, Martin1 aBraunegg, Gerhart0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2012 Dec., v. 37 p.377-388dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04873naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001600168245016500184300001800349520257000367592002802937650001402965650002302979650001403002650001703016650001303033650001903046650001703065650000903082650002003091650003103111650001803142650002103160650000703181650001303188650002203201650001503223650004303238650002403281650001703305650002203322650002003344650003703364650004003401650001203441650005203453650002803505650002103533650002803554650002603582650004003608650005703648650001103705650001803716650003603734650001503770650003303785650003203818650006503850650001003915700001503925700001903940773010003959856008304059852000904142655001204151IND60103187020221119025941.0141106e20120618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010318702DNAL7 a224809102pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2012.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xue-Tao10aConstruction of nanometer cisplatin core-ferritin (NCC-F) and proteomic analysis of gastric cancer cell apoptosis induced with cisplatin released from the NCC-F  ap. 3145-3157.  aBoth transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence spectrometry were used to reveal the characteristics of both subunit disassociation and recombination in apo-pig pancreas ferritin (apoPPF) in an alkaline medium ranging reversibly from pH 7.0 to 13.0. The experimental results indicated that apoPPF could be completely disassociated into 24 free subunits at pH 13.0, and then these subunits could be quickly reassembled into the original apoPPF once the pH of the reactive medium was returned to pH7.0. This novel and simple method could be used to effectively construct a novel nanometer cisplatin core-PPF (NCC-PPF). The major characteristics of NCC-PPF were investigated using various analytical methods such as ultraviolet-spectrometry, circular dichroism spectrometry and TEM, which indicated that its molecular structure was still similar to that of the original apoPPF. Results from the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) method showed that 11.26 cisplatin (CDDP) molecules were successfully packaged within the NCC-PPF shell, indicating that each molecule of apoPPF had the ability to enwrap 11.26 CDDP molecules for constructing the NCC-PPF. Flow cytometry showed that NCC-PPF also had the ability to release CDDP for inducing the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells BGC823 (GCC), but this phenomenon could scarcely be observed using apoPPF. A differential proteomic technique using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels selected and identified the differential proteins from cell apoptosis in order to reveal the molecular pathway of GCC apoptosis by both NCC-PPF and free CDDP, giving 13 differential expression proteins. These differential proteins could be further classified into six groups, which were described as being involved in the regulation of apoptosis, RNA transcription, oxidative stress response, signal transduction, cell metabolism, and cytoskeleton changes. In addition, a real-time PCR method was used to prove the expression level of mRNA and to identify the reliability of the protein expression according to these differential proteins, which indicated that the mRNA level changes of six differential proteins corresponded to those of its differential protein expression in 2-DE gels. These studies played an important role in reasonably revealing the different pathways of GCC apoptosis induced with both the CDDP released by NCC-PPF and the free CDDP. We thus suggest that apoPPF has great potential for constructing a nanometer carrier filled with various drugs for application in clinical work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3achemical structure 3acisplatin 3acytoskeleton 3aferritin 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3agels 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3apancreas 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3aspectroscopy 3astomach neoplasms 3astress response 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCisplatinxpharmacology 2aDrug Delivery Systems 2aFerritinsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aNanoparticles 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aProteomics 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Neoplasmxbiosynthesis 2aStomach Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSwine1 aHuang, Lin1 aHuang, He-Qing0 tJournal of proteomics.g2012 June 18, v. 75, no. 11 p.3145-3157dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2012.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008700172300001600259520134000275592002801615650001501643650001501658650001901673650002201692650002501714650001301739650001901752650001301771700001601784700001701800773011701817856008201934852000902016655001202025IND60100823220221121144049.0141105e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010082322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTehrani-Bagha, A.R.10aSolubilization of two organic dyes by cationic ester-containing gemini surfactants  ap. 112-118.  aSolubilization of two different types of organic dyes, Quinizarin with an anthraquinone structure and Sudan I with an azo structure, has been studied in aqueous solutions of a series of cationic gemini surfactants and of a conventional monomeric cationic surfactant, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB). Surfactant concentrations both above and below the critical micelle concentration were used. The concentration of solubilized dye at equilibrium was determined from the absorbance of the solution at λₘₐₓ with the aid of a calibration curve. The solubilization power of the gemini surfactants was higher than that of DTAB and increased with increasing alkyl chain length. An increase in length of the spacer unit resulted in increased solubilization power while a hydroxyl group in the spacer did not have much effect. Ester bonds in the alkyl chains reduced the solubilization power with respect to both dyes. A comparison between the absorbance spectra of the dyes in micellar solution with spectra in a range of solvents of different polarity indicated that the dye is situated in a relatively polar environment. One may therefore assume that the dye is located just below the head group region of the micelle. Attractive π-cation interactions may play a role for orienting the dye to the outer region of the micelle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSudan dyes 3aabsorbance 3aanthraquinones 3aaqueous solutions 3acationic surfactants 3amicelles 3asolubilization 3asolvents1 aSingh, R.G.1 aHolmberg, K.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 June 15, v. 376, no. 1 p.112-118dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01449naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010600163300001800269520044200287592002800729650002300757650002300780650001100803650001400814650001100828653001500839653002400854653001500878653001600893700002000909773008900929856008401018852000901102655001201111IND60110109520221119220005.0161019e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011010952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao10aSynthesis of the (E)-dehydrobutyrine–thiazoline–proline–leucine fragment of vioprolides B and D  ap. 3150-3153.  aA procedure is reported for the introduction of both the thiazoline and (E)-dehydrobutyrine components into a tetrapeptide-derived fragment of vioprolides B and D.

In the previous work, it was assumed that drops deform from a spherical shape to a prolate spheroid when pass through a converging slot. In the present study, it has been assumed that drops deform into an oblate spheroid while passing through a non-converging slot and a mathematical model is developed for the deformation of drops through non-converging slots. After extending the idea of static and drag forces, it is readily seen that the magnitude of static force (Fcₓ) for the non-converging slotted pore membrane is higher than the static force (Fcₓ ∗) for the converging slotted pore membranes. This is because of drops deform suddenly in the non-converging slots, while, in case of converging slots, the drops deform gradually. Micro-sized oil drops of two systems with different interfacial tensions (4 and 9mN/m) have been used in the study and it is observed that a higher interfacial tension leads to a higher rejection rate for both converging and non-converging slotted pore membranes at various in-pore filtration velocities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afiltration 3amathematical models 3aoils 3asurface tension1 aKhan, S.W.1 aShakoor, A.1 aStarov, V.M.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2013 Nov. 19, v. 119 p.7-13dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.08.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015500164300001600319520109700335592002801432650002501460650001901485650001301504650001701517650002801534650001201562650001001574650001001584650000901594650001301603650000901616650001401625650001201639650001101651650001401662650001601676700001801692700001601710700001801726700001501744700001701759773010501776856008401881852000901965655001201974IND60101825120221122040153.0141106e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010182512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivet, A.10aInfluence of glass and gold sealants materials on oxygen permeation performances in La₀.₈Sr₀.₂Fe₀.₇Ga₀.₃O₃₋δ perovskite membranes  ap. 132-138.  aGas dissociation with a ceramic membrane is an economical and environmental attractive process for methane gas conversion into syngas (mixture of H₂ and CO). For this application, the membrane materials require mixed ionic and electronic conductivities in a large range of pO₂ resulting in an excellent oxygen semi-permeation of the membrane to improve methane conversion. In this paper, particular attention is given to the influence of sealant materials on oxygen semi-permeation performances of membrane materials. For instance, oxygen semi-permeation measurements have been performed with La₀.₈Sr₀.₂Fe₀.₇Ga₀.₃O₃₋δ membranes under an oxygen partial pressure gradient at temperatures from 700°C to 1000°C with different sealing materials (glass or gold ring sealant) between the membrane and the support. The result leads to a better understanding of the effects of sealing on oxygen transport through the La₀.₈Sr₀.₂Fe₀.₇Ga₀.₃O₃₋δ membrane. Indeed, a gold sealing material is required for accurate measurements of oxygen semi-permeation flux.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3aceramics 3adissociation 3aelectrical conductivity 3agallium 3agases 3aglass 3agold 3ahydrogen 3airon 3alanthanum 3amethane 3aoxygen 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aGeffroy, P.M.1 aCoudert, V.1 aFouletier, J.1 aRichet, N.1 aChartier, T.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 366, no. 1-2 p.132-138dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245014900179300001800328520201600346592002802362650000902390650001502399650001202414650002502426650001702451650001202468650001902480650001202499650001102511650001402522650002202536650001002558650001102568650001002579650001302589650002502602650001302627650001102640650001202651651001002663700002902673700003202702773011202734856008202846990002302928852000902951655001202960IND60107916320221119105012.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010791632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgola, Pacifica F.

Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000MWe, out of which only 200MWe has been developed, and about 5000MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100MWt and 100MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe 3aarid lands 3abeeswax 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adyeing 3afisheries 3ageothermal energy 3ahoney 3aincome 3alakes 3alighting 3alivestock production 3alowlands 3apeople 3atourism 3aKenya1 aDavidsdottir, Brynhildur1 aIngvar Birgir Fridleifsson,0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.4222-4246dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0813Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245004700181300001600228520077000244592002801014650004601042650001501088650001101103650001001114650001501124650001901139650001001158700003301168773010201201856008501303990002301388852000901411655001201420IND60103263320221117232653.0141106e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010326332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoynes, Hilary Williamson10aWork incentives and the Food Stamp Program  ap. 151-162.  aLabor supply theory makes strong predictions about how the introduction or expansion of a social welfare program impacts work effort. Although there is a large literature on the work incentive effects of AFDC and the EITC, relatively little is known about the work incentive effects of the Food Stamp Program and none of the existing literature is based on quasi-experimental methods. We use the cross-county introduction of the program in the 1960s and 1970s to estimate the impact of the program on the extensive and intensive margins of labor supply, earnings, and family cash income. Consistent with theory, we find reductions in employment and hours worked when food stamps are introduced. The reductions are concentrated among families headed by single woman.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 3aemployment 3aincome 3alabor 3aprediction 3asocial welfare 3awomen1 aSchanzenbach, Diane Whitmore0 tJournal of Public Economics.g2012 Feb., v. 96, no. 1-2 p.151-162dElsevier B.V.x0047-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.08.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002500197245009800222300001600320520156700336592002801903650001501931650002801946650001201974650001601986650002102002700002202023773010502045856009002150990002302240852000902263655001202272IND60111003720221121074019.0141109e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011100372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.0232doi7 aPMC36533082pmcid7 a232458272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, Michael S.10aNon-Rigid Image Registration Based Strain Estimator for Intravascular Ultrasound Elastography  ap. 515-533.  aIntravascular ultrasound elastography (IVUSe) could improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease by revealing vulnerable plaques through their mechanical tissue properties. To improve the performance of IVUSe, we developed and implemented a non-rigid image-registration method to visualize the radial and circumferential component of strain within vascular tissues. We evaluated the algorithm's performance with four initialization schemes using simulated and experimentally acquired ultrasound images. Applying the registration method to radio-frequency (RF) echo frames improved the accuracy of displacements compared to when B-mode images were employed. However, strain elastograms measured from RF echo frames produce erroneous results when both the zero-initialization method and the mesh-refinement scheme were employed. For most strain levels, the cross-correlation-initialization method produced the best performance. The simulation study predicted that elastograms obtained from vessels with average strains in the range of 3%–5% should have high elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe)–on the order of 4.5 and 7.5 for the radial and circumferential components of strain, respectively. The preliminary in vivo validation study (phantom and an atherosclerotic rabbit) demonstrated that the non-rigid registration method could produce useful radial and circumferential strain elastograms under realistic physiologic conditions. The results of this investigation were sufficiently encouraging to warrant a more comprehensive in vivo validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acardiovascular diseases 3arabbits 3aultrasonics 3avascular tissues1 aDoyley, Marvin M.0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2013 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.515-533dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008200164300001600246520108300262592002801345650002001373650002001393650001501413650001101428650001501439650001501454650001101469650001401480650001101494650001201505650001301517650001201530650001301542651002101555700001701576700002001593773006801613856008201681990002301763852000901786655001201795IND60102709120221119223238.0141106e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010270912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAydin, Isil10aMolybdenum speciation in asphaltite bottom ash (Seguruk, SE Anatolia, Turkey)  ap. 481-485.  aAsphaltites derive from petroleum origin. The combustion of asphaltites produces fly and bottom ashes that are characterized by a high content of valuable elements such as vanadium, nickel, molybdenum, uranium, thorium, sulfur and unburnt carbon. This study presents the concentration and speciation of molybdenum in bottom ash of asphaltite (Seguruk, SE Anatolia, Turkey). Determination of total molybdenum in asphaltite bottom ash was performed in two stage microwave-acid digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. A seven step sequential extraction process to speciation of molybdenum from asphaltite bottom ash was investigated. The most abundant form of molybdenum in samples is sulfide fraction of molybdenum. Relative abundances of the remaining fractions follow the order: residual>reducible>oxidizable>exchangeable>carbonate>water soluble. Molybdenum speciation scheme allows quantitative knowledge of molybdenum distribution in asphaltite bottom ash and their toxicity, mobility, leachability, bioaccumulation and bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3abottom ash 3acarbon 3acombustion 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apetroleum 3asulfur 3athorium 3atoxicity 3auranium 3avanadium 3aTurkey (country)1 aAydin, Firat1 aHamamci, Candan0 tFuel.g2012 May, v. 95 p.481-485dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011900172300001600291520123200307592002801539650001201567650001601579650001601595650001201611650001401623650001701637650002201654650001101676650000701687650002301694650001101717653001601728653003601744653001101780653001301791653002901804700001401833700001901847700001501866700001501881700001601896700001801912773010701930856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60111683020221123034613.0160903e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPillai, Saumya S.10aBiosorption of Cd(II) from aqueous solution using xanthated nano banana cellulose: Equilibrium and kinetic studies  ap. 352-360.  aPresent study explored the biosorption capacity of xanthated nano banana cellulose (XNBC) for Cd(II) from aqueous solution. The biosorbent containing sulfur-bearing groups have a high affinity for heavy metals. Sulfur can be considered as a soft ligand group having strong affinity for cadmium. In the present study, the influence of various important parameters such as pH, time, biosorbent dose and initial Cd(II) concentration on the biosorption capacity were investigated. The maximum biosorption capacity of XNBC for Cd(II) was found to be 154.26mgg−1 at 298K. The Cd(II) sorption of XNBC was confirmed by SEM-EDS and XRF analysis. The isotherms such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson and Tempkin were studied. The Langmuir and the Redlich–Peterson isotherms had been well fitted the biosorption of Cd(II) with xanthated nano banana cellulose. The kinetics of Cd(II) removal using XNBC was well explained by second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated from the biosorption measurements. Among the various desorbing agents tested, the desorbing efficiency was found to be maximum with 0.1molL−1 HCl. It was found that XNBC is also suitable to be used under column operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3acellulose 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asulfur 0aBiosorption 0aXanthated nano banana cellulose 0aCd(II) 0aKinetics 0aThermodynamic parameters1 aDeepa, B.1 aAbraham, Eldho1 aGirija, N.1 aGeetha, P.1 aJacob, Laly1 aKoshy, Mathew0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 98 p.352-360dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245014400180300001800324520058500342592002800927650001400955650001400969650001600983650001800999650001401017650001401031650001401045700002201059700002401081700002401105773009701129856008401226852000901310655001201319IND60109955720221117072510.0141109e20120711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirabal-Gallardo, Yaneris10aEnantioselective total synthesis of (S)-(+)-lennoxamine through asymmetric hydrogenation mediated by l-proline-tetrazole ruthenium catalyst  ap. 3672-3675.  aA novel asymmetric synthetic strategy to prepare isoindolobenzazepine based lennoxamine alkaloid has been achieved in high ee% starting from 2-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethanamine and 1-(chloromethyl)-2,3-dimethoxybenzene in 5 steps and with a 34% overall yield.

Experimental results showed that although fouling potential of tertiary effluent (treated by slow sand filtration) is much lower than that of secondary effluent, fouling is inevitable and is greatly impacted by the applied operational conditions. Under certain filtration flux and backwash interval the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) can be effectively controlled. Operated at high flux and extended backwash interval, a stable performance of UF can also be maintained using chemically enhanced backwash (CEBW). The test of three kinds of chemicals demonstrates that oxidants are suitable reagents with respect to present effluent quantity. Different reagents were used to clean the fouled membrane. Their effects on permeability recovery were compared in relation to fouling removal mechanisms. Based on the empirical results, the total cost of UF under suggested operational conditions was compared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3afouling 3aoxidants 3apermeability 3apressure 3asand 3aultrafiltration1 aErnst, Mathias1 aJekel, Martin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 366, no. 1-2 p.82-91dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014400170300001600314520126400330592002801594650002201622650001201644650002001656650001101676650001601687650001301703650002301716650001101739700001901750700002301769700001801792700002401810700002701834773008201861856008601943990002302029852000902052655001202061IND60110904120221117224609.0141109e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011090412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Haimei10aControlling electron beam-induced structure modifications and cation exchange in cadmium sulfide–copper sulfide heterostructured nanorods  ap. 207-213.  aThe atomic structure and interfaces of CdS/Cu₂S heterostructured nanorods are investigated with the aberration-corrected TEAM 0.5 electron microscope operated at 80kV and 300kV applying in-line holography and complementary techniques. Cu₂S exhibits a low-chalcocite structure in pristine CdS/Cu₂S nanorods. Under electron beam irradiation the Cu₂S phase transforms into a high-chalcocite phase while the CdS phase maintains its wurtzite structure. Time-resolved experiments reveal that Cu⁺–Cd²⁺ cation exchange at the CdS/Cu₂S interfaces is stimulated by the electron beam and proceeds within an undisturbed and coherent sulfur sub-lattice. A variation of the electron beam current provides an efficient way to control and exploit such irreversible solid-state chemical processes that provide unique information about system dynamics at the atomic scale. Specifically, we show that the electron beam-induced copper–cadmium exchange is site specific and anisotropic. A resulting displacement of the CdS/Cu₂S interfaces caused by beam-induced cation interdiffusion equals within a factor of 3–10 previously reported Cu diffusion length measurements in heterostructured CdS/Cu₂S thin film solar cells with an activation energy of 0.96eV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acadmium 3acation exchange 3acopper 3airradiation 3ananorods 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asulfur1 aSadtler, Bryce1 aHabenicht, Carsten1 aFreitag, Bert1 aAlivisatos, A.

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), as one of energy storage technologies aiming at this problem, has excellent characteristics of energy storage and utilization, but its dependence on fossil fuels makes CAES less attractive. In order to avoid the use of fuels, Advanced Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (AA-CAES), which is an optimized CAES system, is designed to capture and reuse the compressed air heat. In this paper, four different air storage chamber models are established and the characteristics of charge and discharge process are analyzed based on the theory of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, the thermodynamic effects of different air storage chamber models on AA-CAES system are examined. Results show that the difference of air storage chamber models can result in different characteristics of charge and discharge process which may affect the working stability of AA-CAES system. Besides, the influence degree of the number of stages on system efficiency and other parameters change with air storage chamber models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acharge characteristics 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3amarkets 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources1 aYang, Ke1 aLi, Xuemei1 aXu, Jianzhong0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Sept., v. 57 p.469-478dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011700179300001400296520209300310592002802403650002402431650001902455650001202474650002002486650001202506650001302518650001402531650001902545650001202564650002802576650001302604650001902617650004302636650001102679650001202690650001502702650002102717650000702738650000902745650001302754700003902767700002702806773008602833856008402919990002303003852000903026655001203035IND60104503120221119043552.0141107e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010450312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Sartal, Cristina10aEffect of the cooking procedure on the arsenic speciation in the bioavailable (dialyzable) fraction from seaweed  ap. 65-71.  aSeafood, including edible seaweed, contains high levels of arsenic. The intake of seaweed is a route to arsenic exposure. Due to the different toxic behaviors among arsenic species, speciation studies are a matter of vital importance to evaluate possible health risks for consumers. Most seaweeds are ingested after a heat treatment and these thermal procedures could lead to a change in arsenic speciation. In this work an arsenic speciation study of four edible seaweeds (Kombu, Wakame, Nori and Sea Lettuce) after cooking has been performed by anion-exchange HPLC connected to an ICP-MS for arsenical detection. Speciation studies were also carried out in the cooking waters of those samples. Powdered cooked seaweed was subjected to an in-vitro digestion procedure by using Piperazine-NN-bis (2-ethane-sulfonic acid) disodium (PIPES), as a buffer solution at a pH of 7.0 and dialysis membranes of 10kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO). Dialyzable fractions were analyzed to identify the arsenic species that become bioavailable for human body functions. Total arsenic concentrations were found between 5.3 and 79.1μgg⁻¹, 3.6–36.7μgg⁻¹ and 1.8–54.3μgg⁻¹ for raw and cooked seaweed, and cooking water, respectively. Total arsenic bioavailability percentages were 20%, 29%, 18% and 11% for cooked Kombu, Nori, Wakame and Sea lettuce, respectively. Results suggest that the heat treatment and the acidic environment and enzymes used in the in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion are not sufficient to produce a change in the arsenic species of the four seaweeds studied. Arsenic species are comparable in each seaweed before and after being cooked, their cooking water and dialysate. Arsenosugars were the main arsenic species found. As(III) species and arsenobetaine (AB) were only found in the Sea Lettuce sample. Glycerol sugar and sulfonate sugar were the most bioavailable species for cooked Kombu and Wakame. Phosphate sugar showed to be in highest proportion in the dialyzable fraction of Nori. AB and glycerol sugar became more bioavailable in the Sea Lettuce sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aanion exchange 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acooking 3adialysis 3adigestion 3aedible seaweed 3aenzymes 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycerol 3aheat treatment 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3alettuce 3amacroalgae 3amolecular weight 3apH 3arisk 3atoxicity1 aBarciela-Alonso, María del Carmen1 aBermejo-Barrera, Pilar0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2012 Nov., v. 105 p.65-71dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014500170300001400315520114600329592002801475650001101503650002101514650002301535650001101558650001601569650001101585650000901596650001101605650001101616650001401627650001601641700002401657700002501681773010301706856008401809852000901893655001201902IND60101825320221122052328.0141106e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010182532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWessel, Claudia10aFirst-principles electronic-structure calculations on the stability and oxygen conductivity in Ba₀.₅Sr₀.₅Co₀.₈Fe₀.₂O₃₋δ  ap. 92-96.  aThe perovskite-type compound Ba₀.₅Sr₀.₅Co₀.₈Fe₀.₂O₃₋δ has been investigated using quantum–theoretical methods. Density–functional calculations indicate a preference of the oxygen vacancy to be located close to cobalt instead of iron because of the higher affinity of oxygen towards iron. The energy barrier for an oxygen-hopping process was examined using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The resulting minimum-energy path is characterized by a correlation between the effective coordination number and the calculated energy: the lower the effective coordination number and the weaker the chemical bonding of the migrating oxygen atoms, the higher the energy. Also, the energy barriers appear to be slightly smaller when the oxygen atom passes an iron atom instead of a cobalt atom. Phonon calculations were carried out to achieve a thermodynamic analysis of B-site substituted BSCF5582 as a function of temperature. Theory suggests that substitution of cobalt by nickel destabilizes the structure whereas Mn-doped BSCF is favored over the unsubstituted compound in a wide temperature range between 0 and 1600K.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3acobalt 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3airon 3anickel 3aoxygen 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aLumey, Marck-Willem1 aDronskowski, Richard0 tJournal of membrane science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 366, no. 1-2 p.92-96dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011000170300001600280520122600296592002801522650002001550650002401570650001301594700001701607773010301624856008501727990002301812852000901835655001201844IND60101669520221117155945.0141106e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010166952DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60372-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLU, Dong-qiang10aTransient flexural- and capillary-gravity waves due to disturbances in two-layer density-stratified fluid  ap. 339-347.  aGeneration of the transient flexural- and capillary-gravity waves by impulsive disturbances in a two-layer fluid is investigated analytically. The upper fluid is covered by a thin elastic plate or by an inertial surface with the capillary effect. The density of each of the two immiscible layers is constant. The fluids are assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the motion be irrotational. A point force on the surface and simple mass sources in the upper and lower fluid layers are considered. A linear system is established within the framework of potential theory. The integral solutions for the surface and interfacial waves are obtained by means of the Laplace-Fourier transform. A new representation for the dispersion relation of flexural- and capillary-gravity waves in a two-layer fluid is derived. The asymptotic representations of the wave motions are derived for large time with a fixed distance-to-time ratio with the Stokes and Scorer methods of stationary phase. It is shown that there are two different modes, namely the surface and interfacial wave modes. The wave systems observed depend on the relation between the observer's moving speed and the intrinsic minimal and maximal group velocities.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3avelocity1 aSUN, Cui-zhi0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2013 July, v. 25, no. 3 p.339-347dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60372-83Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001600261520155700277592002801834650002401862650001501886650002001901650002801921650002801949650001501977650002201992650001202014650002002026650001302046650001902059650003302078700001602111700001902127773009802146856008102244990002302325852000902348655001202357IND60108555020221117033733.0141108e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010855502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Jian-Ding10aNanocomposite film based on graphene oxide for high performance flexible glucose biosensor  ap. 287-294.  aA homogeneous chitosan–ferrocene/graphene oxide/glucose oxidase (CS–Fc/GO/GOx) nanocomposite film was successfully constructed as a novel platform for the fabrication of glucose biosensor. The morphologies and electrochemistry of the nanocomposite film were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. Results demonstrated that the uniformly dispersed GO within the CS matrix could significantly improve the stability of GO and make it exhibit a positive charge, which was more favorable for the further immobilization of biomolecules, such as GOx, with higher loading. Further attaching redox mediator ferrocene group (Fc) to CS could not only effectively prevent the leakage of Fc from the matrix and retain its electrochemical activity, but also improve the electrical conductivity of CS and promote the electron-transfer between GOx and electrode. Biosensors based on this CS–Fc/GO/GOx film had advantages of fast response, excellent reproducibility, high stability, and showed a linear response to glucose in the concentration range from 0.02 to 6.78mM with a detection limit of 7.6μM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and exhibited a higher sensitivity of 10μAmM⁻¹cm⁻². The proposed strategy based on CS–Fc/GO nanocomposite for the immobilization of enzymes can be of practical relevance for the facile design of biosensors, as well as for the construction of new multifunctional bioelectrochemical systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aHuang, Jing1 aLiang, Ru-Ping0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 160, no. 1 p.287-294dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.07.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172300001600286520169200302592002801994650001502022650002002037650001302057650002002070650001602090650001602106650001202122650001402134650001302148650001502161650001502176650000902191650002702200650001602227650001302243650001202256653002002268653002002288653001802308653001202326700002302338700002302361700002502384773009602409856008602505852000902591655001202600IND60111264220221121080655.0190319e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011126422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapiro, Adam J.10aVaccine induced Hepatitis A and B protection in children at risk for cystic fibrosis associated liver disease  ap. 906-911.  aHepatitis A (HAV) and Hepatitis B (HBV) infections can cause serious morbidity in patients with liver disease, including cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFALD). HAV and HBV vaccinations are recommended in CFALD, and maintenance of detectable antibody levels is also recommended with chronic liver disease. A better understanding of factors predicting low HAV and HBV antibodies may help physicians improve protection from these viruses in CFALD patients.We examined HAV and HBV vaccine protection in children at risk for CFALD. Clinical and vaccine histories were reviewed, and HAV and HBV antibody titers measured. Those with no vaccination history or low HAV or HBV titers received primary or booster vaccinations, and responses were measured.Thirty-four of 308 children were at risk for CFALD per project criteria. Ten had previous HAV vaccination, of which 90% had positive anti-HAV antibodies. Thirty-three of 34 had previously received primary HBV vaccination (most in infancy), but only 12 (35%) had adequate anti-HBs levels (≥10mIU/mL). Children with adequate anti-HBs levels were older at first HBV vaccine (median 2.3 vs. 0.1 years, p<0.01), and at final HBV vaccine (median 4.0 vs. 0.8 years, p=0.01). Fourteen of 19 (74%) responded to HBV boosters. Z-scores for BMI at HBV booster were significantly lower in booster non-responders (p=0.04).Children at increased risk of CFALD have inadequate HAV and HBV antibody levels, and HBV antibody protection can be enhanced through vaccine boosters. HBV antibody titers should be assessed in CFALD patients with a history of vaccination, particularly in those who received HBV vaccines in infancy or who are malnourished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abody mass index 3achildren 3acystic fibrosis 3ahepatitis A 3ahepatitis B 3ainfancy 3amorbidity 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aprediction 3arisk 3asecondary immunization 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aViral hepatitis 0aCystic fibrosis 0aLiver disease 0aBooster1 aEsther, Charles R.1 aLeigh, Margaret W.1 aDellon, Elisabeth P.0 tVaccine.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 31, no. 6 p.906-911dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013200172300001400304520095000318592002801268650001501296650001301311650001601324650001101340650000901351650002701360700002101387700001901408700002101427773010601448856008601554990002301640852000901663655001201672IND60102303820221120082830.0141106e20110308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010230382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.11.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagalakshmi, R.10aPolarized Raman and hyperpolarizability studies of Hydroxyethylammonium (l) tartrate monohydrate for quadratic nonlinear optics  ap. 17-23.  aSingle crystals of Hydroxyethylammonium l-tartrate monohydrate [HEALT] have been grown by slow evaporation technique using water as a solvent. The structural and vibrational properties of the crystals were studied. Besides these characterizations ab initio quantum chemical calculations have been performed at HF/6-31G (d) level to derive first order hyperpolarizability. It is shown that the first order hyperpolarizability is found to be 14.2 times more than that of urea. The characteristic vibrational frequencies obtained from polarized Raman spectra in different scattering configurations have been assigned based on the complete factor group analysis. Vibrational analysis of IR and Raman reveals that the charge transfer interaction must be responsible for nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the present system. The UV absorption measurements have also been carried out to confirm the utility of the material for optical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystals 3aevaporation 3aoptics 3aurea 3avibrational properties1 aKrishnakumar, V.1 aHagemann, Hans1 aMuthunatesan, S.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2011 Mar. 8, v. 988, no. 1-3 p.17-23dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.11.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001400264520129400278592002801572650002101600650002401621650001901645650001401664650003501678650001401713650001801727650002101745650002301766651001901789700001501808700001601823700001701839700001701856700002001873700001501893700001701908773010201925856008502027852000902112655001202121IND60101421920221122220808.0141106e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010142192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaterakis, N.14aThe effectiveness of anaerobic digestion in removing estrogens and nonylphenol ethoxylates  ap. 88-95.  aThe fate and behaviour of two groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals, steroid estrogens and nonylphenol ethoxylates, have been evaluated during the anaerobic digestion of primary and mixed sewage sludge under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Digestion occurred over six retention times, in laboratory scale reactors, treating sludges collected from a sewage treatment works in the United Kingdom. It has been established that sludge concentrations of both groups of compounds demonstrated temporal variations and that concentrations in mixed sludge were influenced by the presence of waste activated sludge as a result of transformations during aerobic treatment. The biodegradation of total steroid estrogens was >50% during primary sludge digestion with lower removals observed for mixed sludge, which reflected bulk organic solids removal efficiencies. The removal of nonylphenol ethoxylates was greater in mixed sludge digestion (>58%) compared with primary sludge digestion and did not reflect bulk organic removal efficiencies. It is apparent that anaerobic digestion reduces the concentrations of these compounds, and would therefore be expected to confer a degree of protection against exposure and transfer of both groups of compounds to the receiving/re-use environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3adigestion 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrogens 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3atemporal variation 3aUnited Kingdom1 aChiu, T.Y.1 aKoh, Y.K.K.1 aLester, J.N.1 aMcAdam, E.J.1 aScrimshaw, M.D.1 aSoares, A.1 aCartmell, E.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 199-200 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100003000168245011100198300001600309520138900325592002801714650001901742650001401761650001901775650001201794650000901806650001701815650001201832650003101844650001501875650001001890650002901900650002101929650003001950650001701980650003001997650002102027650002002048650001102068650006702079650001102146650002002157650002302177650004502200650002402245650002202269700001802291700002602309700002202335700002602357700002402383700002202407773009302429856008302522990002302605852000902628655001202637IND60102604820221119075827.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010260482DNAL7 a226826142pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.04.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Biarge, Miriam,10aWhite Matter and Cortical Injury in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: Antecedent Factors and 2-Year Outcome  ap. 799-807.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine the spectrum of isolated white matter (WM)/cortical injury and its relation to outcomes in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and normal appearing basal ganglia and thalami. STUDY DESIGN: From 1992-2007, 84 term infants with HIE and normal basal ganglia and thalami on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging were studied; WM/cortical lesions were classified by site and severity. Neurodevelopmental outcomes and head growth were documented at a median age of 2 years. RESULTS: The WM was normal or mildly abnormal in 33.5%, moderate in 40.5%, and severely abnormal in 26% of infants. Cortical involvement was not seen or was only mild in 75.5%, moderate in 13%, and severe in 12% of infants. WM and cortical injury severity were highly correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.74; P < .001). Infants with severe WM injury had more severe neonatal courses and a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. No infant died. Five infants (6%) developed cerebral palsy but all could walk independently. Cognitive, visual, language, behavioral, and seizure problems were highly prevalent and correlated significantly with the severity of WM injury and poor postnatal head growth. CONCLUSION: Infants with HIE and selective WM/cortical injury have a low prevalence of cerebral palsy but have a wide range of other problems, which occur more often with severe WM/cortical lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerebral palsy 3acognition 3aencephalopathy 3aganglia 3ahead 3ahypoglycemia 3ainfants 3amagnetic resonance imaging 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBasal Gangliaxpathology 2aBrainxpathology 2aBrain Injuriesxdiagnosis 2aCephalometry 2aCerebral Palsyxdiagnosis 2aChild, Preschool 2aGestational Age 2aHumans 2aHypoxia-Ischemia, Brainxdiagnosisxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aIntelligence Tests 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aThalamusxpathology 2aTreatment Outcome1 aBregant, Tina1 aWusthoff, Courtney J.1 aChew, Andrew T.M.1 aDiez-Sebastian, Jesus1 aRutherford, Mary A.1 aCowan, Frances M.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Nov., v. 161, no. 5 p.799-807dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.04.0543Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007700179300001800256520053200274592002800806650001900834650001600853650001200869650002300881650001200904650001400916700003300930700003000963700003600993700002601029700002801055773009701083856008401180852000901264655001201273IND60109790620221120222917.0141109e20110720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010979062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValois-Escamilla, Ismael10aSynthesis of 6-bromo-2-arylindoles using 2-iodobenzoic acid as precursor  ap. 3726-3728.  aThe synthesis of 6-bromo-2-arylindoles starting from readily available 2-iodobenzoic acid is presented.

The Mediterranean basin is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world to global change, and one of the “hot spots” for forthcoming problems of water availability. The present review provides an overview about the relationship between chemical quality (especially concerning organic microcontaminants) and water scarcity, particularly in the Mediterranean area.

They all exhibit high selectivity toward Cu²⁺ in ethanol in the presence of other metallic ions (Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Ag⁺), as well as fast, stable, and reversible binding, as is evidenced by the observation of a red shift in the UV–vis spectrum, ‘ON–OFF’ fluorescence response. In addition, titration and MALDI-TOF measurements indicated that a 1:1 (and possibly also 2:1 (organic ligand: Cu²⁺) complexes were formed, depending on the relative amount of Cu²⁺ added to the solution of the organic ligand. It was also found that the binding constant could be tuned by modifying the nature and position of the substituents attached to the central benzene ring in the quinoxalone derivative. In acetonitrile, unlike in ethanol, these ligands undergo oxidation-decomposition by Cu²⁺ and therefore, no UV–vVis absorption bands could be observed. However, due to color change (from yellow to transparent) they could be useful as dosimeters in this solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetonitrile 3abenzene 3acalcium 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acobalt 3acopper 3aethanol 3afluorescence 3aions 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3asilver 3asolvents 3atitration 3azinc1 aCohen, Beny1 aZeng, Cheng-Chu1 aXu, Yi-Sheng1 aBecker, James Y.0 tTetrahedron.g2011 Aug. 26, v. 67, no. 34 p.6252-6258dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002600167245013300193300001400326520112500340592002801465650002601493650001401519650001301533650001101546650001401557650002301571650000901594650002501603650001101628650002401639650002301663700001801686700002901704773010301733856008201836990002301918852000901941655001201950IND60107404820221121025050.0141108e20110807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010740482DNAL7 a216055682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoethke, Hans Joachim14aThe ability of individuals to assess population density influences the evolution of emigration propensity and dispersal distance  ap. 93-99.  aWe analyze the simultaneous evolution of emigration and settlement decisions for actively dispersing species differing in their ability to assess population density. Using an individual-based model we simulate dispersal as a multi-step (patch to patch) movement in a world consisting of habitat patches surrounded by a hostile matrix. Each such step is associated with the same mortality risk. Our simulations show that individuals following an informed strategy, where emigration (and settlement) probability depends on local population density, evolve a lower (natal) emigration propensity but disperse over significantly larger distances – i.e. postpone settlement longer – than individuals performing density-independent emigration. This holds especially when variation in environmental conditions is spatially correlated. Both effects can be traced to the informed individuals' ability to better exploit existing heterogeneity in reproductive chances. Yet, already moderate distance-dependent dispersal costs prevent the evolution of multi-step (long-distance) dispersal, irrespective of the dispersal strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation density 3arisk 2aBiological Evolution 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPopulation Density1 aGros, Andreas1 aHovestadt, T.q(Thomas),0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Aug. 7, v. 282, no. 1 p.93-99dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.05.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001400277520067700291592002800968650001400996650002301010650001801033650001801051700002301069700002001092700002301112700002301135700002501158700002201183700002201205700002001227773008501247856008201332852000901414655001201423IND60100282020221116162737.0141105e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010028202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroppo, Elena10aEffect of reduction in liquid phase on the properties and the catalytic activity of Pd/Al₂O₃ catalysts  ap. 44-54.  aThe change in structural and surface properties of Pd/Al₂O₃ catalysts as the effect of reduction in liquid phase during preparation is investigated by a multi-technical approach.

The analytical scheme consists of (1) solid-phase extraction (SPE) carried out on hypercrosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene (Isolute ENV+) cartridge; (2) derivatization with trimethylsilyl-N,N-dimethylcarbamate (TMSDMC); (3) analysis of the derivatives with capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, in the selective ion monitoring mode. Ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate/acetic acid (5v/v%) mixture, dichloromethane and acetonitrile were compared as to their ability to elute the phenols and chlorophenols from the ENV+sorbent in the smallest solvent volume possible. The optimized extraction step uses a minimal amount of organic solvent (4mL ethyl acetate). Derivatization of the phenols and chlorophenols with TMSDMC was studied with respect to conversion, reagent excess, medium, temperature and the stability of the trimethylsilyl derivatives. If the reagent is applied in sufficient excess, the reaction takes place instantaneously at room temperature, and the derivatives remain stable for 24h, making the procedure simple, fast and convenient. The overall method gave detection limits of 0.05–100ng/L for all compounds except resorcinol which could not be retained on the SPE cartridge. The complete optimized analytical scheme was applied to ground water and river water samples collected in Hungary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacetonitrile 3acatechol 3achlorophenols 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agroundwater 3aisomers 3amethylene chloride 3amonitoring 3ap-cresol 3apentachlorophenol 3aphenol 3aresorcinol 3ariver water 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factors 3aHungary1 aMörtl, Mária1 aKende, Anikó0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2011 Sept., v. 99, no. 1 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008200173300001600255520103200271592002801303650001901331650001401350650001501364650002101379650001501400650001701415650001501432650000901447650001301456650002301469653000901492653000701501653000901508653000901517653000801526653000801534653000901542653000801551653000701559653000801566653000801574653001001582653000801592653000901600653000901609653000801618653001001626653001101636653000901647653001601656653003201672653001501704653003501719653002601754653001601780700002901796700001801825700002101843700002101864700002801885700002501913773011201938856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60104655220221119084705.0161020e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010465522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanczkowski, Waldemar10aCharacterization of the LPS-induced inflammation of the adrenal gland in mice  ap. 228-235.  aSystemic administration of endotoxin, which closely mimics the bacteria-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can ultimately lead to organ failure. Adrenal gland insufficiency is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients; however, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, we studied comprehensively the characteristics of adrenal gland dysregulation, including inflammation, leukocyte infiltration and cell death in the adrenal glands in the course of LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice. LPS enhanced expression of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, which resulted in rapid recruitment of leukocytes into the adrenal gland. Furthermore, LPS-mediated inflammation was associated with increased apoptosis of adrenocortical and chromaffin cells. Our results performed in mice, suggest that LPS-induced adrenal gland inflammation and cell death might be mechanisms potentially involved in the adrenal gland dysfunction in patients with sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3aapoptosis 3achemokines 3achromaffin cells 3aendotoxins 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3amice 3apatients 3asepsis (infection) 0aACTH 0aCD 0aC5aR 0aCXCL 0aCCL 0aHPA 0aICAM 0aIFN 0aIL 0aLPS 0aMPO 0amPGES 0aNOS 0aPGRP 0aSIRS 0aTLR 0aTUNEL 0aTNF-α 0aVCAM 0aEndotoxemia 0aAdrenal gland insufficiency 0aChemokines 0aThe immune–adrenal crosstalk 0aLeukocyte recruitment 0aVasculature1 aChatzigeorgiou, Antonios1 aSamus, Maryna1 aTrần, Nguyên,1 aZacharowski, Kai1 aChavakis, Triantafyllos1 aBornstein, Stefan R.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 May 22, v. 371 p.228-235dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170300001800278500001500296520095900311592002801270650002201298650002001320650001301340650001901353650002001372650001901392650001301411650001301424650001801437650002101455653001801476700002001494700001901514773008301533856008501616990002301701852000901724655001201733IND60105703520221119132411.0141108e20120509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010570352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLayek, Rama K.10aGraphene sulphonic acid/chitosan nano biocomposites with tunable mechanical and conductivity properties  ap. 2265-2273.  a2019-12-04  aNanocomposites of chitosan are produced using graphene sulphonic acid (SG) at five different compositions and are designated as SG0.5, SG0.75, SG1, SG3 and SG5; the numbers indicate weight percent of SG. The TEM & AFM micrographs indicate that the SG sheets are in exfoliated state. The thermal stability and the storage modulus of the composites increase with increasing SG concentration showing a maximum increase (202%) for SG5 sample. The stresses at break and Young’s modulus have increased with increasing SG content. SG5 shows the highest increase of both tensile strength and Young’s modulus of 290 ± 7% and 200 ± 7%, respectively. Analysis of the Young’s modulus data suggests that SG sheets are randomly distributed and at ≥1 wt% concentration they are unidirectionally oriented parallel to the film.

In non-amended forest soils, the degradation half-life of hexazinone was 21.4, 30.4, 19.4 and 32.8 days in forest soil A, B, C and D, respectively. Degradation could start in soil A and C without lag period because the two soils had been contaminated by this herbicide for a long time, possibly leading to completion of acclimation period of hexazinone-degrading bacteria. In forest soils amended with sewage sludge, the degradation rate constant increased by 17.3% in soil A, 48.2% in soil B, 8.1% in soil C and 51.6% in soil D, respectively. The higher degradation rates (soil A and C) in non-amended soils accord with the lower rate increase in sewage sludge-amended soils. Under non-sterile conditions, biological mechanism accounted for 51.8–62.4% of hexazinone degradation in four soils. Under sterile conditions, the four soils had the similar chemical degradation capacity for hexazinone. In non-amended soil B, only one metabolite (B) was detected, while two metabolites (B and C) were found in sewage sludge-amended soil B. Similarly situated in agricultural soils, N-demethylation at 6-position of triazine ring, hydroxylation at the 4-positon of cyclohexyl group, and removal of the dimethylamino group with formation of a carbonyl group at 6-position of triazine ring appear to be the principal mechanism involved in hexazinone degradation in sewage sludge-amended forest soils. These data will improve understanding of the actual pollution risk as a result of forest soil fertilization with sewage sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aagricultural soils 3aaseptic conditions 3abacteria 3achemical degradation 3aforest soils 3ahalf life 3ahexazinone 3ahydroxylation 3ametabolites 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3arisk 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3aChina1 aWang, Chengjun1 aChen, Fan1 aMa, Meiping1 aLin, Zhenkun1 aWang, Wenwei1 aXu, Zhengti1 aWang, Xuedong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 199-200 p.96-104dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245004700167300001400214520125700228592002801485650000801513650001001521650001301531650002801544650001101572650002101583700002401604700002501628700002101653773009901674856008101773990002301854852000901877655001201886IND60108466820221122121606.0141108e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010846682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiljev, Piotr10aUltrasonic system for solar panel cleaning  ap. 74-78.  aA lot of applications are required for surfaces or walls to remain free from airborne particle deposition. A typical example is the deposition of dust on the solar panels in dusty zones. Pollen, bird droppings, dirt, and dust can build up on solar panels. The ultrasonic cleaning action is able to infiltrate the smallest crevices and hard-to-reach surfaces, penetrating areas normally inaccessible to other cleaning methods. During the rarefaction cycle the liquid is torn apart. This creates a vacuum cavity within the liquid. These cavities will grow larger and smaller as the compression waves are continued. This paper proposes a possibility to create the ultrasonic cavity into liquid in motion with depth of water from 0.1 to 1mm. We are created the ultrasonic cleaning system that performs an ultrasonic cavity in thin water layer in motion (Fig. 1). The finite element method (FEM) was used to define both harmonical analysis and interaction between ultrasonic actuator and medium (air or/and water). The prototype ultrasonic cleaning system was developed and some experimental results were defined. The laser vibrometer used for measuring of mechanical fluctuations on the piezoelectric actuator's surface and measuring results are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abirds 3acleaning 3afinite element analysis 3apollen 3asolar collectors1 aBorodinas, Sergejus1 aBareikis, Regimantas1 aStruckas, Arunas0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Definitions are proposed for the quality and adequacy of data. Quality is differentiated into four categories. A description of how the scheme can be used for evaluating data reliability, especially for use when contributing entries to the IUCLID database, is shown. A discussion of how the criteria might also be used when determining overall data relevance is included.

The movement of these motors is classically assumed to consist of steps involving stiction and sliding, resulting in the term “stick-slip drives”. In the first part of this contribution it has been found that using ideal driving signals, “slip-slip” operation without phases of stiction allows very high velocities, while the maximum velocity is limited principally in stick-slip operation. In this part it is shown that slip-slip operation is also suitable for use with real actuators, driven with frequency-limited versions of the ideal signals presented in part I. The motional performance of the motor as well as its wear and the required electric power are investigated for operation with different signals. It is found that for high velocity inertia motors it is recommendable to use actuators with large stroke and to drive them with a signal consisting of two harmonics at a high fundamental frequency, a result that is supported by similar setups implemented experimentally by other authors. Using Lanczos’ σ factors to calculate the frequency-limited excitation signals instead of standard Fourier series additionally increases the motor performance significantly. The results help motor designers to choose the appropriate mode of operation and to optimise the motor parameters for their individual applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aelectrical equipment 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3astroke1 aHemsel, Tobias1 aSextro, Walter0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The isolation of the antiaromatic compound 21 has also to be rejected.

Influence of transmembrane pressure and cross-flow velocity on normalized permeate flux rate decline and membrane fouling were examined. The microfiltration system was equipped with a tubular ceramic membrane with 0.45μm pore size. A combined pore-blockage–cake-filtration model was successfully used to determine the process performance and identify principal fouling mechanisms. Experimental results revealed that the fouling phenomenon taking place during microfiltration of the fermented mash follows a pattern of initial complete pore blockage and subsequent cake formation. As a result, initial rapid flux decline is followed by gradual flux decline. Fouled membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The membrane surface characteristics examined by SEM images evidenced formation of dense deposit on the upper membrane surface. Rinsing the fouled membrane with water followed by investigation of the permeate flux rate indicated occurrence of increased fouling, when microfiltration was carried out at high transmembrane pressure. The highest normalized flux decline was observed for microfiltration operated at the highest transmembrane pressure (1.4bar) and the lowest cross flow velocity (1ms⁻¹). It is recommended to use high cross-flow velocity (4.55ms⁻¹) and low transmembrane pressure (0.35bar) to minimize membrane fouling, triggered by components of the fermented mash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aceramics 3acorn starch 3aculture media 3afermentation 3afouling 3amash 3amicrofiltration 3amodels 3aporosity 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules1 aCelińska, Ewelina1 aDembczyński, Radosław1 aSzymanowska, Daria1 aNowacka, Magdalena1 aJesionowski, Teofil1 aGrajek, Włodzimierz0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 427 p.118-128dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008000168300001400248520209000262592002802352650003002380650002202410650002102432650002102453650001302474650003302487650001302520650002102533650001902554650001502573650002702588650001602615651001102631700001402642700001602656700001602672773010202688856008702790852000902877655001202886IND60108219620221119014452.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010821962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKfir, Ofir14aThe effect of reservoir operational features on recycled wastewater quality  ap. 76-87.  aIsrael's wastewater recycling program is unprecedented internationally, with close to 80% of sewage treated and reused in agriculture. This article presents findings from a national survey of Israel's wastewater reservoir network. Israel's extensive reuse of wastewater is possible due to a national network of reservoirs that has been established in recent years. Sixty effluent reservoirs presently operating in all parts of Israel, were reviewed and evaluated for static data and sampled for water quality analysis during the intensive irrigation season of 2008. The measurement of 16 chemical, physical and biological parameters, along with 21 major and trace elements was carried out, revealing a wide range of concentrations that reflect reservoir physical and operational characteristics. Results indicate that 65% and 78% of the supplied wastewater volume met the old 20mg/L BOD and 30mg/L TSS regulations for unlimited irrigation. With reference to Israel's updated, more stringent, regulations, only 22% and 28% of the supplied wastewater volume met the new TSS and E.C. regulations for unlimited irrigation, respectively, and only 48%, 58%, 58% and 62% met the new BOD, fecal coliforms, chloride and sodium regulations for unlimited new irrigation, respectively. All measured major and trace elements were well under existing standards, although there were considerable regional variation. Both principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used to examine how the wastewater quality relates to multiple static construction features and operational parameters of the studied reservoirs. Sewage treatment plant technology, along with the reservoir operational regime, were found to have the greatest influence on the organic, nutrient and suspended solids loads of the wastewater supplied. The geographic location of the reservoirs along with their designed area to volume ratio, were found to have the largest influence over salinity components loads. Careful consideration should be given to the aforementioned features in future the reservoir planning process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3airrigation rates 3anational surveys 3aplanning 3aprincipal component analysis 3asalinity 3asewage treatment 3atrace elements 3awastewater 3awater quality analysis 3awater reuse 3aIsrael1 aTal, Alon1 aGross, Amit1 aAdar, Eilon0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Nov., v. 68 p.76-87dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245011600181300001400297520069900311592002801010650001501038650001401053650002201067650002901089650002301118700001801141773011601159856008801275990002301363852000901386655001201395IND60107300820221118012537.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010730082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Ramirez, Jaime,10aOn the limitations of standard statistical modeling in biological systems: A full Bayesian approach for biology  ap. 80-91.  aOne of the most important scientific challenges today is the quantitative and predictive understanding of biological function.

We address the conceptual and methodological obstacles that lie in the inverse problem in biological systems modeling. We introduce a full Bayesian approach (FBA), a theoretical framework to study biological function, in which probability distributions are conditional on biophysical information that physically resides in the biological system that is studied by the scientist.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3aequations 3amolecular biology 3aprobability distribution 3astatistical models1 aSanz, Ricardo0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2013 Sept., v. 113, no. 1 p.80-91dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100003000190245014600220300001800366520183700384592002802221650001402249650001902263650001402282650001302296650001702309650001202326650002602338650002902364650001402393650000902407650001702416650001602433650003602449650004302485650004102528650002102569650003002590650003502620650005302655650007802708650001102786650002202797650001102819650003402830650001102864650002002875650002202895650007502917650002202992650002003014650000903034650002603043650001703069650002203086700002503108700002303133700002403156700002003180700002503200700002203225773009503247856008303342990002303425852000903448655001203457IND60102605220221119074038.0141106e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010260522DNAL7 a227952222pmid7 aPMC34748582pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.05.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickremasinghe, Andrea C.10aNeurodevelopmental Outcomes Following Two Different Treatment Approaches (Early Ligation and Selective Ligation) for Patent Ductus Arteriosus  ap. 1065-1072.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine whether a change in the approach to managing persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) from early ligation to selective ligation is associated with an increased risk of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: In 2005, we changed our PDA treatment protocol for infants born at ≤27 6/7 weeks' gestation from an early ligation approach, with prompt PDA ligation if the ductus failed to close after indomethacin therapy (period 1: January 1999 to December 2004), to a selective ligation approach, with PDA ligation performed only if specific criteria were met (period 2: January 2005 to May 2009). All infants in both periods received prophylactic indomethacin. Multivariate analysis was used to compare the odds of a composite abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome (Bayley Mental Developmental Index or Cognitive Score <70, cerebral palsy, blindness, and/or deafness) associated with each treatment approach at age 18-36 months (n = 224). RESULTS: During period 1, 23% of the infants in follow-up failed indomethacin treatment, and all underwent surgical ligation. During period 2, 30% of infants failed indomethacin, and 66% underwent ligation after meeting prespecified criteria. Infants treated with the selective ligation strategy demonstrated fewer abnormal outcomes than those treated with the early ligation approach (OR, 0.07; P = .046). Infants who underwent ligation before 10 days of age had an increased incidence of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome. The significant difference in outcomes between the 2 PDA treatment strategies could be accounted for in part by the earlier age of ligation during period 1. CONCLUSION: A selective ligation approach for PDAs that fail to close with indomethacin therapy is not associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 18-36 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablindness 3acerebral palsy 3acognition 3adeafness 3aindomethacin 3ainfants 3amultivariate analysis 3apatent ductus arteriosus 3apregnancy 3arisk 3atherapeutics 2aAge Factors 2aBlindnessxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aCardiovascular Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCerebral Palsyxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aDeafnessxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aDevelopmental Disabilitiesxdiagnosisxetiology. 2aDuctus Arteriosus, Patentxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxsurgeryxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aIndomethacinxtherapeutic use 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aInfant, Premature, Diseasesxdrug therapyxetiologyxsurgeryxtherapy. 2aLigationxmethods 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aTreatment Outcome1 aRogers, Elizabeth E.1 aPiecuch, Robert E.1 aJohnson, Bridget C.1 aGolden, Suzanne1 aMoon-Grady, Anita J.1 aClyman, Ronald I.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Dec., v. 161, no. 6 p.1065-1072dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.05.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013500165300001400300520063800314592002800952650002700980650001101007650002101018650002201039700001801061700001301079700002001092773010701112856008601219990002301305852000901328655001201337IND60102304420221120072811.0141106e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010230442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Li10aSynthesis and characterization of two new coordination polymers constructed from 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane and thiocyanate  ap. 45-50.  aTwo coordination polymers {[Co₂.₅(btrb)₅(SCN)₅]·5CH₃CN}ₙ (1) and [Cu(btrb)(μ₂-SCN)₂]ₙ (2), with the flexible 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane (btrb) ligand, have been synthesized in the presence of thiocyanate. 1 is composed of 2D layers, which are stacked into 3D architecture through C–H⋯S interactions.

(2010) [Richardson, T.O., Robinson, E.J.H., Christensen, K., Jensen, H.J., Franks, N.R., Sendova-Franks, A.B., 2010. PLoS ONE 5, e9621.] ant motion out of the nest is shown to be a non-stationary process intriguingly similar to the dynamics encountered in physical aging of glassy systems. Specifically, exit events can be described as a Poisson process in logarithmic time, or, for short, a log-Poisson process. Nouvellet et al. (2010) [Nouvellet, P., Bacon, J.P.,Waxman, D., 2010. J. Theor. Biol. 266, 573.] criticized these conclusions and performed new experiments where the exit process could more simply be described by standard Poisson statistics. In their reply Richardson et al. (2011b) [Richardson, T.O., Robinson, E.J.H., Christensen, K., Jensen, J.H., Christensen, K., Jensen, H.J., Franks, N.R., Sendova-Franks, A.B., 2011b. J. Theor. Biol. 269, 356–358.] stressed that the two sets of experiments were performed under very different conditions and claimed that this was the likely source of the discrepancy. Ignoring any technical issues which are part of the above discussion, the focal point of this work is to ascertain whether or not both log-Poisson and Poisson statistics are possible in an ant society under different external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where interacting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring site on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the ensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions between ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are defined and on a control parameter dubbed ‘degree of stochasticity’ (DS), the dynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a standard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can be described as suggested by Richardson et al. Other aspects of the model behavior are also discussed, i.e. the time dependence of the average value of the utility function, and the statistics of spatial re-arrangements happening anywhere in the system. Finally, we discuss the role of record events and their statistics in the context of ant societies and suggest the possibility that a transition from non-stationary to stationary dynamics can be triggered experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiological Sciences 3aFormicidae 3amodels 3anests 3aprobability 3autility functions 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aPoisson Distribution 2aStochastic Processes1 aChristiansen, Simon0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Aug. 7, v. 282, no. 1 p.36-40dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245006300171300001400234520113200248592002801380650001401408650001201422650002201434650001101456650001401467650000901481650001201490650002701502650001201529650002601541650001101567650001901578650001401597650001201611650002101623651001001644653001901654653001101673653001801684653002801702653002201730700002101752773009901773856008701872852000901959655001201968IND60108236520221119012810.0161027e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010823652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsari, Misuzu10aLi-ion battery recycling and cobalt flow analysis in Japan  ap. 52-59.  aBatteries sometimes contain precious or toxic substances (e.g. nickel, cobalt, lead, mercury, cadmium). However, the collection and recycling rate of small batteries were low in Japan.We focus on cobalt in lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries and conduct chemical analysis, questioner survey and flow analysis in Japan.Results of chemical analysis showed that the concentration of cobalt in Li-ion batteries was around 20% regardless of the year manufactured or the manufacturer. As a result of the consumer questionnaire survey, it became clear that 70% or more of the small batteries are not being removed when small electronic products are finally disposed. The survey also revealed that recognition of the law and system for collection and recycling of small rechargeable batteries is approximately 30–40%. Substance flow analysis showed that both production and demand for Li-ion batteries (cobalt) have increased during 2002–2010. The collection rate for used Li-ion batteries was about 10% during this period; uncollected batteries were either stored or disposed through incineration and landfill as municipal solid waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3acobalt 3alandfills 3alead 3alithium 3amaterial flow analysis 3amercury 3amunicipal solid waste 3anickel 3aquestionnaires 3arecycling 3asurveys 3atoxic substances 3aJapan 0aLi-ion battery 0aCobalt 0aQuestionnaire 0aSubstance flow analysis 0aChemical analysis1 aSakai, Shin-ichi0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Dec., v. 81 p.52-59dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012000171300001800291500001500309520036000324592002800684650002300712650001500735650001500750650002300765650002300788653002200811700002100833700001900854700002100873700002300894700002100917700001900938773008900957856008101046852000901127655001201136IND60109402520221120204548.0141109e20110826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010940252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHigashijima, Shinji10aHighly efficient new indoline dye having strong electron-withdrawing group for zinc oxide dye-sensitized solar cell  ap. 6289-6293.  a2019-12-04  aNew indoline dye (DN319) having strong electron-withdrawing dicyanovinylidene moiety and octyl group in the terminal rhodanine ring gave higher efficiency than D205, which was known as an excellent organic dye sensitizer.

Producing this steel causes significant amounts of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. Climate change experts recommend this amount be halved by 2050; however steel demand is predicted to have doubled by this date. As process efficiency improvements will not reach the required 75% reduction in emissions per unit steel output, new methods must be examined to deliver service using less steel production. To apply such methods successfully to construction, it must first be known where steel is used currently within the industry. This information is not available so a methodology is proposed to estimate it from known data. Results are presented for steel flows by product for ten construction sectors for both the UK and the world in 2006. An estimate for steel use within a ‘typical’ building is also published for the first time. Industrial buildings and utility infrastructure are identified as the largest end-uses of steel, while superstructure is confirmed as the main use of steel in a building. The results highlight discrepancies in previous steel estimates and life-cycle assessments, and will inform future research on lowering demand for steel, hence reducing carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aexperts 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3alife cycle assessment 3amethodology 3arecycling 3asteel 3aUnited Kingdom1 aAllwood, Julian M.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Nov., v. 68 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245012800182300001600310520103100326592002801357650000801385650001701393650004301410650003701453650001601490700003101506700002701537773007701564856008501641852000901726655001201735IND60109239120221118011819.0141109e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010923912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrado-Olmedo, Ana Isabel13aAn evaluation of uncertainty associated to analytical measurements of selected polycyclic aromatic compounds in ambient air  ap. 428-434.  aThis paper presents an evaluation of uncertainty associated to analytical measurement of 18 polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in ambient air by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD). The study was focused on analyses of PM₁₀, PM₂.₅ and gas phase fractions. Main analytical uncertainty was estimated for 11 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), four nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) and two hydroxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) based on the analytical determination, reference material analysis and extraction step. Main contributions reached 15–30% and came from extraction process of real ambient samples, being those for nitro-PAHs the highest (20–30%). Range and mean concentration of selected PACs measured in gas phase and PM₁₀/PM₂.₅ particle fractions during a full year are also presented. Concentrations of OH-PAHs were about 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than their parent PAHs and comparable to those sparsely reported in literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3auncertainty1 aPérez-Pastor, Rosa María1 aGarcía-Alonso, Susana0 tTalanta.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 101 p.428-434dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245018700213300001500400520112600415592002801541650001901569650001801588650001201606650001501618650001601633650002701649650002101676650001201697650001601709650001901725650002901744650001201773650001201785700002501797700001501822700001401837700002801851700002401879700002601903700002301929700001801952700002101970700002701991700001702018700002502035700002002060700001802080700002002098700002202118700002002140700002802160773008302188856008302271990002302354852000902377655001202386IND60111357520221121060644.0141109e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011135752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0332doi7 aPMC30390602pmcid7 a212374742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, L.

They were negative for host factors associated with control of SIV infection. After a third intrarectal challenge with SIVₛₘE₆₆₀, all controlled viremia, with one (macaque #5) maintaining undetectable viremia in blood. Acquisition was not blocked, but virus was contained in the jejunum and draining lymph nodes. Polyfunctional memory T cell responses and high-titered neutralizing and non-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies were present before and maintained post-challenge. The level of protection seen for animal #5 was predicted from analyses of gene transcription in jejunum 2weeks post-challenge. Macaques #7 and #9, exhibiting lower pre-challenge cellular and humoral immunity, partially controlled the SIVₛₘE₆₆₀ challenge. Initial vaccine-induced control by macaque #5 extended to the SIVₛₘE₆₆₀ challenge due to multiple immune mechanisms that were boosted and augmented by cryptic SIV exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acell-mediated immunity 3ahumoral immunity 3ajejunum 3alymph nodes 3aneutralization 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviremia 3aviruses1 aDaltabuit-Test, Mara1 aXiao, Peng1 aZhao, Jun1 aWu, Williamc(Composer)1 aWille-Reece, Ulrike1 aBrocca-Cofano, Egidio1 aKalyanaraman, V.S.1 aKalisz, Irene1 aWhitney, Stephen1 aYi, Ŭn-mic(Composer)1 aPal, Ranajit1 aMontefiori, David C.1 aDandekar, Satya1 aSeder, Robert1 aRoederer, Mario1 aWiseman, Roger W.1 aHirsch, Vanessa1 aRobert-Guroff, Marjorie0 tVirology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 411, no. 1 p.87-102dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014000173300001600313520124000329592002801569650000801597650001601605650001801621650002101639650001501660650002801675650002601703650002201729650002301751650001001774650001101784650001401795650003101809650001601840650000901856700002401865700002401889700002201913700002501935773011001960856008202070852000902152655001202161IND60100903620221121225036.0141105e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010090362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Gilcelia J.L.10aImpedimetric sensor for toxigenic Penicilliumsclerotigenum detection in yam based on magnetite-poly(allylamine hydrochloride) composite  ap. 258-263.  aWe describe a new DNA biosensor for the detection of toxigenic Penicillium sclerotigenum in pure culture or infected yams. The P. sclerotigenum detection takes place on a self-assembled monolayer of a (magnetite)/(poly(allylamine hydrochloride)) (Fe₃O₄–PAH) composite that serves as an anchoring layer for the DNA hybridization interaction. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate and quantify the hybridization degree. The Fe₃O₄–PAH composite is a good platform for the immobilization of biomolecules, due to the presence of many possible binding sites for nucleotides and to its large surface-to-volume ratio and good biocompatibility. The biosensor was capable of not only qualitatively detecting the presence of the fungus genome at low concentrations, but also shown a good quantitative impedimetric response its electrical resistance was monitored along the time of exposure. A Fe₃O₄–PAH-probe biosensor would require only small volumes and low concentrations of the analyte when used, for instance, in detecting P. sclerotigenum contamination of food, besides presenting many comparative advantages, such as selectivity, specificity and reproducibility, relative to alternative techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPenicillium 3abinding sites 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical resistance 3aexposure duration 3afood contamination 3afungi 3agenome 3amagnetite 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotides 3ayams1 aAndrade, Cesar A.S.1 aOliveira, Idjane S.1 ade Melo, Celso P.1 aOliveira, Maria D.L.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 396 p.258-263dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011100172300001600283520177800299592002802077650001402105650001202119650001502131650001002146650001202156650002002168650001202188650002902200650001802229650000902247650002502256650001802281650001702299650000902316650001102325650001302336650003702349700002102386700001402407700002102421700002202442700001802464700003102482773011102513856008202624990002302706852000902729655001202738IND60110500320221123003936.0141109e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011050032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Nagendra Kumar10aExposure to As, Cd and Pb-mixture impairs myelin and axon development in rat brain, optic nerve and retina  ap. 242-258.  aArsenic (As), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are the major metal contaminants of ground water in India. We have reported the toxic effect of their mixture (metal mixture, MM), at human relevant doses, on developing rat astrocytes. Astrocyte damage has been shown to be associated with myelin disintegration in CNS. We, therefore, hypothesized that the MM would perturb myelinating white matter in cerebral cortex, optic nerve (O.N.) and retina. We observed modulation in the levels of myelin and axon proteins, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein, 2′-, 3′-cyclic-nucleotide-3′-phosphodiesterase, myelin-associated glycoprotein and neurofilament (NF) in the brain of developing rats. Dose and time-dependent synergistic toxic effect was noted. The MBP- and NF-immunolabeling, as well as luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining demonstrated a reduction in the area of intact myelin-fiber, and an increase in vacuolated axons, especially in the corpus-callosum. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of O.N. revealed a reduction in myelin thickness and axon-density. The immunolabeling with MBP, NF, and LFB staining in O.N. supported the TEM data. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of retina displayed a decrease in the thickness of nerve-fiber, plexiform-layer, and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) count. Investigating the mechanism revealed a loss in glutamine synthetase activity in the cerebral cortex and O.N., and a fall in the brain derived neurotrophic factor in retina. An enhanced apoptosis in MBP, NF and Brn3b-containing cells justified the diminution in myelinating axons in CNS. Our findings for the first time indicate white matter damage by MM, which may have significance in neurodevelopmental-pediatrics, neurotoxicology and retinal-cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic 3aastrocytes 3aaxons 3acadmium 3acerebral cortex 3aganglia 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglycoproteins 3alead 3amyelin basic protein 3amyelin sheath 3anerve tissue 3arats 3aretina 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAshok, Anushruti1 aRai, Asit1 aTripathi, Sachin1 aNagar, Geet Kumar1 aMitra, Kalyan1 aBandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 273, no. 2 p.242-258dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245009900174300001600273520109800289592002801387650001901415650001101434650001201445650002301457650002601480650001201506650001301518650001201531650001801543650001001561650001101571650001101582650001001593651001101603653001501614653001501629653001701644653002701661700001501688773009701703856009001800852000901890655001201899IND50065205820221117161006.0150427e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006520582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2002.tb00548.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosvik, M.

Of 25 endangered species recorded in the source meadow, only one (Holcus lanatus) was present in the target meadow. After sowing, 16 of the endangered species in addition to Holcus lanatus were recorded in the new site. Six species were only present in sown plots and seven others were more frequent there, while three species might have arrived by chance or originated from the seed bank. Replacing the traditional management regime, including one late cut and grazing in spring and in autumn, with three cutting times and the creation of gaps in the sward, resulted in a higher number of endangered species in plots which were only cut, possibly because the grazing was too intensive in the small enclosures.Nomenclature: Lid & Lid (1994).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolcus lanatus 3aautumn 3acutting 3aendangered species 3afield experimentation 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ameadows 3aseed mixtures 3aseeds 3asowing 3aspring 3asward 3aNorway 0aIndicators 0aLocal seed 0aSeed mixture 0aSemi-natural grassland1 aAustad, I.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2002 Dec., v. 5, no. 2 p.185-194dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2002.tb00548.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008100162300001600243520126100259592002801520650001501548650001501563650001101578650002201589650001201611650001101623650000701634650001501641650001501656700001301671700001801684700001701702773011701719856008201836852000901918655001201927IND60100822320221120055933.0141105e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010082232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Lei10aAdsorptive characteristics of phosphate from aqueous solutions by MIEX resin  ap. 224-232.  aThis study investigated the potential of MIEX resin as the adsorbent for the removal of phosphate from aqueous solutions. In our batch experiments, we studied the effect of some parameters on the removal of phosphate. It was observed that uptake of phosphate was mainly affected by initial phosphate concentration, adsorbent dosage, initial pH of solution, and coexistent anions. The adsorption equilibrium data at 288K fitted well to Freundlich and Koble–Corrigan isotherm models. The kinetics studies displayed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order model. The diffusion studies showed that the intra-particle diffusion was not the only rate-controlling step and, the diffusion process of phosphate from solution to MIEX resin was controlled by film diffusion. The thermodynamics parameters were evaluated. The results showed that the adsorption process was spontaneous thermodynamically, endothermic, and entropy driven. These results have established a good potentiality for MIEX resin to be used as an adsorbent for the removal of phosphate from aqueous solutions. This work will deepen our understanding of the adsorptive characteristics of phosphate by MIEX resin and provide a better way to remove phosphate from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3aentropy 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3awastewater1 aWu, Chao1 aDeng, Huiping1 aZhang, Xinxi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 June 15, v. 376, no. 1 p.224-232dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009500174300001400269520109400283592002801377650001801405650001601423650001401439650001601453650001401469650001501483650001001498650001901508650001001527650002201537650001901559650001101578650002401589650000901613650003701622650001401659650001501673650002201688700002801710700002701738700003801765700003601803700004901839700003301888700002301921700002301944773008201967856008302049990002302132852000902155655001202164IND60111386120221118035612.0141109e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011138612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRust, Naiara Miranda10aBradykinin enhances Sindbis virus infection in human brain microvascular endothelial cells  ap. 81-91.  aSindbis virus (SINV) induces inflammatory and vasoactive responses that are associated with rash and arthritis in human infections. The mechanisms underlying infection-associated microvasculopathy are still unknown. We investigated whether endothelial cells infected by SINV are differentially responsive to bradykinin (BK), a potent inducer of inflammatory edema in a broad range of infectious diseases. Human endothelial cells (HBMECs) infected with SINV presented an upregulation of bradykinin B2 receptors (BK2R) expression. Also, BK reduced SINV-induced apoptosis and enhanced virus replication in HBMECs in a way dependent on BK2R, PI3 kinase and ERK signaling. Strikingly, intracerebral infection of mice in the presence of a BK2R antagonist reduced the local viral load. Our data suggest that SINV infection renders human endothelial cells hypersensitive to BK, which increases host cell survival and viral replication. Ongoing studies may clarify if the deregulation of the kinin pathway contributes to infection-associated vasculopathies in life-threatening arbovirus infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSindbis virus 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3aarboviruses 3aarthritis 3abradykinin 3abrain 3acell viability 3aedema 3aendothelial cells 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areceptors 3aviral load 3avirus replication1 aPapa, Michelle Premazzi1 aScovino, Aline Miranda1 ada Silva, Mayara Marques Carneiro1 aCalzavara-Silva, Carlos Eduardo1 aMarques, Ernesto Torres de Azevedo, Jr.cJr.1 aPeçanha, Ligia Maria Torres1 aScharfstein, Julio1 aArruda, Luciana B.0 tVirology.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 422, no. 1 p.81-91dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245008600179300001600265520097800281592002801259650002801287650001701315650002201332650000901354650001201363650001101375650001801386650002301404650001701427650002201444650001401466650001401480650001401494650002101508700002301529700002101552700002001573773013301593856008801726990002301814852000901837655001201846IND60103032220221119221039.0141106e20110125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010303222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotochem.2010.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIleperuma, Oliver A.10aQuasi-solid electrolyte based on polyacrylonitrile for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 308-312.  aA quasi-solid gel–polymer electrolyte for dye-sensitized nanostructured TiO₂ sensitized by N719 ruthenium dye has been developed. The electrolyte comprises of polyacrylonitrile along with plasticizers, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate in the 15:35:50 ratio and the redox couple consists of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide and iodine along with tertiary butyl pyridine. The concentration of iodide:iodine was optimized and optimal activity was found when the molar ratio is 1.50:0.05. This gel electrolyte has a high electrical conductivity of 4.33mScm⁻¹ and overall conversion efficiencies of over 7% were obtained for solar to electrical energy conversion which is higher than the values reported for other similar gel–polymer electrolytes. The reduction in efficiency compared to a solar cell employing a liquid electrolyte can be attributed to incomplete wetting of pores and due to mass transfer limitations of redox species through a more viscous medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3agels 3aiodides 3aiodine 3amass transfer 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aplasticizers 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apropylene 3apyridines 3aruthenium 3atitanium dioxide1 aAsoka Kumara, G.R.1 aYang, Hong-Sheng1 aMurakami, Kenji0 tJournal of Photochemistry & Photobiology, A: Chemistry.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 217, no. 2-3 p.308-312dElsevier B.V.x1010-60307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2010.10.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011500166300001400281520159200295592002801887650001801915650002501933650001301958650001301971650001101984650001501995650001302010650002102023650001602044650001102060650002002071650001302091653001302104653003502117653001902152653001802171653001802189653001502207700002502222700002102247700002302268773010502291856008402396852000902480655001202489IND60111681820221120024106.0160903e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Junho10aCharacterization of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and energy allocation in Daphnia magna exposed to carbaryl  ap. 28-35.  aThe inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and energy allocation in the freshwater organism Daphnia magna exposed to carbaryl and potential recovery from the effects was examined. The binding of carbaryl-AChE was characterized through in vitro assays. To evaluate the recovery from inhibition and the alteration in energy budget, in vivo exposure and recovery regime tests were conducted. In comparison to diazoxon, the active metabolite of the insecticide diazinon, the stability of enzyme–carbaryl complex was fifteen times lower and the reactivity toward the active site was two times lower, resulting in approximately 30 times lower overall inhibition rate than for diazoxon. The in vitro reactivation rate constant of the inhibited enzyme and the in vivo recovery rate constant of AChE activity were 1.9h−1 and 0.12h−1 for carbaryl, respectively, which are much higher than the corresponding rate constants for diazoxon. The lower AChE inhibition and greater reactivation/recovery rates are in accordance with the lower toxicity of carbaryl compared to diazinon. Carbaryl exposure also altered the profile of the energy reserve: the decrease in lipid and glycogen and the increase in protein content resulted in the reduction of the total energy budget by about 45mJ/gww. This corresponds to 26 percent of the available energy, which might allocate for external stressors. The mechanistic model of AChE inhibition is helpful to get an insight into (eco-)toxicological effects of AChE inhibitors on freshwater crustaceans under environmentally realistic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acarbaryl 3adiazinon 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3aglycogen 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aprotein content 3atoxicity 0aCarbaryl 0aAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor 0aImmobilization 0aEnergy budget 0aDaphnia magna 0aCarbamates1 aKretschmann, Andreas1 aEscher, Beate I.1 aHollender, Juliane0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 98 p.28-35dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007900166300001800245520181200263592002802075650001402103650001402117650002402131650002202155650001802177650001402195650001102209650002002220700001802240700001602258773011202274856008202386990002302468852000902491655001202500IND60107914920221123040338.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010791492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, M.A.R.10aEnergy behaviours as promoters of energy efficiency: A 21st century review  ap. 4095-4104.  aEnergy behaviours represent a significant untapped potential for the increase of end-use energy efficiency in buildings. Although energy behaviours are a major determinant of energy use in buildings, energy savings potential due to behaviour are usually neglected, albeit being referred to be as high as those from technological solutions. This paper presents a review of recent literature on energy behaviours in order to recognise recent trends, quantify energy behaviours potential savings, characterise energy behaviour modelling strategies and identify potential research gaps. Energy behaviour research is vast and has been essentially focused on the residential sector, striving to establish behaviour determinants and the best strategies and instruments to promote more efficient energy behaviours. Potential savings of energy behaviours are referred to reach 20%, but values differ up to 100% between experiences and additional studies to quantify behavioural savings are needed, in particular by using standard quantification techniques. Different modelling techniques have been used to model energy behaviours: qualitative approaches from the social sciences trying to interpret behaviour, here named energy behaviour frameworks; quantitative approaches from the engineering and economics that quantify energy consumption, here designated by energy models; and hybrid approaches that are considered the most relevant since they integrate multiple dimensions of energy behaviours, here referred as energy behaviour modelling. Energy behaviours have a crucial role in promoting energy efficiency, but energy behaviours characteristics and complexity create several research challenges that must be overcome so energy behaviours may be properly valorised and integrated in the energy policy context.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aeconomics 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3aequipment 3amodels 3asocial sciences1 aAntunes, C.H.1 aMartins, N.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.4095-4104dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002200197245008500219300001600304520134600320592002801666650001101694650001001705650001501715650001601730650001601746700001901762700002401781700002501805700002201830700002201852700002001874773010501894856009001999990002302089852000902112655001202121IND60111002620221121043654.0141109e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011100262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.0062doi7 aPMC35475002pmcid7 a232573512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForoughi, Pezhman12aA Freehand Ultrasound Elastography System with Tracking for In Vivo Applications  ap. 211-225.  aUltrasound transducers are commonly tracked in modern ultrasound navigation/guidance systems. In this article, we demonstrate the advantages of incorporating tracking information into ultrasound elastography for clinical applications. First, we address a common limitation of freehand palpation: speckle decorrelation due to out-of-plane probe motion. We show that by automatically selecting pairs of radio frequency frames with minimal lateral and out-of-plane motions, combined with a fast and robust displacement estimation technique, greatly improves in vivo elastography results. We also use tracking information and image-quality measures to fuse multiple images with similar strains that are taken from roughly the same location so as to obtain a high-quality elastography image. Finally, we show that tracking information can be used to give the user partial control over the rate of compression. Our methods are tested on a tissue-mimicking phantom, and experiments have been conducted on intraoperative data acquired during animal and human experiments involving liver ablation. Our results suggest that in challenging clinical conditions, our proposed method produces reliable strain images and eliminates the need for a manual search through the ultrasound data in order to find radio frequency pairs suitable for elastography.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aradio waves 3aultrasonics1 aKang, Hyun-Jae1 aCarnegie, Daniel A.1 avan Vledder, Mark G.1 aChoti, Michael A.1 aHager, Gregory D.1 aBoctor, Emad M.0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2013 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.211-225dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245008300184300001600267520078700283592002801070650001501098650001501113650001601128650001501144700002601159700002201185773008301207856008901290990002301379852000901402655001201411IND60104282120221119130741.0141107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010428212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.measurement.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContreras-Gonzalez, Jose10aClock state estimation with the Kalman-like UFIR algorithm via TIE measurement  ap. 476-483.  aWe show that recently designed the p-shift unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) iterative algorithm is highly efficient in applications to clock state estimation via measurement of the time interval error (TIE). The algorithm is Kalman-like, but does not involve noise statistics and initial errors. Its crucial property is that the estimate becomes optimal in the minimum mean square error sense when the estimator memory is large that is typical for clocks. Examples are given for state estimation in an ovenized crystal clock and error prediction in a master clock. Based upon the experimental studies, we show that this algorithm outperforms the Kalman filter requiring the clock noise covariance matrix that is hard to specify correctly even in white Gaussian approximation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acovariance 3ameasurement 3aprediction1 aIbarra-Manzano, Oscar1 aShmaliy, Yuriy S.0 tMeasurement.g2013 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.476-483dElsevier Ltdx0263-22417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520169200288592002801980650002002008650002002028650001202048650001302060650001102073650001102084650000902095650001402104650001602118650001702134650002202151650000902173650000902182650001502191650001102206650001102217650001802228650002902246650001802275650001302293650001302306650002602319650000902345651002102354653000702375653001102382653000802393653000702401653000802408653000702416653000702423653001002430653000802440653002602448653001902474653001702493653001702510653001702527653001802544700002002562773010702582856008402689852000902773655001202782IND60111681920221123001344.0160903e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvci, Halim10aAssessment of trace element concentrations in soil and plants from cropland irrigated with wastewater  ap. 283-291.  aSamples of soil and food plants were collected from wastewater-irrigated fields in the vicinity of Gaziantep, in southeast Turkey, and analyzed for several trace elements (TEs). The concentrations of Co, Mo and Zn in edible portions of corn, mint and vegetables (eggplant, pepper and tomato) were 0.03–0.66, 0.1–3.2 and 8–148mgkg−1, respectively. In the edible portions of corn and mint, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb concentrations in all samples were <0.01–0.05, 2.0–5.5, 6–47, 0.6–6.7 and 0.2–3.5mgkg−1, respectively. No single plant species had consistently high concentrations of all metals. For example, corn had the highest concentration of Zn (89mgkg−1), but the lowest concentration of Cd (<0.01mgkg−1). The maximum concentrations of some TEs in some crop samples, as well as soil samples, exceeded certain threshold values set in Turkey and other countries. For some TEs there was little difference between wastewater-irrigated and control soil concentrations. Transfer factors (TFs; plant concentration/soil concentration) were high for Cu, Zn and Mo, in comparison with the other TEs (Cd, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb). Higher uptake of certain metals may be associated with the dominant form of the element in the soil matrix. The uptake of chemicals to plant tissues is influenced by the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil and species-specific factors. Although the geochemistry of the region plays a significant role in the levels of TEs in soil and plants, bioaccumulation of metals and subsequent toxicity to plants and animals can be exacerbated by higher environmental concentrations caused by wastewater irrigation and other anthropogenic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMentha arvensis 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3acorn 3aeggplants 3afood plants 3ageochemistry 3airrigated farming 3alead 3amint 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apepper 3aplant tissues 3asoil physical properties 3asoil sampling 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3awastewater irrigation 3azinc 3aTurkey (country) 0aDW 0aICP-MS 0aMAC 0aOM 0aSRM 0aTE 0aTF 0aUWWTP 0aw/v 0aWastewater irrigation 0aTrace elements 0aHeavy metals 0aPlant tissue 0aAccumulation 0aContamination1 aDeveci, Tuğrul0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 98 p.283-291dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015100177300001600328520141700344592002801761650001501789650001501804650001901819650002201838650001701860650003001877650001801907650002101925650001101946650001701957650002101974650002001995650001602015700002002031700002002051700002602071700002102097773010302118856008402221990002302305852000902328655001202337IND60110589320221116142432.0141109e20110910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011058932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuattara, Djomangan A.10aKinetic modelling of in vitro cell-based assays to characterize non-specific bindings and ADME processes in a static and a perfused fluidic system  ap. 310-319.  aRecently, physiologically based perfusion in vitro systems have been developed to provide cell culture environment close to in vivo cell environment (e.g., fluidic conditions, organ interactions). In this work, we model and compare the fate of a chemical, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), in a perfusion and a standard (static well-plate) system. These in vitro systems are composed of Caco-2 and HepG2 cells so as to mimic absorption across the small intestine and intestinal and hepatic metabolism. Compartmental models were developed and calibrated with B[a]P kinetics data in the culture medium to estimate the apparent permeability of Caco-2 cells, the in vitro biotransformation of B[a]P, as well as the different routes of loss by non-specific adsorption. Our results show that non-specific binding is the main process responsible for the depletion of B[a]P in the culture media: at steady state, only 40% and 24% of the total concentration of B[a]P are bioavailable in the static and perfused systems, respectively. We also showed that Caco-2 permeability in the perfused culture system is closer to in vivo conditions than the one obtained in the static system and that higher cellular metabolic activities are observed in static conditions. Perfused in vitro systems combined with kinetic modelling are promising tools for studying in vitro the different processes involved in the toxicokinetics of xenobiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiotransformation 3acell culture 3acellular microenvironment 3aculture media 3ahuman cell lines 3amodels 3apermeability 3apharmacokinetics 3asmall intestine 3axenobiotics1 aChoi, Sue-Hyung1 aSakai, Yasuyuki1 aPéry, Alexandre R.R.1 aBrochot, Céline0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Sept. 10, v. 205, no. 3 p.310-319dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.06.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245015800181300001800339520081300357592002801170650002201198650001201220650002301232650002301255650001401278650001401292650001601306653002201322653002901344653003001373653001901403653002301422700002301445700002701468773008901495856008401584852000901668655001201677IND60110108620221119221550.0161019e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011010862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrisóstomo-Lucas, Carmela10aSynthesis and characterization of new potentially hydrosoluble pincer ligands and their application in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in water  ap. 3116-3119.  aThree water soluble pincer ligands, 2,6-bis[(diethanolamine)methyl]pyridine hydrobromide (1:2) (1), 3,11,17,18-Tetraazatricyclo[11.3.1.15,9]octadeca-1(17),5,7,9(18),13,15-hexaene,3,11-bis(dihydroxymethylmethyl) hydrobromide (1:2) (2), and 1,3-bis[(diethanolamine)methyl]benzene (3) were synthesized and unequivocally characterized by a number of analytical techniques including single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.

The present study was undertaken to determine the mode of ovarian steroid action in regulating IL-18 release by goat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) in the presence and absence of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Primary and telomerase-immortalized goat EECs grown alone or cocultured with ESCs were treated with two ovarian steroids, 17β-estradiol (E₂) and progesterone (P₄). The IL-18 mRNA and protein expression in EECs were studied by reverse transcript (RT) PCR, ELISA, and Western blot assay. The E₂ and/or P₄ treatment of EECs led to a significant increase in both IL-18 mRNA and protein expression either in the primary or in the immortalized EECs compared with that in EECs without the steroid treatment. However, in the presence of ESCs, IL-18 expression by EECs treated with steroids was significantly decreased compared with cells untreated with E₂ and/or P₄. In addition, significantly high abundance of IL-18 mRNA and protein expression by primary and telomerase-immortalized goat EECs was observed in the presence of ESCs compared with those cells without ESCs. These findings suggest that steroids are important for the control of IL-18 expression in goat EECs. Underlying ESCs are needed to mediate the inhibitory effects of steroids on the IL-18 secretory activity of goat EECs in vitro. The IL-18 abundance expressed by goat EECs in vitro are enhanced by underlying ESCs without the treatment of E₂ and/or P₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal ovaries 3acoculture 3aendometrium 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3aestradiol 3agoats 3ainterleukin-18 3amessenger RNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogesterone 3aprotein synthesis 3asteroid hormones 3asteroids 3astromal cells 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aCell Communicationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Line 2aCoculture Techniquesxveterinary 2aEndometriumxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aInterleukin-18xbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProgesteronexpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStromal Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects.1 aNan, Z.C.1 aJin, Y.P.1 aQu, Y.Y.1 aZhao, X.J.1 aWang, A.H.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2012 May, v. 42, no. 4 p.210-219dElsevier Inc.x0739-72407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008600164300001600250520099300266592002801259650001501287650001501302650001501317650001201332650002501344650001901369650001101388650001101399650002301410650001701433650001301450650001301463650001101476650001301487700001501500700002701515700001801542700001601560700001501576700001901591773010501610856008401715852000901799655001201808IND60101824220221122025357.0141106e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010182422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2010.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Qing10aGrafting short-chain amino acids onto membrane surfaces to resist protein fouling  ap. 398-404.  aThe suppression of nonspecific protein adsorption to synthetic surfaces, especially membrane surfaces, represents a severe challenge in biotechnological, biomedical and biosensor community. In this work, we utilize short-chain molecules rather than long-chain polymers as modifiers for antibiofouling membrane surface construction. Three types of natural amino acids, including lysine, glycine, and serine, were chemically grafted onto membranes via carbodiimide chemistry to render highly hydrophilic surfaces, which displayed the intrinsic advantages in high surface coverage, three-dimensional modification, and unsacrificed permeability. Although hydrophilicity of membranes modified with these three types of amino acids was quite close, only lysine modified membrane surface showed superior protein fouling resistance under both static exposure and dynamic filtration conditions. Molecular dynamics simulation study was performed to tentatively interpret the underlying differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3afiltration 3afouling 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahydrophilicity 3aimides 3alysine 3amolecular dynamics 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aproteins 3aserine 3asurfaces1 aSu, Yanlei1 aChan, Christine M.

The specific and synergistic effects of these factors were studied theoretically using a mathematical model that includes inertial and dynamic contact angle terms. After validating the model for capillaries of uniform cross section, the model was extended to capillaries with sinusoidal modulations of the radius, since in practice, capillaries rarely have uniform cross-sections. The height of the meniscus during wetting and dewetting was significantly affected by the relations between the local slope of the capillary surface and the Young contact angle. Non-dimensional variables were defined using viscous effects and gravity as the scaling parameters. Simulations using the dimensionless model showed that the inertial and dynamic contact angle terms can be neglected for narrow capillaries of uniform cross-section but not for uniform, wide cross-section capillaries. Moreover, nonuniformity in cross-sectional area induced hysteresis, deceleration, blocking, and metastable equilibrium locations. An increase in contact angle further amplified the effect of geometry on wetting and dewetting processes. These results enable characterization and modeling of fluid retention and flow in porous structures that inherently consist of capillaries of varying cross section.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3agravity 3ahysteresis 3amathematical models 3asynergism1 aGraber, Ellen R.1 aWallach, Rony0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 396 p.270-277dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245012000186300001800306520172100324592002802045650000802073650001502081650001802096650002402114650002602138650001102164650002202175650003902197650002402236650002202260650001502282650002302297650001402320650007602334650001802410650002202428650001602450650004202466650001402508650001502522650002702537650007702564650002502641650004102666700002302707700002302730700001902753700002602772700002602798700002402824700001902848700002102867700002102888700002202909773010502931856008103036852000903117655001203126IND60102058220221119074237.0141106e20110204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010205822DNAL7 a211343832pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2010.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMárquez, Viter10aProteomic Characterization of Archaeal Ribosomes Reveals the Presence of Novel Archaeal-Specific Ribosomal Proteins  ap. 1215-1232.  aProtein synthesis occurs in macromolecular particles called ribosomes. All ribosomes are composed of RNA and proteins. While the protein composition of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes has been well-characterized, a systematic analysis of archaeal ribosomes has been lacking. Here we report the first comprehensive two-dimensional PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of archaeal ribosomes isolated from the thermophilic Pyrobaculum aerophilum and the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius Crenarchaeota. Our analysis identified all 66 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the P. aerophilum small and large subunits, as well as all but two (62 of 64; 97%) r-proteins of the S. acidocaldarius small and large subunits that are predicted genomically. Some r-proteins were identified with one or two lysine methylations and N-terminal acetylations. In addition, we identify three hypothetical proteins that appear to be bona fide r-proteins of the S. acidocaldarius large subunit. Dissociation of r-proteins from the S. acidocaldarius large subunit indicates that the novel r-proteins establish tighter interactions with the large subunit than some integral r-proteins. Furthermore, cryo electron microscopy reconstructions of the S. acidocaldarius and P. aerophilum 50S subunits allow for a tentative localization of the binding site of the novel r-proteins. This study illustrates not only the potential diversity of the archaeal ribosomes but also the necessity to experimentally analyze the archaeal ribosomes to ascertain their protein composition. The discovery of novel archaeal r-proteins and factors may be the first step to understanding how archaeal ribosomes cope with extreme environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSulfolobus 3abinding sites 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental factors 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein composition 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 2aArchaeal Proteinsxchemistryxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aBinding Sites 2aLysinexchemistry 2aMethylation 2aNucleoside-Triphosphatasexmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aProteomics 2aPyrobaculumxchemistry 2aRibosomal Proteinsxchemistryxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aRibosomesxchemistry 2aSulfolobus acidocaldariusxchemistry1 aFröhlich, Thomas,1 aArmache, Jean-Paul1 aSohmen, Daniel1 aDönhöfer, Alexandra1 aMikolajka, Aleksandra1 aBerninghausen, Otto1 aThomm, Michael1 aBeckmann, Roland1 aArnold, Georg J.1 aWilson, Daniel N.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Feb. 4, v. 405, no. 5 p.1215-1232dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245013600216300001600352520102500368592002801393650001901421650003501440650001901475650001001494650002501504650001401529650002401543650000901567651001101576700002301587700002001610700002201630700001901652700001601671700001901687700002401706700002301730700002201753773008401775856008301859990002301942852000901965655001201974IND60111357820221121060724.0141109e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011135782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.0252doi7 aPMC30419262pmcid7 a212390332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSsemwanga, Deogratius10aMultiple HIV-1 infections with evidence of recombination in heterosexual partnerships in a low risk Rural Clinical Cohort in Uganda  ap. 113-131.  aWe report on the frequency of multiple infections, generation of recombinants and consequences on disease progression in 35 HIV-1 infected individuals from 7 monogamous and 6 polygamous partnerships within a Rural Clinical Cohort in Uganda.

Three participants were dually infected with subtypes A and D, one case with subtype A and A/D recombinant and the fifth with 2 phylogenetically distinct A/D recombinants. Occurrence of A/D recombination was observed in two multiple infected individuals. Rate of late stage WHO events using Cox regression was 3 times greater amongst multiple infected compared to singly infected individuals (hazard ratio 3.35; 95% CI 1.09, 10.3; p=0.049).

Hence, it is imperative that we seek alternative approaches to treat cancer that localise therapeutic agents to the site of the tumour and spare normal tissue. The use of bacteria in cancer therapy represents one such approach. Bacteria were first used as anti-cancer agents over a century ago. Today, this field has re-emerged from the past and is progressing at a rapid rate. Bacteria are used as anticancer agents either alone or in combination with conventional treatments and have been armed with an arsenal of therapeutic genes, which enhance their efficacy. Bacterial directed enzyme prodrug therapy (BDEPT) is one of the most promising approaches, which harnesses the tumour-specific location of bacteria to locally activate systemically administered ‘prodrugs’ within the tumour in order to induce selective tumour destruction. BDEPT is a relatively new concept. It was originally conceived more than 10years ago but it is only until recently that we witness a surge in activity in this field. In this review, we provide a full account of developments in the field of BDEPT since its inception. We share technical knowhow and discuss optimization strategies for vector and enzyme combinations, provide a clear view of the research landscape and suggest possible directions for the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3abacteria 3adose response 3agenes 3alandscapes 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3atherapeutics1 aSpringer, Caroline1 aTangney, Mark0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 170, no. 1 p.120-131dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012900166300001800295520074100313592002801054650002201082650002301104650002301127650001501150650001101165650001701176650001201193653002501205653002301230653000801253653002201261653002601283700002101309700002101330773008901351856008401440852000901524655001201533IND60110108720221119222141.0161019e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011010872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomma, Yuta10aGround triplet pyrimidine-4,6-diyl bis(tert-butyl nitroxide) as a paramagnetic building block for metal–organic frameworks  ap. 3120-3123.  aWe synthesized pyrimidine-4,6-diyl bis(tert-butyl nitroxide) (pmbNO), and characterized as a biradical by means of ESR spectroscopy.

It was reported that high purity oxygen (99+%) was generated using a bed of Ag-ETS-10 granules to separate air (78.0% N₂, 21.0% O₂, 1.0% Ar) at 25°C and 100kPa, with an O₂ recovery larger than 30%. In this study, a higher oxygen recovery was achieved by enhancing the capacity of the adsorbent material and by improving the packing efficiency of the adsorbent within the granules. The packing efficiency of the bed was increased through the combination of two different granule sizes. Here we report a lab scale demonstration of high purity oxygen (99+%) production by adsorptive air separation (78.0% N₂, 21.0% O₂, 1.0% Ar) with an O₂ recovery approaching 40%. Further improvements in oxygen recovery are possible due to the exceptional crystalline density of Ag-ETS-10 (∼3.84g/cm³).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aair 3aargon (noble gases) 3agranules 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3asilver1 aAvila, A.M.1 aWu, L.1 aSawada, J.A.1 aKuznicki, T.M.1 aKuznicki, S.M.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 118 p.794-800dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.08.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245008600162300001800248520061600266592002800882650002100910650001300931650002300944650002300967650004600990650001401036650001301050650004401063650002201107650001401129650001401143700001201157700001501169700001501184700001301199700001601212700001401228700001701242773011201259856008401371852000901455655001201464IND60109954820221117072147.0141109e20120711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lin10aNew P-bridgehead urea-based tripodal anion receptors for H₂PO₄⁻ recognition  ap. 3637-3641.  aA series of new P-bridgehead tripodal urea-based anion receptors 1–3 bearing phosphine oxide (PO) were synthesized and characterized.

In China, it is a serious pest of kiwifruit. The optimal time to control P. pentagona field populations is at the first instar stage of the first, spring generation. Three methods for predicting the hatching of eggs of the first generation from field populations were tested on kiwifruit in Sichuan, based upon the accumulation of heat units (day-degrees) above a developmental threshold, calculated as 10.75 °C. A method developed for P. pentagona control in tea in Japan gave excellent predictions of 50% hatching in 5 of the 6 years under study (2009–2014). The other two methods also gave acceptable predictions of dates of 50% egg hatching (within 5 days of field observed dates). These models may be used as a basis for forecasting spring insecticide application dates targeting the first instar stage (crawlers and settled ‘white caps’).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudaulacaspis pentagona 3aeggs 3ahatching 3aheat 3aheat sums 3ahorticulture 3ainsecticides 3ainstars 3akiwifruit 3amodels 3apesticide application 3apests 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aspring 3atea 3atropics 3aChina 3aJapan 0aChina 0aforecasting 0akiwifruit 0amodelling 0aphenology 0aPseudaulacaspis pentagona 0aspray timing1 aHou, TP1 aHill, MG0 tNew Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science.g2016 July 2, v. 44, no. 3 p.218-226dTaylor & Francisx1175-87837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2016.11846923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009500167300001600262520125600278592002801534650001301562650001201575650001201587650001001599650001901609650001301628650002401641650001301665650001201678653001801690653001201708653001301720653001401733700001501747700001901762700001601781773012101797856008101918852000901999655001202008IND60524945620221120122632.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052494562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNugrahedi, P.Y.10aQuality of cabbage during long term steaming; phytochemical, texture and colour evaluation  ap. 421-427.  aSteaming has been reported to better retain the glucosinolate (GS) content in Brassica vegetables than boiling. However, there is little information on the GS content, colour, and texture attributes in Brassica vegetables in relation to the duration of steaming. This study investigated the effect of the duration of steaming, which was applied in certain commercial preparation processes, on the GS content, colour, and texture of white cabbage. Results showed that the total accessible content of GSs increases initially during steaming until 10 min followed by a consistent decline up to 180 min. This observed initial increase is mainly due to the content of aliphatic GSs rather than indole GSs, which tend to decrease from the start of steaming. A mathematic model for the observed behaviour of the GSs, taking into account several mechanisms, is proposed and fitted to the data. The intensity of the green colour of the cabbage slightly increased during the first 15 min of steaming followed by a decrease onwards. The hardness showed a continuous decline during the entire steaming duration. The study indicates that steaming up to 10 min could promote the health properties as well as the colour and texture attributes of steamed cabbage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3aboiling 3acabbage 3acolor 3aglucosinolates 3ahardness 3amathematical models 3asteaming 3atexture 0aGlucosinolate 0aCabbage 0aSteaming 0aModelling1 aDekker, M.1 aWidianarko, B.1 aVerkerk, R.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.421-427dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011900212300001600331520213900347592002802486650002302514650001302537650002302550650001202573650002002585650001002605650002102615650001602636650001202652650000902664650001102673650001302684650001002697653002302707653002002730653001002750653002102760653001202781653002002793700006202813700007602875773011002951856008503061852000903146655001203155IND50070865520221116162119.0190415e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007086552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiyaporn, Massupha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3014-954610aGrowth and small intestine histomorphology of low and normal birth weight piglets during the early suckling period  ap. 215-222.  aThe present study compared growth performance and small intestinal histomorphological changes between low birth weight (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) piglets at day 0 and day 7 postpartum. The LBW and NBW piglets (Large White×Landrace×Duroc) from five multiparous crossbred sows were used. At birth, all piglets were weighed and classified into LBW (0.8–1.0kg) or NBW (1.4–1.6kg) piglets. At days 0 and 7 postpartum, one LBW and one NBW piglets per sow were randomly selected and euthanized for sample collection. The results showed that at day 7, the average daily gain and percentage change of body weight from day 0 of LBW piglets were not different from NBW piglets; however, their body weights were still lower than those of NBW piglets (P<0.01). The organ weights including small intestine, large intestine, liver, spleen and kidney as normalized per 100g of body weight showed no difference between LBW and NBW piglets at the same day; but they increased with age (P<0.05). The histomorphological changes of small intestine revealed that the villus height and crypt depth were not different between groups at the same day; but they increased with age (P<0.01). In terms of the enterocyte turnover rate as determined by the ratio of villus height to crypt depth, at day 7, the LBW piglets had a higher ratio of villus height to crypt depth with significant effect at the duodenum (P<0.05). Additionally, the proliferative marker index (Ki-67) was also greater in LBW than NBW piglets at day 7 with significant effect at the ileum (P<0.05). These results indicated that the LBW piglets grew at the same rate as NBW piglets with undisturbed organ developments as evidenced by the similar average daily gain, percentage change of body weight and normalized organ weights. Furthermore, the difference in enterocyte proliferation and turnover rate of the small intestine indicated a difference in small intestine development and function between LBW and NBW piglets. These data suggest that the LBW piglets were not only different from their NBW littermates in the body weight but also in small intestinal histomorphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3aduodenum 3agrowth performance 3akidneys 3alarge intestine 3aliver 3alow birth weight 3aparturition 3apiglets 3asows 3aspleen 3asuckling 3avilli 0aGrowth performance 0aHistomorphology 0aKi-67 0aLow birth weight 0aPiglets 0aSmall intestine1 aThongsong, Boonrit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5021-02471 aKalandakanond-Thongsong, Sarinee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5635-57810 tLivestock science.g2013 Dec., v. 158, no. 1-3 p.215-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2013.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006000159300001800219520078600237592002801023650002201051650001601073650002101089650001501110650002201125650001301147650001401160650001901174700001901193700001801212700001601230700002001246700002001266700001901286700001801305700001801323773014201341856007401483852000901557655001201566IND60668902620221120231324.0190920e20130716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066890262DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11027c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, Jen-Chun10aRuO₂/MnO₂ core–shell nanorods for supercapacitors  ap. 8753-8758.  aRuO₂/MnO₂ NRs as an electrode for supercapacitors show a high electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 793 F g⁻¹ (based on MnO₂) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 2 mV s⁻¹ in 1 M Na₂SO₄ aqueous solution. A good rate capability with a specific capacitance of 556 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹ and a good cycling stability (20% degradation after 1000 cycles) were also achieved. The enhancement of capacitive behavior can be attributed to the conductive RuO₂ template with a series resistance of 0.75 Ω and a charge transfer resistance of 0.75 Ω.

Various models have been developed and used for predictions of future C dynamics but uncertainties still exist. Diagnosing the models' behaviors in terms of structures can help to narrow down the uncertainties in prediction of C dynamics. In this study three widely used land surface models, namely CSIRO's Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) with 9 C pools, Community Land Model (version 3·5) combined with Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CLM‐CASA) with 12 C pools and Community Land Model (version 4) (CLM4) with 26 C pools were driven by the observed meteorological forcing. The simulated C storage and residence time were used for analysis. The C storage and residence time were computed globally for all individual soil and plant pools, as well as net primary productivity (NPP) and its allocation to different plant components' based on these models. Remotely sensed NPP and statistically derived HWSD, and GLC2000 datasets were used as a reference to evaluate the performance of these models. Results showed that CABLE exhibited better agreement with referenced C storage and residence time for plant and soil pools, as compared with CLM‐CASA and CLM4. CABLE had longer bulk residence time for soil C pools and stored more C in roots, whereas, CLM‐CASA and CLM4 stored more C in woody pools because of differential NPP allocation. Overall, these results indicate that the differences in C storage and residence times in three models are largely because of the differences in their fundamental structures (number of C pools), NPP allocation and C transfer rates.

The monosialoganglioside GM3 is the major GA species in mature human milk, while the disialoganglioside GD3 is the most abundant species in bovine milk and human colostrum. Recently, GA have attracted substantial attention due to their positive influences in several biological actions, for instance pathogen binding, neural development and immune system activation. Consequently, this review aimed to summarise the structure, biosynthesis, analysis and identification of these functional biomolecules. Furthermore, the nutritional, functional and therapeutic attributes of GA are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601433cNational Natural Science Foundation of P.R.

These processes along with all other iron-making units utilize fossil fuel based inputs such as coal, coke and natural gas, for reducing the iron ore feed and fulfilling the energy demand of the process. In this paper, we propose a new iron making process that uses solar energy for smelting the iron ores and limits the coal requirement only to that of required for reduction purposes. Therefore, reducing the overall carbon footprint of the process. Mass and energy balance calculations were carried out for the proposed solar-smelt process and a potential emission reduction of 20% was obtained when compared to the existing composite pellet processes. The demonstrate the process, preliminary reduction experiments of magnetite ore-lignite coal composite pellets were carried out using a combined solar simulator-reactor setup and 55% metallisation was obtained at temperature of 1130 °C. A preliminary techno-economic and payback period evaluation of the solar-smelt process was carried out based on Australian conditions, which suggests that the feasibility of its commercial application depends on the natural gas price and cost of heliostats. The payback period was estimated to be about 2.5–3 years at the present cost of heliostats and natural gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3acoal 3aenergy balance 3aenergy costs 3airon 3amagnetite 3anatural gas 3asolar energy 3atemperature 0aComposite pellet 0aSolar-smelt process 0aCO2 emission 0aSolar simulator 0aPayback period1 aEkman, Ben1 aMejias, Raul1 aBrooks, Geoffrey1 aRhamdhani, M.

In this study, the acclimatization of microorganisms in sequencing batch reactor were performed with anaerobic/aerobic (A/O) and anaerobic/anoxic (A/A) cycles, the biomass changes of PAOs and DPAOs and the correlations were then discussed. The results indicated that after acclimatization, the nutrient removal efficiencies reached to 85.34% (COD), 93.64% (PO₄³⁻-P) and 92.34% (NO₃⁻-N), respectively, with NO₃⁻-N:PO₄³-P of 1.5:1. The successful enrichment of PAOs and DPAOs (reached 97.9%) was verified by the change of relative metabolic activities, which was further proved by the change of bacterial diversity. The number of Candidatus Accumulibacter, Zoogloea, and Dechloromonas all increased at A/O and A/A stages while the number of Acinetobacter only increased at A/O stage. So Accumulibacter sp. was DPAO while Acinetobacter sp. was only PAO in this process, and genera Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas and Zoogloea greatly coordinated in denitrification and accumulating phosphorous though RDA and chord plot. This was worthy of attention and development to explore enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in practical wastewater treatment via improving identification of bacterial species and symbiosis of bacteria community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aDechloromonas 3aZoogloea 3aacclimation 3aactivated sludge 3abatch systems 3abiomass 3adenitrification 3aenvironment 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asymbiosis 3awastewater treatment 0aPAOs 0aDPAOs 0aBacterial community 0aRemoval efficiency 0aVisual analysis1 aZhong, Yuming1 aHuang, Hui1 aTan, Zexing1 aSun, Yan1 aLiu, Hui0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 744 p.140852-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013300164300001600297520191600313536012702229592002802356596009402384650001202478650001702490650001902507650001102526650005002537650004302587650002402630650001902654650001702673653002802690653002502718653001702743653003802760653001202798700001602810700001602826700001802842700001802860773012002878856008502998852000903083655001203092IND60605001620221118190157.0180719e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060500162DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2018.14364252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wei10aExploring improvement of impervious surface estimation at national scale through integration of nighttime light and Proba-V data  ap. 699-717.  aDirectly mapping impervious surface area (ISA) at national and global scales using nighttime light data is a challenge due to the complexity of land surface components and the impacts of unbalanced economic conditions. Previous research mainly used the coarse spatial resolution Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for ISA mapping; the improved spatial resolution and data quality in the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite’s Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) and in Proba-V data provide a new opportunity to accurately map ISA distribution at the national scale, which has not been explored yet. This research aimed to develop a new index – modified impervious surface index (MISI) – based on VIIRS DNB and Proba-V data to improve ISA estimation and to compare the results with those from the combination of VIIRS DNB and MODIS NDVI data. Landsat data were used to develop ISA data for the typical sites for use as reference data. Regression analysis was used to establish the ISA estimation model in which the dependent variable was from the Landsat data and the independent variable was from the MISI, as well as the previously used Large-scale Impervious Surface Index (LISI). The results indicate that the major error is from the very small or very large proportion of ISA in a unit; improvement of spatial resolution through use of higher spatial resolution nighttime light data (e.g., VIIRS DNB) or NDVI (e.g., Proba-V NDVI) data is an effective approach to improve ISA estimation. Although different indices for the combination of nighttime light and NDVI data have been used, the MISI is especially valuable for reducing the estimation errors for the regions with a small or large ISA proportion.  aThis work was supported by the Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University’s Research and Development Fund [2013FR052];  aPublisher supplied data  a2013FR052cZhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University’s Research and Development Fund 3aLandsat 3adata quality 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asurface area 0aimpervious surface area 0anighttime light data 0aProba-V NDVI 0amodified impervious surface index 0aLandsat1 aLi, Guiying1 aNi, Wenjian1 aZhang, Yuhuan1 aLu, Dengsheng0 tGIScience & remote sensing.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 55, no. 5 p.699-717dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19689x1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2018.14364253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007900171300002000250520175200270592002802022650001502050650002202065650002102087650002202108650001602130650002602146650001602172700001802188700001302206700001802219700005702237700005602294700006302350773013102413856008402544852000902628655001202637IND60678837320221121223036.0191218e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067883732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b040912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Liu-Chuang10aSelf-Reference Analysis Based on Temperature Difference Absorption Spectra  ap. 15791-15797.  aThe direct qualitative identification of pure liquids in laboratories and in security checks is generally performed by the detection of the refractive index or the permittivity. However, refractive indices are strongly influenced by temperature, while the permittivities of some organics are difficult to differentiate. On the other hand, the quantitative monitoring of samples with high concentration in plating baths and in chemical production lines are generally performed via a “Sampling–Dilution–Analysis” approach because of significant deviations from the linear range at high concentration, which makes the real-time monitoring of concentrated samples difficult. Here, we propose a self-reference analysis (SRA) method to directly analyze pure liquids and concentrated samples based on temperature difference absorption spectra (TDAS) without the need for dilution. This method was performed by simultaneously scanning the spectra of the reference and the sample, which are both obtained from the same analyte for detection but are at different temperatures. Compared to conventional absorption spectra with a blank reference, the red-shifted peak wavelengths of TDAS enable the detection of many far UV absorptive compounds in the near-ultraviolet region (λ > 190 nm). More importantly, organic compounds with similar structures can be easily distinguished. In addition, TDAS can also be used for the quantitative detection of concentrated analytes. The proposed SRA-TDAS method is a rapid and effective method; this approach does not require dilution and utilizes a self-reference, implying the wide potential applicability in security checks, and the real-time monitoring of concentrated compounds in chemical production lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonitoring 3aorganic compounds 3arefractive index 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aFan, Fei-Long1 aWang, Yi1 aChen, Zhen-Ni1 aSun, Jian-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7987-52421 aFang, Yi-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2735-67821 aWu, Shaohua,d1949-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5559-69510 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 91, no. 24 p.15791-15797dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b040913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006500160300001600225500001100241520130000252592002801552596006001580596002501640650001201665650001701677650001701694650001901711650001801730650001701748650003001765650001301795650001201808650001101820650001401831650000901845700003301854700001901887700007001906773013601976856007402112852000902186655001202195IND60743211020221123000628.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074321102DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.124802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSendra, Alberto10aDiversity, ecology, distribution and biogeography of Diplura  ap. 415-425.  aREVIEW  aDiplura is the sister group to insects and one of the three basal hexapod groups with unique entognathan mouthparts. The order is divided into 10 families, which include 1008 species in 141 genera, with a high proportion of monotypic genera. They are ubiquitous in soils and subsurface terrestrial habitats, as well as have an important role in overall biogeochemical cycles. We present the first comprehensive review of the global biodiversity and ecology of Diplura. We highlight four aspects of this basal hexapod group: diversity in morphological body plans and sizes; ecology in terrestrial environments from soil to caves; food preference and trophic levels, and their biogeographical and paleobiogeographical significance. Diplura depends on high humidity and moderate temperatures. They are presumably very sensitive to anthropogenic pressures and climate change, and therefore are a suitable model for ecophysiological studies and evident priority targets for conservation. We conclude that the future efforts should focus on establishing a molecular phylogeny to clarify the relationships between and within families, as well as to reveal global biogeographical patterns. This will require an increase in sampling effort in several regions of the globe, especially in tropical regions.  aPublisher supplied data  aRYC‐2013‐14441cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  a15471cVillum Fonden 3aDiplura 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aecophysiology 3afood choices 3ageographical distribution 3ahumidity 3ainsects 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asoil1 aJiménez‐Valverde, Alberto1 aSelfa, Jesús,1 aReboleira, Ana Sofia P.

TiO₂ nanotube arrays prepared by self-ordering electrochemical anodization are attractive for the development of biomedical devices for local drug delivery applications. In this work, several layers of polydopamine (PDA) were deposited to functionalize TiO₂ nanotube arrays. The anticoagulant drug bivalirudin (BVLD) was used as a model drug. PDA extended the release period of BVLD and maintained a sustained release kinetic. Depending on the number of PDA layers, the release characteristics of BVLD improved, as there was a reduced burst release (from 45% to 11%) and extended overall release period from 40 days to more than 300 days in the case of 5 layers. Besides, the BVLD loaded 5-layer PDA coating maintained the high bioactivity of BVLD and effectively reduced the thrombosis formation by inhibition of the adhesion and denaturation of fibrinogen, platelets, and other blood components. Both in vitro and ex vivo blood evaluation results demonstrated that this coating significantly improved the hemocompatibility. These results confirmed the capability of PDA fitted TiO₂ nanotube systems to be applied for local drug delivery over an extended period with well retained bioactivity and predictable release kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanticoagulants 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3ablood platelets 3acoatings 3adenaturation 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectrochemistry 3afibrinogen 3amedical equipment 3ananotubes 3athrombosis 3atitanium dioxide 0apolydopamine 0ahemocompatibility 0aBVLD 0along-term drug release 0aTiO2 nanotube1 aLi, Xiangyang1 aQiu, Hua1 aLi, Ping1 aQi, Pengkai1 aMaitz, Manfred F.1 aYou, Tianxue1 aShen, Ru1 aYang, Zhilu1 aTian, Wenjie1 aHuang, Nan1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2378-68890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 28, v. 10, no. 9 p.7649-7660dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b061083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245012200202300001400324500001100338520049600349592002800845596011300873650001600986650001101002650001601013650001701029650002001046650001401066700001801080700002001098700002501118700002401143773013901167856008001306852000901386655001201395IND60764247520221116172409.0220126e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424752DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.128292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Xiaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7483-517X10aProduction, composition and preservation of micellar casein concentrate and its application in cheesemaking: A review  ap. 46-58.  aREVIEW  aRemoval of 40–95% of native serum proteins from skimmed milk may be achieved by microfiltration (MF) to generate micellar casein concentrate (MCC).

Camellia sinensis var sinensis tea mixtures were prepared according to a 3-component simplex-centroid design containing ten formulations. The antibacterial activity was used to assess the inhibition ability of the tea mixtures against a range of seven Gram positive, Gram negative, vegetative cells and sporeforming bacteria. A formulation of tea mixtures was then optimized by the desirability function aiming to maximize the inhibition of different strains and/or serotypes of Salmonella. The best tea formulation was chemically characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS). The linear effects of white and black teas were statistically significant (p < 0.05) as well as the interaction between green and white and green and black on the inhibition of S. Thyphimurium. Although the optimized tea mixture was effective against all Salmonella strains, the inhibition was substantially greater for specific serotypes, with differences observed even among strains of the same serotype (p < 0.05). A total of 11 phenolic constituents such as gallic acid, quinic acid, (+)-catechin/(−)-epicatechin, (−)-gallocatechin/(−)-epigalocatechin, coumaroylquinic acid, galloylquinic acid, and caffeoylquinic acid were tentatively identified using ESI–MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis var. sinensis 3aSalmonella 3aantibacterial properties 3ablack tea 3achlorogenic acid 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3agallic acid 3amodels 3aquinic acid 3aresponse surface methodology 3aserotypes 3aspore-forming bacteria 3avegetative cells 0aDesirability function 0aResponse surface methodology 0aSalmonella 0aAntimicrobial 0aFlavonoids1 aPrado-Silva, Leonardo do1 aAlvarenga, Verônica O.1 aZielinski, Acácio A.F.1 aBataglion, Giovana A.1 aMorais, Damila R. de1 aEberlin, Marcos N.1 aSant'Ana, Anderson de S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.414-420dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013200174300001600306520174400322592002802066650002602094650001402120650001102134650001702145650002102162650002602183650001402209650001102223650002902234650002502263650002602288650001202314653001402326653002602340653002602366653002102392653002202413700001802435773011302453856008602566852000902652655001202661IND60614744420221121025000.0181029e20181220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061474442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Md. Uzzal10aCritical consideration of buildings' environmental impact assessment towards adoption of circular economy: An analytical review  ap. 763-780.  aA rapid development of building environmental research from the globe is witnessed in recent years to deal with the environmental issues, especially in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions, due to the substantial environmental burdens associated with the building industry. Thus, numerous scientific efforts have been devoted to buildings through environmental assessment like a life cycle assessment (LCA) and a methodological framework development. Concerning the rapid growth of buildings, LCA is increasingly used for assessing and mitigating the associated environmental impacts from material selection to the whole building systems. This study aims to comprehensively review the LCA implication on buildings by discussing the contemporary issues related to the development of this research field. The study considers a wide range of literature including case studies, reviews and surveys, and these articles are critically examined according to the predefined criteria developed. An in-depth analysis is also conducted on selected studies to unveil the criticality of the assessments and results under different considerations. In addition to demonstrating the research gaps for comprehensive assessment of buildings, the adoption of a circular economy (CE) concept is highlighted by providing a comprehensive framework. The findings show that resource recovery and resource-efficient building construction are seldom considered in prevailing studies. As a result, the framework proposed in this paper should help support a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive research for increasing the accuracy and practicability by introducing the CE principle to the building industry for enhancing its sustainability performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuilding construction 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3aconstruction industry 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle assessment 3asurveys 0aBuildings 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aCircular economy 0aAnalytical review1 aNg, S.

Fifteen ssDNA aptamers having high affinity toward BCM-7 were identified from a 72 nt long random library after ten rounds of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. Dissociation constant values of selected aptamers were in the range of 7.7–156.7 nM. Seq6 aptamer exhibited the lowest Kd value. Nine aptamers were evaluated for their binding toward BCM-7, BCM-9A1, and BCM-9A2 peptides, and binding was variable. SeqU5 exhibited the lowest binding with BCM-9A1 and BCM-9A2. Aptamer-coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) resulted in color change of GNPs in the presence of BCM-7, thereby establishing recognition of BCM-7 by aptamers. The enzyme-linked aptamer-sorbent assay (ELASA) was evaluated as an assay of BCM-7 in biological fluids. BCM-7-peroxidase competed with BCM-7 in ELASA, performed with BCM-7 solution and BCM-7 spiked urine pretreated with urease, plasma, and β-casein digest samples. 3aamino acids 3abeta-casein 3acolor 3adigestion 3amilk 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3apeptides 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3aurease 3aurine1 aRajput, Yudhishthir S.1 aSharma, Rajan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 63, no. 10 p.2647-2653dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00007  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009300164300001600257500002000273520141700293592002801710650001401738650001201752650001501764650002401779650001701803650001501820650001301835650001201848650001701860650001301877650000901890650001101899650001101910650002301921700002201944700001901966773013601985856007402121852000902195655001202204IND60743211220221123000334.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074321122DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.124712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Smedt, Pallieter10aTemporal complementarity in activity‐density of two arthropod macro‐detritivore taxa  ap. 455-463.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacro‐detritivores are important fragmenters performing a first step in the ecosystem process of nutrient cycling. Woodlice and millipedes are important representatives of this group and their ecology and niche requirements are often regarded as very similar. However, it is unclear whether there is a difference in temporal activity throughout the year between both groups, possibly leading to temporal complementarity for leaf litter breakdown, and whether patterns of temporal variation in activity are consistent across different habitat types. We studied year‐round pitfall‐trap data of woodlice and millipedes from an old sand quarry with a high habitat heterogeneity. Our results indicate that there is high temporal complementarity between both detritivore taxa, with millipede activity‐density peaking in spring, while woodlice showing a peak in summer. Interestingly, timing of activity depended on habitat openness. Millipedes peak first in open habitat and later in closed habitat, while woodlice showed the opposite pattern. Temporal turnover in community composition was high and of similar magnitude as spatial turnover in community composition across this relatively small scale of our study area. We conclude that, although woodlice and millipedes show comparable habitat preferences, their temporal activity patterns show the potential for temporal complementarity for litter breakdown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplopoda 3aIsopoda 3aarthropods 3acommunity structure 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3aplant litter 3aquarries 3asand 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation1 aProesmans, Willem1 aBaeten, Lander0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2021 July, v. 14, no. 4 p.455-463dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.124713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009900163500001900262520228600281592002802567650001002595650001502605650001602620650001502636650000902651650001902660650002302679650001302702650001502715650001502730650001102745653001202756653002502768653001302793653001202806653002102818700001402839700001902853700001702872773009902889856008502988852000903073655001203082IND60720956820221122051000.0210311e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072095682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiek, A.10aDaily energy expenditure and water turnover in two breeds of laying hens kept in floor housing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLaying hens are increasingly kept in barn or free-range systems, which not only allows birds to move freely but also potentially entails higher energy expenditures due to higher locomotor activity. Therefore, the aim of our study was to quantify the daily energy expenditure (DEE) and water turnover in freely moving laying hens. For that purpose, 10 Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and 10 Lohmann Brown (LB) hens were obtained from a conventional breeding company at 17 weeks of age. The trial started when birds reached an age of 34 weeks. All 20 birds were kept together in the same littered floor pen (12.1 m²). The pen was equipped with perches, a nest box, feeding and nipple drinkers. The DEE was determined individually for all experimental birds (n = 20) for a total of nine days using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method. Lohmann Brown hens were heavier than LSL hens, but laying rate did not differ between the two breeds, that is, one egg per hen and day during the study period. Average egg mass was 63.1 ± 0.20 g in LB and 61.7 ± 0.12 g in LSL hens, which converted to an egg energy content of 420 and 410 kJ/egg, respectively. Dilution spaces for oxygen and hydrogen differed between the breeds but not the respective turnover rates. Total body water as a percentage of body mass (LB: 54.4%, LSL: 53.8%; SEM = 0.7, F₁,₁₈ = 0.41, P = 0.513) and total water intake (TWI) per day (LB: 275 ml/day, LSL: 276 ml/day; SEM = 20, F₁,₁₇ = 0, P = 0.994) did not differ between LB and LSL hens. Individual DEE increased with body mass in LB but not in LSL hens. Average DEE did not differ between the two breeds (LB: 1501 kJ/day; LSL: 1520 kJ/day; SEM = 32.1, F₁,₁₇ = 2.54, P = 0.131). However, when comparing the DEE on a metabolic mass basis, LSL hens expended with 984 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵ on average significantly more energy per day than LB hens (895 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵; SEM = 20.3, F₁,₁₈ = 10.1, P = 0.005). Our results suggest that the DLW technique is a viable method to measure the energy expenditure and water turnover over several days in laying hens. Furthermore, we show that laying hens kept in floor pens fit into the general pattern of DEE among wild birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarns 3abody water 3abody weight 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aenergy content 3aenergy expenditure 3ahydrogen 3alocomotion 3anest boxes 3aoxygen 0aChicken 0aField metabolic rate 0aIsotopes 0aPoultry 0aWater metabolism1 aPetow, S.1 aSpeakman, J.R.1 aSchrader, L.0 tAnimal.g2021 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.100047-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245012600166300001600292500002000308520160500328592002801933650001501961650001101976650001701987650002402004650002002028650001202048650001202060650001302072650001302085650002302098650001302121650001502134650001202149650003102161650000902192650001702201650002202218650002802240651001102268700003902279700003302318700002502351700001902376700003402395700003002429700002202459700004402481700003702525773013002562856007202692852000902764655001202773IND60587740520221122190936.0180102e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058774052DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.26402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Amanda Posselt10aShort‐term Impacts on Soil‐quality Assessment in Alternative Land Uses of Traditional Paddy Fields in Southern Brazil  ap. 534-542.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNo‐till, crop diversity and integrated crop–livestock systems are proposed managements to increase agriculture sustainability in the rice paddies of the Southern Brazilian lowlands and avoid degradation in the region. Because soil is considered a key medium in which management modifications can be measured, our study aimed to evaluate soil‐quality impacts by measuring carbon and nitrogen stocks and microbial activity 18 months after the adoption of different paddy‐farming systems in an Albaqualf soil of Southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of five paddy‐farming systems with a range of vegetation diversity (both in time and in space) and grazing seasons. In addition, a reference area (i.e. native forest) was sampled for comparison. We verified that soil quality was affected over the short term through the adoption of no‐till, crop diversity and integrated grazing practices. However, during the study period, only the system with low anthropic and/or mechanical intervention and high plant diversity differed from the traditional paddy land‐use approach in Brazil in terms of soil‐quality effects. This system achieved a carbon management index of 49 (approximately half that of the native forest) and had the highest enzymatic activity (similar to native forest). These outcomes were primarily due to an increase in the particulate organic matter fraction of the soil carbon stock (4·6 Mg ha⁻¹ more than in rice monocropping). To evaluate changes in soil quality over the long term, additional studies are required.

In Europe, it is predominately transmitted by the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. Compared with other European countries, the United Kingdom (UK) is considered to have a low incidence of LB, although this varies regionally. To determine whether an association exists between tick bite consultations and LB incidence in the UK, retrospective questionnaires were sent to general practitioners (GPs) in high (Wiltshire), medium (Cumbria) and low (Wales) incidence areas. During 2011, the greatest incidence of consultations for tick bites was reported by GPs in Cumbria (204 consultations per 100,000 inhabitants), followed by Wiltshire (160 per 100,000 population) and Wales (54 per 100,000 population). In Wiltshire and Cumbria, GPs predominantly provided advice on tick removal, whilst Welsh GPs mostly advised patients on tick bite prevention. Focusing on Cumbria during 2011–2013, 72.5% of GPs removed ticks from patients (incidence of 101 consultations per 100,000 population), and more GPs diagnosed LB based on clinical features than laboratory‐confirmed diagnoses. To date, this is the first study to investigate the incidence of tick bite consultations and LB in England and Wales.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIHR HPRU  cMerial 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes ricinus 3aLyme disease 3apublic health 3asheep 3aticks 3azoonoses 3aEngland 3aWales1 aHall, Jessica L.1 aBirtles, R.

In this study, the composition of microbial phenolic metabolites in human feces collected after regular consumption of either red wine, dealcoholized red wine, or gin was analyzed by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Red wine interventions produce a change in the content of eight phenolic acids, which are probably derived from the catabolism of flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins, the main flavonoids in red wine. Moreover, alcohol seemed not to influence the formation of phenolic metabolites by the gut microbiota. A principal component analysis revealed large interindividual differences in the formation of microbial metabolites after each red wine polyphenol intervention, but not after the gin intervention, indicating differences in the gut microbial composition among subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3adigestive system 3afeces 3aflavanols 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphenolic acids 3aprincipal component analysis 3ared wines 2aAlcoholic Beveragesxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCross-Over Studies 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolyphenolsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aWinexanalysis 0ared wine polyphenols 0agut microbiota 0amicrobial metabolites 0afeces 0aUPLC-ESI-MS/MS1 aQueipo-Ortuño, María Isabel1 aBoto Ordóñez, María,1 aMuñoz-González, Irene1 aSánchez-Patán, Fernando1 aMonagas, Maria1 aMartín-Álvarez, Pedro J.1 aMurri, Mora1 aTinahones, Francisco J.1 aAndrés-Lacueva, Cristina1 aBartolomé, Begoña1 aMoreno-Arribas, M.Victoria0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 61, no. 16 p.3909-3915dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf400678d3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02452naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011200157300001600269500002000285520092000305592002801225596009201253650001701345650001001362650002001372650002801392650001101420650001501431650001401446650001301460650001801473650001001491650001301501651001101514700006501525700002601590700002201616700002201638700001701660700003301677700002901710700002301739773012601762856007301888852000901961655001201970IND60743211620221123012803.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074321162DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.128292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSüli, Tamás10aSubtyping Blastocystis in pigs and humans revealed unusual avian‐specific subtype ST6 in humans in Serbia  ap. 544-548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBlastocystis is a common protist colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of humans and various animals.

Eleven randomly selected PCR‐positive pig samples and 10 samples from human patients (with gastrointestinal complaints) were subjected to SSU rDNA sequencing. Three subtypes were identified (ST3, ST5 and ST6) by phylogenetic analysis. ST5 was found in all pig samples; while in human samples, we detected ST3 and ST6. The latter subtype is relatively uncommon in Europe and highly adapted to avian hosts; therefore, the possibility of sporadic zoonotic transmission to human patients should not be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data  a31034cMinistry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia 3aBlastocystis 3abirds 3adigestive tract 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3amicroscopy 3aphylogeny 3aprotists 3apublic health 3aswine 3azoonoses 3aSerbia1 aKozoderović, Gordana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1497-264X1 aPotkonjak, Aleksandar1 aVidanović, Dejan1 aTešović, Bojana1 aVračar, Vuk1 aMiladinović Tasić, Nataša1 aStensvold, Christen Rune1 aLalošević, Vesna0 tZoonoses and public health.g2021 Aug., v. 68, no. 5 p.544-548dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.128293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010100168500001900269520253600288592002802824650001902852650001502871650002102886650001902907650000902926650001402935650001302949653002502962653001202987653001002999653002003009653001203029700001603041700001603057700002103073700001903094700001503113700002003128700001603148773009903164856008503263852000903348655001203357IND60720957220221122050952.0210311e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072095722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, É.R.10aReproductive status effects of pair-housed male pigs on natural, agonistic and sexual behaviours  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoar rearing, which avoids pain and suffering caused by surgical castration, provides better performance, a greater deposition of muscle tissue and leaner carcasses and thus has beneficial effects on both animal welfare and the product. Some countries that do not slaughter boars must consider their boar taint and aggressive and sexual behaviours. Considering that pigs are housed in large groups, which may complicate the formation of social hierarchies and increase fighting and mounting behaviours, some studies have conducted research with reduced numbers of pigs per pen, but these behaviours continued to be observed. However, a study of the reproductive status of pair-housed male pigs has yet to be reported. The aim of this study was to determine whether the reproductive status of uncastrated, immunocastrated and surgically castrated pair-housed male pigs alters their natural, agonistic and sexual behaviours. A total of 48 male pigs from Agroceres PIC™ genetics were assigned to three groups: surgically castrated (barrows), immunocastrated and uncastrated (boars). Natural, aggressive and sexual behaviours of the pigs were assessed by direct observations during four periods of 12 h each (six, five and three weeks before slaughter and the slaughter week). The pigs were housed in pairs from the growing phase until slaughter. Animal behaviour was observed from the finishing phase to slaughter. Carcass lesions were assessed according to five different classes (one: no injury; two to five: severely injured). Overall, boars spent more time lying and less time eating and drinking than barrows. In total of all the periods (48 h), boars expressed more aggressive and sexual behaviours than barrows, whereas immunocastrated pigs displayed similar behaviours to boars, before and after the second vaccine dose. No differences in carcass lesions between treatments and no prevalence of carcasses with severe injuries were observed. In conclusion, the reproductive status of pair-housed male pigs did not change the natural behaviour of boars, immunocastrated pigs or barrows. The agonistic and sexual behaviours of boars and barrows remained unchanged. When housing pigs in pairs, immunocastrated pigs presented similar agonistic and sexual behaviours to boars before and after the second immunocastration vaccine dose. The use of pair-housed uncastrated male pigs has generated welfare benefits for these animals, as the number of carcasses with injuries did not differ from barrows and immunocastrated pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aboar taint 3aimmunocastration 3amuscle tissues 3apain 3aslaughter 3avaccines 0aAggressive behaviour 0aBarrows 0aBoars 0aImmunocastrated 0aWelfare1 aBridi, A.M.1 aSilva, C.A.1 aGiangareli, B.L.1 aFerreira, G.A.1 aVero, J.G.1 aFregonesi, J.A.1 aCosta, S.C.0 tAnimal.g2021 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.100072-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009100174300001600265520115100281592002801432650001701460650001801477650001301495650001601508650001601524650001301540650001201553650001301565650001501578650001201593650001601605653004501621653002101666653001701687653001101704653002701715700002601742700002001768700002201788700002601810773012101836856008101957852000902038655001202047IND60524946320221121231059.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052494632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasperué, Joaquín H.10aContinuous white–blue LED light exposition delays postharvest senescence of broccoli  ap. 495-502.  aIn this work, the impact of low intensity (20 μmol m−2 s−1) continue illumination with white and blue light-emitting diodes (WB LED) on the shelf life of broccoli heads stored at 5 °C or at 22 °C was assessed. At both temperatures, heads stored under WB LED showed the highest levels of chlorophylls, reflected in a higher Hue angle and lower L* values compared to controls stored in the darkness. Also, during storage at 22 °C the treated samples had a slower rate of sugar lost compared to dark stored controls. At 5 °C, glucose and fructose levels were maintained and sucrose was increased by the WB LED treatment. The dark stored controls showed the highest accumulation of antioxidant compounds, but there were no differences in ascorbic acid content except for the last storage day at 5 °C, being the WB LED samples which had a slightly higher level (p < 0.05). Finally, treated samples showed an increment in the total carotenoid content, mainly during storage at 22 °C. According to the results, WB LED treatment would be a feasible and low cost technology to enlarge the postharvest storage of whole broccoli heads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abroccoli 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3afructose 3aglucose 3alighting 3ashelf life 3asucrose 3atemperature 0aWhite–blue light emitting-diodes (LED) 0aBroccoli storage 0aAntioxidants 0aSugars 0aPostharvest senescence1 aGuardianelli, Luciano1 aRodoni, Luis M.1 aChaves, Alicia R.1 aMartínez, Gustavo A.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.495-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009600161300001800257520141800275592002801693650003701721650001301758650002201771650001901793650001901812650001501831650000901846650001901855650000901874650002201883650001601905650003701921653003901958653003201997653002502029653002602054653002902080700001802109700001802127700005602145700001702201700001902218700006102237700006102298773013902359856007802498852000902576655001202585IND60594809820221118154335.0180524e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059480982DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b094472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Pooja10aProbing the Mechanism for Bipolar Resistive Switching in Annealed Graphene Oxide Thin Films  ap. 6521-6530.  aThe bipolar resistive switching (BRS) between a metallic low resistance state (LRS) and an insulating high resistance state (HRS) is demonstrated for annealed graphene oxide (GO) thin film-based device structures with aluminum (Al) as one of the contact electrodes. An optimal switching of ∼10⁴ order is recorded for Al/GO (200 °C)/indium tin oxide (ITO) among the device structures in metal (M₂)/GO (T)/metal (M₁) configurations (M₁ = Al, Au, or ITO and M₂ = Au or Al), fabricated using GO (T)/metal (M₁), annealed at different temperatures, T = 100, 200, 300, and 400 °C. The initial Ohmic conduction for electronic transport and the presence of metal contents through GO thin films in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy support the physical evidence of Al filament formation between the two electrodes as imaged by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The speculated mechanism for BRS in repeated voltage sweep cycles is attributed to the current triggered breaking of metal filaments because of the combined effect of Joule’s heating and Peltier heat generation at LRS → HRS transition, and electric field induced migration of metal atoms, leading to the formation of metal filaments through the GO film at the HRS → LRS transition. The higher switching ratio exhibited in the current study could be translated to engineer simple and low-cost resistive memory devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3acomputer hardware 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3amaterials science 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aannealed graphene oxide thin films 0abipolar resistive switching 0alow resistance state 0ahigh resistance state 0ametal filament formation1 aSingh, Manjri1 aThakur, Jyoti1 aPatil, Ranjit1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3429-52361 aMa, Yuan Ron1 aTandon, Ram P.1 aSingh, Surinder P.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9638-76731 aMahapatro, Ajit K.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3860-28620 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 7 p.6521-6530dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b094473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017700163300001800340520121200358592002801570650004401598650002201642650001501664650001501679650001301694650001201707650002101719650002201740650001101762650001301773650002201786650000901808650000901817650001401826650001401840650001801854650001101872650001301883650004401896650001401940650001501954650003301969650001202002650001002014650002102024650001802045650001702063650001102080650002502091650002302116700002402139700002302163700002202186773014102208856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60668903720221120231401.0190920e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066890372DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11064h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuwahara, Yasutaka12aA novel conversion process for waste slag: synthesis of calcium silicate hydrate from blast furnace slag and its application as a versatile adsorbent for water purification  ap. 7199-7210.  aBlast furnace slag (BFS), a high volume byproduct resulting from the iron manufacturing industry, was used as a low-cost and abundant precursor for preparing a high-surface-area calcium silicate hydrate. The synthesis of slag-made calcium silicate hydrate (slagCS) was achieved via a facile two-step dissolution–coprecipitation procedure using HCl and NaOH, respectively. The use of concentrated protonic acid facilitated an easy dissolution of BFS, and the subsequent addition of aqueous NaOH solution at 100 °C yielded a hydrate product with over 85% atom economy (10.9 g from 10.0 g of BFS). By the combination of XRD, FT-IR, ²⁹Si MAS NMR, FE-SEM, nitrogen physisorption and chemical analysis, the product synthesized under optimum conditions was identified to be a calcium silicate hydrate with a stoichiometry of Ca : Si = 1 : 1 and with a mean surface area of 219 m² g⁻¹ incorporating the slag-derived metals (Al, Mg, Fe, Ti and Mn) in its structure. The thus synthesized slagCS showed good adsorption properties for removal of Cu²⁺, phosphate ions and model protein (ovalbumin) diluted in water, making this material a promising candidate for efficient bulk wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acalcium silicate 3achemical analysis 3acopper 3afurnaces 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aovalbumin 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3aslags 3asodium hydroxide 3astoichiometry 3asurface area 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3awater purification1 aTamagawa, Shigetaka1 aFujitani, Tadahiro1 aYamashita, Hiromi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 May 28, v. 1, no. 24 p.7199-7210dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11064h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011400174300001600288520165800304592002801962650002501990650002802015650002102043650002502064650002202089650000902111650001402120650003502134650002002169650001402189650001902203650002002222650005202242650002402294650001402318653002502332653001302357653003502370653001402405653001602419653004002435700002402475700001902499700002002518700002202538773012202560856008302682852000902765655001202774IND60571153520221118013959.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057115352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Patrícia I.S.10aIn vitro screening for estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds using Mozambique tilapia and sea bass scales  ap. 106-113.  aA wide range of estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EDCs) are accumulating in the environment and may disrupt the physiology of aquatic organisms. The effects of EDCs on fish have mainly been assessed using reproductive endpoints and in vivo animal experiments. We used a simple non-invasive assay to evaluate the impact of estrogens and EDCs on sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) scales. These were exposed to estradiol (E2), two phytoestrogens and six anthropogenic estrogenic/anti-estrogenic EDCs and activities of enzymes related to mineralized tissue turnover (TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and ALP, alkaline phosphatase) were measured. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR detected the expression of both membrane and nuclear estrogen receptors in the scales of both species, confirming scales as a target for E2 and EDCs through different mechanisms. Changes in TRAP or ALP activities after 30minute and 24h exposure were detected in sea bass and tilapia scales treated with E2 and three EDCs, although compound-, time- and dose-specific responses were observed for the two species. These results support again that the mineralized tissue turnover of fish is regulated by estrogens and reveals that the scales are a mineralized estrogen-responsive tissue that may be affected by some EDCs. The significance of these effects for whole animal physiology needs to be further explored. The in vitro fish scale bioassay is a promising non-invasive screening tool for E2 and EDCs effects, although the low sensitivity of TRAP/ALP quantification limits their utility and indicates that alternative endpoints are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal physiology 3abass 3abioassays 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenzyme activity 3aestradiol 3amineralization 3aplant estrogens 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascales (integument) 3ascreening 0aAlkaline phosphatase 0aBioassay 0aEndocrine disrupting compounds 0aEstradiol 0aFish scales 0aTartrate-resistant acid phosphatase1 aEstêvão, M.

We provide the first composite magnetic polarity record through the Lower Silurian (Llandovery) from the magnetostratigraphy of six sections. These are integrated with graptolite biostratigraphy and some carbon isotope chemostratigraphy. The palaeomagnetic signal is carried by both haematite and magnetite, with haematite dominating in red-coloured mudstones and mostly magnetite in non-red lithologies. The influence of possible tectonic disruption of the fabric is assessed using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. Only the most thermally mature section at Backside Beck shows the imprint of initial tectonic fabric formation. The Llandovery is divided into 6 major normal-reverse-polarity chron couplets (referred to as LL1 to LL6). An additional longer, exclusively normal polarity interval (referred to as WE1n), beginning in Telychian Stage slice Te3, runs into the lower Sheinwoodian. Within these five polarity couplets there are 10 further submagnetozones, and 10 tentative submagnetozones. Average reversal frequency (including the tentative submagnetozones) was ca. 3.0 Myr⁻¹ in the Early Silurian, which is probably an underestimate, due to insufficient sampling density in some parts of the Rhuddanian and Aeronian. This reversal frequency is similar to that in the late Cenozoic, indicating the future potential utility of magnetostratigraphy for high-resolution correlation and dating in the Early Silurian.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aSilurian period 3aanisotropy 3abiostratigraphy 3acarbon 3afabrics 3ahematite 3aisotopes 3alithology 3amagnetic susceptibility 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3atectonics 0aStratigraphy 0aTimescale 0aAnisotropy of magnetic susceptibility 0aEurope 0aTelychian1 aHarris, Samuel E.1 aWójcik, Krystian1 aNawrocki, Jerzy1 aWoodcock, N.

In the first trial, M. bovis was isolated from 86 of 200 tissue samples that were cultured using 2 liquid media, BACTEC 12B and BBL mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT), and a solid medium, Middlebrook 7H11 supplemented with pyruvate (7H11P). M. bovis was isolated from 2 samples with MGIT but not BACTEC 12B. M. bovis was isolated from 9 samples with BACTEC but not MGIT; these 9 samples came from the North Canterbury/Marlborough region of New Zealand. The proportion of tissues from which M. bovis was isolated with BACTEC 12B or MGIT and the mean time for isolation was different for samples from the North Canterbury/Marlborough region but not the rest of New Zealand. In the second trial, M. bovis was isolated from 401 of 1,033 tissues that were cultured using MGIT, Middlebrook 7H9 broth, or solid 7H11P. The proportion of isolates of M. bovis and the mean time for their isolation with MGIT was different for the North Canterbury/Marlborough and the rest of New Zealand. The reason for this difference was not determined but may be related to the genotypes present in this region. Genotyping using variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of 197 isolates of M. bovis revealed that the 44 isolates from North Canterbury/Marlborough were represented by 2 closely related VNTR types that were not found in 153 isolates from the remainder of New Zealand.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this project was provided by TBFree New Zealand.  aPublisher supplied data  cTBFree, New Zealand 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aanimals 3abovine tuberculosis 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aliquids 3aminisatellite repeats 3apyruvic acid 3atandem repeat sequences 3aNew Zealand 0aBACTEC 12B 0abacterial culture 0aMGIT 0aMycobacterium bovis 0aNew Zealand1 aPrice-Carter, Marian1 aBland, Kirstie1 aJoyce, Maree A.1 aKhan, Farina1 aSurrey, Melissa1 ade Lisle, Geoffrey W.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.508-512dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387176977633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245008100131300001600212520072300228592002800951650002600979650003001005650001601035650001501051653003901066653002801105700002901133700001401162773019601176852000901372655001201381IND60705207620221122010410.0200731e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070520762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJha, Sujeet K.10aModus operandi of Scientific Community in Dissemination of Research-Findings  ap. 217-220.  aThe modus operandi vis-à-vis communication of the ‘results of the researches being conducted’ to/for the benefit of outside world happens to be an area of prime concern among the scientific community, since, scientists do not want to disclose their research-results through non-credible sources of communication.

Linseed oil is valued for its food and non-food applications. Modifying its oil content and fatty acid (FA) profiles to meet market needs in a timely manner requires clear understanding of their quantitative trait loci (QTL) architectures, which have received little attention to date. Association mapping is an efficient approach to identify QTL in germplasm collections. In this study, we explored the quantitative nature of seed quality traits including oil content (OIL), palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid (LIO) linolenic acid (LIN) and iodine value in a flax core collection of 390 accessions assayed with 460 microsatellite markers. The core collection was grown in a modified augmented design at two locations over 3 years and phenotypic data for all seven traits were obtained from all six environments. Significant phenotypic diversity and moderate to high heritability for each trait (0.73–0.99) were observed. Most of the candidate QTL were stable as revealed by multivariate analyses. Nine candidate QTL were identified, varying from one for OIL to three for LIO and LIN. Candidate QTL for LIO and LIN co-localized with QTL previously identified in bi-parental populations and some mapped nearby genes known to be involved in the FA biosynthesis pathway. Fifty-eight percent of the QTL alleles were absent (private) in the Canadian cultivars suggesting that the core collection possesses QTL alleles potentially useful to improve seed quality traits. The candidate QTL identified herein will establish the foundation for future marker-assisted breeding in linseed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aalleles 3afatty acid composition 3aflax 3afoods 3agermplasm conservation 3aiodine value 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3alipid content 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultivariate analysis 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed quality 3astearic acid 2aAlleles 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aFlaxxgenetics 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Markers 2aInheritance Patternsxgenetics 2aLinkage Disequilibriumxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSeedsxgenetics 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxmetabolism 0aCanada1 aDuguid, Scott1 aBooker, Helen1 aRowland, Gordon1 aDiederichsen, Axel1 aCloutier, Sylvie0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2014 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.881-896dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-014-2264-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01115naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006200163300001400225520029000239592002800529650001000557650001300567650001200580653001700592653001600609773012000625856008300745852000900828655001200837IND60775670520221119090957.0220427e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077567052DNAL7 a10.1556/abot.56.2014.1-2.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, E.10aBibliography of foliicolous lichenized fungi, 1952–2013  ap. 33-68.  aThe bibliography of foliicolous lichenised fungi is compiled, listing publications of the last 60 years following Santesson’s world monograph on the foliicolous lichens.

This research reports a new kind of self-healing polypeptide hydrogels based on self-assembly between cholesterol (Chol)-modified triblock poly(l-glutamic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(l-glutamic acid) ((PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA)-g-Chol) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modified poly(l-glutamic acid) (PLGA-g-β-CD). The hydrogel formation relied on the host and guest linkage between β-CD and Chol. This study demonstrates the influences of polymer concentration and β-CD/Chol molar ratio on viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels. The results showed that storage modulus was highest at polymer concentration of 15% w/v and β-CD/Chol molar ratio of 1:1. The effect of the PLGA molecular weight in (PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA)-g-Chol on viscoelastic behavior, mechanical properties and in vitro degradation of the supramolecular hydrogels was also studied. The hydrogels showed outstanding self-healing capability and good cytocompatibility. The multilayer structure was constructed using hydrogels with self-healing ability. The developed hydrogels provide a fascinating glimpse for the applications in tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolypeptides 3aviscoelasticity 3astorage modulus 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3acholesterol 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyglutamic acid 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3atissue engineering 3amolecular weight 0areports1 aWu, Jie1 aWang, Bo1 aYan, Shifeng1 aZhang, Kunxi1 aDing, Jianxun1 aYin, Jingbo0 tBiomacromolecules.g2015 Nov. 09, v. 16, no. 11 p.3508-3518dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.5b012873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015100167300001400318500001900332520070300351592002801054650001801082650001301100651001101113651002401124651001801148653001401166653001701180653003601197653003201233773010901265856008201374852000901456655001201465IND60695778620221121083642.0200519e20020301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069577862DNAL7 a10.1179/0373668021250003592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrolle, Riclef14aThe Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of the subantarctic and temperate islands in the eastern Southern Hemisphere (90°E to 0°): an annotated catalogue  ap. 57-80.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOn the subantarctic and temperate islands of the eastern Southern Hemisphere (90°E to 0°) 66 Hepaticae and two Anthocerotae species are recorded, among them ten are recorded for the first time.

Such alterations in community composition must be underlain by changes in the population dynamics of component species. • Here, the impact of elevated CO₂ (550 µmol mol⁻¹) and warming (+2°C) on the population growth of four plant species important in Australian temperate grasslands is reported. Data collected from the Tasmanian free‐air CO₂ enrichment (TasFACE) experiment between 2003 and 2006 were analysed using population matrix models. • Population growth of Themeda triandra, a perennial C₄ grass, was largely unaffected by either factor but population growth of Austrodanthonia caespitosa, a perennial C₃ grass, was reduced substantially in elevated CO₂ plots. Warming and elevated CO₂ had antagonistic effects on population growth of two invasive weeds, Hypochaeris radicata and Leontodon taraxacoides, with warming causing population decline. Analysis of life cycle stages showed that seed production, seedling emergence and establishment were important factors in the responses of the species to global changes. • These results show that the demographic approach is very useful in understanding the variable responses of plants to global changes and in elucidating the life cycle stages that are most responsive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aHypochaeris radicata 3aLeontodon 3aThemeda triandra 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3ademographic statistics 3adevelopmental stages 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ainvasive species 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aplant communities 3apopulation growth 3aseedling emergence 3atemperature1 aWills, Karen E.1 aJanes, Jasmine K.1 aVander Schoor, Jacqueline K.1 aNewton, Paul C.

I. Lewis10aEnhanced sexual reproduction in bryophytes at high latitudes in the maritime Antarctic  ap. 107-117.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContrary to the generally accepted hypothesis that bryophyte fertility decreases with increasing latitude and therefore climatic severity, a detailed study of bryophyte reproductive strategies at sites in the southern maritime Antarctic (68–72°S) has revealed that an unexpectedly high proportion of species is capable of producing sporophytes. Of the regional bryoflora, 43% (19 species; 17 mosses, 2 liverworts) in Marguerite Bay and 47% (17 species; 16 mosses, 1 liverwort) in Alexander Island are known to produce sporophytes, although the number fruiting at comparable latitudes on the colder and more arid Antarctic continent is less (33%). These numbers and proportions are much greater than were previously known at such relatively high southern polar latitudes. Sporophytes of several species are recorded for the first time within the Antarctic biome, while those of two liverworts (Lophozia excisa and Cephaloziella varians) are reported for the first time south of 62°S. High incidence of sporophyte production is attributed to locally favourable microclimatic conditions producing small-scale 'oases'. The large majority of fertile mosses are monoecious short acrocarps growing on rather calcareous soils. Spore production and size data for a number of species are compared with previously published studies of the same or closely related species from the northern maritime Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, but no consistent trends are revealed between species over the latitudinal gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3abryology 3aecosystems 3alatitude 3amicroclimate 3amonoecy 3amosses and liverworts 3asexual reproduction 3aspores 3asporophytes 3aAntarctic region 3aMarguerite Bay 0aBRYOPHYTES 0aANTARCTIC 0aDISPERSAL1 aConvey, Peter0 tJournal of bryology.g2002 June 1, v. 24, no. 2 p.107-117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1179/0373668021250009623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014100206300001800347520192200365592002802287650002502315650002102340650001702361650001202378650001202390650001302402650001602415650002302431650001802454650001102472650002002483650002102503650002102524650001502545650002802560650001202588650002502600700002502625700002802650700006202678700002202740700006002762773012402822856008302946852000903029655001203038IND60793651020221117063401.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079365102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafeez, Arslan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5022-155510aFoliar application of moringa leaf extract (MLE) enhanced antioxidant system, growth, and biomass related attributes in safflower plants  ap. 1087-1095.  aThe use of synthetic fertilizers is a potential source of environmental hazards. Natural plant-based growth regulators are eco-friendly, inexpensive and their use is highly recommended. Moringa (Moringa oleifera L.) is also known as a miracle plant with high nutritional content, medicinal and plant growth-promoting properties due to the presence of appreciable levels of hormones, vitamins, micro, and macronutrients. However, no literature has been found regarding the effect of moringa leaf extract (MLE) application on safflower plants (Carthamus tinctorius L.). Therefore, the present experiment investigated the effect of two different concentrations of MLE (3 and 20%) on various biochemical, mineral content, growth, and biomass-related attributes of safflower plants. Results revealed that application of MLE significantly improved chlorophyll content, maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), shoot and root length, fresh and dry biomass. Moreover, MLE application also significantly enhanced activities of leaf superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) while decreasing H₂O₂ and MDA content. Foliar application of MLE also resulted in a notable increase in proline, glycine betaine, and mineral content. The application of MLE (20%) manifested maximum improvement in all attributes when compared to MLE (3%). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed positive correlation among growth, biomass, biochemical and mineral content, whereas a strong negative correlation was found between these traits and oxidative stress markers (H₂O₂ and MDA) under MLE application. The present experimental findings indicate that MLE application can be employed as a natural plant growth regulator. Furthermore, the MLE enhanced the antioxidant system and reduced oxidative stress, therefore, it can be used to ameliorate the detrimental effects of environmental adversities on plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aMoringa oleifera 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3abiomass 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3afoliar application 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth substances 3aproline 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aTipu, Muhammad Imran1 aSaleem, Muhammad Hamzah1 aAl-Ashkar, Ibrahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5022-15551 aSaneoka, Hirofumi1 aSabagh, Ayman El1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4241-192X0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Nov., v. 150 p.1087-1095dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245011600175300001600291520130100307592002801608650002801636650002401664650001701688650002001705650002301725650001201748650001501760650001501775650002001790650001601810651001201826653002001838653003601858653002001894653001601914653003001930653003101960653003801991700001902029700002002048700005902068700002302127773009502150856008902245852000902334655001202343IND60626510120221117062039.0190502e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062651012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietze, Victoria10aFarmers consideration of soil ecosystem services in agricultural management - A case study from Saxony, Germany  ap. 813-824.  aThe ecosystem services (ES) concept has been increasingly considered in science and policy making. However, its consideration in agricultural management by farmers has not yet been fully investigated. This paper presents a theoretical framework based on available literature on how the concept of ES is likely established in agricultural practices and policies. We refine this framework based on a case study from Saxony, Germany. First, semi-qualitative interviews with farmers were conducted and a qualitative content analysis with a combination of a deductive and inductive category system executed. The results show that knowledge about the concept of ES is inherent in agriculture and that farmers implement various ES in agricultural management decisions even though their terminology may differ from ES definitions in research. Second, the paper evaluates existing agricultural policy instruments within the case study region related to their potential to enhance the provision of ES by asking which governance instruments are familiar with and would be accepted by the farmers for incorporating ES more prominently as a criterion in their management decisions. The paper concludes with an enriched conceptual framework about ES in farmers’ decision making and on policy recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural policy 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3asoil ecosystems 3aterminology 3aGermany 0aSoil management 0aAgricultural ecosystem services 0aSoil protection 0aSoil policy 0aAgri-environmental policy 0aCommon agricultural policy 0aAgricultural management practices1 aHagemann, Nina1 aJürges, Nataly1 aBartke, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1528-30501 aFürst, Christine,0 tLand use policy.g2019 Feb., v. 81 p.813-824dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245020100165500002000366520181600386592002802202596005602230596002202286596005902308650002102367650001202388650001602400650001602416650001002432650002202442650002102464650002902485650001402514650001402528650001302542650003002555650001302585650001302598650001902611650002902630650001702659650001402676650001002690651001002700700002202710700001402732700002202746700002202768700002402790700001802814700001702832700006602849773012202915856007303037852000903110655001203119IND60789098620221118170301.0220818e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078909862DNAL7 a10.1002/wer.16782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, Debaraj10aElucidating the resistance repertoire, biofilm production, and phylogenetic characteristics of multidrug‐resistant Escherichia coli isolated from community ponds: A study from West Bengal, India  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study details about the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of multidrug‐resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli in the fresh community pond water (n = 257) collected from three districts of West Bengal, India. In total, 57 isolates were MDR of which 38 emerged as extended spectrum and 7 as AmpC‐type β‐lactamase producers in phenotypic assay. Among β‐lactamase genes, blaCTXM‐1was predominant (87.71%) followed by blaAmpC (77.2%) and blaTEM‐1 (22.8%). Six MDR strains carried metallo‐β‐lactamase (MBL, blaNDM‐1) gene. Tissue culture plate assay confirmed strong biofilm (SP) production in four MDR and one non‐MDR isolates. In PCR‐based replicon typing (PBRT), multiple plasmids of diverse replicon types (Frep, FIB, I1, FIA, K/B, HI1, and Y) were identified. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus–polymerase chain reaction (ERIC‐PCR)‐based phylogenetic analysis revealed a high degree of genetic divergence among the MDR isolates. Multiplex PCR‐based phylogrouping categorized 11 isolates as virulent (B2/D/F), which carried blaCTXM‐1 gene and three had blaNDM‐1 gene. Relative transcriptional activity of AcrAB efflux pump was significantly elevated among the SP and MBL producers. The presence of MDR E. coli isolates, particularly those resistant to carbapenem, in pond water used for daily domestic and household work, is a cause of concern as these pathogens may sneak into human food chain causing life‐threatening infections. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Multidrug‐resistant biofilm producing E. coli isolated from community pond water. A few of them were carbapenem‐resistant and belonged to virulent (B2/D) types. Expression of AcrAB efflux pumps was found significantly elevated among biofilm producers and carbapenem‐resistant population.  aPublisher supplied data  cCAAST‐Advanced Centre for Livestock Health (ACLH)  cICAR‐World Bank  cNational Agricultural Higher Education Project (NAHEP) 3aEscherichia coli 3abiofilm 3acarbapenems 3aenvironment 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahuman food chain 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areplicon 3aresearch 3atissue culture 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 3avirulence 3awater 3aIndia1 aBanerjee, Jaydeep1 aHabib, Md1 aThapa, Geetanjali1 aSamanta, Indranil1 aNanda, Pramod Kumar1 aDutt, Triveni1 aSarkar, Keka1 aBandyopadhyay, Samiran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9529-57150 tWater environment research.g2022 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.e1678-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:21189x1061-43037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.16783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245016800153300001600321520185500337592002802192650001102220650002202231650001902253650001602272650001102288650001502299650001802314650001602332651000902348700002302357700002002380773010702400856003902507852000902546655001202555IND4465775220221120205155.0120315e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446577522DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.83012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Wenchao10aProspects for calibrating rainfall‐runoff models using satellite observations of river hydraulic variables as surrogates for in situ river discharge measurements  ap. 872-882.  aThe need for calibration limits the direct application of rainfall‐runoff (RR) models in ungauged basins. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for calibrating RR models using river hydraulic variables (river width or water surface elevation) that are observable by remote sensing. By integrating a RR model with at‐a‐station hydraulic geometry, using power functions to describe the cross‐sectional hydraulic relationship at the basin outlet, the simulated river width or water surface elevation become the output of the integrated model. The objective of the calibration is then shifted to minimizing the difference between the simulated values and the satellite measurements of the hydraulic variables. Correspondingly, the calibration process is carried out by tuning the RR model and power function parameters simultaneously. The HYdrological MODel (HYMOD) RR model and Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) multi‐objective optimization scheme were selected based on the characteristics of satellite observations. A proof‐of‐concept experiment was carried out for the Pakse gauging station in the Mekong Basin, southwest Laos. Discharge estimates with acceptable accuracy were obtained by calibration, using ground measurements of either river width or water surface elevation at the Pakse gauging station, under designed average and low satellite observation frequencies. From the results of the experiment, a higher observational frequency was found to be preferable for making more reliable estimations. Using ground measurements with the possible error of satellite observations as calibration data, the maximum uncertainty was less than 20% of the mean daily discharge at Pakse station. This conceptual framework can provide a new tool for improving river discharge estimation in large ungauged basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahydrologic models 3aremote sensing 3ariver water 3arivers 3asatellites 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3aLaos1 aIshidaira, Hiroshi1 aBastola, Satish0 tHydrological processes.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 26, no. 6 p.872-882dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8301  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245011600190300001400306500002000320520139900340592002801739650002101767650002101788650002201809650002001831650002001851650001801871650001501889650002601904650001901930650002101949650001301970650002801983650001602011650001802027650002702045650004202072650005002114650002102164650003202185650003102217650003102248650002002279650001002299650004502309650002202354650001402376650003102390650001602421700003402437700002002471700002102491773011602512852000902628856008902637655001202726IND4394743720221122130002.0210415e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439474372DNAL7 a178036402pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02152.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollén, Jonas10aResponse of the transcriptome of the intertidal red seaweed Chondrus crispus to controlled and natural stresses  ap. 45-55.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Intertidal seaweeds inhabit an inherently stressful environment with rapidly changing physical conditions with the turning tides. Many macroalgae are therefore very resistant to abiotic stress; however, the bases for this tolerance and the relative importance of different stressors are largely unknown. • Here, the effects of stress on the transcriptome of the red seaweed Chondrus crispus were investigated using cDNA microarrays. The responses were studied after exposure to high light, high temperature, and hypo‐ and hyperosmotic conditions in the laboratory and compared with gene expression in nature at different stress loads: at high and low tide at solar noon, and during a cloudy and a sunny day, respectively. • The study identifies key stress genes and marker genes for specific stressors. The data also provide an insight into the physiological effects of stress; for example, high light stress and high natural stress caused an increase in antioxidative proteins, suggesting an increased oxidative stress. • Clustering analysis suggested that osmotic stress modulated the gene expression in nature under high‐stress conditions and was thus the most significant natural stressor. The potential cross‐talk between stress reactions and methyl jasmonate‐induced responses was also investigated and is tentatively suggested to be mediated by reactive oxygen species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrus crispus 3acluster analysis 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amicroarray technology 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3atemperature 3atranscriptome 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aAlgal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChondrusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenetic Markers 2aLight 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOsmotic Pressure. 2aOxylipins 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aGuisle‐Marsollier, Isabelle1 aLéger, Jean J.1 aBoyen, Catherine0 tnew phytologist.g2007 Oct., v. 176, no. 1 p.45-55dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02152.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02278naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013800173300001600311520086800327592002801195650001501223650001601238650001401254650001001268650001301278650001201291650001901303650002101322650002401343650001701367650002201384650001101406650002501417650001901442653003001461653000901491653000801500653001401508653002401522653001001546700002101556773013501577856008701712852000901799655001201808IND60692555220221122225045.0200614e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069255522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahvand, Fatemeh10aMicrostructure and physical properties of thermoplastic corn starch foams as influenced by polyvinyl alcohol and plasticizer contents  ap. 359-367.  aThermoplastic starch (TPS) foams was prepared by melt extrusion process and the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and glycerol/water plasticizer contents on the physical and cellular properties of these foams were investigated.

The density of TPS foam decreased about 70%, and cell density increased up to 60-fold by adding 20% PVA. In addition to the positive effect of the PVA on improving processability and cellular uniformity, it also acted as a polymeric plasticizer and adding it allowed to decrease another low molecular weight plasticizer content in TPS/PVA blends. As a result by statistical analysis significant improvements in expansion ratio (256%), cell density (60 times), and lower moisture absorption (60%) were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acorn starch 3aextrusion 3afoams 3aglycerol 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3aphysical properties 3aplasticizers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astarch 3astatistical analysis 3athermoplastics 0aThermoplastic corn starch 0aFoam 0aPVA 0aExtrusion 0aCellular morphology 0aANOVA1 aFasihi, Mohammad0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.359-367dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.2223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245016600166500002000332520163200352592002801984596004402012596007602056650002102132650001502153650002502168650001602193650000902209650001402218650002102232650001302253650001302266650000902279650001602288650001002304700003402314700002302348700001602371700005502387773012202442856007302564852000902637655001202646IND60789098720221118170253.0220818e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078909872DNAL7 a10.1002/wer.16712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGevaerd de Souza, Naomi10aRemoval of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and water/soil slurry using Fe0‐modified reactive activated carbon conjugated with persulfate  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTreatment of highly persistent perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been a challenging but significant task. Herein, we propose adsorption‐mediated chemical decomposition of PFAS implemented by using granular activated carbon (GAC) impregnated with zerovalent nanoiron (ZVI, Fe⁰), so‐called reactive activated carbon (RAC). The effects of reaction temperature, injection of persulfate (PS), and presence of soil on removal of PFAS in water were evaluated. Results showed that RAC conjugated with PS at 60°C exhibited decomposition of PFAS, exclusively all three carboxylic PFAS tested, obviously producing various identifiable short‐chain PFAS. Carboxylic PFAS were removed via physical adsorption combined with chemical decomposition while sulfonic PFAS were removed via solely adsorption mechanism. The presence of soil particles did not greatly affect the overall removal of PFAS. Carbon mass balance suggested that chemical oxidation by radical mechanisms mutually influences, in a complex manner, PFAS adsorption to GAC, ZVI and its iron derivatives, and soil particles. Nonetheless, all tested six PFAS were removed significantly. If successfully developed, the adsorption‐mediated decomposition strategy may work for treatment of complex media containing PFAS and co‐contaminants under different environmental settings. PRACTITIONERS POINTS: Treatment of persistent per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) was addressed. Activated carbon with zerovalent iron was examined in the presence of persulfate. The system significantly removed and decomposed PFAS in water and soil mixture.  aPublisher supplied data  aER18‐1482cU.S. Department of Defense  cThe University of Texas at Arlington Interdisciplinary Research Program 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3achemical degradation 3aenvironment 3airon 3aoxidation 3aperfluorocarbons 3aresearch 3aslurries 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater1 aParenky, Akshay Chandrashekar1 aNguyen, Hiep Hoang1 aJeon, Junha1 aChoi, Hyeok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6313-13610 tWater environment research.g2022 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.e1671-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:21189x1061-43037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.16713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245011400129300001600243520074500259592002801004650001701032650001601049650000901065650001101074650001301085650001201098650000901110650001501119650001901134653001501153653001801168653001501186653002301201700002001224700002001244773015801264852000901422655001201431IND60705208520221122065937.0200731e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070520852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhapre, A.P.10aDevelopment of technology for preparation of fig (Ficus carica L.) fruit powder and its utilization in toffee  ap. 267-270.  aShort postharvest life and increased production necessitates development of non-conventional products from fresh fig (Ficus carica L.) fruits.

The glandular tissue is protruding out of the basal part of the receptacular tissue, but the apical part of the nectary is epimorphic. The glands can have various shapes if observed in the median longitudinal section of the flower and gland shapes are characteristic to the cultivars. The anisodiametrical cells of the nectarial epidermis are arranged in one or two rows. The surface of the nectary is covered by cuticle, the thickness of which depends on climatic conditions. Stomata of the nectary are mesoxeromorphic, the guard cells are sunken below the outer anticlinal wall of the epidermis cells. The investigated pear-shaped quince cultivars have more sunken stomata than the apple-shaped ones. Both the glandular tissue and the nectary parenchyma are the thickest on the basal part of the nectary, but taper on the apical part. The nectary parenchyma cells differ from the receptacular ones in shape and size. The phloem bundles, supplying the nectary, do not enter into direct contact with the secretory tissues.The morphological and histological differences that can be found between the nectary of cvs. ‘Konstantinápolyi’ and cvs. ‘Dunabogdányi’, as well as between the gland of the investigated apple-shaped cultivars and pear-shaped ones, can have taxonomic importance and could refer to the various degree of susceptibility of the cultivars to Erwinia amylovora .  aPublisher supplied data 3aErwinia amylovora 3acultivars 3adirect contact 3ahistology 3ahypanthium 3anectaries 3aphloem 3aquinces 0aCydonia oblonga 0aquince 0astoma 0anectary 0amorphology1 aOrosz-Kovács, Zs.1 aFarkas, Á.0 tActa botanica Hungarica.g2007 Sept. 1, v. 49, no. 3-4 p.359-375dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35629x1588-25787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/abot.49.2007.3-4.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010000169300001600269520086900285536012001154592002801274650003401302650002501336650001901361650001401380650000901394650001001403650003701413650001201450650001301462650001201475650001001487650001601497650001101513650001801524650001301542650001301555653001801568653001101586653001301597653002401610700001901634700002001653700002001673773013201693856008001825852000901905655001201914IND60615650820221117200959.0181011e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061565082DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387177015212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Lorelei L.10aAtypical cytologic presentation of a histiocytic sarcoma in a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog  ap. 541-543.  aA Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dog was presented because of a 10-d history of progressive vomiting, inappetence, and lethargy, with mild neurologic signs. Fine-needle aspirates of splenic nodules seen on ultrasound were suggestive of a carcinoma. On autopsy, a disseminated neoplasm was present in the lung, spleen, and adrenal glands. Additionally, there was a Chiari-like malformation of the skull with corresponding syringomyelia of the cranial spinal cord. Histologically, the neoplasm was comprised of a pleomorphic population of round cells with a high mitotic rate. Cells stained positive for vimentin and CD18 and negative for cytokeratin, chromogranin A, CD3, CD20, MHC II, and CD11d, and hence the tumor was diagnosed as a histiocytic sarcoma. The cytologic presentation in this case is uncommon for this type of tumor, as was the clinical presentation.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCavalier King Charles Spaniel 3aabnormal development 3aadrenal glands 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3alungs 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amitosis 3anecropsy 3asarcoma 3askull 3aspinal cord 3aspleen 3asyringomyelia 3avimentin 3avomiting 0aAdrenal gland 0acanine 0acytology 0ahistiocytic sarcoma1 aKelly, Lisa S.1 aGarner, Bridget1 aBrown, Cathy A.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.541-543dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387177015213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100005800157245006700215300001400282520130300296592002801599650001201627650001501639650001601654650001101670650001501681650001101696650001501707650001301722650001801735650001201753650002001765650001001785650001801795653001201813653001501825653001801840653001901858653002201877653001101899700001901910700001701929700002101946700002001967700002001987773010402007856009202111852000902203655001202212IND60571154320221118014119.0190412e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057115432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Orla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3371-328810aBenefits of dry comminution of biomass pellets in a knife mill  ap. 42-54.  aThe potential benefits of dry comminution in a knife mill for a diverse range of biomass pellets are explored. The impact of dry comminution on energy consumption, particle size and shape, is examined as well as the link between milling and mechanical durability. Biomass pellet comminution energy was significantly lower (19.3–32.5 kW h t−1 [fresh] and 17.8–23.2 kW h t−1 [dry]) than values reported in literature for non-densified biomass in similar knife mills. The impact of drying was found to vary by feedstock. Dry grinding reduced milling energy by 38% for mixed wood pellets, but only 2% for steam exploded pellets. Particle size and shape, particle distribution dispersion, and distribution shape parameters changes between fresh and dry milling were also material dependent. Von Rittinger analysis showed that to maximise mill throughput, pellets should be composed of particles which can pass through the screen and thus have a neutral size change. A strong correlation was found between pellet durability and energy consumption for fresh biomass pellets. Dry grinding has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption without compromising the product particle size, as well as enhancing product quality and optimising biomass pellet comminution and combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acombustion 3adry milling 3adrying 3adurability 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3agrinding 3aparticle size 3apellets 3aproduct quality 3asteam 3awood products 0aBiomass 0aKnife mill 0aParticle size 0aParticle shape 0aPellet durability 0aDrying1 aLester, Edward1 aKingman, Sam1 aGiddings, Donald1 aLormor, Stephen1 aEastwick, Carol0 tBiosystems engineering.g2017 Aug., v. 160 p.42-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245011600198300001400314520163700328592002801965650001601993650001402009650002102023650002202044650002202066650001402088650001502102650001602117650001402133650001302147700003102160700002202191700002302213700002602236773014902262856006802411856010302479990002302582852000902605655001202614IND60643321220221118002718.0190510e20111017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064332122DNAL7 a10.3791/32442doi7 aPMC32272102pmcid7 a220251072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachu, Ravichandra10aMonitoring equilibrium changes in rna structure by 'peroxidative' and 'oxidative' hydroxyl radical footprinting  ap. e3244.  aRNA molecules play an essential role in biology. In addition to transmitting genetic information, RNA can fold into unique tertiary structures fulfilling a specific biologic role as regulator, binder or catalyst. Information about tertiary contact formation is essential to understand the function of RNA molecules. Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are unique probes of the structure of nucleic acids due to their high reactivity and small size.1 When used as a footprinting probe, hydroxyl radicals map the solvent accessible surface of the phosphodiester backbone of DNA1 and RNA2 with as fine as single nucleotide resolution. Hydroxyl radical footprinting can be used to identify the nucleotides within an intermolecular contact surface, e.g. in DNA-protein1 and RNA-protein complexes. Equilibrium3 and kinetic4 transitions can be determined by conducting hydroxyl radical footprinting as a function of a solution variable or time, respectively. A key feature of footprinting is that limited exposure to the probe (e.g., 'single-hit kinetics') results in the uniform sampling of each nucleotide of the polymer.5 In this video article, we use the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena ribozyme to illustrate RNA sample preparation and the determination of a Mg(II)-mediated folding isotherms. We describe the use of the well known hydroxyl radical footprinting protocol that requires H2O2 (we call this the 'peroxidative' protocol) and a valuable, but not widely known, alternative that uses naturally dissolved O2 (we call this the 'oxidative' protocol). An overview of the data reduction, transformation and analysis procedures is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrahymena 3acatalysts 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amagnesium 3amonitoring 3anucleotides 3aribozymes 3asolvents1 aPadlan, Frances-Camille S.1 aRouhanifard, Sara1 aBrenowitz, Michael1 aSchlatterer, Jörg C.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 Oct. 17, , no. 56 p.e3244-e3244dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/32443Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3244/monitoring-equilibrium-changes-rna-structure-peroxidative-oxidative  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245018700192300001600379500002000395520139700415592002801812650001601840650001001856650002001866650002501886650001701911650003001928650001901958650001901977650002201996650001702018650002102035650002202056650002702078650003502105650004902140650005902189650001702248650003802265650002002303650005402323650002502377650005102402650003302453650003102486650003202517650002702549700002102576700002602597773011802623852000902741856008902750655001202839IND4399270220221122125951.0210417e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439927022DNAL7 a180282992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02261.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuh‐Shuh10aImproved imaging of actin filaments in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a green fluorescent protein fusion to the C‐ and N‐termini of the fimbrin actin‐binding domain 2  ap. 525-536.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• The role of the actin cytoskeleton in plant development is intimately linked to its dynamic behavior. Therefore it is essential to continue refining methods for studying actin organization in living plant cells. The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) has popularized the use of translational fusions of GFP with actin filament (F‐actin) side‐binding proteins to visualize in vivo actin organization in plants. The most recent of these live cell F‐actin reporters are GFP fusions to the actin‐binding domain 2 (ABD2) of Arabidopsis fimbrin 1 (ABD2‐GFP). • To improve ABD2‐GFP fluorescence for enhanced in vivo F‐actin imaging, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated expressing a construct with GFP fused to both the C‐ and N‐termini of ABD2 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (35S::GFP‐ABD2‐GFP). The 35S::GFP‐ABD2‐GFP lines had significantly increased fluorescence compared with the original 35S::ABD2‐GFP lines. • The enhanced fluorescence of the 35S::GFP‐ABD2‐GFP‐expressing lines allowed the acquisition of highly resolved images of F‐actin in different plant organs and stages of development because of the reduced confocal microscope excitation settings needed for data collection. • This simple modification to the ABD2‐GFP construct presents an important tool for studying actin function during plant development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aactin 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimage analysis 3amicrofilaments 3aplant development 3aplant organs 3apromoter regions 3atransgenic plants 3atranslation (genetics) 2aActinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytoskeleton 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMeristemxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSeedlingsxmetabolism.1 aYoo, Cheol‐Min1 aBlancaflor, Elison B.0 tnew phytologist.g2008 Jan., v. 177, no. 2 p.525-536dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02261.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01920naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245008300162300001600245520077900261592002801040650001101068650001501079650001101094650001101105650001501116650001001131650001001141651001201151653007901163653002201242653001501264653002901279653002201308773012301330856008401453852000901537655001201546IND60775671620221119090620.0220427e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077567162DNAL7 a10.1556/abot.50.2008.3-4.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMate, A.10aConsolido regalis-Polygonetum arenastri in segetal fields of Baranja (Croatia)  ap. 363-383.  aIn this work the weed vegetation of cereals is described on the basis of 204 coenological records in Croatian Baranja.

Radiographs revealed a soft tissue mass extending from the mid-femur into the body wall. Cytology of a sample obtained from a fine-needle aspirate was unremarkable. The bird was prepared for surgical investigation of the mass but died acutely at the time of pre-medication. Autopsy revealed an extradural mesenchymal neoplasm that focally compressed the lumbar spinal cord, extended into and along the adjacent nerve structures, and displaced the kidneys, skeletal muscle, and body wall. Histopathology was consistent with a perineurioma, which was positive for alcian blue and negative for S100, GLUT1, and neurofilament proteins on immunohistochemistry. PCR testing of tumor tissue was negative for gallid herpesvirus 2 (Marek’s disease virus) and avian leukosis virus. Although the etiology of the mass was not determined, our case highlights a severe manifestation of an uncommonly diagnosed tumor in the chicken. Though uncommon, perineurioma should be considered a differential diagnosis for lameness in the chicken.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 2 3anecropsy 3acell biology 3ajuveniles 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aneoplasms 3askeletal muscle 3aspinal cord 3ahindlimbs 3aradiography 3apolymerase chain reaction 3alameness 3apets 3akidneys 3aintegument 3ahistopathology 3aAvian leukosis virus 3achickens 3aetiology 3aproteins 3anerve tissue 0aGallid herpesvirus 2 0aperineurioma 0apoultry 0aChickens1 aBlas-Machado, Uriel1 aMayer, Joerg0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.557-560dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387177029363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003900113040001800152100002400170245014000194300001600334520173400350592002802084650001702112650002702129650002802156650002102184650001602205650001602221650001202237650001702249650001802266651001202284700002202296700002202318773010202340852000902442856011202451856008602563961001302649655001202662IND4456957420221118033948.0200517e20030701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445695742DNAL7 a10113/494912hdl7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-42-4-324.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeblond, Jeffrey D.14aThe biochemistry of dinoflagellate lipids, with particular reference to the fatty acid and sterol composition of a Karenia brevis bloom  ap. 324-331.  aThe harmful marine dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis (Dinophyceae), frequently forms large toxic blooms in the waters off the west coast of Florida (USA) and is responsible for massive fish kills and public health concerns. Despite decades of field studies on this organism, no investigation has yet characterized the lipid composition of a K. brevis bloom. To address this lack of information, samples from a 1999 K. brevis bloom from the north-west Florida coast were analysed for their fatty acid and sterol composition. Fatty acids found in different lipid fractions containing membrane phospholipids, chloroplast-associated glycolipids or storage triglycerides differed significantly. The glycolipid fraction was found to contain octadecapentaenoic acid [18:5(n-3)], a fatty acid commonly associated with dinoflagellates. The phospholipid fraction was found to contain small amounts of two recently described, highly unsaturated fatty acids, octacosaoctaenoic acid [28:8(n-3)] and octacosaheptaenoic acid [28:7(n-6)]. Fatty acids from the triglyceride fraction were more abundant than those associated with glycolipids or phospholipids. Sterols were found mainly as free sterols and were dominated by two compounds, (24S)-4α-methyl-5α-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-3β-ol and its 27-nor derivative. The lipid composition of these samples very closely resembles laboratory-grown cultures of K. brevis and serves to provide an in situ field validation of past laboratory examinations of this organism. The implications of our data are discussed in the context of the physiological autecology of K. brevis, in the form of a mini review on the biochemistry of dinoflagellate lipids, as studied in both the laboratory and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3afatty acid composition 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3atriacylglycerols 3aglycolipids 3aDinophyceae 3asterols 3achloroplasts 3aphospholipids 3aFlorida1 aEvans, Terence J.1 aChapman, Peter J.0 tPhycologia.g2003 July 1, v. 42, no. 4 p.324-331dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/494913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-42-4-324.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01884naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009100173300001600264500002900280520071100309592002801020650001601048650001301064650002101077650002101098650002001119650002001139651001101159653003501170653001101205653003601216700002601252700003001278773010901308856008401417852000901501655001201510IND60688872520221117182852.0200417e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068887252DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2014.8999962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsourtou, Vasiliki10aAction research with children and adolescents working on the streets of Athens, Greece  ap. 313-326.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aIn fieldwork with children and adolescents working on the streets of Athens, Greece, the authors applied a multidisciplinary methodology, through which participants were empowered to articulate their own voice.

The two main limitations which prevent smaller feature sizes of hydrogel structures are (1) the upper glass layer of a microchip maintains a large spacing (typically 525 μm) between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, leading to diffraction of UV light at the edges of mask patterns, (2) diffusion of free radicals and monomers results in irregular polymerization near the illumination interface. In this work, we present a simple approach to enable the use of optical lithography to fabricate hydrogel arrays with a minimum feature size of 4 μm inside closed microchips. To achieve this, we combined two different techniques. First, the upper glass layer of the microchip was thinned by mechanical polishing to reduce the spacing between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, and thereby the diffraction of UV light at the edges of mask patterns. The polishing process reduces the upper layer thickness from ∼525 to ∼100 μm, and the mean surface roughness from 20 to 3 nm. Second, we developed an intermittent illumination technique consisting of short illumination periods followed by relatively longer dark periods, which decrease the diffusion of monomers. Combination of these two methods allows for fabrication of 0.4 × 10⁶ sub-10 μm sized hydrogel patterns over large areas (cm²) with high reproducibility (∼98.5% patterning success). The patterning method is tested with two different types of photopolymerizing hydrogels: polyacrylamide and polyethylene glycol diacrylate. This method enables in situ fabrication of well-defined hydrogel patterns and presents a simple approach to fabricate 3-D hydrogel matrices for biomolecule separation, biosensing, tissue engineering, and immobilized protein microarray applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3afree radicals 3aglass 3ahydrogels 3alighting 3amicroarray technology 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asurface roughness 3atissue engineering 3aultraviolet radiation1 aBomer, Johan

Among them, two were purified by silica gel and ODS column chromatography and preparative HPLC and were identified as 2ʹ,3,4,4ʹ,6ʹ-pentamethoxychalcone and 2ʹ-hydroxy-3,4,4ʹ,6ʹ-tetramethoxychalcone by spectroscopic analyses. The remaining compound was determined as 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), a major oxylipin in plants, by comparing its spectrum and retention time from LC-MS/MS analysis with those of the authentic compound. The accumulation of these compounds was reproduced in leaves inoculated with Bipolaris sorokiniana, the causal agent of spot blotch of the Poaceae species. This inoculation increased the amounts of other oxylipins, including jasmonic acid (JA), JA-Ile, 9-oxooctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid (9-KODE), and 13-oxooctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid (13-KODE). The treatments of the barley leaves with JA and OPDA induced the accumulation of methoxylchalcones, but treatment with 9-KODE did not. These methoxylchalcones inhibited conidial germination of B. sorokiniana and Fusarium graminearum, thereby indicating that these compounds possessed antifungal activity. Consequently, they are considered to be involved in the chemical defense processes as phytoalexins in barley. Accumulation of methoxylchalcones in response to JA treatment was observed in all seven barley cultivars tested, but was not detected in other wild Hordeum species, wheat, and rice, thus indicating that their production was specific to cultivated barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aFusarium graminearum 3aHordeum vulgare 3aantifungal properties 3abarley 3achemical defenses 3achromatography 3aconidia 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3agermination 3ainfection 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3aoxylipins 3apathogens 3aphytoalexins 3aplant biochemistry 3arice 3asilica gel 3aspectral analysis 3awheat 0aHordeum vulgare 0aPoaceae 0aPhytoalexin 0aMethoxylchalcone 0aFlavonoid 0aPathogen infection1 aKatsuyama, Yuhka1 aKariya, Keisuke1 aTebayashi, Shin-ichi1 aSue, Masayuki1 aTohnooka, Takuji1 aUeno, Kotomi1 aTaketa, Shin1 aIshihara, Atsushi0 tPhytochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 184 p.112650-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1126503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010800169300001800277520128400295592002801579650001401607650002801621650001301649650001301662650001701675650002701692650001801719650000901737650002201746650002601768650001901794650001901813700002201832700002201854700001801876700001801894700002901912700002201941700002601963773010801989856008402097852000902181655001202190IND60533372220171127000000.0160731e20151214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053337222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.5b011262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaez, Julieta
I.10aGauging and Tuning Cross-Linking Kinetics of Catechol-PEG Adhesives via Catecholamine Functionalization  ap. 3811-3818.  aThe curing time of an adhesive material is determined by the polymerization and cross-linking kinetics of the adhesive formulation and needs to be optimized for the particular application. Here, we explore the possibility of tuning the polymerization kinetics and final mechanical properties of tissue-adhesive PEG gels formed by polymerization of end-functionalized star-PEGs with catecholamines with varying substituents. We show strong differences in cross-linking time and cohesiveness of the final gels among the catecholamine-PEG variants. Installation of an electron-withdrawing but π-electron donating chloro substituent on the catechol ring resulted in faster and more efficient cross-linking, while opposite effects were observed with the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. Chain substitution slowed down the kinetics and hindered cross-linking due either to chain breakdown (β-OH group, in norepinephrine) or intramolecular cyclization (α-carboxyl group, in DOPA). Interesting perspectives derive from use of mixtures of catecholamine-PEG precursors offering further opportunities for fine-tuning of the curing parameters. These are interesting properties for the application of catecholamine-PEG gels as tissue glues or biomaterials for cell encapsulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3abiocompatible materials 3acatechol 3acohesion 3acrosslinking 3adihydroxyphenylalanine 3aencapsulation 3agels 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amechanical properties 3anorepinephrine 3apolymerization1 aUstahüseyin, Oya1 aSerrano, Cristina1 aTon, Xuan-Anh1 aShafiq, Zahid1 aAuernhammer, Günter K.,1 ad’Ischia, Marco1 aCampo, Aránzazu del,0 tBiomacromolecules.g2015 Dec. 14, v. 16, no. 12 p.3811-3818dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.5b011263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001600291520197700307592002802284650001402312650001702326650001902343650001302362650001502375650001802390650002002408650001602428650001802444650001202462650001402474650003602488650002902524650002202553651001002575653001802585653001802603653002802621653002102649653001402670700002102684773014102705856008102846852000902927655001202936IND60570841320221120075013.0190426e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057084132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jef.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanama, Daisuke14aThe effects of ingredient branding in the food industry: case studies on successful ingredient-branded foods in Japan  ap. 126-131.  aMuch of the previous literature argues that innovation activities are not as active in the food industry as in other industries. In particular, scholars have noted that research and development intensity in the food manufacturing industry is lower than in other industries. However, recent years have witnessed the development of strategies in which new ingredients, technologies, and designs are used in branded end products.Defining such products as ingredient-branded foods (IBFs), this study clarifies the processes and effects of ingredient branding strategies in the Japanese food industry. We classified the 105 IBFs cases into six product categories that included confection and dessert, drinks, seasonings, preservative foods, dairy products, and agriculture products. By organizing the key IB feature, we also classified them into four IB categories of health and functionality, manufacturing and processing, producer and geographical indication, and packaging. In addition, we extract various types of intellectual property related to ingredient-branded foods and analyze them.The manufacturing and processing category for IBFs has the most cases, at 40.5% of the total, while health and functionality is the second largest as 30.6%. However, each product category has its own distribution range. In the confection and dessert category, manufacturing and processing is the largest. The categories of seasonings and preservative foods also have many IB cases involved with manufacturing and processing. Products with strong health functionalities stand out in the recent drink market. A similar tendency has been witnessed in agriculture products.From the analysis, we conclude that many IBFs have been already introduced to the market and they have diversified in different product categories. IBFs based on manufacturing technologies and healthcare have been popular approaches, but we also find IBFs with new packaging designs and geographical identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3acase studies 3adairy products 3adesserts 3aflavorings 3afood industry 3ahealth services 3aingredients 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3apackaging 3aprotected designation of origin 3aresearch and development 3atraditional foods 3aJapan 0afood industry 0afunctionality 0ageographical indication 0aingredient brand 0apackaging1 aNakazawa, Narumi0 tJournal of ethnic foods.g2017 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.126-131dElsevier B.V.aKorea Food Research InstitutewJournal:23306x2352-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jef.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245014100131300001600272520090400288592002801192650002401220650002001244650001001264650001501274650001801289650002001307650001301327650001501340650002401355650001301379650001601392653001201408653003101420700001801451700001801469773015801487852000901645655001201654IND60705209120221120095245.0200731e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070520912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, R.H.14aThe effect of stage of ripening on the shelf life of tomatoes (Lycopersi conesculentum) stored in the evaporative cooling system (E.C.S)  ap. 299-301.  aThe research was carried out for a period of 3 weeks on the storability of tomatoes at three different stages of ripening (i.e. matured green stage, half ripe and fully ripe). They were sub divided into two equal sets each, one was kept at room temperature (between 28–30°C) in the laboratory as the control while the second set stored in the ECS at a temperature between 19–23°C. Parameters like percent rot, physical appearance and percent weight loss were assessed at 3 days interval, Tomatoes stored in the ECS had lower reduction in weight while remaining fresh but with higher percent rot. Tomatoes stored at room temperature recorded higher weight loss while recording lower percentage rot with a bad appearance.

Of the 85 Virginia opossums identified from the UTCVM case database, there were 17 diagnoses of neoplasia from 12 cases (14%). These cases included 8 females, 2 males, and 2 neutered males. All opossums with known ages (11 of 12) were >2 y old. Pulmonary tumors, specifically minimally invasive or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinomas, were the most common diagnosis and accounted for 53% (9 of 17) of the neoplasms. Additional tumors included acute myeloid leukemia with eosinophil maturation, hepatic hemangiosarcoma, sarcoma (unknown origin), squamous cell carcinoma, disseminated mast cell tumor, trichoblastoma, thyroid adenoma, and an osteoma. These findings serve as a reference for the types of spontaneous neoplasms in Virginia opossums; based on these findings, neoplasia should be considered as a differential in mature captive Virginia opossums.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidelphis virginiana 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadenoma 3adatabases 3afemales 3ahemangiosarcoma 3alung neoplasms 3amales 3amast cells 3amyeloid leukemia 3aopossums 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3aveterinary medicine 3aTennessee 0aCancer 0aDidelphis virginiana 0amarsupial 0aneoplasia 0aVirginia opossums1 aDonnell, Robert L.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 29, no. 3 p.331-337dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387177040173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245018200163300001600345520117200361592002801533650001801561650002201579650001301601650001101614650001001625650001101635651001201646653001701658653001501675653002901690653001801719653003201737700001301769700001901782700001301801700001301814700001101827773012301838856008401961852000902045655001202054IND60775672220221119090702.0220427e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077567222DNAL7 a10.1556/abot.54.2012.3-4.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatra, B.10aMorpho-anatomy of Xerephedromiya ustjurtensis (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) induced galls and intersexual variation of gall density in Ephedra distachya L.

The gall midge, Xerephedromyia ustjurtensis Fedotova (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) induces both types of gall formation. Galls are persistent resinous stem swellings usually subglobular and rarely fusiform in shape. Mature galls are solid, hard, indehiscent woody structure with many circular exit holes on their surface. Galls are anatomically similar, but different from the unaffected stems. The mean number of larval cavities varied significantly between subglobular and fusiform galls, while variation of diameter of the larval cavities was not significant between the gall morphotypes. We documented significant (p < 0.05) variation in total gall densities between sexes of Ephedra distachya, where male plants (mean = 0.89 ± 0.15) supporting higher gall densities than females (mean = 0.36±0.04).

Sucrose, tryptone and initial pH were found to be the most significant parameter (P < 0.05) for levan production. Result showed that the optimum condition was sucrose 162.5 g/L, tryptone 10 g/L, initial pH 7 and maximum yield was 7.9 ± 0.18 g/L in 72 h fermentation. Purified levan was characterized using various physicochemical techniques such as GC–MS, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR spectroscopy and SEC/TDA. Based on this data, the structure of levan was independent of initial culture conditions. The biomedical potential of the isolated Bacillus subtilis A17 levan for its angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition activities was exploited in vitro. Interestingly, levan possessed an important angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory 81.1 ± 4.1% at 4 mg/mL. The overall, data suggested that levan presents a promising natural source of antihypertensive agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aantihypertensive agents 3acarbon 3aenzyme inhibition 3aexperimental design 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alevan 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3astable isotopes 3asucrose 3atryptones 0aOptimization 0aResponse surface methodology 0aBacillus subtilis AF17 0aBiological activity1 aCasillo, Angela1 aChaari, Fatma1 aCimini, Donatella1 aCorsaro, Maria Michela1 aBachoual, Rafik1 aEllouz-Chaabouni, Semia0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 158 p.945-952dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.2323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010900155500002000264520137000284592002801654596009701682596001801779650002101797650001001818650000901828650001601837650001601853650001101869650000901880650001301889650001101902650001101913650001501924650001801939650001801957700006801975700001802043773012202061856007302183852000902256655001202265IND60789099620221118170416.0220818e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078909962DNAL7 a10.1002/wer.16752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Erika10aEscherichia coli levels and microbial source tracking in stormwater retention ponds and detention basins  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLittle is known about the spatial and temporal changes that occur with Escherichia coli in urban stormwater systems. The goal of this project was to assess E. coli in urban stormwater detention basins and retention ponds, not connected to the sewer system, to determine temporal and spatial differences and evaluate the sources of E. coli utilizing microbial source tracking (MST). Surface water quality was sampled at three detention basins and five retention ponds during major storm events in the summers of 2018 and 2019. One week after each storm, groundwater and surface water were sampled. The MST samples were taken from storm events and normal flows, for both surface and groundwater. E. coli levels were higher during rain events in both detention basins and retention ponds and infrequently met a recreational standard. E. coli in groundwater was pervasive and infrequently met a recreational standard. The MST analysis found sewage, dog, human, and bird markers during storm events and sewage and bird markers during regular flows. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Rain events had significantly more E. coli than during normal flows in both retention ponds and detention basins. E. coli in groundwater was ubiquitous and fluctuates over time. Microbial source tracking (MST) found bird, dog, human, and sewage markers present during all storm events analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data  aND02396cUnited States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  cCity of Fargo 3aEscherichia coli 3abirds 3adogs 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3arain 3aresearch 3asewage 3astorms 3astormwater 3asurface water 3awater quality1 aHargiss, Christina L.

The modeling approach is novel for this shallow estuary which experiences heavily managed freshwater inflow known to be an ecological stressor to the estuary's oysters. The aims of the study were to (1) determine the ABM's accuracy in simulating larval dispersal patterns when compared with measured in situ larval settlement data; (2) establish connectivity patterns between various oyster reefs within the estuary; and (3) discover larval transport pathways within the Charlotte Harbor estuarine system. Key characteristics of the ABM, in particular the agents serving as simulated larvae, include settlement behavior and salinity tolerance and associated mortality. The ABM accurately recreated larval dispersal patterns during the peak spawning season, providing fundamental insight into the importance of protecting the furthest upstream oyster reef as a sustained larval source to the downstream reefs. Thus, supporting the effectiveness of using field measurements for the validation of ABMs and subsequently using ABM simulations to bolster future field studies. Ultimately, this study provides an effective, generally applicable, approach to model larval ecology for restoration purposes.  aPublisher supplied data  cFGCU Graduate Studies Fellowship  cFGCU Whitaker Center Blair Summer Research Scholarship 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aecological restoration 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3alarvae 3amodels 3amortality 3aoysters 3arivers 3asalt tolerance 3aFlorida1 aJose, Felix1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-09501 aRichard, Joëlle1 aMortensen, Jonas Brandi1 aMilbrandt, Eric C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1998-70550 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.e13487-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04482naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010300179500001900282520240900301592002802710650002502738650002102763650001902784650002502803650001802828650001902846650002302865650002002888650002302908650002802931650001702959650002202976650002002998650001503018650001603033650001803049650001403067650002603081650002603107650001503133650001103148650000903159650001903168650001703187650001403204650001503218650001603233651001103249653001603260653003403276653001503310653002903325653002903354700003003383700001903413700002003432700002603452700001903478700001703497700002203514700002003536773011903556856008803675852000903763655001203772IND60702563220221122110640.0201223e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070256322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1407722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerra, Anne-Antonella10aLocal-scale dynamics of plant-pesticide interactions in a northern Brittany agricultural landscape  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil pollution by anthropogenic chemicals is a major concern for sustainability of crop production and of ecosystem functions mediated by natural plant biodiversity. Understanding the complex effects of soil pollution requires multi-level and multi-scale approaches. Non-target and agri-environmental plant communities of field margins and vegetative filter strips are confronted with agricultural xenobiotics through soil contamination, drift, run-off and leaching events that result from chemical applications. Plant-pesticide dynamics in vegetative filter strips was studied at field scale in the agricultural landscape of a long-term ecological research network in northern Brittany (France). Vegetative filter strips effected significant pesticide abatement between the field and riparian compartments. However, comparison of pesticide usage modalities and soil chemical analysis revealed the extent and complexity of pesticide persistence in fields and vegetative filter strips, and suggested the contribution of multiple sources (yearly carry-over, interannual persistence, landscape-scale contamination). In order to determine the impact of such persistence, plant dynamics was followed in experimentally-designed vegetative filter strips of identical initial composition (Agrostis stolonifera, Anthemis tinctoria/Cota tinctoria, Centaurea cyanus, Fagopyrum esculentum, Festuca rubra, Lolium perenne, Lotus corniculatus, Phleum pratense, Trifolium pratense). After homogeneous vegetation establishment, experimental vegetative filter strips underwent rapid changes within the following two years, with Agrostis stolonifera, Festuca rubra, Lolium perenne and Phleum pratense becoming dominant and with the establishment of spontaneous vegetation. Co-inertia analysis showed that plant dynamics and soil residual pesticides could be significantly correlated, with the triazole fungicide epoxiconazole, the imidazole fungicide prochloraz and the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam as strong drivers of the correlation. However, the correlation was vegetative-filter-strip-specific, thus showing that correlation between plant dynamics and soil pesticides likely involved additional factors, such as threshold levels of residual pesticides. This situation of complex interactions between plants and soil contamination is further discussed in terms of agronomical, environmental and health issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aCentaurea cyanus 3aCota tinctoria 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aFestuca rubra 3aLolium perenne 3aLotus corniculatus 3aPhleum pratense 3aTrifolium pratense 3aagricultural landscapes 3abiodiversity 3achemical analysis 3acrop production 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aepoxiconazole 3aimidazole 3apesticide application 3apesticide persistence 3aprochloraz 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3athiamethoxam 3atriazoles 3avegetation 3axenobiotics 3aFrance 0aEcotoxicity 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aPesticides 0aPlant community dynamics 0aVegetative filter strips1 aBittebière, Anne-Kristel1 aMony, Cendrine1 aSlimani, Kahina1 aPallois, Frédérique1 aRenault, David1 aCouée, Ivan1 aGouesbet, Gwenola1 aSulmon, Cécile0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 744 p.140772-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1407723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162520101700270592002801287650001101315650001501326650001501341650002501356650001701381650002601398650004301424650001001467650001201477650003101489650001701520650003301537650001101570653001301581653001701594653002101611653001701632700005501649700001301704700001801717700001401735700001301749773012201762856008101884852000901965655001201974IND60676562420221120111327.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067656242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aMethod for identifying acacia honey adulterated by resin absorption: HPLC-ECD coupled with chemometrics  aHoney adulteration is a general safety and quality concern. Resin technology, as a new kind of adulteration, could remove or reduce harmful substances in honey to create substandard honey, which would enable substandard products to enter the market. Thus, it is urgently important to identify such adulterated products. In this work, raw acacia honey treated with macroporous adsorption resins (MARs) was distinguished by HPLC-ECD coupled with chemometrics. The physicochemical characterization of raw acacia honey and acacia honey treated with resins were analyzed. Furthermore, the chromatography fingerprints of honey samples were established, and samples were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The results indicated that raw acacia honey could be distinguished from the resin-treated honey. In summary, adulteration of acacia honey with resin technology could be detected by HPLC-ECD combined with chemometrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aadulterated products 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahoney 3amarkets 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporous media 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresins 0aHPLC-ECD 0aAdulteration 0aResin adsorption 0aAcacia honey1 aZhao, Haoan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7071-93851 aZhu, Min1 aZhang, Jinjin1 aCheng, Ni1 aCao, Wei0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 118 p.108863-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1088633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245009400198500002000292520166300312592002801975650001402003650002402017650001202041650001102053650001202064650001002076650002702086650001502113650002402128650001302152650001702165650001102182650001802193650001902211650002702230651002202257700006002279700002202339700001802361700001902379700002102398700002502419700001902444700002202463700002802485773012202513856007402635852000902709655001202718IND60764244920221116172010.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424492DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasoli, Edoardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3128-894610aRehabilitation of Mediterranean animal forests using gorgonians from fisheries by‐catch  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe assessment of effective and affordable restoration interventions is pivotal to developing new tools to mitigate habitat loss and enhance natural recovery. Gorgonians create important three‐dimensional habitats in the Mediterranean Sea providing several ecosystem services associated with coralligenous reefs. Transplantations of the octocorals Eunicella cavolini, Eunicella singularis, and Paramuricea clavata were carried out at the site impacted by the wreck of the Costa Concordia in 2012. A total of 135 by‐caught gorgonians, caught in the gears of local artisanal fishermen or found lying on the seabed by SCUBA divers, were transplanted on impacted coralligenous reefs between 20 and 35 m depth and monitored for 2.5 years. A high survival rate (82.1%) was recorded, with main losses attributable to the detachment of the organisms from the substrate rather than death of the colonies. Eunicella cavolini transplanted colonies and natural colonies used as controls were monitored and showed similar, and seasonally influenced, growth and healing rates. Epibiosis and necrosis events were reported in both transplanted and natural colonies during summer, highlighting the sensitivity of the species to thermal stress. The present study emphasizes the importance of a management framework as a stepping‐stone to achieve effective restoration outcomes, including the removal of pressures that caused changes in natural communities and the participation of local stakeholders. The effectiveness of the methods and procedures proposed in this work allowed the restoration activities to continue at a larger scale during summer and autumn 2020.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEunicella 3aParamuricea clavata 3aanimals 3aautumn 3abycatch 3adeath 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3ahabitat destruction 3anecrosis 3astakeholders 3asummer 3asurvival rate 3athermal stress 3atraditional technology 3aMediterranean Sea1 aVentura, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3548-360X1 aMancini, Gianluca1 aCardone, Sara1 aFarina, Fulvia1 aDonnini, Lorenzo1 aPace, Daniela Silvia1 aShaul, Richard1 aBelluscio, Andrea1 aArdizzone, Giandomenico0 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.e13465-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245009100156300001600247500002000263520112600283592002801409650001301437650001201450650001901462650001601481650002501497650001501522650002801537650002101565651001501586700006301601700001801664773012301682856007201805852000901877655001201886IND60743208420221121092344.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074320842DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.25582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikka, A.

Without major intervention, this is expected to be further exacerbated by growing demand and climate change. Groundwater management, scientific and evidence‐based, can make an important contribution to managing unsustainable groundwater use and strengthening the climate resilience of farmers due to groundwater's unique storage characteristics. This study brings together a set of strategies and solutions to better manage groundwater that cover the augmentation of groundwater recharge through managed aquifer recharge, management of groundwater demand through participatory groundwater management and other methods, and the harnessing synergies of co‐dependent sectors. The opportunities, constraints and available evidence for each are analysed and the boundaries, barriers and specificities identified to establish entry points for positive change through policies and implementation programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3airrigation 3asustainable agriculture 3awater management 3aSouth Asia1 aAlam, Mohammad Faiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5600-61081 aPavelic, Paul0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2021 July, v. 70, no. 3 p.560-573dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl69714x1531-03537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.25583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245005400162500002000216520157100236592002801807596003601835596001101871596006401882650001701946650002301963650002001986650003802006650001202044650001202056650001702068650002302085650002002108650000902128650001802137650002002155650001702175650001002192651001102202700006002213700002502273700002102298773012602319856007502445852000902520655001202529IND60790397120221118222218.0220824s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079039712DNAL7 a10.1002/cft2.200062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatteau, Caroline10aSudangrass as companion crop to establish alfalfa  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen establishing alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), the use of companion crops often suppresses weed growth and increases harvestable forage biomass. In Quebec, small‐grain cereals are traditionally used as companion crops, but the use of other recently introduced species such as sudangrass [Sorghum × drummondii (Nees ex. Steud.) Millsp. & Chase] has not yet been evaluated. This project was conducted to evaluate the impact of sudangrass, annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lamarck), and oat (Avena sativa L.) used as companion crops on alfalfa establishment, forage yield, forage quality, and persistence. When sown in June, sudangrass used as a companion crop may result in higher forage yields in the sowing year than other species. Moreover, sudangrass was less competitive overall with alfalfa than annual ryegrass, resulting in higher alfalfa yields and limited impact on alfalfa stand density. However, when weed pressure was high, sudangrass appeared to have lower weed suppression potential than other species. Alfalfa established with sudangrass produced forage with a similar nutritive value to alfalfa established with oat or annual ryegrass when sudangrass was planted in May but lower nutritive value than with annual ryegrass or solo‐sown alfalfa when sudangrass was planted in June. The effects of companion crops on alfalfa yields in the post‐sowing year were minimal overall. The results apply to the specific sowing rates used here and further studies should evaluate the performance of each companion crop at a wider range of sowing rates.  aPublisher supplied data  cBelisle Solution Nutrition Inc.  cMitacs  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aAvena sativa 3aLolium multiflorum 3aMedicago sativa 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aalfalfa 3abiomass 3aforage yield 3aintroduced species 3anutritive value 3aoats 3astand density 3aturf management 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aQuebec1 aSeguin, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7737-76211 aBaurhoo, Bushansingh1 aMustafa, Arif F.0 tCrop, forage & turfgrass management.g2020, v. 6, no. 1 p.e20006-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27125x2374-38327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cft2.200063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245014400210500001900354520167500373592002802048650001302076650001102089650000802100650002502108650001702133650001902150650002002169651001402189653001402203653002202217653002402239653002602263653002402289700002302313700006002336773011502396856008302511852000902594655001202603IND60723195920221116222418.0210421e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072319592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1016102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4949-690310aShallow larval depth-distribution and life history characteristics of the tropical congrid eel Ariosoma scheelei in the Northwest Coral Sea  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSmall-sized eels of the Tropical Conger, Ariosoma scheelei, appear to be common in shallow Indo-Pacific tropical sheltered-bay and lagoon-type habitats when they are sampled appropriately and their larvae are abundant offshore of these areas, but little is known about their biology. Collections of about 7800 likely A. scheelei larvae in May 1997 using a 2-mm mesh 70 m² mouth-opening trawl with a multiple opening-and-closing codend system at 13 Northwest Coral Sea (NWCS) areas (5 upper-200 m sampling depth-layers, 2 nighttime trawl-deployments/area) and a surface net were used to examine the vertical and geographic distributions of abundance and size of the leptocephali and metamorphosing larvae. 76.5% of trawl-caught A. scheelei leptocephali (33–169 mm, 95.3 ± 22.9 mm) were collected in the 0–12 m depth-layer and 927 (43–151 mm, 83.6 ± 19.5 mm) were examined from surface catches. Some larvae were caught at 12–25 m (12.3%) and 25–50 m (10.1%), but few were caught at 50–100 m (0.77%) and 100–200 m (0.12%). Leptocephali were most abundant offshore in the southeast and metamorphosing larvae (N=532, 82–146 mm) were most abundant in the northwest near the large shelf areas of Torres Strait and the Gulf of Papua. Regional size variations, proportions of metamorphosing larvae, and currents entering/exiting the NWCS suggested that larvae experience transport among areas, and have potential for retention by the Coral Sea Gyre or other recirculations. The high larval abundance of this small-size eel that reaches reproductive maturity at sizes <200 mm suggest it is more abundant in shallow tropical areas than is widely known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAriosoma 3aConger 3aeel 3aleptocephalus larvae 3alife history 3amarine science 3asexual maturity 3aCoral Sea 0aCongridae 0aAriosoma scheelei 0aLarval distribution 0aVertical distribution 0aNorthwest coral sea1 aTsukamoto, Katsumi1 aLeis, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0603-34470 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 Feb., v. 42 p.101610-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1016103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245007900205500002000284520178000304592002802084596002502112596004202137650001202179650002702191650001402218650001002232650002002242650001202262650001302274650001502287651001802302700001902320700006502339773012202404856007402526852000902600655001202609IND60764245120221116171524.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424512DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolezal, Aleksandra J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1388-361010aRestored marginal farmland benefits arthropod diversity at multiple scales  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe loss of resource‐rich non‐crop habitat is a hypothesized driver of arthropod decline on farms, implying recovery with restoration. Alternatively, chronic arthropod loss may limit colonization to abundant taxa, especially crop pests. Here, we test the impact of restoring marginal farmland on agriculturally important arthropods on 13 conventional farms across a 10,000 km² region of central North America with approximately 92% crop cover. We examined local richness by habitat (crops, restored prairie, remnant forest), spatial turnover among habitat and farms, and regional comparisons between farm and non‐farms using iNaturalist data. Sampling approximately 13,000 individuals identified to family or lower, restored prairie had twice the abundance of arthropods compared to crop and forest, with 44% of all families detected, 66% of beneficial families, and 94 unique taxa despite their recent construction (<10 years) and small size (~9.6% of farm area). There was some compositional overlap between crop and prairie, while farm forest had mostly unique taxa. Larger restored areas supported more diverse and taxonomically uniform arthropod assemblages, while crop fields were family‐depauperate with primarily herbivorous taxa. Unexpectedly, the abundance and richness of arthropods between farms with restored habitat and non‐farm areas regionally were similar, although farms possessed more herbivorous species and fewer butterflies and aquatics. The extensive and rapid colonization of restored habitat by beneficial arthropods implies that conventional farms may be habitat limited for many taxa. Our work supports calls for farm redesign that includes habitat reconstruction, which can support arthropods with known benefits to food production.  aPublisher supplied data  a298241cOMAFRA‐HQP  cCanada First Research Excellence Fund 3adecline 3aecological restoration 3afarm area 3afarms 3afood production 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3aNorth America1 aEsch, Ellen H.1 aMacDougall, Andrew S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1869-78680 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.e13485-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165300001800282520144800300592002801748650001301776650001801789650001001807650002501817650001501842650001001857650001701867650001601884650002501900650001901925650001601944651001001960653001401970653001601984653001902000653001302019653001602032653001002048700001702058700001302075700001902088773011102107856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60547727320221119084516.0160903e20161025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054772732DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.11936492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jing10aFour new earthworms of the genus Amynthas (Oligochaeta: Megascolecidae) from Mount Emei, Sichuan Province, China  ap. 2499-2513.  aFour new species were collected from Mt.

Furthermore, several issues are identified for further exploration, and possible directions for the development of biosensors are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018C02049cKey Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, China  a2019YFC1604504cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2019YFD1002301cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aZJWR0102001cTechnology Innovation Progamme of Zhejiang Province 3abiosensors 3acolorimetry 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescence 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3ahuman health 3amicrobial detection1 aBelwal, Tarun1 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1242-38661 aLin, Xingyu1 aXu, Yanqun1 aLuo, Zisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8232-97390 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2020 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.1465-1487dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.125763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170520158700301592002801888650002201916650001601938650001001954650002501964650001501989650002602004650001302030650002002043650001402063653003102077653001702108653001702125653002602142653002502168653001902193653003302212700002502245700002502270700002502295700003302320700002402353700002502377700002702402773009802429856008202527852000902609655001202618IND60676562620221122221129.0200628e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067656262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1170622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLekkas, Panagiotis10aEndothelin receptors in the brain modulate autonomic responses and arrhythmogenesis during acute myocardial infarction in rats  aEndothelin has been implicated in various processes in the brain, including the modulation of sympathetic responses. The present study examined the pathophysiologic role of brain endothelin-receptors in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, characterized by high incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.We investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of antagonists of endothelin-receptors ETA, ETB, or both, during a 24 h-observation period post-coronary ligation in (n = 70) rats. Continuous recording was performed via implanted telemetry transmitters, followed by arrhythmia-analysis and calculation of autonomic indices derived from heart rate variability. The regional myocardial electrophysiologic properties were assessed by monophasic action potentials and multi-electrode recordings.Sympathetic-activity was decreased and vagal-activity was enhanced after intracerebroventricular ETA-receptor blockade, thus attenuating regional myocardial repolarization inhomogeneity. As a result, the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was markedly lower in this group. Such effects were also observed after intracerebroventricular blockade of ETB-, or both, ETA- and ETB-receptors, although to a lesser extent.ETA-receptors in the brain modulate sympathetic and vagal responses and alter arrhythmogenesis during evolving myocardial necrosis in rats. These findings provide insights into arrhythmogenic mechanisms during acute myocardial infarction and call for further investigation on the role of endothelin in the central autonomic network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3aantagonists 3abrain 3aendothelin receptors 3aheart rate 3amyocardial infarction 3anecrosis 3apathophysiology 3atelemetry 0aBrain endothelin receptors 0aETA-receptor 0aETB-receptor 0aMyocardial infarction 0aSympathetic response 0aVagal response 0aVentricular tachyarrhythmias1 aKontonika, Marianthi1 aGeorgiou, Evgenia S.1 aLa Rocca, Vassileios1 aMouchtouri, Eleni-Taxiarchia1 aMourouzis, Iordanis1 aPantos, Constantinos1 aKolettis, Theofilos M.0 tLife sciences.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 239 p.117062-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1170623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166520217300290592002802463650001602491650001502507650001102522650001402533650001202547650001502559650001002574650001502584650001002599650001602609650001302625650001602638650001002654650002002664650001902684650001102703650001702714650001902731650001202750651001402762653000702776653000902783653000802792653000802800653001602808653001002824653002502834653002002859653002202879653002302901700001902924700002102943700002402964700005702988773011603045856008303161852000903244655001203253IND60720954120221122051007.0210322e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072095412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1269482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera, Elise10aCritical factors influencing adolescents’ active and social park use: A qualitative study using walk-along interviews  aParks are important public resources that offer opportunities to be physically active and connect socially. However, parks are not well attended by adolescents, and limited research exists to inform optimal park design to increase adolescents’ park visits and support active and social park use. This study aimed to gain in-depth insights into park characteristics that are important for influencing park visitation, park-based physical activity and social interaction among adolescents. Participants (n = 34, aged 13–18 years, 41.2 % female) were recruited from diverse neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia. Walk-along interviews were conducted in nine pre-selected parks, where researchers and participants walked together during the interview. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. The most commonly mentioned characteristics for encouraging park visitation were: the presence of natural features; sports features (e.g., sports courts); playgrounds; aesthetics/condition; and location. The presence of sports features, fitness equipment, walking/cycling paths, playgrounds and green open space were the most frequently mentioned features for encouraging park-based physical activity. The most commonly mentioned features for encouraging socialising when at the park were: presence of barbecue/picnic areas; sports features; seating; organised events; and shade/shelter. Female adolescents more commonly mentioned safety and the presence of playgrounds, and males more commonly noted sports features, size and location as being important for park visitation. Adolescents also considered social factors, such as accompaniment and peer influence, as being critical for encouraging them to visit the park. Many park features were important for all behaviours. For example, sports features were most commonly mentioned as being important for encouraging adolescents’ park visitation and active and social park use. Stakeholders should consider these factors when (re)designing parks to ensure the parks appeal to this sub-population and encourage adolescents to visit and be active and social in this setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aaesthetics 3adesign 3aequipment 3afemales 3ainterviews 3amales 3aopen space 3aparks 3aplaygrounds 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3ashade 3asocial behavior 3asocial factors 3asports 3astakeholders 3aurban forestry 3awalking 3aAustralia 0aPA 0aMVPA 0aSES 0aAFL 0aAdolescents 0aParks 0aPark characteristics 0aPark visitation 0aPhysical activity 0aSocial interaction1 aTimperio, Anna1 aLoh, Venurs H.Y.1 aDeforche, Benedicte1 aVeitch, Jenny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8962-08870 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 Mar., v. 58 p.126948-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1269483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007400145245008800219300001800307500001900325500002000344520180500364592002802169650001402197650002502211650002002236650001502256650002802271650001002299650001602309650002402325650001802349650001502367650003002382650001002412650001602422650004302438650002102481650001902502650002002521650001002541700005902551700006002610773015702670856007902827852000902906655001202915IND60702749320221121005853.0200719e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070274932DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClifford, M.

Epidemiological and intervention studies suggest that they can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This review addresses their metabolic handling after oral consumption to provide a mechanistic basis to explain their possible effects on health. Intact acyl‐quinic acids are absorbed only to a small extent in the small intestine, but the cinnamic acids are efficiently absorbed after hydrolysis by either digestive or microbial enzymes in the colon. Metabolism results in phenolic conjugates in the blood and urine, but varying dependent on the acyl‐quinic acid, and subject to significant interperson variability. The balance between hydrogenation and complete β‐oxidation of the cinnamic acids, both by liver and gut microbiota, determines the profile of metabolites. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that some metabolites are bound to human serum albumin and/or sequestered in tissues, and some exhibit biological activity in vitro, consistent with proposed protective action in vivo. Significant gaps in the literature include lack of plasma and urinary data for free‐living individuals, and pharmacokinetic data for groups who consume coffee or maté at regular short intervals. Data are required for cis isomers. There is a critical need for precise urinary biomarkers of consumption of acyl‐quinic acids, accounting for variability in individual metabolism and in beverage composition, thus facilitating better translation of urinary metabolite measurements into accurate coffee consumption data to improve the outcomes of future epidemiological and intervention studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3acardiovascular diseases 3acolon 3afood safety 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ametabolites 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apharmacokinetics 3arisk reduction 3asmall intestine 3aurine1 aKerimi, Asimina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9725-35111 aWilliamson, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5624-62670 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2020 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.1299-1352dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019500169300001600364520049100380592002800871650001400899650001600913650001600929651001200945653001300957653001700970653001600987653001801003653001301021653001601034653001201050773010901062856008601171852000901257655001201266IND60604999920221118222627.0190722e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060499992DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2017.14039762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyu-Tek10aFour new species of the family Lecithoceridae (Lepidoptera, Gelechioidea) from Vietnam, based on material collected in 1949–1950 and preserved in the Muséum d’histoire naturelle, Geneva  ap. 318-328.  aFour new species of Lecithoceridae: two new species of the subfamily Torodorinae (Lepidozonates landryi sp. nov. and Torodora longidiscalis sp. nov.) and two of the subfamily Lecithocerinae (Homaloxestis lactarius sp. nov. and Lecithocera pahiaensis sp. nov.) are described from Vietnam.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) to F. columnare, including fish mortality and bacterial loads in fish gill and kidney after parasitism by I. multifiliis. Fish received the following treatments: 1) non-infected control; 2) infected by I. multifiliis at 30,000therontsfish−1 alone; 3) infected by F. columnare ALM-05-53 at 4.59×107CFUmL−1 alone; 4) infected by I. multifiliis at 30,000therontsfish−1 and exposed to F. columnare ALM-05-53 at 4.59×107CFUmL−1; 5) infected by F. columnare TN-3-2012 at 4.27×107CFUmL−1 alone; and 6) infected by I. multifiliis at 30,000therontsfish−1 and exposed to F. columnare TN-3-2012 at 4.27×107CFUmL−1. F. columnare in fish tissues were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and reported as genome equivalents per mg of tissue (GEsmg−1). The results demonstrated that the I. multifiliis-parasitized tilapia showed significantly (P<0.05) higher mortality (60.4%) when exposed to F. columnare ALM-05-53 than non-parasitized fish (29.1%). The bacterial loads of F. columnare ALM-05-53 in fish infected by 30,000therontsfish−1 were ≥5703GEsmg−1 which was between 13 and 17 fold higher than those of non-parasitized fish (≤472GEsmg−1). Similarly, parasitized tilapia showed significantly higher mortality (25%) and bacterial loads (≥1586GEsmg−1) at day 3 post-exposure to F. columnare TN-3-2012 than non-parasitized fish (0% and ≤197GEsmg−1). I. multifiliis parasitism of tilapia enhanced F. columnare invasion and resulted in higher fish mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 3aOreochromis 3afarmed fish 3agenome 3ahybrids 3akidneys 3amicrobial load 3amortality 3aparasitism 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aDisease 0aFlavobacterium columnare 0aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 0aqPCR 0aBacterial load 0aParasite–bacterium interaction1 aShoemaker, Craig A.1 aLaFrentz, Benjamin R.0 tAquaculture.g2014 June 20, v. 430 p.44-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.0413Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/604993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2014-Ich-F%20columnare%20coinfection.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013800164520112600302592002801428650001901456650004401475650002801519650003001547650001101577650001401588650001701602650001401619650001401633650001701647650001301664650001101677650001901688650001601707653004101723653003201764653001401796700001501810700001601825700001501841700001501856700001301871700001801884700001701902700001801919773010001937856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60723196220221116221709.0210820e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072319622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1005842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Gen,10aDevelopment of a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) fluorescence assay for the detection of enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP)  aThe emerging microsporidian parasite Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) causes retardation of shrimp growth, leading to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses in shrimp aquaculture.

The specificity of EHP RPA was tested, and the assay did not cross-react with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV), infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), or Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Field and clinical applicability of this assay was evaluated using 61 field samples. The coincidence rate of the detection results for the clinical samples between RPA and qPCR was 95.1 %. In summary, the real-time RPA analysis provides an efficient and sensitive detection method for EHP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterocytozoon 3aInfectious hematopoietic necrosis virus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aassays 3adetection 3afluorescence 3ahemocytes 3aparasites 3arecombinases 3asampling 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3atemperature 0aRecombinase polymerase amplification 0aEnterocytozoon hepatopenaei 0aDetection1 aCong, Feng1 aCai, Weiyou1 aLi, Jinhui1 aWu, Miaoli1 aXiao, Li1 aHu, Xiaoliang1 aZeng, Weiwei1 aHe, Dongsheng0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Mar., v. 19 p.100584-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1005843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245011400154300001600268520168500284592002801969650001501997650001302012650001702025650001402042650001602056650001102072650001202083650001002095650001302105650001002118650002402128650001702152650001602169650001402185651002202199773009902221856007102320852000902391655001202400IND60468473520221120205537.0151209s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046847352DNAL7 a10.1071/BT150282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStart, A.

The study area encompassed Western Australia south of ~26° S. It included all the South-west Botanical Province and southern components of the Eremaean Botanical Province, with the northern boundary corresponding with bioregional boundaries. Vegetation ranges from wet and dry sclerophyll forest through woodlands and heaths to deserts. The mistletoe flora comprises 21 taxa, 19 in the Loranthaceae and two in the Santalaceae. They infect 153 species in 25 genera and 15 families. The Fabaceae provides hosts to more taxa than any other family; however, the genus with most host species, Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), supports only two mistletoe species, one of which barely enters the study area. Melaleuca (also Myrtaceae) is host to seven species. The number of mistletoe species per bioregion ranges from 0 to 18, with 12 species in the seven bioregions of the South-west Botanical Province and 20 in the six bioregions of Eremaean Botanical Province that are within the study area. In both provinces, diversity is lower in coastal areas and higher in more arid, inland areas. Most mistletoe habitats in the study area are fire-prone. One species is probably capable of resprouting whereas all other taxa are obligate seeders. With no means of in situ seed storage, post-fire recovery depends on seed importation. Fire is the most pervasive (but not the only) threatening process operating today. However, fire management in more populous agricultural and urban areas safeguards many populations in the South-west Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aFabaceae 3aLoranthaceae 3aMelaleuca 3aSantalaceae 3acoasts 3adeserts 3aflora 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3asclerophyll forests 3aseed storage 3aurban areas 3awoodlands 3aWestern Australia0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2015, v. 63, no. 8 p.636-646dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT150283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006900145245009200214300001800306500001900324500002000343520136800363592002801731596006201759650002101821650001401842650000901856650001801865650001601883650001301899650002001912650001201932650001301944650001901957650000901976650001701985650001002002650000902012651001102021651000902032700002002041700002202061700006102083700002502144700006902169700006702238773015702305856007902462852000902541655001202550IND60702749520221121042451.0200719e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070274952DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacios‐Rojas, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3072-461110aMining maize diversity and improving its nutritional aspects within agro‐food systems  ap. 1809-1834.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAgro‐food systems are undergoing rapid innovation in the world and the system's continuum is promoted at different scales with one of the main outcomes to improve nutrition of consumers. Consumer knowledge through educational outreach is important to food and nutrition security and consumer demands guide breeding efforts. Maize is an important part of food systems. It is a staple food and together with rice and wheat, they provide 60% of the world's caloric intake. In addition to being a major contributor to global food and nutrition security, maize forms an important part of the culinary culture in many areas of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Maize genetics are being exploited to improve human nutrition with the ultimate outcome of improving overall health. By impacting the health of maize consumers, market opportunities will be opened for maize producers with unique genotypes. Although maize is a great source of macronutrients, it is also a source of many micronutrients and phytochemicals purported to confer health benefits. The process of biofortification through traditional plant breeding has increased the protein, provitamin A carotenoid, and zinc contents of maize. The objective of this paper is to review the innovations developed and promoted to improve the nutritional profiles of maize and outcomes of the maize agro‐food system.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research 3abiofortification 3acarotenes 3acorn 3aenergy intake 3afood safety 3agenetics 3ahuman nutrition 3amarkets 3aoutreach 3aphytochemicals 3arice 3astaple foods 3awheat 3azinc 3aAfrica 3aAsia1 aMcCulley, Laura1 aKaeppler, Mikayla1 aTitcomb, Tyler J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-47681 aGunaratna, Nilupa S.1 aLopez‐Ridaura, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9208-53411 aTanumihardjo, Sherry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7022-17600 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2020 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.1809-1834dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.125523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245011700202500002000319520199400339592002802333596003402361650002002395650002702415650001402442650002202456650001802478650000902496650000902505650002102514650001102535650001502546650002102561650002502582650001102607651001402618700002202632700002002654700003302674700002702707773012202734856007402856852000902930655001202939IND60764245520221116171549.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424552DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.135032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMounsey, Cameron M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6012-999814aThe influence of environmental drivers and restoration intervention methods on postmine restoration trajectories  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMining activity causes major changes in site topography, soil physical and chemical properties, hydrology, and biological assemblages. Reassembling plant communities in these highly altered environments is dependent on interactions between environmental drivers and management intervention techniques through time, yet the long‐term effects of these interactions have rarely been quantified. This study examined a 19‐year‐old, postmining woodland restoration chronosequence in southwest Australia to understand plant community compositional development in postmine restoration sites. We tested the effects of environmental drivers (rainfall regimes, site aspect, slope) and management intervention techniques (substrate ripping and material properties) in terms of four restoration criteria: species richness, plant density, vegetation cover, and compositional similarity to reference sites. Irrespective of environmental drivers or management intervention techniques, vegetation cover increased through time, while plant density and species richness declined. Bray–Curtis similarity to reference communities remained unchanged. Within these trends, ripping and first‐year rainfall significantly affected restoration criteria outcomes; species richness and plant density were greatest when rainfall in the first winter immediately following site restoration was low but followed by a high summer rainfall. The most effective ripping depth was dependent on rainfall, deep‐ripped sites performed best when rainfall was high, and nonripped sites performed best under low‐mean rainfall conditions. Measured restoration criteria had not reached the levels of the target reference community after 19 years, which may be attributable to the still‐developing vegetation structure. This emphasizes the importance of assessing postmining restoration outcomes over longer time frames (>>5 years) with implications for determining appropriate, time‐dependent completion criteria.  aPublisher supplied data  cHanson Construction Materials 3achronosequences 3aecological restoration 3ahydrology 3aplant communities 3aplant density 3arain 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3asummer 3atopography 3avegetation cover 3avegetation structure 3awinter 3aAustralia1 aStevens, Jason C.1 aRenton, Michael1 aDixon, K.

However, subsoiling may benefit crop yields on soils with a compacted subsoil, such as a fragipan. Fragipan soils cover 30% of the land surface of Pennsylvania and 27 million acres in the United States. This study was conducted to determine whether subsoiling an Andover loam soil (fine‐loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Fragiaquult) with a fragipan starting at 19 inches and a seasonally high water table would result in maize (Zea mays L.) yield improvements compared with no‐till. The research took place at Rock Springs, central Pennsylvania, from 2012 to 2014. Soil was subsoiled every spring to a 17‐inch depth with a straight‐shank subsoiler with straight tips and fluted coulters behind it. Approximately 80% of the soil surface remained undisturbed, guaranteeing soil erosion protection by crop residue and soil health maintenance. Penetration resistance was reduced by subsoiling to 14 inches the first year, and penetration resistance was still significantly lower than under no‐tillage 1 year later at 7 to 13 inches deep. On average, subsoiling increased maize yields by 11%. This research shows that subsoiling with reduced surface disturbance can increase maize yields on soils with a shallow fragipan while maintaining the benefits of conservation tillage for soil health.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  aProject #PEN04600 Accession No. 1009362.cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFragiaquults 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop residues 3aforage 3afragipans 3ahigh water table 3aloam soils 3ano-tillage 3aresistance to penetration 3asoil erosion 3asoil quality 3aspring 3asubsoil 3asubsoilers 3aturf management 3aPennsylvania0 tCrop, forage & turfgrass management.g2020, v. 6, no. 1 p.e20008-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27125x2374-38327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cft2.200083Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245009900199500002000298520185300318592002802171596001402199596005802213650002702271650002402298650000902322650002702331650001002358650002302368650001902391650001802410650001102428650002402439650001302463700002202476700002302498700002102521700002202542773012202564856007402686961001202760852000902772655001202781IND60764245720221116171431.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424572DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson, Dean E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7623-249810aDoes active plant restoration passively restore native fauna community structure and function?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcological restoration commonly emphasizes reestablishing native plant communities. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that actively restoring plant communities can passively restore structure and function of other community components like wildlife. However, this assumption is rarely tested. We evaluated how plant restoration in grasslands of the northwestern United States affected the structure (composition and relative abundance) of native small mammal communities and the important functional role they play as seed predators. We quantified vegetation, small mammal community structure, small mammal seed predation, and effects of seed predation on native plant recruitment in comparable grasslands that were either native‐dominated, planted with introduced forage grasses, or had undergone restoration treatments to suppress introduced grasses and increase native plants with and without supplemental watering. Native plant cover averaged ≥5 times higher at restoration sites relative to introduced grass sites. Small mammals, primarily deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were least abundant in introduced grass sites and most abundant in water‐supplemented restoration treatments, with intermediate levels in native and unwatered restoration sites. Seed offerings and seed sowing experiments indicated that seed predation and its effects on plant recruitment correlated with small mammal abundance, with effects generally weakest in introduced grass and strongest in restoration sites. Our results suggest that active plant restoration can passively restore the structure and function of native small mammal communities. While small mammal seed predation is a desired long‐term function, it can also inhibit restoration efforts.

Metastable film structures develop as a combination of dewetting and buckling phenomena. By controlling the maleic anhydride monomer to cellulose nanowhisker weight ratio, the whiskers can be incorporated into a homogeneously covering patterned polymer film. Excess nanowhiskers are required to prevent complete dewetting and deposit dimensionally stable films. The formation of anchoring points is assumed to stabilize the film through a “pinning” effect to the substrate. The latter control the in-plane film stresses, similar to the effects of surface inhomogeneities such as artificial scratches. The different morphologies are evaluated by optical microscopy, AFM, contact angle measurements, and ellipsometry. Further analysis by infrared spectroscopy and XPS suggests esterification between the maleic anhydride and cellulose moieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acontact angle 3aesterification 3afilms (materials) 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alight microscopy 3amaleic anhydrides 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aLaborie, M.-P.1 aMathew, A.

The regeneration of muskmelon was evaluated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented separately with 17 treatments as combinations of two auxins (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid [NAA] and Naphthoxyacetic acid [NOA]) and four cytokinins (Benzylaminopurine [BAP], Thidiazuron [TDZ], Kinetin [KIN], and N-(2-Chloro-4-pyridyl)-N′-phenylurea [CPPU]). The treatments were experimented on 4- and 8-day-old cotyledon explants. A significant degree of organogenesis occurred in 4-day-old cotyledons (P < 0.01) than in 8-day-old cotyledons and shoots grew significantly (P < 0.01) by increasing the concentration of cytokinins in the media. The highest regeneration frequency was obtained in media supplemented with 0.6 mg/l BAP and 0.025 mg/l NOA. Derivatives were transferred to the greenhouse after complete adaptation. For the first time in muskmelon, genetic fidelity was evaluated in mother plants and in regenerated plants by inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Ten primers amplified 112 well-resolved bands with an average of 11 bands per primer and ranged from 7 to 13 bands. According to the results of molecular analysis, no genetic variation was observed among the ex vitro and mother plants. The stability of the ploidy level through plant regeneration was verified by a flow cytometry analysis which indicated monomorphic patterns in the regenerated and mother plants. More than other treatments, the combination of BAP and NOA appeared more suitable for the tissue culture of muskmelon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3acotyledons 3acytokinins 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouses 3akinetin 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amuskmelons 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorganogenesis 3aploidy 3athidiazuron 3atissue culture 0aMuskmelons (Cucumis melo L.) 0aShoot regeneration 0aGenetic fidelity 0aISSR marker 0aFlow cytometric 0aMS 0aNAA 0aKIN 0aNOA 0aTDZ 0aBAP 0aCPPU 0aISSR 0aPCR1 aFarajpour, Mostafa0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2021 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.88-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2020.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007100171300001600242520131600258592002801574650001501602650001001617650002501627650001101652650001001663650001301673650001101686650002001697650001601717650001601733650001601749653001501765653001601780653001601796653001201812653001001824700001901834700002301853700001401876700005701890773012101947856008102068852000902149655001202158IND60524944520221120235928.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052494452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantacatalina, J.V.10aUltrasonically assisted low-temperature drying of desalted codfish  ap. 444-450.  aLow-temperature drying (LTD) constitutes an interesting means of dehydrating foodstuffs, thus preserving the quality of the product. Power ultrasound (US) generates several mechanical effects that could help to shorten the long drying times associated with LTD. In this work, the feasibility of using US in LTD of desalted cod was assessed.For this purpose, desalted cod slices (50 × 30 × 5 mm) were dried (2 m/s) at different temperatures (10, 0 and −10 °C) without (AIR) and with (AIR + US, 20.5 kW/m3) US application. Afterwards, the dried samples were rehydrated in distilled water (25 °C). A diffusion model was used to describe both drying and rehydration kinetics. The color and hardness of both dried and rehydrated cod samples were also measured.The application of US increased the drying rate at every temperature tested, shortening the drying time by 16% at 0 °C and up to 60% at −10 °C. The ultrasonically assisted dried samples presented a rehydration rate which was slightly lower than that of those that had been conventionally dried, but they were harder and whiter, which is more suited to consumer preferences. Therefore, power ultrasound could be considered an affordable technology with which to accelerate LTD of desalted cod, providing high quality dried products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acod (fish) 3acolor 3aconsumer preferences 3adrying 3afoods 3ahardness 3amodels 3aproduct quality 3arehydration 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasound 0aDehydration 0aRehydration 0aTexture 0aColor1 aGuerrero, M.E.1 aGarcia-Perez, J.V.1 aMulet, A.1 aCárcel, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3796-61460 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Jan., v. 65 p.444-450dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013400161500002000295520168700315592002802002596002602030596003802056596004802094650001602142650001502158650001202173650002502185650002702210650001502237650001402252650002102266650002202287650000902309650001402318650001502332700002702347700005902374773012202433856007402555852000902629655001202638IND60764245920221116171517.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076424592DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapia, Washington10aIntroduction of giant tortoises as a replacement “ecosystem engineer” to facilitate restoration of Santa Fe Island, Galapagos  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRe‐establishment of ecosystem engineers via introduction of replacement species is increasingly being proposed to facilitate ecosystem restoration of island ecosystems around the world, yet attendant challenges and risks remain largely unknown. We evaluate the first phase (2015–2020) of a program to restore a population of giant tortoises, ecosystem engineers of terrestrial ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands, to Santa Fe Island during which a total of 551 juvenile and 31 subadult tortoises of the non‐native Española Island species (Chelonoidis hoodensis) were translocated. After 5 years, most (85%) of tortoises released remain alive, exhibiting robust vital rates comparable to those of conspecifics in their native range, having colonized 10% of the island via gradual dispersal from the point‐of‐release. Populations of an arboreal cactus (Opuntia echios)—a keystone species for many organisms on the island and intended beneficiary of tortoise restoration—and pallid land iguanas (Conolophus pallidus)—an endemic, herbivorous reptile considered potentially at risk from the introduction of tortoises, both increased coincident with the arrival of tortoises. Herbivore exclosure experiments revealed that the island's plant community manifested a response to the arrival of tortoises; however, significant engineering of the island's vegetation will require many decades. These results highlight the first stage of what appears to be a successful conservation intervention that can serve as a “proof of concept” for introduction of ecological replacements to other islands in Galapagos, and potentially for other island ecosystems around the world.  aPublisher supplied data  cGalapagos Conservancy  a9282cGlobal Environment Facility  cMohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund 3aChelonoidis 3aConolophus 3aOpuntia 3acacti and succulents 3aecological restoration 3aherbivores 3ajuveniles 3akeystone species 3aplant communities 3arisk 3atortoises 3avegetation1 aGoldspiel, Harrison B.1 aGibbs, James P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0529-97050 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.e13476-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162520172100278592002801999650002002027650001202047650001902059650001902078650001502097650002102112650002002133650001602153650001702169650000902186650002002195650001102215650002802226650001802254650001202272650001302284650001502297650000902312653001902321653001602340653001602356653003002372653002002402653002102422653000902443700001502452700001602467700001202483700001602495700002302511773009802534856008202632852000902714655001202723IND60676563420221122221236.0200628e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067656342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1170702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Juan10aNeonatal murine engineered cardiac tissue toxicology model: Impact of dexrazoxane on doxorubicin induced injury  aDoxorubicin (DOX) induced cardiotoxicity is a life-threatening side effect of chemotherapy and decreased cardiac function can present years after treatment. Despite the investigation of a broad range of pharmacologic interventions, to date the only drug shown to reduce DOX-related cardiotoxicity in preclinical studies and limited clinical trials is the iron chelating agent, dexrazoxane (DRZ), although the mechanisms responsible for DRZ mediated protection from DOX related cardiotoxicity remain unclear. Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) can be used for tissue repair strategies and as in vitro surrogate models to test cardiac toxicities and preventative countermeasures. Neonatal murine ECTs display cardiotoxicity in response to the environmental toxin, cadmium, and reduced cadmium toxicity with Zinc co-treatment, in part via the induction of the anti-oxidant Metallothionein (MT). We adapted our in vitro ECT model to determine the feasibility of using the ECT approach to investigate DOX-related cardiac injury and DRZ prevention. We found: (1) DOX induced dose and time dependent cell death in ECTs; (2) Zinc did not show protection from DOX cardiotoxicity; (3) MT overexpression induced by Zinc, low dose Cd pretreatment, or MT-overexpression (MT-TG) did not reduce ECT DOX cardiotoxicity; (4) DRZ reduced ECT DOX induced cell death; and (5) The mechanism of DRZ ECT protection from DOX cardiotoxicity was topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B) inhibition rather than reduced reactive oxygen species. Our data support the feasibility of ECTs as an in vitro platform technology for the investigation of drug induced cardiotoxicities including the role of TOP2B in DOX toxicity and DRZ mediated DOX toxicity prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acadmium 3acardiac output 3acardiotoxicity 3acell death 3achelating agents 3aclinical trials 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3airon 3ametallothionein 3amodels 3areactive oxygen species 3atissue repair 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3azinc 0aCardiotoxicity 0aDexrazoxane 0aDoxorubicin 0aEngineered cardiac tissue 0aMetallothionein 0aTopoisomerase 2B 0aZinc1 aYu, Haitao1 aJi, Honglei1 aCai, Lu1 aLeng, Jiyan1 aKeller, Bradley B.0 tLife sciences.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 239 p.117070-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1170703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245013200178300001800310520151200328592002801840650001101868650001201879650001101891650002101902650001401923650002201937650001501959650001101974650002501985650001402010650001202024650001002036650000902046650003002055650001302085650002302098650003202121650002002153650003302173650004102206650002102247651001402268653001002282653002902292653001302321653002402334653002202358700002202380700002102402700001802423700002302441700002102464700002402485700002502509700002302534700002502557773013302582852000902715856007502724655001202799IND4467771920160905000000.0160905e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446777192DNAL7 a235310212pmid7 a10.1021/jf305258r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodio, Natalia
S.10aElemental and Isotopic Fingerprint of Argentinean Wheat. Matching Soil, Water, and Crop Composition to Differentiate Provenance  ap. 3763-3773.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate if elemental and isotopic signatures of Argentinean wheat can be used to develop a reliable fingerprint to assess its geographical provenance. For this pilot study we used wheat cultivated at three different regions (Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Entre Ríos), together with matching soil and water. Elemental composition was determined by ICP-MS. δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N were measured by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, while ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratio was determined using thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Wheat samples from three sampling sites were differentiated by the combination of 11 key variables (K/Rb, Ca/Sr, Ba, ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr, Co, Mo, Zn, Mn, Eu, δ¹³C, and Na), demonstrating differences among the three studied regions. The application of generalized Procrustes analysis showed 99.2% consensus between cultivation soil, irrigation water, and wheat samples, in addition to clear differences between studied areas. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis showed significant correlation between the elemental and isotopic profiles of wheat and those corresponding to both soil and water (r² = 0.97, p < 0.001 and r² = 0.96, p < 0.001, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the correspondence between soil, water, and wheat samples using different statistical methods, showing that wheat elemental and isotopic compositions are mainly related to soil and irrigation water characteristics of the site of growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3airrigation water 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3aprovenance 3asodium 3astatistical analysis 3astrontium 3atillage 3awheat 3azinc 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aElements 2aIsotopesxanalysis 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aStrontium Isotopesxanalysis 2aTriticumxchemistryxclassification. 2aWaterxchemistry 0aArgentina 0awheat 0amultielement composition 0aisotopes 0ageographical origin 0afood authenticity1 aBaroni, María V.1 aBadini, Raúl G.1 aInga, Marcela1 aOstera, Héctor A.1 aCagnoni, Mariana1 aGautier, Eduardo

Our fieldwork study in Afghanistan showed that there was a maximum value of 3371 μg/L and an average value of 233 μg/L of lithium in well drinking water. Since the level of lithium in well water is higher than the levels in other countries, we investigated the health risk of lithium. After confirming no influence of ≤1000 μM lithium on cell viability, we found that lithium at concentrations of 100 and 500 μM promoted anchorage-independent growth of human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) but not that of human keratinocytic carcinoma cells (HSC-5) or lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549). The same concentrations of lithium also promoted phosphorylation of c-SRC and MEK/ERK but not that of AKT in the keratinocytes. Inhibitors of c-SRC (PP2) and MEK (PD98059) suppressed the lithium-induced increase in anchorage-independent growth of the keratinocytes. Our results suggested that lithium promoted transformation of nontumorigenic cells rather than progression of tumorigenic cells with preferential activation of the c-SRC/MEK/ERK pathway. Since previous pharmacokinetics studies indicated that it is possible for the serum level of lithium to reach 100 μM by drinking 2.5 L of water containing 3371 μg/L of lithium per day, the high level of lithium contamination in well drinking water in Kabul might be a potential oncogenic risk in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarcinoma 3acell viability 3aenvironment 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3alithium 3alungs 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphorylation 3arain 3arisk 3awell water 3aAfghanistan 0aICP-MS 0ac-SRC 0aMEK 0aERK 0aAKT 0aGAPDH 0aDrinking water 0aOncogenesis 0aProgression 0aTransformation1 aHashimoto, Kazunori1 aYoshinaga, Masafumi1 aAzimi, Mohammad Daud1 aFayaz, Said Hafizullah1 aHamajima, Nobuyuki1 aKondo-Ida, Lisa1 aYanagisawa, Kiyoshi1 aKato, Masashi0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 744 p.140830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245011900157300001400276520183100290592002802121650001602149650001202165650001402177650002302191650001202214650001202226650002102238650002502259650001102284650003102295650002202326650001002348651001202358653001702370653002102387653001202408653001902420653002202439700002502461700002302486700001802509773014602527856007402673852000902747655001202756IND4402472820221119120232.0151126e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440247282DNAL7 a10.2111/06-130.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Derek W.10aEvaluation of Low-Stress Herding and Supplement Placement for Managing Cattle Grazing in Riparian and Upland Areas  ap. 26-37.  aManagement practices are often needed to ensure that riparian areas are not heavily grazed by livestock. A study was conducted in Montana during midsummer to evaluate the efficacy of low-stress herding and supplement placement to manage cattle grazing in riparian areas. Three treatments were evaluated in three pastures over a 3-yr period in a Latin-square design (n == 9). Each year, naïïve 2-yr-old cows with calves were randomly assigned to the three treatments: 1) free-roaming control, 2) herding from perennial streams to upland target areas, and 3) herding to upland sites with low-moisture block supplements. Stubble heights along the focal stream were higher (P == 0.07) in pastures when cattle were herded (mean ±± SE, 23 ±± 2 cm) than in controls (15 ±± 3 cm). Global positioning system telemetry data showed that herding reduced the time cows spent near (< 100 m) perennial streams (P == 0.01) and increased the use of higher elevations (P == 0.07) compared with controls. Evening visual observations provided some evidence that free-roaming cows (44%% ±± 19%%) were in riparian areas more frequently (P == 0.11) than herded cows (23%% ±± 6%%). Fecal abundance along the focal stream was less (P == 0.07) with herding (61.9 ±± 11.4 kg ·· ha⁻⁻¹) than in controls (113.2 ±± 11.4 kg ·· ha⁻⁻¹). Forage utilization within 600 m of supplement sites was greater (P == 0.06) when cows were herded to low-moisture blocks (18%% ±± 6%%) compared with controls and herding alone (8%% ±± 2%%). Moving cattle to uplands at midday using low-stress herding is an effective tool to reduce use of riparian areas. Herding cattle to low-moisture blocks can increase grazing of nearby upland forage but may not provide additional reduction in cattle use of riparian areas compared with herding alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef cattle 3astreams 3ahighlands 3agrazing management 3agrazing 3aherding 3afeed supplements 3aspatial distribution 3aheight 3aglobal positioning systems 3adiurnal variation 3afeces 3aMontana 0adistribution 0agrazing behavior 0aherding 0ariparian areas 0asupplement blocks1 aVan Wagoner, Harv C.1 aWeinmeister, Robin1 aJensen, Delyn0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2008 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.26-37dThe Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, Incx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F06-130.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012500171300001800296520234500314592002802659650001502687650001902702650002302721650001202744650002102756650002202777650001302799650002102812650004402833650002402877650001902901700001802920700002002938700001902958773010402977856008603081852000903167655001203176IND60578276020221119140506.0170812e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057827602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b025202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Brandon
A.10a1,1,3,3-Tetramethylguanidine-Promoted Ring-Opening Polymerization of N-Butyl N-Carboxyanhydride Using Alcohol Initiators  ap. 2002-2012.  aN-Butyl N-carboxyanhydride (Bu-NCA) was polymerized in THF to produce poly(N-butylglycine) using benzyl alcohol initiator and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (TMG) promoter. Poly(N-butylglycine) species (PNBG) with controlled molecular weight (Mₙ = 2.9–20.5 kg mol–¹) and narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI = 1.04–1.08) were obtained by controlling the initial monomer-to-initiator ratio and conversion. The reaction exhibits characteristics of a living polymerization, as evidenced by the linear increase of Mₙ with conversion and successful chain extension experiments. Kinetic studies revealed a first-order dependence of propagation rate on the monomer and benzyl alcohol concentration and zero-order dependence on the TMG concentration, consistent with a controlled polymerization where the TMG does not influence the chain propagation. It was further revealed that the polymerization activities and Mₙ control are strongly dependent on the structure of the alcohol initiators. Primary alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, n-propanol, and benzyl alcohol) can mediate the polymerization of Bu-NCA with the TMG present to produce PNBG polymers with good to moderate control of Mₙs and PDIs. By contrast, sterically hindered secondary or tertiary alcohols (e.g., isopropyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol) or a primary alcohol bearing strongly electron withdrawing substituents (e.g., 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) or phenol either failed to initiate the polymerization or produced PNBGs whose molecular weights deviated to varying extents from the theoretical values based on single-site initiation with alcohols. ¹H NMR analysis revealed hydrogen bonding interactions between TMG and various alcohols, thereby promoting the initiation by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the alcohols toward ring-opening addition of Bu-NCA monomer. Electron-rich primary alcohols can initiate the polymerization more efficiently than the electron-deficient primary alcohol or sterically hindered secondary or tertiary alcohols, resulting in enhanced control over polymer molecular weight in the former than the latter. The polymerization has been successfully extended toward the synthesis of heteroblock copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and PNBG by using a hydroxyl-ended PEG macroinitiator and TMG promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abenzyl alcohol 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization1 aXuan, Sunting1 aHorton, Matthew1 aZhang, Donghui0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 49, no. 6 p.2002-2012dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b025203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007100159300001600230520099600246592002801242650001401270650001501284650002301299650001001322650001201332650001201344650001601356650002601372650001601398650001601414650001401430773008801444856007401532852000901606655001201615IND60082125420221120165158.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212542DNAL7 a10.1111/soru.120442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeggem, Reidun10aDiversification and Re‐feminisation of Norwegian Farm Properties  ap. 439-459.  aFemale potential successors of farm properties are increasingly choosing not to take over the farm, with the result that rural areas are becoming masculinised. The question asked in this article is, how will the current shift in European and Norwegian agriculture towards increased diversification affect the recruitment of young women to rural areas? This study employs quantitative methods to answer this question. The findings are a significant and positive relationship between the potential recruitment of women, a higher level of education among farm property owners, and farm property owners’ involvement in farm diversification associated with farm tourism and Green Care. The article concludes that there are more options for a farm‐based life than there used to be, and that this increases the probability that daughters are wanted as successors of their parents’ farm properties. This outcome is of importance for recruitment of women to rural areas and for rural viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adaughters 3aecotourism 3aeducational status 3afarms 3afemales 3aparents 3aprobability 3aquantitative analysis 3arural areas 3arural women 3aviability0 tSociologia ruralis.g2014 Oct., v. 54, no. 4 p.439-459dVan Gorcumx0038-01997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soru.120443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013000168300001600298520189100314592002802205650001302233650001402246650001302260650001302273650000802286650001502294650001302309650001202322650001102334650001402345650001302359650002202372650001502394650001502409651001102424653001702435653002202452653002102474653002202495653001402517653001302531773009802544856008602642852000902728655001202737IND60610050020221116171051.0180824e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061005002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLønne, Ida10aTerrestrial slopes in northern high latitudes: A paradigm shift regarding sediment origin, composition, and dynamic evolution  ap. 180-202.  aHigh-Arctic terrestrial slopes have received limited systematic research interest, but increased vulnerability related to regional warming has driven the call for better knowledge of the dynamics of these systems. Studies of sediment transport from a plateau area in Adventdalen, Svalbard, and associated slopes extending to sea level demonstrate that glacial processes play a more prominent role than earlier anticipated, − especially the impact of glacial meltwater. Traces of drainage at the plateau and the dissection of the plateau edge and upper slope were clearly initiated during various stages of Late Glacial runoff. Further, there is a close association between the sediment distribution and composition at the plateau and the evolution of various types of slopes. The reconstructed sedimentation history shows that the landscape will undergo four stages with contrasting modes of sediment transport: 1) subglacial processes related to active ice, 2) processes related to the margin of active ice, 3) processes related to the melting of inactive ice, and 4) nonglacial processes. These stages form four successions, referred to as supply regimes A–D, which control the supply of water and sediments to a given slope segment. In this landscape, traces of glacial meltwater occur at most altitudes, in “odd” positions and in slope segments “without” catchments. The associated depocenters (isolated, composite or coalescing into aprons), are often outsized compared to the apparent slope catchment. Reworked glacial sediments form a significant part of the slope-debris but are covered partly or entirely by products of physical weathering. Colluvium, senso stricto, thus masks a distinct system shift related to the local termination of glacial meltwater. Consequently, the weathering part of the slope sediment budget in this region is considerably overestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acolluvium 3adrainage 3aglaciers 3aice 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3amelting 3arunoff 3asea level 3asnowmelt 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aNorway 0aSteep slopes 0aSlope successions 0aTerrestrial fans 0aGlacial meltwater 0aColluvium 0aSvalbard0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 276 p.180-202dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010400171300001600275500002000291520086400311592002801175596004901203650001901252650001201271650001301283650002001296650001501316650001501331700001901346700001801365700002701383700002101410700002201431773011301453856008001566852000901646655001201655IND60786889720221119133757.0220806e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078688972DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.133172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamakrishnan, Sathish10aSynaptotagmin oligomers are necessary and can be sufficient to form a Ca2+‐sensitive fusion clamp  ap. 154-162.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe buttressed‐ring hypothesis, supported by recent cryo‐electron tomography analysis of docked synaptic‐like vesicles in neuroendocrine cells, postulates that prefusion SNAREpins are stabilized and organized by Synaptotagmin (Syt) ring‐like oligomers. Here, we use a reconstituted single‐vesicle fusion analysis to test the prediction that destabilizing the Syt1 oligomers destabilizes the clamp and results in spontaneous fusion in the absence of Ca²⁺. Vesicles in which Syt oligomerization is compromised by a ring‐destabilizing mutation dock and diffuse freely on the bilayer until they fuse spontaneously, similar to vesicles containing only v‐SNAREs. In contrast, vesicles containing wild‐type Syt are immobile as soon as they attach to the bilayer and remain frozen in place, up to at least 1 h until fusion is triggered by Ca²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data  aDK027044cNational Institute of Health (NIH) 3aSNARE proteins 3acalcium 3amutation 3aoligomerization 3aprediction 3atomography1 aBera, Manindra1 aColeman, Jeff1 aKrishnakumar, Shyam S.1 aPincet, Frederic1 aRothman, James E.0 tFEBS letters.g2019 Jan., v. 593, no. 2 p.154-162dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.133173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014200168300001800310520124600328592002801574650002301602650001301625650002101638650001901659650002301678650002201701700001701723700001801740700002001758700002001778700002301798700001801821700001901839773010401858856008601962852000902048655001202057IND60578276120180713000000.0170812e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057827612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b025292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenk, Florian10aSynthesis of Functional Block Copolymers Carrying One Poly(p-phenylenevinylene) and One Nonconjugated Block in a Facile One-Pot Procedure  ap. 2085-2095.  aBlock copolymers composed of a MEH–PPV block and a nonconjugated functional block (molecular weights between 5 and 90 kg/mol) were synthesized in a facile one-pot procedure via ROMP. This one-pot procedure permits the synthesis of numerous block copolymers with little effort. Amphiphilic block copolymers were obtained via incorporation of oxanorbornene carrying a PEG side chain as well as via postpolymerization modification of a reactive ester carrying norbornene derivative with methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)amine. These amphiphilic block copolymers can be self-assembled into micelles exhibiting different sizes (60–95 nm), morphologies (micelles or fused, caterpillar-like micelles), and optical properties depending on the polymer composition and the micellization procedure. Furthermore, the reactive ester carrying block copolymers enabled the introduction of anchor groups which facilitated the preparation of nanocomposites with CdSe/CdZnS core–shell QDs. The obtained composites were studied using time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The results revealed an increased interaction based on an accelerated decay of the QD emission for composites as compared to the mixture of the QDs with unfunctionalized polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3ananocomposites 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence1 aShin, Suyong1 aKim, Kyung-Oh1 aScherer, Martin1 aGehrig, Dominik1 aLaquai, Frédéric1 aChoi, Tae-Lim1 aZentel, Rudolf0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 49, no. 6 p.2085-2095dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b025293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014600170300001800316520112300334592002801457650004401485650001301529650002101542650002701563650001401590650001401604650001301618650001401631650003301645650001201678653001901690653003201709653002101741700001701762700001901779700001601798773013701814856008701951852000902038655001202047IND60614405120221120212348.0190202e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061440512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoyan10aComparison of structures of walnut protein fractions obtained through reverse micelles and alkaline extraction with isoelectric precipitation  ap. 1214-1220.  aThe effects of different extraction methods on the contents of disulfide (SS) and sulfhydryl (SH) and secondary structure of albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin fractions from walnut proteins were evaluated. By comparison with the changing trend for four protein fractions from alkali extraction with isoelectric precipitation (AEIP), the SH contents of globulin, prolamin and glutelin fractions from the reverse micelles (RMs) significantly increased (p < 0.05), but decreased in the albumin faction. The SS bond contents of albumin, globulin and glutelin fractions obtained by two extraction methods were similar, except that the SS bond content in prolamin obtained through RMs increased by 2.57%. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the proportions of α–helix in globulin, β–sheet structure in prolamin, unordered structure in globulin, prolamin and glutein, turn structure in albumin, prolamin and glutelin by RMs were higher than those by AEIP. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the reverse micelle extraction could affect the surface structures of four protein fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalbumins 3aalkali treatment 3achemical precipitation 3aglobulins 3aglutelins 3amicelles 3aprolamins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awalnuts 0aWalnut protein 0aStructural characterization 0aReverse micelles1 aLiu, Hongkai1 aZhang, Xiaowei1 aZhu, Haitao0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 125 p.1214-1220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245021200171300001400383520128800397592002801685650002101713650001901734650002001753650001401773650001801787650001801805650001301823650004301836650001501879650001201894650002101906650001301927650001201940650002201952650002601974650002102000650002602021653003602047653002702083653001902110653002202129700002202151773011202173856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60603041420221120224652.0180712e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060304142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichael, Claudia10aQuantitative isomer-specific N-glycan fingerprinting using isotope coded labeling and high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry with graphitic carbon stationary phase  ap. 88-95.  aGlycan reductive isotope labeling (GRIL) using ¹²C6-/¹³C6-aniline as labeling reagent is reported with the aim of quantitative N-glycan fingerprinting. Porous graphitized carbon (PGC) as stationary phase in capillary scale HPLC coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry with time of flight analyzer was applied for the determination of labeled N-glycans released from glycoproteins. The main benefit of using stable isotope-coding in the context of comparative glycomics lies in the improved accuracy and precision of the quantitative analysis in combined samples and in the potential of correcting for structure-dependent incomplete enzymatic release of oligosaccharides when comparing identical target proteins. The method was validated with respect to mobile phase parameters, reproducibility, accuracy, linearity and limit of detection/quantification (LOD/LOQ) using test glycoproteins. It is shown that the developed method is capable of determining relative amounts of N-glycans (including isomers) comparing two samples in one single HPLC-MS run. The analytical potential and usefulness of GRIL in combination with PGC-ESI-TOF-MS is demonstrated comparing glycosylation in human monoclonal antibodies produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and hybridoma cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3adetection limit 3aglycomics 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3agraphene 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahybridomas 3aisomers 3aisotope labeling 3aisotopes 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoligosaccharides 3aquantitative analysis 0aQuantitative N-glycan profiling 0aIsotope coded labeling 0aPGC separation 0aMass spectrometry1 aRizzi, Andreas M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 27, v. 1383 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009500172300001800267520032000285592002800605650002300633650002300656650001400679650002200693700002600715700002400741773010600765856008500871852000900956655001200965IND60579318120221119072720.0170816e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057931812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b017302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuktarov, Airat R.10aOne-Pot Method for the Synthesis of 2,5-Unsubstituted Pyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,9]fullerenes  ap. 3863-3866.  aA new, efficient process has been developed for the preparation of 2,5-unsubstituted pyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,9]fullerenes by the Ti(O-i-Pr)₄-promoted reaction of fullerene C₆₀ with 1,3,5-perhydrotriazines generated in situ upon the reaction of primary alkyl- and benzylamines with paraformaldehyde and EtMgBr.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afullerene 3aorganic compounds1 aShakirova, Zulfiya R.1 aDzhemilev, Usein M.0 tOrganic letters.g2017 July 21, v. 19, no. 14 p.3863-3866dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.7b017303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002900175245007500204300001400279520237900293592002802672650001002700650001602710650001502726650001902741650001902760650001302779650002202792650001702814650001602831650001702847650002802864650001002892650001002902650001902912650001502931650002302946700002402969700001902993700001903012700001903031773014903050856006803199856010603267990002303373852000903396655001203405IND60643347320221122135928.0190510e20120316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064334732DNAL7 a10.3791/36812doi7 aPMC33537072pmcid7 a224535772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwczarczak, Alexander B.10aCreating transient cell membrane pores using a standard inkjet printer  ap. e3681.  aBioprinting has a wide range of applications and significance, including tissue engineering, direct cell application therapies, and biosensor microfabrication.1-10 Recently, thermal inkjet printing has also been used for gene transfection.8,9 The thermal inkjet printing process was shown to temporarily disrupt the cell membranes without affecting cell viability. The transient pores in the membrane can be used to introduce molecules, which would otherwise be too large to pass through the membrane, into the cell cytoplasm.8,9,11 The application being demonstrated here is the use of thermal inkjet printing for the incorporation of fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers into cells. The advantage of using thermal ink-jet printing to inject molecules into cells is that the technique is relatively benign to cells.8, 12 Cell viability after printing has been shown to be similar to standard cell plating methods1,8. In addition, inkjet printing can process thousands of cells in minutes, which is much faster than manual microinjection. The pores created by printing have been shown to close within about two hours. However, there is a limit to the size of the pore created (~10 nm) with this printing technique, which limits the technique to injecting cells with small proteins and/or particles. 8,9,11 A standard HP DeskJet 500 printer was modified to allow for cell printing.3, 5, 8 The cover of the printer was removed and the paper feed mechanism was bypassed using a mechanical lever. A stage was created to allow for placement of microscope slides and coverslips directly under the print head. Ink cartridges were opened, the ink was removed and they were cleaned prior to use with cells. The printing pattern was created using standard drawing software, which then controlled the printer through a simple print command. 3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence, trypsinized, and then resuspended into phosphate buffered saline with soluble fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers. The cell suspension was pipetted into the ink cartridge and lines of cells were printed onto glass microscope cover slips. The live cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and actin was found throughout the cytoplasm. Incorporation of fluorescent actin into the cell allows for imaging of short-time cytoskeletal dynamics and is useful for a wide range of applications.13-15  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3abioprinting 3abiosensors 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3acleaning 3acomputer software 3acytoskeleton 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3aphosphates 3atissue engineering1 aShuford, Stephen O.1 aWood, Scott T.1 aDeitch, Sandra1 aDean, Delphine0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Mar. 16, , no. 61 p.e3681-e3681dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/36813Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3681/creating-transient-cell-membrane-pores-using-a-standard-inkjet-printer  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016700166300001400333520167000347592002802017650001302045650000802058650001202066650001202078650001102090650001602101650001302117650003702130650001602167650002302183650001502206650000902221650001702230650001402247650003402261650002302295650001402318650002202332650001502354651001902369700001602388700001302404700002002417700002002437700003002457700001902487700002302506700003502529773012702564856007402691852000902765655001202774IND60662102220221117164218.0190904e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066210222DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00390f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrenhauser, Franz S.10aBubble bursting as an aerosol generation mechanism during an oil spill in the deep-sea environment: laboratory experimental demonstration of the transport pathway  ap. 65-73.  aOil spills in the deep-sea environment such as the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico release vast quantities of crude oil into the sea-surface environment. Various investigators have discussed the marine transport and fate of the oil into different environmental compartments (air, water, sediment, and biota). The transport of the oil into the atmosphere in these previous investigations has been limited to only evaporation, a volatility dependent pathway. In this work, we studied the aerosolization of oil spill matter via bursting bubbles as they occur during whitecaps in a laboratory aerosolization reactor. By evaluating the alkane content in oil mousse, crude oil, the gas phase, and particulate matter we clearly demonstrate that aerosolization via bursting bubbles is a solubility and volatility independent transport pathway for alkanes. The signature of alkane fractions in the native oil and aerosolized matter matched well especially for the less volatile alkanes (C20–C29). Scanning electron microscope interfaced with energy dispersive X-ray images identified the carbon fractions associated with salt particles of aerosols. Theoretical molecular dynamics simulations in the accompanying paper lend support to the observed propensity for alkanes at air–salt water interfaces of breaking bubbles and the produced droplets. The presence of a dispersant in the aqueous phase increased the oil ejection rate at the surface especially for the C20–C29 alkanes. The information presented here emphasizes the need to further study sea-spray aerosols as a possible transport vector for spilled oil in the sea surface environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aalkanes 3abubbles 3acarbon 3adispersants 3adroplets 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aevaporation 3amolecular dynamics 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aparticulates 3apetroleum 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asea transportation 3asediments 3asimulation models 3asolubility 3aGulf of Mexico1 aAvij, Paria1 aShu, Xin1 aDugas, Victoria1 aWoodson, Isaiah1 aLiyana-Arachchi, Thilanga1 aZhang, Zenghui1 aHung, Francisco R.1 aValsaraj, K.

Here, the effect of substituents on the photoacidity and excited-state proton transfer (PT) pathways of prototype 2-naphthol (2OH) at the symmetric C7 position was investigated through photochemical and computational studies of 7-amino-2-naphthol (7N2OH) and 7-methoxy-2-naphthol (7OMe2OH). Time-resolved emission experiments of 7N2OH revealed that the presence of an electron-withdrawing versus electron-donating group (EWG vs EDG, NH₃⁺ vs NH₂) led to a drastic decline in photoacidity: pKₐ* = 1.1 ± 0.2 vs 9.6 ± 0.2. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with explicit water molecules confirmed that the excited neutral state (x = NH₂) is greatly stabilized by water, with equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles calculations supporting potential mixing between the Lₐ and Lb states. Similar suppression of photoacidity, however, was not observed for 7OMe2OH with EDG OCH₃, pKₐ* = 2.7 ± 0.1. Hammett plots of the ground- and excited-state PT reactions of substituted 7-x-2OH compounds (x = CN, NH₃⁺, H, CH₃, OCH₃, OH, and NH₂) vs Hammett parameters σₚ showed breaks in the linearity between the EDG and EWG regions: ρ ∼ 0 vs 1.14 and ρ* ∼ 0 vs 3.86. The divergent acidic behavior most likely arises from different mixing mechanisms of the lowest Lb state with the Lₐ and possible Bb states upon substitution of naphthalene in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3adensity functional theory 3amixing 3amodels 3amoieties 3anaphthalene 3aphotochemistry 3aprototypes1 aBrown, Paige J.1 aNelson, Ryan C.1 aTakematsu, Kana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2334-336X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 123, no. 19 p.4301-4310dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b012953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245018000172520124900352592002801601650001001629650001601639650001901655650001101674650002401685650001701709650001801726650001001744650001601754650001601770650001201786650001001798651001101808700002601819773012301845856008001968852000902048655001202057IND60715186220221122052719.0201026e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071518622DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101016132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovikova, Liubov  Yu.10aDependence of Fresh Grapes and Wine Taste Scores on the Origin of Varieties and Weather Conditions of the Harvest Year in the Northern Zone of Industrial Viticulture in Russia  aClimate change affects all characteristics of grapes, including the taste of fresh berries and wine. The purpose of this study was to reveal the dependence of fresh grapes taste scores (GS) and wine taste scores (WS) on the origin of the varieties and weather conditions of the harvest year in the northern zone of industrial viticulture in Russia. The material used in the study were taste scores of 232 grape varieties from the Don Ampelographic Collection (47°25′ N 40°03′ E) 1981–2019. The correlation analysis, ANOVA, and regression were used. It was shown that GS negatively correlated with productivity, and WS with the berry mass of variety. In recent decades, GS have increased in groups of varieties of various interspecies origin, and WS have not changed. Regression models revealed that the reason for GS improvement was in the growth of average temperature above 15 °C, while WS varied depending on the sum of precipitation for the period with temperatures above 20 °C, which did not have a reliable trend. Together with data on the growth of grape yield and sugar content, the results indicate that observed climate warming is favorable for grapevine cultivation in the northern zone of industrial viticulture in Russia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3afruit yield 3aglobal warming 3agrapes 3aregression analysis 3asmall fruits 3asugar content 3ataste 3atemperature 3aviticulture 3aweather 3awines 3aRussia1 aNaumova, Lyudmila  G.0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101016133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012900172300001600301520105200317592002801369650001201397650001101409650002301420650001501443650001201458650001201470650002401482650001601506650001401522653001101536653001701547653001701564653001701581653002301598653001801621700002101639700002101660700002401681773011401705856008401819852000901903655001201912IND60603041620221120214145.0180712e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060304162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerracci, Valerio13aAn investigation of the matrix sensitivity of refinery gas analysis using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection  ap. 144-150.  aThe response of a flame ionisation detector (FID) on a gas chromatograph to methane, ethane, propane, i-butane and n-butane in a series of multi-component refinery gas standards was investigated to assess the matrix sensitivity of the instrument. High-accuracy synthetic gas standards, traceable to the International System of Units, were used to minimise uncertainties. The instrument response exhibited a small dependence on the component amount fraction: this behaviour, consistent with that of another FID, was thoroughly characterised over a wide range of component amount fractions and was shown to introduce a negligible bias in the analysis of refinery gas samples, provided a suitable reference standard is employed. No significant effects of the molar volume, density and viscosity of the gas mixtures on the instrument response were observed, indicating that the FID is suitable for the analysis of refinery gas mixtures over a wide range of component amount fractions provided that appropriate drift-correction procedures are employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanes 3aethane 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3amethane 3apropane 3areference standards 3auncertainty 3aviscosity 0aGC-FID 0aRefinery gas 0aGas analysis 0aEnergy gases 0aDetector linearity 0aGas standards1 aBrown, Andrew S.1 aHarris, Peter M.1 aBrown, Richard J.C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 27, v. 1383 p.144-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014900166300002000315500001900335520110400354592002801458650001401486650001501500650001701515650001001532650002001542650002401562650002401586650001501610650001101625650001101636653001401647653002701661653002001688653002801708653002601736700001701762700001801779700001601797700001501813700001301828700005501841773014601896856008502042852000902127655001202136IND60719219020221123044535.0201130e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071921902DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c067822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tianqi10aAmorphous CoOₓ-Decorated Crystalline RuO₂ Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts for Boosting Overall Water Splitting at Large Current Density  ap. 17520-17526.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping efficient bifunctional water electrolysis catalysts applied at large current density is desirable. Herein, an amorphous CoOₓ-decorated crystalline RuO₂ nanosheet catalyst self-supported on nickel foam (CoOₓ–RuO₂/NF) with high performance for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) is prepared successfully by hydrothermal method and annealing. The overpotentials at ±1500 mA cm–² for OER and HER are 420 and 215 mV, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. Remarkably, it shows good durability with small decline in performance after 48 h durability test for OER and HER at ±1500 mA cm–². Furthermore, it only needs 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm–² for overall water splitting (OWS); the decline of activity is satisfactory after 48 h durability test at 1500 mA cm–². The reason could be because of the sufficient active sites generated by the crystalline–amorphous combination and self-supporting nanosheet structure. This work therefore proposes an effective strategy for preparing a high-performance OWS catalyst, especially at large current density.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectrolysis 3afoams 3agreen chemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen 0aamorphous 0abifunctional catalysts 0aRuO2 nanosheets 0aoverall water splitting 0alarge current density1 aXu, Qinglian1 aQian, Guangfu1 aChen, Jinli1 aZhang, Hao1 aLuo, Lin1 aYin, Shibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1539-44740 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 8, no. 47 p.17520-17526dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c067823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245010900206300001600315500002000331520094300351592002801294596002601322596003301348650001301381650002701394650002201421650001101443650001201454650002301466650004301489700002101532700006701553700005701620700001801677700002001695700002101715700002201736700005801758700005401816700002001870700005801890700005901948773011302007856008002120852000902200655001202209IND60786890020221119133825.0220806e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078689002DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.133012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyashita, Yurina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2736-441310aDual conformation of the ligand induces the partial agonistic activity of retinoid X receptor α (RXRα)  ap. 242-250.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1‐[(3,5,5,8,8‐pentamethyl‐5,6,7,8‐tetrahydronaphthalen‐2‐yl)amino]benzotriazole‐5‐carboxylic acid (CBt‐PMN), a partial agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), has attracted attention due to its potential to treat type 2 diabetes and central nervous system diseases with reduced adverse effects of existing full agonists. Herein, we report the crystal structure of CBt‐PMN‐bound ligand‐binding domain of human RXRα (hRXRα) and its biochemical characterization. Interestingly, the structure is a tetramer in nature, in which CBt‐PMNs are clearly found binding in two different conformations. The dynamics of the hRXRα/CBt‐PMN complex examined using molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the flexibility of the AF‐2 interface depends on the conformation of the ligand. These facts reveal that the dual conformation of CBt‐PMN in the complex is probably the reason behind its partial agonistic activity.  aPublisher supplied data  cNanken‐Kyoten, TMDU  a#JP18gm0910003cAMED‐CREST 3aagonists 3acentral nervous system 3acrystal structure 3ahumans 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus1 aNumoto, Nobutaka1 aArulmozhiraja, Sundaram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7150-560X1 aNakano, Shogo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6614-71581 aMatsuo, Naoya1 aShimizu, Kanade1 aShibahara, Osamu1 aFujihara, Michiko1 aKakuta, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3633-81211 aIto, Sohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9937-31001 aIkura, Teikichi1 aIto, Nobutoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0839-03841 aTokiwa, Hiroaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3790-17990 tFEBS letters.g2019 Jan., v. 593, no. 2 p.242-250dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.133013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001600285520150300301536022201804592002802026596013202054650001102186650002302197650001602220650001102236650002102247650001602268650000902284650002602293650001202319650001502331650000902346650001002355650001302365650001802378653002702396653001902423653002002442700003002462700002402492700002802516773011202544856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60686298520221122165429.0200316e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629852DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2019.16606732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumklam, Ponlakrit10aEffects of operating parameters of impinging stream dryer on parboiled rice quality and energy consumption  ap. 634-645.  aIt is very important to know how operating condition of a coaxial impinging stream dryer affects the drying time, parboiled rice quality and energy consumption. The drying temperature, parboiled paddy feed rate, drying air velocity and impinging distance were experimentally investigated. Increases in drying temperature and air velocity and a decrease in paddy feed rate provided higher evaporation rate whilst impinging distance, ranging from 5 to 13 cm, did not affect the evaporation rate. Collision between kernels within the impinging zone caused the hull’s lemma splitting from the kernel and the percentage of the split kernel strongly depended on the air velocity and feed rate. The acceleration in the rate of drying by changing the above operating parameters did not affect the head rice yield. In addition, the collision of kernels also did not influence the head rice yield since the mechanical properties of rice are strengthened during steaming step in the parboiling process. However, the change of head rice quality was only governed by the moisture content after drying. The total energy consumption including electricity and heat was strongly depended on the air velocity and feed rate whilst it was slightly changed with the drying temperature. From the present study, it was recommended that the parboiled paddy should not be dried below 25% d.b. and the highest temperature that could possibly be used was 190 °C and the inlet air velocity should not be below 15 m/s.  aThe authors express their sincere appreciation to King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) and Thailand Research Fund (Grant no.

The dataset comprises seven outgroup taxa, all eight extant genera and a number of extinct taxa that have been associated with Megalyridae, including two genera from Maimetshidae, whose affinity with Megalyridae is uncertain. Analytical results are unstable because some of the fossil taxa have many missing entries. The most stable results are produced when the maimetshid taxa and Cretodinapsis are excluded. When included, these taxa fall outside crown‐group Megalyridae, the maimetshid taxa being the sister of Orthogonalys (Trigonalidae). Based on the results of our analyses, we synonymize the fossil genera Rubes Perrichot n.syn. and Ukrainosa Perrichot & Perkovsky n.syn. with Prodinapsis, creating the new combinations Prodinapsis bruesin.comb. and Prodinapsis prolatan.comb. When comparing past and present distributions of Megalyridae with the results of the phylogenetic analyses, it is evident that the genera radiated in the Mesozoic, and that the family as a whole was much more widespread then. The present‐day distribution is essentially relictual, with range contraction since the early Tertiary probably being the result of climate deterioration, which caused the disappearance of tropical forests throughout the Palaearctic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalyridae 3aTrigonalidae 3aclimate 3adata collection 3afossils 3anew combination 3aparasitic wasps 3aphylogeny 3atropical forests1 aPerrichot, Vincent,1 aSHAW, SCOTT R.0 tSystematic entomology.g2010 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.658-677dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2010.00537.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245013900189300001400328500001500342520131600357592002801673650001601701650001701717650002401734650002601758650001801784650001201802650001601814650001901830650002601849650001701875650001001892650001701902650001701919650001301936650001901949650004001968650001302008650002002021650003802041650001702079650001702096650001902113650001602132650002402148650004002172650003302212650002502245650005202270650003602322650001002358650001002368651002502378653001802403700002002421700003102441700002702472700002702499700002702526773010302553856008402656852000902740655001202749IND4477791220221118060245.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447779122DNAL7 a220995182pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerdiguero, Pedro10aIdentification of water stress genes in Pinus pinaster Ait. by controlled progressive stress and suppression-subtractive hybridization  ap. 44-53.  a2019-12-06  aClimate change is a major challenge particularly for forest tree species, which will have to face the severe alterations of environmental conditions with their current genetic pool. Thus, an understanding of their adaptive responses is of the utmost interest. In this work we have selected Pinus pinaster as a model species. This pine is one of the most important conifers (for which molecular tools and knowledge are far more scarce than for angiosperms) in the Mediterranean Basin, which is characterised in all foreseen scenarios as one of the regions most drastically affected by climate change, mainly because of increasing temperature and, particularly, by increasing drought. We have induced a controlled, increasing water stress by adding PEG to a hydroponic culture. We have generated a subtractive library, with the aim of identifying the genes induced by this stress and have searched for the most reliable expressional candidate genes, based on their overexpression during water stress, as revealed by microarray analysis and confirmed by RT-PCR. We have selected a set of 67 candidate genes belonging to different functional groups that will be useful molecular tools for further studies on drought stress responses, adaptation, and population genomics in conifers, as well as in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aforest trees 3agene overexpression 3amicroarray technology 3ahybridization 3adrought 3ahydroponics 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3ametagenomics 3agenes 3awater stress 3aAngiospermae 3aconifers 3aPinus pinaster 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlobal Warming 2aHydroponics 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aNucleic Acid Hybridizationxmethods 2aPinusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPolyethylene Glycols 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aTrees 2aWater 0aMediterranean Region 0aMagnoliophyta1 aCollada, Carmen1 aBarbero, María del Carmen1 aGarcía Casado, Gloria1 aCervera, María Teresa1 aSoto Carmona, Álvaro,0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Jan., v. 50 p.44-53dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245012300208300001800331520075700349592002801106650001101134650001401145650002301159650003301182650001301215650001101228700002101239700005901260700005401319700005601373700002101429700005801450773013601508856008001644852000901724655001201733IND60644500820221122055341.0190516e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064450082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b017462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Rintaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2168-943610aObserving the Kinetic Pathway of Nanotube Formation from Bolaamphiphiles by Time-Resolved Small-Angle X-ray Scattering  ap. 4340-4345.  aWe investigated the formation kinetics of a single monolayer nanotube from bolaamphiphiles (consisting of a sugar residue, an alkyl chain, and an amino group) in solution. In this bolaamphiphile, a transition from a monomerically dispersed state to the nanotube takes place by changing the solvent condition. This transition was induced by fast mixing with a stopped-flow apparatus. From just after the mixing, this transition process was monitored in situ by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering. In this manner, we were able to derive the direct structural information as a function of time during the nanotube formation. The results revealed that disklike aggregates initially formed, which then grew and closed to produce a tubular structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3amixing 3ananotubes 3aphysical chemistry 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 3asugars1 aKawauchi, Hiroki1 aKameta, Naohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3541-58071 aLee, Ji Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4456-01281 aFujii, Shota1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6594-52111 aShimizu, Toshimi1 aSakurai, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9737-00610 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 123, no. 19 p.4340-4345dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b017463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245014300208300001400351506007600365520131800441592002801759506003701787650001901824650001501843650001601858650001901874650001801893650002601911650001101937650002201948650002001970650001701990700002502007700002502032700001702057700001902074700002202093700002502115700001702140700002502157773009302182856008402275852000902359655001202368IND60113054520221207083617.0141111e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011305452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0792doi7 aPMC56280202pmcid7 a233803662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Serenus10aIsomer-specific chromatographic profiling yields highly sensitive and specific potential N-glycan biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer  ap. 58-67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAberrant glycosylation has been observed for decades in essentially all types of cancer, and is now well established as an indicator of carcinogenesis. Mining the glycome for biomarkers, however, requires analytical methods that can rapidly separate, identify, and quantify isomeric glycans. We have developed a rapid-throughput method for chromatographic glycan profiling using microfluidic chip-based nanoflow liquid chromatography (nano-LC)/mass spectrometry. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we analyzed and compared serum samples from epithelial ovarian cancer cases (n=46) and healthy control individuals (n=48). Over 250 N-linked glycan compound peaks with over 100 distinct N-linked glycan compositions were identified. Statistical testing identified 26 potential glycan biomarkers based on both compositional and structure-specific analyses. Using these results, an optimized model was created incorporating the combined abundances of seven potential glycan biomarkers. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this optimized model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, indicating robust discrimination between cancer cases and healthy controls. Rapid-throughput chromatographic glycan profiling was found to be an effective platform for structure-specific biomarker discovery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal ovaries 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarcinogenesis 3aglycosylation 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3aovarian neoplasms 3apolysaccharides 3aspectroscopy1 aWilliams, Cynthia C.1 aDimapasoc, Lauren M.1 aRo, Grace S.1 aOzcan, Sureyya1 aMiyamoto, Suzanne1 aLebrilla, Carlito B.1 aAn, Hyun Joo1 aLeiserowitz, Gary S.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 1279 p.58-67dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015700166300001800323520131500341592002801656650001601684650001701700650001101717650001501728650004201743650001201785650001701797650002401814650002501838650002201863650001401885650001301899650001701912653001601929653002501945653002601970653002001996653002302016653002602039700002002065700001302085700001602098700001702114700001302131700001502144700001702159773013702176856008702313852000902400655001202409IND60614405820221120223807.0190131e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061440582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiang14aThe first complete mitochondrial genome from the family Hygrophoraceae (Hygrophorus russula) by next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic implications  ap. 1313-1320.  aHygrophorus russula (Schaeff.) Kauffman is an edible ectomycorrhizal fungus that is widely distributed in the world. In this study, the mitogenome of H. russula was sequenced and assembled. The mitogenome of H. russula is composed of circular DNA molecules, with a total size of 55,769 bp. Further analysis indicated that the frequent use of A and T in codons contributes to the high AT content (80.87%) in the H. russula mitogenome. Comparative analysis indicated that the length and base composition of the core protein-encoding genes, and the number of tRNA genes in the H. russula mitogenome varied from that of other Agaricales mitogenomes. Gene arrangement analysis revealed a novel gene order in the H. russula mitogenome. In addition, the expansion of the mitogenome in Agaricales was found to be closely related to the increase in the number of introns. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined mitochondrial gene set showed strong support for tree topologies, and H. russula was determined to be relatively distant from other Agaricales species. This study is the first report on the mitogenome of a member of genus Hygrophorus as well as family Hygrophoraceae, which improves our understanding of mitochondrial differentiation and evolution in the important ectomycorrhizal fungi Hygrophorus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHygrophorus 3acircular DNA 3acodons 3agene order 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintrons 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3amitochondrial genome 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphylogeny 3atopology 3atransfer RNA 0aHygrophorus 0aMitochondrial genome 0aProtein-encoding gene 0aRepeat sequence 0aGene rearrangement 0aPhylogenetic analysis1 aWang, Qiangfeng1 aJin, Xin1 aChen, Zuqin1 aXiong, Chuan1 aLi, Ping1 aZhao, Jian1 aHuang, Wenli0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 122 p.1313-1320dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011800163300001600281520167500297592002801972650001302000650001202013650001202025650001202037650001902049650002102068650001502089650003002104650001102134650002602145650002202171650001602193650001002209700001502219700001702234700003002251700002002281773009602301856007302397852000902470655001202479IND60082126220221120154313.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212622DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.120972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía De León, D10aCan the storage effect hypothesis explain weed co‐existence on the Broadbalk long‐term fertiliser experiment?  ap. 445-456.  aUnderstanding how plant species with similar resource requirements co‐exist has been a long‐standing ecological question with several theoretical explanations. One potential mechanism is the storage effect hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, species co‐exist because they differ in when they are most actively using resource and, therefore, respond differently to environmental perturbation. The hypothesis is based on two main assumptions: (i) two competitors have different responses to climate and (ii) the responses to climate are mediated by changes in the relative importance of intra‐ and interspecific competition. The hypothesis could provide useful insights into the role of climate in maintaining weed species diversity and potential shifts in dominant species under climate change. This study tested the basic principles of the storage effect hypothesis on weed communities using data from the Broadbalk long‐term fertiliser experiment. Relative abundance of weeds in 10 plots with contrasting fertility but no herbicides was assessed for 21 years. Multivariate analyses and generalised additive mixed models were used to analyse the data. The following pairs of species were found to be adapted to similar fertiliser levels, but diverged in their response to climate: (i) Papaver rhoeas–Tripleurospermum inodorum, (ii) Medicago lupulina–Vicia sativa and (iii) Scandix pecten‐veneris–Ranunculus arvensis. Contrasting responses to spring temperature within these species pairs modified the competition balance providing evidence for the storage effect hypothesis and helping to explain weed co‐existence in the Broadbalk experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago 3aPapaver 3aScandix 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afertilizer rates 3aherbicides 3ainterspecific competition 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aweeds1 aStorkey, J1 aMoss, S.

In this study, a two-step pretreatment with dilute sulfuric acid and aqueous ammonia was performed efficiently on rice straw to obtain fermentable sugar. The soaking in aqueous ammonia process was also optimized by a statistical method. RESULTS: Response surface methodology was employed. The determination coefficient (R²) value was found to be 0.9607 and the coefficient of variance was 6.77. The optimal pretreatment conditions were a temperature of 42.75°C, an aqueous ammonia concentration of 20.93%, and a reaction time of 48 h. The optimal enzyme concentration for saccharification was 30 filter paper units. The crystallinity index was approximately 60.23% and the Fourier transform infrared results showed the distinct peaks of glucan. Ethanol production using Saccharomyces cerevisiae K35 was performed to verify whether the glucose saccharified from rice straw was fermentable. CONCLUSIONS: The combined pretreatment using dilute sulfuric acid and aqueous ammonia on rice straw efficiently yielded fermentable sugar and achieved almost the same crystallinity index as that of α-cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aammonia 3abiomass 3acrystal structure 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice straw 3asaccharification 3asoaking 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3avariance1 aYi, Sang-jun,1 aLee, Ju Hun1 aJung, You Ree1 aThapa, Laxmi Prasad1 aKim, Jun Seok1 aUm, Youngsoon1 aPark, Chulhwan1 aKim, Seung Wook0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.333-333dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245009100150300001600241520158700257592002801844650002801872650002101900650003101921650001901952650001301971651001001984651001101994651001802005651001102023700001902034700001202053700001502065700003002080773009602110856007302206852000902279655001202288IND60082126320221120154220.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212632DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.121002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Z10aPotential distribution of two Ambrosia species in China under projected climate change  ap. 520-531.  aThe invasion of Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida from their native range to occupy large areas in China has raised considerable concern. Using the maximum entropy (Maxent) method, we developed models for each Ambrosia species, based on occurrence records from both native ranges (North America) and their invaded ranges (e.g. northern and south‐western Europe) to predict the availability and distribution of suitable habitats for these two species in China. For each species, we also assessed potential shifts in habitat suitability for the year 2050, using three general circulation models (GCMs) and two emission scenarios. Elevation and average mean precipitation in October contributed most to model development for both species. Potential distribution projections under future climatic change scenarios suggested an averaged percentage of suitable area (2.21%) and habitat gain (1.49%) in A. artemisiifolia distribution, with further expansion to environmentally favourable locations in south‐east coastal regions, northern Taiwan and the Beijing–Tianjin–Tangshan area in northern China. Future predicted percentage of suitable area for A. trifida was 0.03% with a very limited suitable habitat gain of <1% although this species had the potential to continue to spread in northern China. Our findings suggest that management priorities should be focused on A. artemisiifolia, whilst effective control strategies for A. trifida may be optimised by concentrating efforts on those relatively fewer regions of China where the species is currently abundant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3aAmbrosia trifida 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate change 3ahabitats 3aChina 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aTaiwan1 aDiTommaso, A.,1 aWu, R S1 aHuang, H Y1 aGonzalez‐Andujar, José0 tWeed research.g2014 Oct., v. 54, no. 5 p.520-531d[Wiley-Blackwell, etc.]x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.121003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011200165300001600277520105700293592002801350650001401378650001601392650001201408650002701420650002201447650001901469650002201488653002501510653003001535653002301565700001801588700001801606700001901624700001501643700001601658700001201674773011601686856008601802852000901888655001201897IND60561066220221120045529.0170719e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056106622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jie10aStructural features and thermal property of propionylated starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratio  ap. 123-130.  aThis work concerned the effects of amylose/amylopectin ratio on the structure and thermal stability of propionylated starches with high degree of substitution (DS). Four starches with different amylose content were used to obtain propionylated starches. Acylation partly disrupted granule morphology of native starches, and the imperfection and porous structures of starch granule were intensified along with the increased amylose content. It was noted that the crystalline structure of starch was destroyed and thus intense acylation occurred in both amorphous and crystalline regions. The acylated starch with high-amylose content displayed more ordered region compared to low-amylose starch. Acylation enhanced the thermal stability of starch, and this effect became more evident as the amylose content increased.

Knowledge of the characteristics of the soil helps in determining the crop choices, irrigation scheduling, soil amendment needs, general drainage requirements, and crop management practices needed to maintain optimal soil conditions for plant growth. Soil Survey information is an important component of technology transfer. Misallocation of factors of production across heterogeneous production units is important in explaining differences in measured productivity across farms. To assess the role of soil information in minimizing fertilizer misallocation, we consider soil resources information and the package of practices for crops as a benchmark for comparing fertilizer requirements for each of diverse farm households. We calculate the fertilizer use deviation from soil test-based fertilizer requirement and blanket recommendations as misallocation. This paper focused on identifying the land resources constraints and potential status of Nanjevanapura village in Udigala Horticultural Producers Company, Chamarajnagar district, Karnataka which was established in 2016 by the Department of Horticulture, Government of Karnataka. Keeping in view the objectives of FPO, an attempt was made to study land resources inventory and provide the land resources information for enhancing the efficiency in horticultural production. The extent of fertilizer misallocation in the cultivation of tomato crop across the farms shows that there is considerable scope for reducing the excess application of Rs-1095(ranging from Rs -180 to Rs -2170) and deficit application of Rs 808 (ranging from Rs320 to Rs 1350) per ha. This conclusively supports the argument for avoiding the cost of fertilizer misallocation besides its impact on soil fertility degradation. Thus, using soil information, it is possible to reduce the cost of cultivation, enhancing productivity and long-term sustainability of Farmers Producer Companies as they have to identify the production clusters and estimate the correct input requirements for production planning of FPO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop management 3adrainage 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3ahorticulture 3ainventories 3aland management 3aplant growth 3aresearch 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3asoil surveys 3atechnology transfer 3atomatoes 3avillages 3aIndia1 aHegde, Rajendra1 aDwivedi, B.

The species appeared in Siberia as an unpretentious ornamental plant around the middle of the 20th century. Cases of withdrawal from culture have been recorded since the 1970s and 1980s; mass naturalization began at the end of the 20th century. Currently, the species is common in many regions of Siberia, but the most active in the Altai Territory, the Altai Republic, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Irkutsk Regions. It is common in anthropogenic habitats; it can also often be found in suburban forests, ravines, along the banks of water bodies. It shows tolerance to habitat conditions, but is especially active in areas with a close occurrence of groundwater on humus-rich soils. The species richness of I. glandulifera communities is from 10-15 to 40 species. In total, about 100 species of vascular plants were recorded in I. glandulifera communities in Siberia  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3aSiberia 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3aornamental plants 3aspecies richness1 aWojciech, Adamowski1 aSvetlana, Mikhailova1 aAlla, Verkhozina1 aElena, Zykova1 aSvetlana, Sheremetova0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 31 p.00004-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202131000043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245003900165300001300204520067000217592002800887650002400915650001300939650001100952650002300963650001600986700002501002700001501027700001701042700002101059700001501080773015501095856008101250852000901331655001201340IND60627369120221118011028.0190128e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062736912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-1499-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiufeng10aSynthesis of BaMoO4 hollow spheres  ap. 6716.  aBased on the “polymer-cation templates” technique, well-defined BaMoO₄ hollow spheres with an average diameter of 2.3 μm have been synthesized via a simple precipitation reaction between BaCl₂ and (NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄ · 4H₂O at room temperature in the presence of poly(methacrylic acid).

Having been in widespread use for the last 80 years, at an estimated cost of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars each year, the effectiveness of these structures is still widely debated in the literature. Many studies of varying quality have been undertaken that attempt to address this issue, but it has proved difficult for practitioners to develop a consensus regarding the utility of these structures, despite their continued use. Systematic review methodology was used to formally synthesize empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of engineered in‐stream structures as a management tool to increase salmonid abundance. Meta‐analysis shows that evidence regarding the effectiveness of in‐stream devices is equivocal. Heterogeneity is significant both for population size and local habitat preference. This heterogeneity is related to stream width, with in‐stream devices being less effective in larger streams. Consequently, widespread use of in‐stream structures for restoration, particularly in larger streams, is not supported by the current scientific evidence base.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3acost estimates 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahydraulic structures 3ameta-analysis 3apopulation size 3astreams 3asystematic review1 aBayliss, Helen R.1 aShowler, David A.1 aSutherland, William J.1 aPullin, Andrew S.0 tEcological applications.g2009 June, v. 19, no. 4 p.931-941dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1311.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012000158300001600278500002000294520124200314592002801556650002301584650001201607650002901619650001401648650001101662650001201673650002201685650001401707650002301721651001501744700002201759700002001781700002001801700002301821773013001844856007401974852000902048655001202057IND60587560820221117205224.0180319e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058756082DNAL7 a10.1890/08-0135.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraje, Todd J.10aFishing from past to present: continuity and resilience of red abalone fisheries on the Channel Islands, California  ap. 906-919.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArchaeological data from coastal shell middens provide a window into the structure of ancient marine ecosystems and the nature of human impacts on fisheries that often span millennia. For decades Channel Island archaeologists have studied Middle Holocene shell middens visually dominated by large and often whole shells of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Here we use modern ecological data, historical accounts, commercial red abalone catch records, and zooarchaeological data to examine long‐term spatial and temporal variation in the productivity of red abalone fisheries on the Northern Channel Islands, California (USA). Historical patterns of abundance, in which red abalone densities increase from east to west through the islands, extend deep into the Holocene. The correlation of historical and archaeological data argue for long‐term spatial continuity in productive red abalone fisheries and a resilience of abalone populations despite dramatic ecological changes and intensive human predation spanning more than 8000 years. Archaeological, historical, and ecological data suggest that California kelp forests and red abalone populations are structured by a complex combination of top‐down and bottom‐up controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis rufescens 3aabalone 3aanthropogenic activities 3afisheries 3ahumans 3aislands 3amarine ecosystems 3apredation 3atemporal variation 3aCalifornia1 aErlandson, Jon M.1 aRick, Torben C.1 aDayton, Paul K.1 aHatch, Marco B.

This paper explores the feasibility of the take-back regulation operating under a collection target and a reuse target. Two models using different regulation setups are developed to show the effects of a take-back regulation on consumer surplus, the benefits to the supply chain, and social welfare. The results suggest that the optimal strategies of the manufacturer depend on the regulation model applied. Setting higher regulation targets decreases the manufacturer’s profit, but the chain benefits from the reuse target. To achieve a high collection rate and reuse efficiency, policy makers should set a high collection target and a high reuse target. To improve the social welfare, a low collection target and a high reuse target should be set. This study provides some suggestions for the manufacturer to cope with regulation targets and offers some guidelines for policy makers to set and implement the regulation targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer surplus 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apaper 3aproducer responsibility 3asocial welfare 3asupply chain 0aTake-back 0aCollection target 0aReuse target 0aRemanufacturing 0aClosed loop supply chain1 aBangyi, Li1 aZonghuo, Li1 aGoh, Mark1 aShanting, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 283 p.124576-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012600175300001400301520136100315592002801676650001801704650002101722650002201743650001101765650002401776650000901800650001201809650001901821651001001840653001301850653001801863653001001881653001401891653001601905700001801921700002001939700001901959773025701978856008202235852000902317655001202326IND60734163320221120075441.0220110e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073416332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hpj.2021.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, Girme Aoudumbar10aChloroplast gene matK holds the barcodes for identification of Momordica (Cucurbitaceae) species from Indian subcontinent  ap. 89-98.  aDNA barcoding is a supplementary tool in plant systematics, extensively used to resolve the species level controversies. This paper details the identification of DNA barcodes for seven species of Momordica, using the chloroplast gene matK. Since the species M. cymbalaria has been confused as a member of the genus Luffa, 26 accessions of Momordica belonging to seven Indian species and two accessions of Luffa acutangula were included in this study. Analysis of matK sequences has yielded distinct barcodes in M. charantia var. charantia, M. subangulata subsp. renigera, M. cochinchinensis, M. balsamina, M. cymbalaria and also in Luffa acutangula. Evolutionary status of each species was reflected as nucleotide polymorphisms in each sequence. The wild species M. dioica and M. sahyadrica have yielded one barcode but failed to get differentiated. Further, this study provides conclusive proof that M. cymbalaria is a member of Momordica genus. The phylogram generated was successful to distinguish the monoecious species of this genus, M. charantia, M. balsamina and M. cymbalaria, from the dioecious species M. dioica, M. sahyadrica, M. subangulata subsp. renigera and M. cochinchinensis.

A total of 596 Salmonella isolated from culture of 29 896 faecal samples of patients with acute diarrhoea were included in this study. Faecal samples were collected from local hospitals and clinics in Gwangju area during January 2000–December 2009. The mean annual frequency of isolates for the 10 years was 2.0% (range, 0.9–6.0). The isolates were serologically classified into 43 different serotypes. The 10 most common serotypes were Salmonella Enteritidis (47.9%), S. Typhimurium (20.4%), S. Braenderup (3.2%), S. Montevideo (2.9%), S. Paratyphi B (2.9%), S. London (2.3%), S. Bardo (1.7%), S. Virchow (1.7%), S. Infantis (1.5%) and S. Typhi (1.5%), accounting for 86% of all the isolates. Temporal variations were observed in the distribution of different Salmonella serotypes over the years, and only S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium were persistent throughout the study period. Although age specificity varied with serotypes, Salmonella was isolated most frequently from children below 5 years of age (179/596, 30.0%). A seasonal trend was apparent, and the highest rates were found in the summer months. This is the first report of the annual frequency of isolation of Salmonella serotypes, and seasonal and age‐specific patterns of salmonellosis in humans in Gwangju area, Korea, over a decade‐long period.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiarrhea 3ahumans 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3ahospitals 3aserotypes 3afeces 3achildren 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3apatients 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aO Antigensximmunology 2aPrevalence 2aSalmonellaxclassification 2aSalmonella Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSalmonella enteritidisxclassification 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxclassification 2aSeasons 2aSerotyping 2aYoung Adult 3aKorean Peninsula 0aKorea (South)xepidemiology. 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aKim, M.

Often, interest lies in how the hypothesized dependencies differ between groups. Multigroup comparisons can be made by imposing various constraints: constraints on the topology, the path coefficients, the residual variances, and more. To date, only classical path analysis and structural equation modeling can account for differences between groups. These techniques have assumptions that are often not appropriate for ecological studies. The d‐sep test and the recently developed generalized chi‐squared test relax many of these assumptions for path models that can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but are currently lacking a multigroup test. In this paper, we develop a multigroup extension to the d‐sep test. Furthermore, we show how a recently developed generalized chi‐squared test and AIC for DAGs can be used for multigroup testing. The approaches are illustrated by a worked example and implemented in the commonly used statistical package, R. Practical recommendations for multigroup modeling are made, and advantages and disadvantages of the multigroup d‐sep and the chi‐squared test are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a863.14.018cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aequations 3apath analysis 3atopology1 aShipley, Bill1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7026-38800 tEcosphere.g2021 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.e03502-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.35023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013500171300001600306520208100322592002802403650002702431650002002458650002202478650001602500650002302516650001302539650001802552650001302570650001102583650001402594650001302608653002702621653003302648653003902681653002602720653002102746700005502767700005502822773011902877856008802996852000903084655001203093IND60635820320221121060633.0190523e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063582032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shunhui10aEnantioselective degradation and bioaccumulation of sediment-associated fipronil in Lumbriculus variegatus: Toxicokinetic analysis  ap. 335-341.  aEnantioselective degradation and biotransformation are critical processes affecting the bioaccumulation and toxicity of chiral pesticides in the environment. In the present study, enantioselective uptake, biotransformation and elimination of a current use pesticide, fipronil in a benthic invertebrate, Lumbriculus variegatus were assessed using a sediment bioaccumulation test. Toxicokinetic models were constructed to quantitatively describe kinetic processes of fipronil enantiomers. The degradation of fipronil in sediment significantly affected chemical uptake, thus degradation kinetic model was incorporated into toxicokinetic modeling. It was shown that S-(+)-fipronil degraded faster than R-(−)-fipronil in sediment, with dissipation rate constants being 0.090 ± 0.008 and 0.023 ± 0.006 1/d, respectively. As a result, R-(−)-enantiomer preferentially accumulated in sediment over time. Similarly, higher concentrations of R-(−)-fipronil were detected in L. variegatus compared with S-(+)-fipronil. Toxicokinetic modeling showed R-(−)-fipronil had larger uptake and elimination rate coefficients and apparent maximum reaction rate, but a smaller apparent half-saturation constant than S-(+)-fipronil. Preferential uptake of R-(−)-fipronil from sediment to L. variegatus was the main reason for greater R-(−)-fipronil concentrations in organism. Biotransformation of fipronil in L. variegatus was also enantioselective, yet it played fewer roles on enantioselective bioaccumulation than uptake. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of selective degradation, uptake and biotransformation of sediment-associated fipronil on its enantioselective bioaccumulation in benthic invertebrates, which helps to improve the accuracy for assessing aquatic toxicity of the chiral pesticide.Enantioselective bioaccumulation of sediment-associated fipronil in Lumbriculus variegatus was quantitatively explained by selective degradation, uptake, biotransformation and elimination parameters using a combination of degradation and toxicokinetic modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumbriculus variegatus 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3afipronil 3ainvertebrates 3akinetics 3amodels 3asediments 3atoxicity 0aToxicokinetic modeling 0aEnantioselective degradation 0aEnantioselective biotransformation 0aBenthic invertebrates 0aChiral pesticide1 aLi, Huizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5200-19161 aYau, Ching,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4006-83390 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 01, v. 672 p.335-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.4903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012600161300001800287500002000305520204600325592002802371650002302399650001402422650001102436650001202447650001502459650002102474650001002495650001402505650001602519650001102535650001402546650002402560650001402584650000902598650001002607650001202617650002502629650001602654650001102670700001902681700002002700700002102720773013202741856007402873852000902947655001202956IND60587561020221117205221.0180319e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058756102DNAL7 a10.1890/08-1699.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, Douglas P.10aAssessing threats to species at risk using stage‐structured state–space models: mortality trends in skate populations  ap. 1347-1364.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulation models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Data to support modeling is limited for many species at risk, and commonly used approaches generally assume stationary vital rates, a questionable assumption given widespread ecosystem change. We describe a modeling approach that can be applied to time series of length composition data to estimate vital rates and test for changes in these rates. Our approach uses stage‐structured population models fit within a Bayesian state–space model. This approach simultaneously allows for both process and observation uncertainty, and it facilitates incorporating prior information on population dynamics and on the monitoring process. We apply these models to populations of winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) that have been designated as “endangered” or “threatened.” These models indicate that natural mortality has decreased for juveniles and increased for adults in these populations. The declines observed in these populations had been attributed to unsustainable rates of bycatch in fisheries for other groundfishes; our analyses indicate that increased natural mortality of adults is also an important factor contributing to these declines. Adult natural mortality was positively related to grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) abundance, suggesting the hypothesis that increased adult mortality reflected increased predation by expanding grey seal herds. Population projections indicated that the threatened population would be expected to stabilize at a low level of abundance if all fishery removals were eliminated, but that the endangered population would likely continue to decline even in the absence of fishery removals. We note that time series of size distributions are available for most marine fish populations monitored by research surveys, and we suggest that a similar approach could be used to extract information from these time series in order to estimate mortality rates and changes in these rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalichoerus grypus 3aLeucoraja 3aadults 3abycatch 3aecosystems 3afish communities 3aherds 3ajuveniles 3amarine fish 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3arisk 3aseals 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awinter1 aJonsen, Ian D.1 aSimon, James E.1 aMyers, Ransom A.0 tEcological applications.g2009 July, v. 19, no. 5 p.1347-1364dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1699.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011500198300001800313500002000331520130600351592002801657596004501685650003701730650001601767650001101783650001201794650001601806650001201822650002701834650001401861650002101875650001101896650001101907650001101918650001001929650000901939650001001948700006301958700005702021700005702078700006102135700005802196773012102254856007402375852000902449655001202458IND60773966620221119083116.0220420e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077396662DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.180652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArend, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-066710aLack of hydraulic recovery as a cause of post‐drought foliage reduction and canopy decline in European beech  ap. 1195-1205.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEuropean beech (Fagus sylvatica) was among the most affected tree species during the severe 2018 European drought. It not only suffered from instant physiological stress but also showed severe symptoms of defoliation and canopy decline in the following year. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we used the Swiss‐Canopy‐Crane II site and studied in branches of healthy and symptomatic trees the repair of hydraulic function and concentration of carbohydrates during the 2018 drought and in 2019. We found loss of hydraulic conductance in 2018, which did not recover in 2019 in trees that developed defoliation symptoms in the year after drought. Reduced branch foliation in symptomatic trees was associated with a gradual decline in wood starch concentration throughout summer 2019. Visualization of water transport in healthy and symptomatic branches in the year after the drought confirmed the close relationship between xylem functionality and supported branch leaf area. Our findings showed that embolized xylem does not regain function in the season following a drought and that sustained branch hydraulic dysfunction is counterbalanced by the reduction in supported leaf area. It suggests acclimation of leaf development after drought to mitigate disturbances in canopy hydraulic function.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss Federal Office for the Environment 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aacclimation 3acanopy 3adecline 3adefoliation 3adrought 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf area 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3astarch 3asummer 3atrees 3awood 3axylem1 aLink, Roman Mathias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0588-37571 aZahnd, Cedric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0930-56581 aHoch, Günter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0985-97461 aSchuldt, Bernhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4738-52891 aKahmen, Ansgar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7823-51630 tThe new phytologist.g2022 May, v. 234, no. 4 p.1195-1205dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.180653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05155naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006700140245014800207300001600355500001100371506002800382520273100410592002803141596005603169596006203225596014903287506003703436650001903473650001703492650003003509650001903539650002703558650002003585650002203605650001803627650001203645650002203657650002103679650002003700650001103720650001103731650002503742650001303767650002203780650003003802650002103832650001803853650002803871650001003899650000903909700006903918700006203987700005504049700006304104700007504167700007204242773011904314856007504433852000904508655001204517IND60750476120221207114359.0220826e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075047612DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.101992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez‐Moreno, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5216-831310aEdible mycorrhizal fungi of the world: What is their role in forest sustainability, food security, biocultural conservation and climate change?  ap. 471-490.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Access  aEdible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) have been consumed since ancestral times by humans either as food, medicine or for ceremonial use. Nowadays, they are a non‐timber forest product and a diverse genetic resource with great ecological, sociocultural, economic, medicinal and biotechnological relevance around the world. Therefore, they have a paramount role to play in meeting the United Nations global sustainable development goals 2030. EMF may promote forest sustainability, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through the maintenance of forest masses, human nutrition and health, economic development, conservation of biocultural heritages, women empowerment and hunger mitigation. We provide a worldwide review of the knowledge, biodiversity, novel approaches, future challenges and perspectives in the post‐COVID era of this important genetic resource whose relevance has usually received marginal attention despite its strategic global significance. SUMMARY: Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They have a paramount importance in nutrient cycling, plant protection against pathogens and abiotic stress, and establishment of underground networks that connect trees and other plants in nature, therefore being the wood wide web, the ‘internet’ of the forests. According to our literature review, globally 970 mycorrhizal fungal species (including both mushrooms and truffles) are edible, and they have enormous relevance either as a source of subsistence in low‐income human groups around the world or as an important economic component whose international commerce is worth billions of American dollars annually. Since edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a non‐timber forest product, their sustainable use and management is crucial in order to maintain forest stands and to provide well‐being to the human communities surrounding the forested areas where they grow. In different parts of the world, different cultures have developed a traditional knowledge of EMF over millennia. Their knowledge might play an important role in food supply and food security in the future, hence contributing towards the “zero hunger” global goal. The biotechnological development of EMF has also been crucial in the establishment of plantations, or successful reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a worldwide review of how EMF might contribute to forest sustainability, food supply, biocultural conservation, and hunger and climate change mitigation is addressed by analysing the similarities, contrasts and challenges in all five continents.  aPublisher supplied data  cMexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)  a31961143010cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aA314021402‐2002cOpen‐Funds of Scientific Research Programs of State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3aectomycorrhizae 3afood availability 3afood security 3aforests 3agenetic resources 3agreenhouse gases 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3ahunger 3aindigenous knowledge 3amedicine 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anontimber forest products 3aplant protection 3areforestation 3asustainable development 3atrade 3awood1 aGuerin‐Laguette, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9845-99061 aRinaldi, Andrea C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9352-10371 aYu, Fuqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7931-080X1 aVerbeken, Annemieke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6266-30911 aHernández‐Santiago, Faustino1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2374-22611 aMartínez‐Reyes, Magdalena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2352-917X0 tPlants, people, planet.g2021 Sept., v. 3, no. 5 p.471-490dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.101993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163300001600266520167000282592002801952650001601980650004301996650002602039650002202065650002902087650001302116650001002129650001302139651001002152651001102162700001802173700001402191700001902205700001802224700002102242773009702263852000902360856008102369655001202450IND60440141820221118023924.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044014182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-008-0151-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuchugi, A.10aGenetic structuring of important medicinal species of genus Warburgia as revealed by AFLP analysis  ap. 787-795.  aThe genus Warburgia (Canellaceae) contains four tree species that are of valuable medicinal importance and are all found in Africa. Genetic diversity present in wild populations of these species is under great threat due to unsustainable harvesting for medicines and indiscriminate felling for timber and agricultural expansion. There is therefore an urgent need for conservation of these species. Some authors disagree about the taxonomy of the genus and list different species as synonyms. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to determine the genetic relationships between three species to resolve the taxonomic confusion. The amount of genetic variation within and among populations was assessed to guide strategies for their conservation and sustainable utilization. Four AFLP primer pairs (EcoRI/MseI) generated a total of 185 amplification products. Analysis of molecular variance revealed most variation among individuals within populations (63%, P < 0.0001), but variation among populations (37%, P < 0.0001) was highly significant as well. Constrained analysis of principal coordinates based on the Jaccard distance confirmed the separation among populations (38.2%, P < 0.0001). A phenetic tree and ordination graphs showed a clear distinction of W. ugandensis from W. salutaris and W. stuhlmannii. W. ugandensis populations from Uganda and western Kenya formed a subgroup that clustered away from the rest of the W. ugandensis populations. W. salutaris and W. stuhlmannii populations showed little genetic differentiation. An implication of the data to genetic management and taxonomic clarification is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanellaceae 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3amultidimensional scaling 3ataxonomy 3atrees 3avariance 3aKenya 3aUganda1 aMuluvi, G.

Nevertheless, studies on the occurrence of chemicals in feminine hygiene products have received little attention. In this study, 24 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), comprising nine phthalates, six parabens, eight bisphenols, and triclocarban (TCC) were measured in seven categories of feminine hygiene products (i.e., pads, panty liners, tampons, wipes, bactericidal creams and solutions, and deodorant sprays and powders; N = 77) collected in the Albany area of New York State in the United States. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), methyl paraben (MeP), and ethyl paraben (EtP) were found in all pad, panty liner, and tampon samples. Panty liners contained the highest concentrations of DMP (median: 249 ng/g), DEP (386 ng/g), DBP (393 ng/g), and DIBP (299 ng/g) and tampons contained the highest concentrations of DEHP (267 ng/g). MeP, EtP, and propyl paraben (PrP) were the major parabens found in feminine hygiene products. Bactericidal creams and solutions contained median concentrations of MeP, EtP and PrP at 2840, 734, and 278 ng/g, respectively. The estimated exposure doses of phthalates, parabens, and bisphenols through the dermal absorption pathway from the use of pads, panty liners, and tampons were significant. In comparison with the exposure doses reported previously from other sources and pathways, the significance of feminine hygiene products as sources of EDC exposure was delineated. The dermal absorption doses from the use of feminine hygiene products, under different exposure scenarios, were 0.19–27.9% and 0.01–6.2% of the total exposure doses of phthalates and bisphenols, respectively. This is the first study to report the occurrence of phthalates, parabens, bisphenols, and TCC in feminine hygiene products from the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3aanti-infective agents 3adeodorants 3adermal exposure 3adibutyl phthalate 3adiethyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3aplasticizers 3apowders 3askin absorption 3awomen 3aNew York 0aPhthalates 0aBisphenols 0aAntimicrobials 0aTampons 0aNapkins 0aDeodorant spray1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.105465-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1054653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013300168500002200301520151200323592002801835650002501863650001801888650001901906650003101925650001501956650001401971650002001985650001502005650001802020650001702038650002402055650002002079650001602099653001402115653004302129653001702172653003002189700001402219700001602233700001702249700001202266700001802278700001702296773011702313856005202430852000902482655001202491IND60792425020221120032021.0220906e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079242502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2022.1091512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huiying10aShort-term exposure of HFD depresses intestinal cholinergic anti-inflammatory activity through hypothalamic inflammation in mice  aPre-press version  aHigh fat diet (HFD) exposure has been proven to impair vagus nerve function. However, it is not yet known whether HFD challenge impacts vagal efferent-based intestinal cholinergic anti-inflammation activity. This investigation aims to evaluate the effect of HFD on intestinal cholinegic anti-inflammatory activity in mice. Mice with or without intracerebroventricular treatment with an antibody against toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were fed with HFD or standard chow for 2 weeks. Vagus nerve-based anti-inflammatory activity was analyzed by heart rate variability. Acetylcholine (ACh) content, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subtype (α7nAChR) and pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by biochemical kits or qRT-PCR. HFD feeding mice exhibit significant increase in high frequency (HF) and decrease in the ration of low frequency/HF, which were accompanied by lower ACh levels and α7nAChR mRNA expression in the intestinal segments. However, anti-TLR4 antibody-treated HFD mice showed normal ACh levels and α7nAChR mRNA expression in the intestinal segments. Moreover, TNF-α production in small intestine significantly reduced in HFD + antibody group compared with HFD + vehicle group. Collectively, our present results reveal that HFD challenge depresses intestinal cholinergic anti-inflammatory activity, which is mediated by hypothalamic inflammation. Impairment of intestinal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is the cause of intestinal low-grade inflammation by HFD consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aacetylcholine 3aacute exposure 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibodies 3acytokines 3agene expression 3aheart rate 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3anicotinic receptors 3asmall intestine 3avagus nerve 0aintestine 0acholinergic anti-inflammatory activity 0ahypothalamus 0atumour necrosis factor α1 aHu, Limei1 aZuo, Lijuan1 aNing, Gaijun1 aShi, Li1 aXu, Zhengrong1 aRen, Weidong0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2022 Aug. 19,  p.109151-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2022.109151  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169500001400245520164800259592002801907650001701935650002001952650002901972650001102001650001502012650001502027650002502042650002502067650001602092650001302108650001602121650002302137650001402160650001202174650001102186650001402197650001702211651001002228653003202238653003602270653002502306653002402331653003302355653003602388700001502424700001502439700001702454773011302471856008602584852000902670655001202679IND60714071720221123004423.0210114e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071407172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Mengyu10aLCA and LCCA based multi-objective optimization of pavement maintenance  aNAL-light  aWith growing maintenance demands whereas limited budgets, an integrated methodology unifying life-cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) and multi-objective optimization is proposed to establish maintenance decision-making system, considering performance, economic as well as environmental dimensions. Firstly, system scope and unit process of the methodology are redefined considering pavement industry in China. Next, assessment models and parameters are determined to establish the inventory. Then, LCCA is adopted to convert environmental footprint into an economically measurable unit - environmental damage cost (EDC). Lastly, a programming optimization is executed to obtain the optimal maintenance schedule over the whole pavement life cycle. To verify, a case study based on an existing highway in southeast China is conducted, considering ECA-10 thin overly (ECA-10), milling and resurfacing the upper layer (MRU) and hot-in-place rehabilitation (HR) strategies. Results indicate that user cost is the dominant factor whereas environmental impact is relatively negligible. Pavement design life and service life of maintenance alternatives have significant influence on the optimal schedule, and longer pavement design life should be considered when conducting LCA-based programming optimization. With the extension of design life, MRU shows the best long-term benefit. Materials and construction are the main stages potentially improved.

This experiment investigated the agronomic effects and runoff losses associated with different forms of P fertiliser applied to an irrigated dairy pasture (soils were Vertic Calcic Red Chromosols; average Olsen P, 50mg P/kg) in north-central Victoria, Australia. Single superphosphate (SSP), a sulfurised diammonium phosphate, or partially acidulated phosphate rock was surface-applied at 50kgP/ha in March 2005 to a border-check, flood-irrigated dairy pasture (ryegrass–white clover) ten days before a scheduled irrigation. Dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP) were measured in runoff from whole bays on one replicate and from microplots on all three replicates for a period of 9 weeks. In all runoff events and all treatments, concentrations of DRP and TP in runoff greatly exceeded water quality guidelines for acceptable limits (0.045mg P/L). The SSP resulted in significantly higher concentrations of P in runoff than the less water-soluble fertilisers. Even after the fifth irrigation, runoff from all fertilisers still exceeded the control. These results suggest that: (i) P fertilisers should not be applied in high-risk situations as insurance against yield loss; (ii) the current recommendation of withholding irrigation for 3 days after fertiliser application is insufficient to prevent potentially significant losses occurring; and (iii) runoff losses were dependent on the type of fertiliser applied, with a smaller proportion of P applied as sulfurised DAP lost in runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairies 3adiammonium phosphate 3afarming systems 3afertilizer application 3ainsurance 3airrigation 3apartially acidulated rock phosphate 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arunoff 3asoil 3asolubility 3asuperphosphate 3awater quality 3aAustralia 0awater quality 0aslowly soluble fertilisers 0airrigation 0amicroplots1 aQuin, B.

Geopolymerization offers a novel way for preparation of catalysts and possibility to use waste or industrial side-stream derived raw material as a resource for catalyst manufacturing. This work concentrates on metakaolin-based geopolymer materials that were prepared, characterized and tested as alternative environmentally benign catalyst supports for the oxidation of dichloromethane. The geopolymers with the Si/Al ratio of 1.5 were modified with HCl to increase their specific surface area, which is important in catalytic applications. Significant increase in specific surface areas was achieved via leaching of Na and Al from the geopolymer structure. Highest specific surface areas achieved for calcined geopolymers were over 500 m²g⁻¹. Use of acid concentrations higher than 1 M led to the dehydroxylation of the geopolymer. Dehydroxylation decreased the total acidity of geopolymer through the loss of the Brønsted acid sites, which are responsible for the adsorption of dichloromethane in the beginning of the catalytic reaction. Absence of Brønsted acid sites was observed by the formation of CH₂O as the only reaction intermediate. The best result in the dichloromethane oxidation was found with the geopolymer treated with 1 M HCl. Without using any additional active sites, the maximum dichloromethane conversion of 90% was reached at 525 °C with the maximum HCl yield of 83%. This result indicates the good potential of modified geopolymers to be used as catalyst supports in environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aconcentrates 3aleaching 3amanufacturing 3amethylene chloride 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3araw materials 3asurface area 3awastes 0aEnvironmental catalysis 0aNew catalytic materials 0aAcid leaching 0aOxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC)1 aSreenivasan, Harisankar1 aOjala, Satu1 aPitkäaho, Satu1 aLaitinen, Tiina1 aNiu, He1 aKeiski, Riitta L.1 aIllikainen, Mirja0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124584-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008600166300001400252520169700266592002801963650001601991650001502007650001902022650001602041650002602057650001502083650001302098650002102111650001402132650000902146650001002155650001502165650001902180650001602199650001902215653002102234653002302255653002402278700001502302700001802317700001402335700001402349773009402363856005102457852000902508655001202517IND60792425120221120032012.0220906e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079242512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2022.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Pengyu10aComposting effect and antibiotic removal under a new temperature control strategy  ap. 89-98.  aThe main objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a new temperature control strategy in the co-composting process to accelerate operation cycle and remove antibiotics from mixed organic wastes. The evaluation of the composting process showed that composting with temperature control (TC) was completed within 14 days. The final compost of TC exhibited a 10% higher degradation of organic matters, more humus formation and 11.25% lower heavy metals concentration than conventional composting (CC), which fully met the Chinese National Agricultural Organic Fertilizer Standard requirements. The degradation extent and kinetic of macrolides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones showed that the removal efficiency of total antibiotics in TC was 23.58% higher than CC, with less half-life, which was significantly correlated with higher temperature. Particularly, the highest removal was observed for sulfonamides (87.45%) in TC, the half-life of which was reduced by 75.95% compared with CC. The higher degradation rate was attributed to enhanced decomposition of unstable antibiotics and degrading activity of microbes at high temperature. The microbiological analysis showed that the external heating led to a distinct composition and succession of bacterial community in TC. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota were dominant and the emergence of Patescibacteria and Chloroflexi at cooling period in TC proved that the later composting environment was in an oligotrophic state. Current research provided a promising rapid composting approach for high-quality fertilizer production and antibiotic management in organic waste disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloroflexi 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aantibiotics 3abacterial communities 3acomposting 3acomposts 3afluoroquinolones 3ahalf life 3aheat 3ahumus 3amacrolides 3aorganic wastes 3atemperature 3awaste disposal 0aRapid composting 0aComposting product 0aBacterial community1 aLiu, Botao1 aAhmed, Imtiaz1 aYang, Jun1 aZhang, Bo0 tWaste management.g2022 Nov., v. 153 p.89-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2022.08.025  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245005300169520066300222592002800885650002500913650002400938650002300962650002000985653002201005653001801027653001401045700005801059773012401117856008401241852000901325655001201334IND60734164020221122225323.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073416402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaan, Corine M.10aAccessibility of green areas for local residents  aGreen spaces play an important role in urban areas.

To this end, it carried out a case study on a cell phone refurbishment company that is responsible for the reconditioning of cell phones; the company also receives returned cell phones from one of the largest cell phone manufacturers in Brazil. Another company collects waste from the refurbishing process and recycles the precious metals and plastic from the electronic electronics components. A number of propositions were made and confirmed through an interview conducted with the owner of the refurbishment company. It is concluded that the main reasons for the return of the product are the “buy back” process, irreparable and at the end of life cell phones. And from cell phones received from the manufacturer, it is estimated that about 15% of the products are returned to the market without remanufacturing, 15% are used for the salvaged components, and 70% are reconditioned for return to the market. The refurbishing process proved to be profitable because the annual cash flow approached USD 2.5 million and generated a profit of USD 226 thousand for the refurbishment company and prevents a discard of 4.5 tons/year of EEW, which gives an efficiency of 88% of all the cell phone manufactured by the company. Thus, the reverse logistics chain of the cellular manufacturing industry in Brazil has proved to be very sustainable, with zero net EEW.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectronics 3aflow 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3ametals 3amobile telephones 3aplastics 3arecycling 3awastes 3aBrazil 0aRefurbishing 0aCell phone waste 0aReverse logistics 0aSustainable development1 aGuerhardt, Flavio1 aFranzini, Carlos Eduardo1 aHo, Linda Lee,1 aRocha Ribeiro Júnior, Silvestre Eduardo1 aCânovas, Geovana1 aKenji Yamamura, Charles Lincoln1 aVanalle, Rosangela Maria1 aBerssaneti, Fernando Tobal0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 283 p.124585-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008700163300001600250520166700266592002801933650001301961650002401974650002301998650001302021650001102034650001702045650002002062650001702082650001202099650001802111650001302129650002902142650002002171653002602191653001702217653002102234653001202255700002102267700002202288700001302310773009602323856008502419852000902504655001202513IND60792425220221120032009.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079242522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2022.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yi,10aChemical-free pressure washing system as pretreatment to harvest cathode materials  ap. 121-128.  aRecycling cathode materials from spent lithium-ion batteries has the potential to reduce damages to the environment and human health due to hazardous waste treatment, and mitigate supply risks of raw materials. Related political incentives or regulations have led to increased research and development efforts on cathode recycling. Promising approaches include direct recycling and hydrometallurgical processes, where delamination is the first step after collection of cathodes. In this study, we examined a pressure washing system’s ability to harvest cathode materials. A high-pressure water jet provides strong forces to overcome the adhesion provided by organic binders. Four factors (water pressure, distance between nozzle and cathode, incident angle of water jet, and nozzle type) were investigated using a 3⁴⁻¹ fractional factorial design to screen important parameters and find the optimal conditions. Compared with other delamination processes where chemical reagents and heating are involved, the chemical-free pressure washing system can achieve separation in a few seconds (∼74 min/m²) at room temperature, which remarkably improves the efficiency of delamination. The particle size of recycled products (D50 of 31.87 μm) is significantly reduced without Al contamination from current collectors or morphological damages. In addition, three types of recycled cathode materials were used as inputs for the acid leaching process. High leaching efficiencies of lithium (>90 %) and cobalt (>85 %) suggest that the pressure washing system could be a practical, economical, and eco-friendly pretreatment process to harvest cathode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aambient temperature 3aangle of incidence 3acathodes 3acobalt 3adelamination 3ahazardous waste 3ahuman health 3alithium 3aparticle size 3apolitics 3aresearch and development 3awaste treatment 0aLithium-ion batteries 0aDelamination 0aPressure washing 0aCathode1 aJafvert, Chad T.1 aKpodzro, Edwin E.1 aZhao, Fu0 tWaste management.g2022 Nov., v. 153 p.121-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2022.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165300001600304520166900320592002801989650001902017650001602036650001002052650000902062650002802071650000902099650001702108650001302125650002202138650002002160650001102180650002102191650001302212650000902225650003102234650002502265650002202290650001802312650001202330650003002342650001602372650002202388650001302410650001502423650002002438650001602458650001002474650001202484650001702496700002802513700002002541700002002561700002602581700001902607700002402626773009702650852000902747856008102756655001202837IND60440142120221118023951.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044014212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-008-0134-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenaut, Jenny10aQuantitative proteomic analysis of short photoperiod and low-temperature responses in bark tissues of peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch)  ap. 589-600.  aIn the temperate climate of the northern hemisphere, winter survival of woody plants is determined by the ability to acclimate to freezing temperatures and to undergo a period of dormancy. Cold acclimation in many woody plants is initially induced by short photoperiod and low, non-freezing temperatures. These two factors (5°C and short photoperiod) were used to study changes in the proteome of bark tissues of 1-year-old peach trees. Difference in-gel electrophoresis technology, a gel-based approach involving the labeling of proteins with different fluorescent dyes, was used to conduct a quantitative assessment of changes in the peach bark proteome during cold acclimation. Using this approach, we were able to identify differentially expressed proteins and to assign them to a class of either ‘temperature-responsive’ or ‘photoperiod-responsive’ proteins. The most significant factor affecting the proteome appeared to be low temperature, while the combination of low temperature and short photoperiod was shown to act either synergistically or additively on the expression of some proteins. Fifty-seven protein spots on gels were identified by mass spectrometry. They included proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., enolase, malate dehydrogenase, etc), defense or protective mechanisms (e.g., dehydrin, HSPs, and PR-proteins), energy production and electron transport (e.g., adenosine triphosphate synthases and lyases), and cytoskeleton organization (e.g., tubulins and actins). The information derived from the analysis of the proteome is discussed as a function of the two treatment factors: low temperature and short photoperiod.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aacclimation 3aactin 3abark 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acold 3acytoskeleton 3adormancy 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrophoresis 3aenergy 3afluorescent dyes 3afreezing 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amass spectrometry 3aoverwintering 3apeaches 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aphotoperiod 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atrees 3atubulin 3awoody plants1 aHausman, Jean-François1 aBassett, Carole1 aArtlip, Timothy1 aCauchie, Henry-Michel1 aWitters, Erwin1 aWisniewski, Michael0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2008 Oct., v. 4, no. 4 p.589-600dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-008-0134-43Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02822naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245009700220300001800317520137300335592002801708650003001736650001601766650002001782650001301802650001401815650001201829650000901841650001801850650001201868650001801880650001101898650002101909650001501930650002401945650001301969650001301982650002301995653001802018653002002036653001502056700002102071700001802092773013402110856008702244852000902331655001202340IND60589562620221119065608.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058956262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Corre-Bordes, Deborah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7386-787410aGuide to electrospinning denatured whole chain collagen from hoki fish using benign solvents  ap. 1289-1299.  aTissue engineering requires the design and manufacture of biomimetic scaffolds. Collagen-derived nanofibrous scaffolds have been intensively studied because collagen, in the form of fibrils, is one of the main components of the extra cellular matrix (ECM). Several collagen materials have been used in electrospinning studies including mammalian extracted Type I collagen and gelatin formulations. Denatured whole chain collagen (DWCC) can be prepared by heat denaturing acid-soluble collagen extracted from cold-water fish skin. This product provides a consistent source of collagen with a controlled molecular weight profile and intact alpha chains including telopeptides. In this work, we studied DWCC-water-acid systems in order to determine the effect of solution composition on nanofibre morphology. Whereas measurement of the classical physical properties of concentrated solutions failed to predict and only partially explained the electrospinning behavior of collagen derived polymers, hydrodynamic properties provided insight. All the samples are presented in ternary diagrams to map the electrospinnability of the systems. These “electrospinning maps” provide an informative resource to electrospinning collagen-derived product for biomedical or commercial applications and a practical alternative to complicated models developed for synthetic polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacruronus novaezelandiae 3abiomimetics 3acold-water fish 3acollagen 3afish skin 3agelatin 3aheat 3ahydrodynamics 3amammals 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3aphysical properties 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atissue engineering 0aFish collagen 0aElectrospinning 0aNanofibers1 aHofman, Kathleen1 aHall, Bronwyn0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.1289-1299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012000175520233200295592002802627650001802655650001502673650002002688650001502708650001002723650001402733650002002747650002602767650001402793650000902807650001502816650002602831650001002857650002602867650002302893650001602916650001502932650001802947650000902965650001102974650001102985650002102996650002903017650001903046650001403065650001403079653001403093653001103107653001803118653002503136653002103161653001103182700002003193700002503213700001903238700002703257773010503284856008503389852000903474655001203483IND60680684620221119193742.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068068462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1054642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Katie Wan Yee10aCurrent understanding of potential ecological risks of retinoic acids and their metabolites in aquatic environments  aIn animals, retinoic acids (RAs), one of the main derivatives of vitamin A, are crucial for a variety of physiological processes. RAs, including all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA, and their corresponding metabolites (i.e., all-trans-4-oxo-RA, 9-cis-4-oxo-RA and 13-cis-4-oxo-RA) can be excreted through urination from humans and animals. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are a significant source of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs into aquatic environments. RAs and 4-oxo-RAs can be identified and quantified by use of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RAs and 4-oxo-RAs have been reported in various environmental matrices including rivers, lakes, reservoirs and coastal marine environments as well as in sewage effluents discharged from STPs. Greater concentrations of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs have been observed during blooms of cyanobacteria and microalgae, suggesting that cyanobacteria and microalgae are natural sources of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs in aquatic environments. These potential sources of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs raise concerns about their concentrations and risks in aquatic environments because excessive intake of these chemicals can result in abnormal morphological development in animals. Teratogenic effects were observed in amphibians, fish embryos, gastropods, mammals and birds when exposed to RAs. This review summarizes sources, concentrations, adverse effects and ecological risks of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs in aquatic environments. An interim, predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of RAs (in terms of at-RA) for freshwater environments was determined to be 3.93 ng/L at-RA equivalents. Based on limited data on concentrations of RAs in freshwater ecosystems, their hazard quotients were found to range from zero to 16.41, depending on the environmental conditions of receiving waters. Ecological risks of RAs in marine environments are yet to be explored due to the paucity of data related to both their concentrations in marine environment and toxic potencies to marine species. This review updates current knowledge of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs in aquatic environments and calls for more studies on their concentrations and fate in aquatic environments, especially estuarine and coastal marine environments with a view to enabling a comprehensive assessment of their ecological risks around the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aGastropoda 3aadverse effects 3aamphibians 3abirds 3aeffluents 3aembryo (animal) 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3afish 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3alakes 3aliquid chromatography 3amarine environment 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3aretinoic acid 3arisk 3arivers 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ateratogenicity 3aurination 3avitamin A 0aRetinoids 0aSewage 0aCyanobacteria 0aAquatic environments 0aEcological risks 0aMarine1 aZhou, Guang-Jie1 aHilscherová, Klára1 aGiesy, John P.1 aLeung, Kenneth Mei Yee0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.105464-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1054643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008100165300001600246520086000262592002801122650001301150650002301163650001601186700001601202700001401218700001401232773008701246856008501333852000901418655001201427IND60584273320221122064900.0200419e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058427332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shasha10aMechanical failure of graphene and the anharmonic phonon coupling mechanisms  ap. 404-409.  aThrough ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the mechanical failure of graphene under equibiaxial strains is studied and its failure strain is found to decrease with increasing temperature. Phonon spectra at elevated temperatures are calculated based on the third order interatomic force constants, demonstrating that the transverse optical mode (TO) at K point displays an intriguing waterfall behavior under large equibiaxial strains and its frequency decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the in-plane modes exhibit broader phonon spectra under large strains comparing to the out-of-plane modes, suggesting stronger in-plane phonon couplings and suppressed contributions to the lattice thermal transport. This work provides deeper insight into the long-standing conundrum for understanding the discrepancy between theory and experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3atemperature1 aWang, Yanan1 aWang, Hui1 aChen, Yue0 tCarbon.g2018 Jan., v. 126 p.404-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008600175300001800261520197400279592002802253650001902281650001802300650001402318650001402332650001802346650002502364650000902389650001602398650002002414650002102434650001202455650001802467650002002485650001202505650001702517650001302534650001502547650001102562650001002573650001002583650001602593650002102609650001902630700001802649773015502667856008102822852000902903655001202912IND60627370020221120201041.0190128e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062737002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-1482-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoshtaghioun, B.

Tundish plaster is mainly composed of MgO with minor amounts of SiO₂ and impurities, with a grain size of less than 1 mm, inorganic or organic fibers in order to decrease density and provide porosity for insulation, plasticizers and stiffening agents and some other additions. Tundish slag analysis for different grades of steel (7176D and 1191D, according to DIN standard) at different sequences, indicated a very variable composition of CaO (11–42%), SiO₂ (28–46%), Al₂O₃ (6–12%), MgO (11–20%), MnO (0–13%) and some minor variations of Fe, FeO and TiO₂. Experimental work indicated that slag when penetrated into pores of plaster, develop the phases of Monticellite (CaO · MgO · SiO₂) and Merwinite (CaO₁.₅ · MgO₀.₅ · SiO₂) around MgO particles and decrease the liquidus temperature from 2,800 °C to about 1,500 °C and provide dissolution of MgO grains in steel making process. Calculation based on two kinetic equations developed for diffusion controlled dissolution, indicated that the dissolution of MgO in tundish plaster is not a diffusion controlled process and is affected by turbulent flow parameters. Phase diagram of CaO–SiO₂–MgO indicates that decreasing SiO₂ to below 20% and increasing CaO content to as high as possible, increases the liquidus temperature to above 2,000 °C. Sources of SiO₂ in the process are the rice husk addition, which is used as an insulating material on top of the melt, and the slag flux addition. These sources should be reduced to as low a level as possible. This fact does not affect the fluidity of slag which is required for inclusion removal. Fluidity of slag comes from low melting point eutectics in CaO–Fe₂O₃ and CaO–FeO (about 1,200 °C) due to iron oxide on top of the steel melt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium oxide 3acorrosion 3aequations 3aferrous oxide 3ainsulating materials 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnesium oxide 3amanganese oxides 3amelting 3amelting point 3aphysical phases 3aplaster 3aplasticizers 3aporosity 3arice hulls 3asilica 3aslags 3asteel 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aturbulent flow1 aMonshi, Ahmad0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 Aug., v. 42, no. 16 p.6720-6728dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-1482-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012800158300001800286500002000304520208700324592002802411650002802439650001002467650001102477650001802488650003302506650002502539650001302564650002102577650001102598650002202609650001302631650001902644650000902663650002002672650002002692650001402712700002302726700002102749773013202770856007402902852000902976655001202985IND60587561520221117205217.0180319e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058756152DNAL7 a10.1890/08-0831.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorman, Daniel10aLand‐to‐sea connectivity: linking human‐derived terrestrial subsidies to subtidal habitat change on open rocky coasts  ap. 1114-1126.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpatial subsidies are considered strong where differences in resource availability between donor and recipient systems are greatest. We tested whether human activities on land can increase subsidies of terrigenous nitrogen to open rocky coasts and whether these differences can predict apparent deforestation of kelp forests. We first identified landscape‐scale variation in the human‐mediated transfer of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from natural, agricultural, and urban catchments to temperate coasts after episodes of rainfall. Compared to natural catchments, subsidies of DIN were on average 8–407 times greater in urban catchments, and 1–63 times greater in agricultural catchments. Urban derived nitrogen was attributed to the release of sewage effluent, as delineated by δ¹⁵N isotopic values of transplanted algae. Having made this link, we then assessed whether this catchment‐scale variation may account for variation in structure of subtidal habitats, particularly as related to theory of nutrient‐driven shifts of habitat from perennial (i.e., canopy‐forming algae) to opportunistic species (i.e., turf‐forming algae). We not only detected patterns consistent with this theory, but also established that the size and total proportion of patches of turf‐forming algae were greater where the ratio of donor : recipient nitrogen loads was greater (i.e., size of subsidy). An important realization was that deforestation may be more strongly related to variation in the size of subsidy rather than size of human populations, particularly among urban catchments. These data directly link the type of human activity within catchments to the modification of land‐to‐sea subsidies and indirectly support theory that predicts terrestrial inputs to have greater ecological effects where the disparity in resource availability between donor and recipient is exacerbated. Our evidence has been used by coastal managers to reconsider their management of coastal systems and has subsequently contributed to new water‐recycling policy and initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aalgae 3acoasts 3adeforestation 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen 3apollution load 3arain 3asewage effluent 3astable isotopes 3asubsidies1 aRussell, Bayden D.1 aConnell, Sean D.0 tEcological applications.g2009 July, v. 19, no. 5 p.1114-1126dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0831.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008400168300001800252520132600270592002801596650004401624650001501668650001301683650001101696650002001707650002401727650002401751650001601775650001201791650002101803650002301824650001401847650001101861650001801872650003301890650003301923650001101956650002101967653002901988653002202017653001302039653002602052653001102078700001902089700001502108700002002123773013402143856008702277852000902364655001202373IND60589562720221119065453.0190131e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058956272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yan-Jie10aResearch of a new metal chelating carrier preparation and papain immobilization  ap. 1175-1182.  aA new type of magnetic metal chelating carrier (PCMM-IDA-Cu2+) was prepared for the immobilization of papain, using chitosan as raw material, nano Fe3O4 as magnetic material, SiO2 as porogen, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) as a chelating ligand, and binding with transition metal ion (Cu2+). The resulting products were well characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BBD (Box-Behnken Design) of RSM (Response Surface Methodology) was applied to analyze the optimum enzyme immobilization conditions. The results showed that the enzyme immobilization capacity was 94.18mg/g of PCMM-IDA-Cu2+, with 7.976U/mg of relative immobilized enzyme activity under the optimum conditions (pH6.73, 1.56mg enzyme/15.0mg carrier, 30.9°C), and the recovery of enzyme activity was reached 87.21%. Compared with the free papain, the immobilized papain displayed enhanced enzyme activity, superior enzymatic properties, good operational stability and reusability. It is worth mentioning that the novel carriers exhibited selectively biological adsorption capacity, and this technique is an alternative method for the immobilization of enzyme, making the process more efficient and economic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3achitosan 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental design 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3aligands 3alight microscopy 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3apapain 3araw materials 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 0aMetal chelating carriers 0aMagnetic material 0aChitosan 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aPapain1 aZhu, Min-Liang1 aLi, Yan-Li1 aXiong, Chun-Hua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 June, v. 112 p.1175-1182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01278naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008200155300001800237520030600255592002800561650001400589650001900603650001800622700001800640700001500658700001400673700001300687700001900700700001600719773013400735856007400869852000900943655001200952IND60660146820221117070424.0190823e20140410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066014682DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00693c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Tian,10aSynthesis of yolk–shell HPW@Hollow silicalite-1 for esterification reaction  ap. 4846-4848.  aHPW@Hollow S-1, a novel solid catalyst which can be reused in the synthesis of ethyl acetate, was successfully prepared by the ship-in-bottle approach.

The sampled trees were grown from shortleaf pine and loblolly pine seeds formed in 1951 and 1952, prior to the start of intensive forest management across their native ranges. Amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were developed and used to study genetic diversity and its structure in these pine species. After screening 48 primer pairs, 17 and 21 pairs were selected that produced 794 and 647 AFLPs in shortleaf pine and loblolly pine, respectively. High-AFLP-based genetic diversity exists within shortleaf pine and loblolly pine, and most (84.73% in shortleaf pine; 87.69% in loblolly pine) of this diversity is maintained within physiographic populations. The high value of unbiased measures of genetic identity and low value of genetic distance for all pairwise comparisons indicates that the populations have similar genetic structures. For shortleaf pine, there was no significant correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance (r = 0.28), while for loblolly pine there was a weak but significant correlation (r = 0.51).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus echinata 3aPinus taeda 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3aintensive forestry 3ascreening 3aseeds 3atrees 3aArkansas 3aMississippi 3aOklahoma1 aTauer, C.

It was found the molar free energy of adsorption (ΔG ₘᵃᵈˢ) of n-alkane probe molecules on the LYCF surface is higher than that of RCF at different temperatures. The interaction of probes on the surfaces of LYCF and RCF becomes stronger with the increasing in the chain length of the n-alkane probes. Simultaneously, the ln K ₛ is linear to 1/T, where K ₛ and T are the constant of Henry’s law and temperature, respectively. Similar results were obtained by using Dorris–Gray method (area per methylene unit) and measured probe areas. The results indicate that LYCF and RCF are different in the surface morphology and physical chemistry properties, which suggests that LYCF is a more promising cellulose-based carbon fiber material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aalkanes 3acarbon fibers 3agas chromatography 3arayon 3atemperature1 aZou, Qi-chao0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 Aug., v. 42, no. 16 p.6907-6912dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-1488-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008000172506002800252520106300280592002801343506003701371650002201408650001801430650001701448650001101465650001401476650001501490650001201505700002901517700001901546700002601565773009601591856008301687852000901770655001201779IND60750476720221207114402.0210826s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075047672DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202133060142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarimurti, Nuradji14aThe Effect of Common Detergents on The Causative Virus of Newcastle Disease  aResource is Open Access  aNewcastle disease is one of the most severe poultry viral diseases due to its ability to cause massive economic losses and about 100% mortality in chickens. Many disinfectants have been used on farms to prevent the disease. However, the use of existing commercial disinfectants nowadays is considered expensive. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial detergents as disinfectants in inactivating the virus. Two commercial detergents containing Alkylbenzene sulfonates, which can dissolve the viral envelope lipid, were tested. More so, three concentrations of 1%, 1.5%, and 2% were used, with contact times of 5, 10, and 15 minutes, respectively. The commercial disinfectant Virkon was employed as a control. The results showed that commercial detergents had the same results compared to control by being able to inactivate the virus with a concentration of 1%, 1.5%, and 2% in 5, 10, and 15 minutes, respectively. This shows that simple and inexpensive household detergents can be used as an alternative for disinfection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNewcastle disease 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3alipids 3amortality 3asulfonates 3aviruses1 aAnistisha, Luthfiya Azmy1 aGhea, Aquatica1 aNLP, Indi Dharmayanti0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 33 p.06014-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202133060143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245006200134300001200196520066700208592002800875650002700903650001300930650001300943650001300956700001400969700001900983700002101002773015801023852000901181655001201190IND60770608920221117172056.0220319e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077060892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarmā, Añjalī,10aMarketing of tomato crop in Durg district of Chhattisgarh  ap. 223.  aThe present study analyses marketing of tomato crop in the Durg district of Chhattisgarh.

ESD focuses on energy conservation and efficiency by improving the thermal performance of buildings and promoting the use of renewable sources. Recently, however, it has faced criticism for its quantitative emphasis and dependence on technological advancements, as opposed to focusing on the qualitative aspects of the human dimension and tendency to connect with nature. A switch in focus toward more human-centred approaches could pave the way for biophilic design (BD) to emerge as a potential strategy to bridge this gap. BD is based on the concept of health and well-being and it underpins the positive effect that enhanced human–nature connectedness can bring to both building occupants and the environment. As both ESD and BD address better the environmental response, a holistic approach to design that is based on both principles may lead to more sustainable outcomes. This study investigates the potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of adopting BD within the built environment through a systematic literature review on biophilia, BD and human–nature connectedness. The results revealed a wide range of benefits, from the improvement of thermal performance to the promotion of pro-environmental behaviour. However, the review also found weaknesses and threats associated with BD, such as biophobia and negative emotions towards nature, and becoming a design burden posing as a hazard for building operations. This study also identifies growing trends in BD, as well as research gaps; few studies in the literature, for example, have focused on education, and this lack of knowledge can be identified as a major threat for its wide use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3adesign for environment 3aeducation 3aemotions 3aenergy conservation 3ahumans 0aBiophilia 0aBiophilic design 0aEnvironmentally sustainable design 0aHuman-nature connectedness 0aSWOT analysis 0aBuilt environment 0aESD 0aBD 0aSWOT 0aIPCC 0aBE 0aGBRT 0aHNC 0aPRISMA1 aBrambilla, Arianna0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 283 p.124591-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1245913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166520118300266592002801449650002801477650001501505650002101520650002001541650002601561650002001587653001801607653001701625653002201642653002201664653002001686700001601706700001701722700002001739700001901759700002801778700001901806700005501825773011201880856008301992852000902075655001202084IND60792425720221120032007.0220921e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079242572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2022.1146512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Rongzhou10aNeedle-integrated ultrathin bioimpedance microsensor array for early detection of extravasation  aExtravasation is a common complication during intravenous therapy in which infused fluids leak into the surrounding tissues. Timely intervention can prevent severe adverse consequences, but early detection remains an unmet clinical need because existing sensors are not sensitive to leakage occurring in small volumes (< 200 μL) or at deep venipuncture sites. Here, an ultrathin bioimpedance microsensor array that can be integrated on intravenous needles for early and sensitive detection of extravasation is reported. The array comprises eight microelectrodes fabricated on an ultrathin and flexible polyimide substrate as well as functionalized using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Needle integration places the array proximity to venipuncture site, and functional coating significantly reduces interface impedance, both enable the microsensors with high sensitivity to detect early extravasation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the capability of the microsensors to differentiate various intravenous solutions from different tissue layers as well as identify saline extravasation with detection limit as low as 20 μL.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aintravenous injection 3amicroelectrodes 0aExtravasation 0aBioimpedance 0aNeedle-integrated 0aMicrosensor array 0aEarly detection1 aJin, Yunxia1 aLi, Renee R.1 aJiang, Chengmei1 aPing, Jianfeng1 aCharles, Christopher J.1 aKong, Yong Lin1 aHo, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9458-90330 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 216 p.114651-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1146513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245015500166520082100321592002801142650001501170650001501185650001201200650000901212650001101221650001601232650002001248650001101268650002401279650003101303650001301334650001301347650001601360650001101376653002601387653002601413653001501439653002401454653002301478653002201501700002101523700002001544700004501564773012601609856008401735852000901819655001201828IND60734164520221122225252.0211218s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073416452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1000902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShokr, E.

However, the mechanism regulating ETH biosynthesis during fruit ripening and under osmotic stress is largely unknown in apple (Malus domestica). Here, we explored the roles of SnRK2 protein kinases in ETH biosynthesis related to fruit ripening and osmoregulation. We identified the substrates of MdSnRK2‐I using phosphorylation analysis techniques. Finally, we identified the MdSnRK2‐I‐mediated signaling pathway for ETH biosynthesis related to fruit ripening and osmoregulation. The activity of two MdSnRK2‐I members, MdSnRK2.4 and MdSnRK2.9, was significantly upregulated during ripening or following mannitol treatment. Overexpression of MdSnRK2‐I increased ETH biosynthesis under normal and osmotic conditions in apple fruit. MdSnRK2‐I phosphorylated the transcription factors MdHB1 and MdHB2 to enhance their protein stability and transcriptional activity on MdACO1. MdSnRK2‐I also interacted with MdACS1 and increased its protein stability through two phosphorylation sites. The increased MdACO1 expression and MdACS1 protein stability resulted in higher ETH production in apple fruit. In addition, heterologous expression of MdSnRK2‐I or manipulation of SlSnRK2‐I expression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit altered fruit ripening and ETH biosynthesis. We established that MdSnRK2‐I functions in fruit ripening and osmoregulation, and identified the MdSnRK2‐I‐mediated signaling pathway controlling ETH biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  aB17043cHigher Education Discipline Innovation Project  aCEFF‐PXM2019‐014207‐000032cConstruction of Beijing Science and Technology Innovation and Service Capacity in Top Subjects  a31772284cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32072551cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31672133cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872086cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD1000200cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2018YFD1000201cNational Key Research and Development Program  c2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University 3aMalus domestica 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3aclimacteric fruits 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aheterologous gene expression 3amannitol 3aosmoregulation 3aosmotic stress 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinases 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLi, Xingliang1 aWang, Wei1 aLi, Tianyu1 aDai, Zhengrong1 aChen, Yating1 aZhang, Kaikai1 aZhu, Haocheng1 aMao, Wenwen1 aFeng, Qianqian1 aLiu, Liping1 aYan, Jiaqi1 aZhong, Silin1 aLi, Bingbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9950-51851 aJia, Wensuo0 tThe new phytologist.g2022 May, v. 234, no. 4 p.1262-1277dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.180403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014700166300001800313520044900331592002800780650001300808650001400821650002300835650002300858650001900881650001200900650001300912700002200925773010600947856008501053852000901138655001201147IND60579315920221119072733.0170816e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057931592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b016172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChun, Supill10aTransition-Metal-Free Poly(thiazolium) Iodide/1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene/Phenazine-Catalyzed Esterification of Aldehydes with Alcohols  ap. 3787-3790.  aPoly(3,4-dimethyl-5-vinylthiazolium) iodide was used as a polymer precatalyst in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and phenazine for the oxidative esterification of aldehydes with alcohols.

Instead, the trend for increased species diversity in swards is an opportunity to improve mineral concentrations in the basal diet. Currently, there are limited data on the mineral concentrations of different species and botanical groups, particularly for I and Se, which are among the most deficient minerals in livestock diets. We grew 21 pasture species, including some cultivar/wild type comparisons, of grasses, legumes and forbs, as single species stands in a pot study in a standard growth medium. Herbage concentrations of Co, Cu, I, Mn, Se, Zn, S, Mo and Fe showed no consistent differences between the wild and cultivated types. There were significant differences between botanical groups for many minerals tested. Forbs were highest in I and Se, grasses in Mn and legumes in Cu, Co, Zn and Fe. Comparing species concentrations to recommended livestock intakes, the forbs Achillea millefolium, Cichorium intybus and Plantago lanceolata, and the legumes Medicago lupulina, Trifolium hybridum and Lotus corniculatus, appear to be good sources of Co, Cu, I, Se and Zn. Further work is required to ensure these results are consistent in multispecies mixtures, in different soil types and in field trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea millefolium 3aCichorium intybus 3aLotus corniculatus 3aMedicago lupulina 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aTrifolium hybridum 3acobalt 3acopper 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adietary minerals 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aiodine 3airon 3alegumes 3alivestock 3amanganese 3amineral content 3amolybdenum 3anutrient deficiencies 3apastures 3aselenium 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3asulfur 3asward 3azinc1 aMcGrath, Steve P.,1 aLee, Michael  R.

MMR has been in operation since the 1940's resulting in subsurface contamination that in some locations exceeds USEPA preliminary remediation goals for these chemicals. A molasses–water mixture (1 : 40 dilution) was applied to a treatment plot and clean water was applied to a control plot via seven flood irrigation events. Pore water samples were collected from 12 lysimeters installed at different depths in 3 boreholes in each test plot. The difference in mean concentrations of RDX in pore water samples from the two test plots was very highly significant (p < 0.001). The concentrations differences with depth were also very highly significant (p < 0.001) and degradation was greatly enhanced at depths from 5 to 13.5 ft. biodegradation was modeled as first order and the rate constant was 0.063 per day at 5 ft and decreased to 0.023 per day at 11 ft to 13.5 ft depth. Enhanced biodegradation of HMX was also observed in molasses treated plot samples but only at a depth of 5 ft. The difference in mean TOC concentration (surrogate for molasses) was highly significant with depth (p = 0.003) and very highly significant with treatment (p < 0.001). Mean total nitrogen concentrations also differed significantly with treatment (p < 0.001) and depth (p = 0.059). The molasses water mixture had a similar infiltration rate to that of plain water (average 4.12 ft per day) and reached the deepest sensor (31 ft) within 5 days of application. Most of the molasses was consumed by soil microorganisms by about 13.5 feet below ground surface and treatment of deeper depths may require greater molasses concentrations and/or more frequent flood irrigation. Use of the bioremediation method described herein could allow the sustainable use of live fire training ranges by enhancing biodegradation of explosives in situ and preventing them from migrating to through the vadose zone to underlying ground water and off-site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3aexplosives 3aflood irrigation 3agroundwater 3ainfiltration rate 3alysimeters 3amolasses 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pore water 3atotal nitrogen 3avadose zone 3aOahu1 aLamichhane, Krishna M.1 aBabcock, Roger W.1 aTurnbull, Stephen J.0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 15, no. 11 p.2023-2029dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00320e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245009700180300001600277520183700293592002802130650002502158650001602183650002102199650001702220650002502237650001502262650001502277650001102292650001502303650001402318650002602332650002902358650004402387700002402431700001502455700001702470700002502487700001702512773010602529856007302635852000902708655001202717IND60082123020221120154302.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212302DNAL7 a245170992pmid7 a10.1111/ppl.121682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHectors, Kathleen10aDynamic changes in plant secondary metabolites during UV acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 219-230.  aPlants respond to environmental stress by synthesizing a range of secondary metabolites for defense purposes. Here we report on the effect of chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. In the natural environment, UV is a highly dynamic environmental parameter and therefore we hypothesized that plants are continuously readjusting levels of secondary metabolites. Our data show distinct kinetic profiles for accumulation of tocopherols, polyamines and flavonoids upon UV acclimation. The lipid‐soluble antioxidant α‐tocopherol accumulated fast and remained elevated. Polyamines accumulated fast and transiently. This fast response implies a role for α‐tocopherol and polyamines in short‐term UV response. In contrast, an additional sustained accumulation of flavonols took place. The distinct accumulation patterns of these secondary metabolites confirm that the UV acclimation process is a dynamic process, and indicates that commonly used single time‐point analyses do not reveal the full extent of UV acclimation. We demonstrate that UV stimulates the accumulation of specific flavonol glycosides, i.e. kaempferol and (to a lesser extent) quercetin di‐ and triglycosides, all specifically rhamnosylated at position seven. All metabolites were identified by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)‐coupled tandem mass spectrometry. Some of these flavonol glycosides reached steady‐state levels in 3–4 days, while concentrations of others are still increasing after 12 days of UV exposure. A biochemical pathway for these glycosides is postulated involving 7‐O‐rhamnosylation for the synthesis of all eight metabolites identified. We postulate that this 7‐O‐rhamnosylation has an important function in UV acclimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacclimation 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3aglycosides 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3apolyamines 3aquercetin 3asecondary metabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aVan Oevelen, Sandra1 aGeuns, Jan1 aGuisez, Yves1 aJansen, Marcel A.

By decorating the bulky phenylcarbamoylated CD onto the unmodified CD silica, the CSP can provide multiple interaction sites such as H-bonding (OH, CO, NH), steric effects, π–π, dipole–dipole and inclusion complexation interactions, which help to broaden the CSP's enantioselectivity profile and enhance the enantioselectivity to some specific analytes. A group of enantiomer pairs such as isoxazolines, bendroflumethiazide, indoprofen, diperodon, fenoterol, atropine, styrene oxide and dansyl amino acids can be baseline or partially separated on the current CSP under reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The selectivity and resolution of 4NPh-OPr reached 5.25 and 13.97, which is an exciting achievement for the enantioseparations by CD CSPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aatropine 3acyclodextrins 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ahydrogen bonding 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asilica 3astyrene 0aBilayer cyclodextrin 0aClick 0aEnantiorecognition 0aRP-HPLC1 aLu, Xiaohong1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-20531 aLv, Jie0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 1381 p.253-259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001800288520101600306536021001322592002801532596008501560596009501645650002601740650001901766650001701785650002801802700001301830700001901843700001501862700002001877773013901897856008502036852000902121655001202130IND60686295620221122074059.0200316e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629562DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17231722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xianghai10aHyperspectral imagery classification with cascaded support vector machines and multi-scale superpixel segmentation  ap. 4530-4550.  aHyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification is a rapidly growing and highly active research area in the field of hyperspectral community. The method that combines both spatial and spectral information for hyperspectral image classification has made a great advance. The focus of spectral-spatial classification is how to extract discriminating features and how to combine the spectral and spatial information effectively. In this paper, we propose a new spectral-spatial method to solve these two problems. The first part is a series of support vector machines (SVMs) that are cascaded to form the enhanced features, where the predicted information of the preceding layer can provide correction information for the subsequent layer, and then a new superpixel segmentation method is adopted to introduce multi-scale spatial information, which can generate multi-scale superpixels at one time and is as accurate as the state-of-the-art methods. The final label is determined by majority voting of different scales.  aThis work was supported by the The Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2019JM-114];The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant JB181708 [JB181708].  aPublisher supplied data  a2019JM-114cThe Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China  aJB181708cThe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant JB181708 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3asupport vector machines1 aWang, Da1 aWang, Xiaozhen1 aZhao, Jing1 aJiao, Li-cheng,0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 June 17, v. 41, no. 12 p.4530-4550dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17231723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245017000199300001800369520109800387592002801485650002201513650002101535650001801556650001101574650001001585650001501595650001801610650001101628650001501639650001901654650001001673650000801683650001801691650002001709653002201729653002101751653001901772653002701791653002401818653002701842700001601869700001601885700001701901700001501918700001801933700005701951773014802008856008002156852000902236655001202245IND60644497820221116144538.0190516e20190327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064449782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b001952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7237-761110aTranscriptomic and Phytochemical Analyses Reveal Root-Mediated Resource-Based Defense Response to Leaf Herbivory by Ectropis oblique in Tea Plant (Camellia sinensis)  ap. 5465-5476.  aLeaf herbivory on tea plants (Camellia sinensis) by tea geometrids (Ectropis oblique) severely threaten the yield and quality of tea. In previous work, we found that local defense response was induced in damaged leaves by geometrids at the transcriptome level. Here, we investigated the systemic response triggered in undamaged roots and the potential role of roots in response to leaf herbivory. Comparative transcriptome analysis and carbohydrate dynamics indicated that leaf herbivory activated systemic carbon reallocation to enhance resource investment for local secondary metabolism. The crucial role of jasmonic acid and the involvement of other potential hormone signals for local and systemic signaling networks were supported by phytohormone quantification and dynamic expression analysis of phytohormone-related genes. This work represents a deep understanding of the interaction of tea plants and geometrids from the perspective of systems biology and reveals that tea plants have evolved an intricate root-mediated resource-based resistance strategy to cope with geometrid attack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aEctropis obliqua 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3agenes 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aplant hormones 3aroots 3atea 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aCamellia sinensis 0aEctropis oblique 0aleaf herbivory 0asystemic root response 0acarbon reallocation 0aphytohormone signaling1 aWang, Yanan1 aLi, Longbao1 aLi, Fangdong1 aHe, Yaxian1 aWu, Jianqiang1 aWei, Chaoling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1300-20160 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Mar. 27, v. 67, no. 19 p.5465-5476dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b001953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04529naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014000181300001800321520314800339592002803487650001203515650001703527650001303544650001703557650002103574650001203595650001003607650001103617650001903628650001303647650001503660650003203675650001603707650001003723650001603733651001403749700002003763700002603783700001703809773013903826856008503965961001204050852000904062655001204071IND60686295720221122074034.0200316e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629572DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17231732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgogno-Mondino, Enrico,10aHow far can we trust forestry estimates from low-density LiDAR acquisitions? The Cutfoot Sioux experimental forest (MN, USA) case study  ap. 4551-4569.  aAerial discrete return LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) technology (ALS – Aerial Laser Scanner) is now widely used for forest characterization due to its high accuracy in measuring vertical and horizontal forest structure. Random and systematic errors can still occur and these affect the native point cloud, ultimately degrading ALS data accuracy, especially when adopting datasets that were not natively designed for forest applications. A detailed understanding of how uncertainty of ALS data could affect the accuracy of derivable forest metrics (e.g. tree height, stem diameter, basal area) is required, looking for eventual error biases that can be possibly modelled to improve final accuracy. In this work a low-density ALS dataset, originally acquired by the State of Minnesota (USA) for non-forestry related purposes (i.e. topographic mapping), was processed attempting to characterize forest inventory parameters for the Cutfoot Sioux Experimental Forest (north-central Minnesota, USA). Since accuracy of estimates strictly depends on the applied species-specific dendrometric models a first required step was to map tree species over the forest. A rough classification, aiming at separating conifers from broadleaf, was achieved by processing a Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) scene. ALS-derived forest metrics initially greatly overestimated those measured at the ground in 230 plots. Conversely, ALS-derived tree density was greatly underestimated. To reduce ALS uncertainty, trees belonging to the dominated plane were removed from the ground dataset, assuming that they could not properly be detected by low-density ALS measures. Consequently, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values significantly decreased to 4.0 m for tree height and to 0.19 cm for diameter estimates. Remaining discrepancies were related to a bias affecting the native ALS point cloud, which was modelled and removed. Final MAE values were 1.32 m for tree height, 0.08 m for diameter, 8.5 m² ha⁻¹ for basal area, and 0.06 m for quadratic mean diameter. Specifically focusing on tree height and diameter estimates, the significance of differences between ground and ALS estimates was tested relative to the expected ‘best accuracy’. Results showed that after correction: 94.35% of tree height differences were lower than the corresponding reference value (2.86 m); 70% of tree diameter differences were lower than the corresponding reference value (4.5 cm for conifers and 6.8 cm for broadleaf). Finally, forest parameters were computed for the whole Cutfoot Sioux Experimental Forest. Main findings include: 1) all forest estimates based on a low-density ALS point cloud can be derived at plot level and not at a tree level; 2) tree height estimates obtained by low-density ALS point clouds at the plot level are highly reasonably accurate only after testing and modelling eventual error bias; 3) diameter, basal area, and quadratic mean diameter estimates have large uncertainties, suggesting the need for a higher point density and, probably, a better mapping of tree species (if possible) than achieved with a remote sensing-based approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3aconifers 3adata quality 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3alidar 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3ascanners 3atopography 3atree and stand measurements 3atree height 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aMinnesota1 aFissore, Vanina1 aFalkowski, Michael J.1 aPalik, Brian0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 June 17, v. 41, no. 12 p.4551-4569dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17231733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011700173300001600290520088400306592002801190650002401218650001201242650001401254650002301268650001201291650001101303650002301314653002201337653002001359653002301379653002101402653002301423700002101446700002001467700002401487700002101511700001701532773011401549856008401663852000901747655001201756IND60603039820221120093616.0180712e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060303982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzouz, Imadeddine10aFeasibility of the preparation of silica monoliths for gas chromatography: Fast separation of light hydrocarbons  ap. 127-133.  aThe preparation conditions of silica monoliths for gas chromatography were investigated.

However, when hydrolysis progresses confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals the formation of lipid aggregates, whose morphology is not compatible with that of bilayers. Smaller vesicles or droplets can also be seen inside the GUV. Our studies indicate that these aggregates or droplets are enriched in the non-lamellar lipid ceramide, an end-product of PlcHR2 reaction. Moreover, the aggregates/droplets appear enriched in the hydrolytic enzyme PlcHR2. At a final stage GUVs containing the enzyme-enriched droplets disintegrate and vanish from the microscope field. The observed non-lamellar enzyme-rich structures may be related to intermediates in the process of aggregation and fusion although the experimental design prevents vesicle free diffusion in the aqueous medium, thus actual aggregation or fusion cannot be observed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aceramides 3acholesterol 3adroplets 3aexperimental design 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrolysis 3alipid bilayers 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphospholipase C 3asphingomyelins 0aGUVs 0aPlcHR2 0aNMR 0aPLCs 0aSMase 0aCer 0aSM 0aChol 0aDAG 0aDOPC 0aPE 0aPC 0aPhospholipase C/sphingomyelinase HR2 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aNon-lamellar phases 0aLipid aggregates1 aSot, Jesús1 aMontes, L.-Ruth1 aVasil, Adriana I.1 aVasil, Michael L.1 aGoñi, Félix M.,1 aAlonso, Alicia0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2013 Jan., v. 166 p.12-17dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012100167300001800288520068000306592002800986650001801014650003601032650001401068650002301082650002301105650001101128650001301139650002201152650002201174650003001196700002301226700003401249700005901283773013401342856008001476852000901556655001201565IND60767691720220414000000.0220220e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076769172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c016142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCluzeau, Jérôme10aConcise Six-Step Asymmetric Approach to Ramelteon from an Acetophenone Derivative Using Ir, Rh, Cu, and Ni Catalysis  ap. 2129-2135.  aA concise six-step asymmetric synthesis of nearly enantiomerically pure ramelteon was developed from a monocyclic precursor with a 17% overall yield and a 97% ee in the asymmetric step. The synthetically challenging tricyclic 1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-indeno[5,4-b]furan core of ramelteon was assembled by using Ir-catalyzed O-vinylation and Rh-catalyzed vinyl ether annulation through directed C–H bond activation, while the chirality was introduced with enantioselective reduction of an α,β-unsaturated nitrile moiety under hydrosilylation conditions using a Cuᴵᴵ/Walphos type catalyst.

Under the optimized gradient elution conditions, it takes only 6min to separate all 12 β-agonists, and the critical pair of Ractopamine and Isoxsuprine isomers was almost completely separated. Based on the over 10,000 full-width at half maximum (FWHM) mass resolution and high mass accuracy features of TOF MS with 20mDa mass window, accurate mass chromatograms were reconstructed for individual compounds. The fragmentation pathways of 12 β-agonists were also studied using Q-TOF MS. The potential of UPLC–Q/TOF MS for confirmatory analysis was shown by determining the accurate mass of all compounds and fragment ions upon collision-induced-dissociation (CID) at different energies. The extra mass measurement errors for all β-agonists were found to be within 5ppm. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were determined for all β-agonists in feeds and found to be 1–5ng/mL and 5–50μg/kg, respectively. The method of UPLC–Q/TOF MS developed in this study was initially applied to the research of feeds for analysis of 12 β-agonists and proved to be accurate, sensitive, convenient and practical.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3adetection limit 3adrug residues 3afeed contamination 3afeeds 3aions 3aisomers 3aisoxsuprine 3amass spectrometry 3ascreening 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aFeng, Zhang1 aFei, Ding1 aWei-Qing, Li1 aQing-Yu, Chen1 aXiao-Gang, Chu1 aCheng-Bao, Xu0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Feb. 22, v. 1278 p.82-88dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002100175245007500196300001400271520239600285592002802681650001602709650001102725650002402736650001902760650001002779650002102789650000902810650003502819650002302854650001302877650001402890650002602904650001502930650001202945650001202957650001302969650001102982650002602993650001303019650001403032650002603046650002003072650001803092700002203110773014903132856006803281856010603349990002303455852000903478655001203487IND60643346120221122113815.0190510e20120418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064334612DNAL7 a10.3791/36662doi7 aPMC34666312pmcid7 a225467702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChablais, Fabian10aInduction of myocardial infarction in adult zebrafish using cryoinjury  ap. e3666.  aThe mammalian heart is incapable of significant regeneration following an acute injury such as myocardial infarction1. By contrast, urodele amphibians and teleost fish retain a remarkable capacity for cardiac regeneration with little or no scarring throughout life2,3. It is not known why only some non-mammalian vertebrates can recreate a complete organ from remnant tissues4,5. To understand the molecular and cellular differences between regenerative responses in different species, we need to use similar approaches for inducing acute injuries. In mammals, the most frequently used model to study cardiac repair has been acute ischemia after a ligation of the coronary artery or tissue destruction after cryoinjury6,7. The cardiac regeneration in newts and zebrafish has been predominantly studied after a partial resection of the ventricular apex2,3. Recently, several groups have established the cryoinjury technique in adult zebrafish8-10. This method has a great potential because it allows a comparative discussion of the results obtained from the mammalian and non-mammalian species. Here, we present a method to induce a reproducible disc-shaped infarct of the zebrafish ventricle by cryoinjury. This injury model is based on rapid freezing-thawing tissue, which results in massive cell death of about 20% of cardiomyocytes of the ventricular wall. First, a small incision was made through the chest with iridectomy scissors to access the heart. The ventricular wall was directly frozen by applying for 23-25 seconds a stainless steel cryoprobe precooled in liquid nitrogen. To stop the freezing of the heart, fish water at room temperature was dropped on the tip of the cryoprobe. The procedure is well tolerated by animals, with a survival rate of 95%. To characterize the regenerative process, the hearts were collected and fixed at different days after cryoinjury. Subsequently, the specimen were embedded for cryosectioning. The slides with sections were processed for histological analysis, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. This undertaking enhances our understanding of the factors that are required for the regenerative plasticity in the zebrafish, and provide new insights into the machinery of cardiac regeneration. A conceptual and molecular understanding of heart regeneration in zebrafish will impact both developmental biology and regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aambient temperature 3acardiomyocytes 3achest 3acoronary vessels 3afish 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3ahistology 3ain situ hybridization 3ainfarction 3aliquids 3amammals 3amedicine 3amodels 3amyocardial infarction 3anitrogen 3aresection 3asalamanders and newts 3astainless steel 3asurvival rate1 aJaźwińska, Anna0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Apr. 18, , no. 62 p.e3666-e3666dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/36663Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3666/induction-of-myocardial-infarction-in-adult-zebrafish-using-cryoinjury  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010100168300001800269520081900287592002801106650001501134650001301149650001101162650001401173650002001187650001601207650004401223650001301267650002901280650001101309653001401320653002201334653003101356700001701387700001601404700001601420700001501436700001601451773013401467856008701601852000901688655001201697IND60614403220221121012114.0190606e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061440322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Kaiyun10aStructural characterization and anti-thrombotic properties of fucoidan from Nemacystus decipiens  ap. 1817-1822.  aThe sulfated polysaccharide NP2 was isolated and purified from Nemacystus decipiens, the structure and antithrombotic activity of NP2 was further studied. NP2 was composed of fucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and xylose at molar ratios of 76.3:20.5:1.5:1.7. ES-CID-MS/MS results showed that NP2 had a backbone of α (1 → 3)-linked fucose and a branch was composed of Fuc-(2 → 1)-GlcA, which was agree with the results of NMR and methylation analysis. The results also show that the sulfate groups were substituted at the C2 or C4 positions of the fucose residues. In addition, analysis of the antithrombotic activity results indicated that NP2 can increase the percentage of t-PA/PAI-1, thereby suggesting that NP2 has high fibrinolytic activity and should be explored as a novel antithrombotic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNemacystus 3afucoidan 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucuronic acid 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asulfates 3atandem mass spectrometry 3axylose 0aFucoidans 0aMass spectrometry 0aAnti-thrombotic activities1 aTai, Wenjing1 aShan, Xindi1 aHao, Jiejie1 aLi, Guoyun1 aYu, Guangli0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Dec., v. 120 p.1817-1822dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245011500208300001800323520105000341592002801391650002201419650002001441650002001461650001401481650001501495650001801510650002201528650001801550650002901568650001601597650001301613650002601626650002201652650001301674650001701687651001201704653001701716653001801733653002101751653002201772653002501794653001701819653001801836653001701854700006001871700001701931773014801948856008002096852000902176655001202185IND60644498120190725000000.0190516e20190419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064449812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b004112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaassen, Christin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1824-191310aMetabolomics-Based Approach for the Discrimination of Potato Varieties (Solanum tuberosum) using UPLC-IMS-QToF  ap. 5700-5709.  aOne hundred eighty-two authentic potato samples (Solanum tuberosum) of known variety were collected from various German regions in 2016 and 2017. Samples were extracted with a liquid–liquid-extraction protocol that included isopropanol, methanol, and water in order to focus on lipophilic metabolites. The analysis of nonpolar extracts was performed using an UPLC-IMS-QToF-MS system; data sets obtained were evaluated via multivariate data analysis. A selection of 14 key metabolites with a significant difference in their abundance profiles was identified. This set of markers contained four hydroxylated glucocerebrosides, two phosphoinositols, one phosphocholine, and seven acylated sterol glucosides based on stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, which primarily enable the varietal discrimination. Fragments and neutral losses commonly appearing within one class or subclass of lipids were summarized within a new database that included ion mobility data. The performance of the approach was verified with twenty-nine commercial potato samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abeta-sitosterol 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aglucosides 3ahydroxylation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alipophilicity 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amultivariate analysis 3aphosphorylcholine 3apotatoes 3astigmasterol 3aGermany 0ametabolomics 0aUPLC-IMS-QToF 0apotato varieties 0aSolanum tuberosum 0alipid identification 0aion mobility 0asterol lipids 0acerebrosides1 aKuballa, Jürgen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6336-94521 aRohn, Sascha0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 19, v. 67, no. 19 p.5700-5709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010300174300001800277520098700295536012901282592002801411596007801439650002901517650001901546650001901565700002401584700002801608773013901636856008501775852000901860655001201869IND60686296120221122034613.0200316e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629612DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17231772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBannawat, Lakkhana10aPermittivity estimation of a shallow-layered medium using high-resolution ground-penetrating radar  ap. 4626-4643.  aThis paper proposes a method of permittivity estimation using ground penetrating radar (GPR). The proposed method can estimate the permittivity of a shallow-layered medium. In the proposed method, antenna calibration is introduced to improve the vertical resolution of the GPR. The conventional surface reflection method is slightly modified to be suitable for operation at a shallow depth since the antenna calibration impacts the signal amplitude being exploited to estimate the permittivity. Simulation and experimentation examples are illustrated to confirm that the proposed method can estimate the permittivity of each layer of dielectric ground medium. Simulations were divided into two main catalogues in order to investigate the resolution improvement and estimation accuracy of the GPR. The experimentation of the GPR along with the proposed method were conducted. The experimental results showed good agreement with those obtained from the commercial dielectric prob kit.  aThis work was supported by the Thailand Research Fund through the TRF Senior Research Scholar Program[Grant No. RTA6080008].  aPublisher supplied data  aRTA6080008cThailand Research Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004396 3aground-penetrating radar 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing1 aBoonpoonga, Akkarat1 aAkkaraekthalin, Prayoot0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 June 17, v. 41, no. 12 p.4626-4643dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17231773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001300158245008800171300001600259520125400275592002801529650001801557650001401575650002001589650001801609650001001627650002001637650001301657650002601670650002201696650002501718650002001743700001901763700001601782700002601798700001301824700001501837700001801852773010601870856007301976852000902049655001202058IND60082123620221120154257.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212362DNAL7 a246416252pmid7 a10.1111/ppl.121912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xin10aAdvances in identification and validation of plant microRNAs and their target genes  ap. 203-218.  aDevelopments in the field of molecular biology and genetics, such as microarray, gene transfer and discovery of small regulatory RNAs, have led to significant advances in plant biotechnology. Among the small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) have elicited much interest as key post‐transcriptional regulators in eukaryotic gene expression. Advances in genome and transcriptome sequencing of plants have facilitated the generation of a huge wealth of sequence information that can find much use in the discovery of novel miRNAs and their target genes. In this review, we present an overview of the developments in the strategies and methods used to identify and study miRNAs, their target genes and the mechanisms by which these miRNAs interact with their target genes since the discovery of the first miRNA. The approaches discussed include both reverse and forward genetics. We observed that despite the availability of advanced methods, certain limitations ranging from the cost of materials, equipment and personnel to the availability of genome sequences for many plant species present a number of challenges for the development and utilization of modern scientific methods for the elucidation and development of miRNAs in many important plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aequipment 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahuman resources 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3amolecular biology 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscriptomics1 aZhang, Yanping1 aZhu, Xudong1 aKorir, Nicholas Kibet1 aTao, Ran1 aWang, Chen1 aFang, Jinggui0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2014 Oct., v. 152, no. 2 p.203-218dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.121913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281520178800297592002802085650001102113650003502124650002502159650001502184650001902199650001402218650001802232650001302250651001702263653002102280653001902301653002602320653001902346700001902365773009802384856008602482852000902568655001202577IND60610048220221120211004.0180824e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061004822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicoll, Tami10aWithin-catchment variability in landscape connectivity measures in the Garang catchment, upper Yellow River  ap. 197-209.  aThe degree of landscape connection has wide-ranging implications for sediment availability, frequency of transport, and the nature of sediment storage within a basin. Two methodological approaches for assessing landscape connectivity are applied within the Garang subcatchment of the upper Yellow River. A GIS-based geomorphometric index was calculated for the catchment and compared to a methodology linking interpretation of satellite imagery and field mapping of sediment storage to slope threshold analysis. Landscapes of the Garang catchment are highly contrasting and can be separated into three zones: i) a highly disconnected upper catchment of low-relief with large inactive sediment stores; ii) a transitional zone where present landscape dynamics are controlled in large part by past incisional processes in the form of large alluvial fan/terrace deposits; and iii) a highly connected and highly dissected landscape within the lower catchment that has little accommodation space for sediment storage. The geomorphometric index shows general agreement with the patterns in landscape connectivity observed through imagery and field investigations. However, it estimates similar levels of connectivity in landscapes with observed (dis)connectivity, reflecting limitations of the calculation. While rapidly calculated geomorphometric indices of landscape connectivity provide useful appraisals of relative within-catchment variability in systems such as the Garang catchment, caution is urged in conducting broader-scale analyses using the same tools. Findings from this study highlight the importance of field-informed appraisals of landscape dynamics, site-specific characteristics and the imprint of historical (evolutionary) context in making such comparative assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitat connectivity 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3asediments 3asubwatersheds 3aterraces 3aYellow River 0aSediment storage 0aRiver incision 0aSediment connectivity 0aGeomorphometry1 aBrierley, Gary0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 277 p.197-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100003300158245012900191300001600320520165600336592002801992650002102020650001702041650002702058650001002085650002302095650001702118650001102135650001402146650001102160650001102171650002002182650001102202650001902213650001902232650002002251700001702271700002202288700002402310700002202334700002002356700001702376773010602393856007302499852000902572655001202581IND60082123720221120154232.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212372DNAL7 a246844712pmid7 a10.1111/ppl.122012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTattini, M.q(Massimiliano),10aEpidermal coumaroyl anthocyanins protect sweet basil against excess light stress: multiple consequences of light attenuation  ap. 585-598.  aThe putative photoprotective role of foliar anthocyanins continues to attract heated debate. Strikingly different experimental set‐ups coupled with a poor knowledge of anthocyanin identity have likely contributed to such disparate opinions. Here, the photosynthetic responses to 30 or 100% solar irradiance were compared in two cultivars of basil, the green‐leafed Tigullio (TG) and the purple‐leafed Red Rubin (RR). Coumaroyl anthocyanins in RR leaf epidermis significantly mitigated the effects of high light stress. In full sunlight, RR leaves displayed several shade‐plant traits; they transferred less energy than did TG to photosystem II (PSII), and non‐photochemical quenching was lower. The higher xanthophyll cycle activity in TG was insufficient to prevent inactivation of PSII in full sunlight. However, TG was the more efficient in the shade; RR was far less able to accommodate a large change in irradiance. Investment of carbon to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was more in RR than in TG in the shade, and was either greatly enhanced in TG or varied little in RR because of high sunlight. The metabolic cost of photoprotection was lower whereas light‐induced increase in biomass production was higher in RR than in TG, thus making purple basil the more light tolerant. Purple basil appears indeed to display the conservative resource‐use strategy usually observed in highly stress tolerant species. We conclude that the presence of epidermal coumaroyl anthocyanins confers protective benefits under high light, but it is associated with a reduced plasticity to accommodate changing light fluxes as compared with green leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aanthocyanins 3aattitudes and opinions 3abasil 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acultivars 3aenergy 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alutein 3aphotostability 3aphotosystem II 3asolar radiation1 aLandi, Marco1 aBrunetti, Cecilia1 aGiordano, Cristiana1 aRemorini, Damiano1 aGould, Kevin S.1 aGuidi, Lucia0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2014 Nov., v. 152, no. 3 p.585-598dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.122013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002000175245007700195300001400272520224100286592002802527650001702555650001802572650002102590650001702611650002102628650002502649650001602674650001502690650001302705650001002718650002102728650001502749650001802764650002502782650001102807650001702818650001202835700001602847773014902863856006803012856009103080990002303171852000903194655001203203IND60643346320221122113917.0190510e20120222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064334632DNAL7 a10.3791/36682doi7 aPMC33769402pmcid7 a223952962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnacker, Daniel10aGeneration of organotypic raft cultures from primary human keratinocytes  ap. e3668.  aThe development of organotypic epithelial raft cultures has provided researchers with an efficient in vitro system that faithfully recapitulates epithelial differentiation. There are many uses for this system. For instance, the ability to grow three-dimensional organotypic raft cultures of keratinocytes has been an important milestone in the study of human papillomavirus (HPV)1. The life cycle of HPV is tightly linked to the differentiation of squamous epithelium2. Organotypic epithelial raft cultures as demonstrated here reproduce the entire papillomavirus life cycle, including virus production3,4,5. In addition, these raft cultures exhibit dysplastic lesions similar to those observed upon in vivo infection with HPV. Hence this system can also be used to study epithelial cell cancers, as well as the effect of drugs on epithelial cell differentiation in general. Originally developed by Asselineau and Prunieras6 and modified by Kopan et al.7, the organotypic epithelial raft culture system has matured into a general, relatively easy culture model, which involves the growth of cells on collagen plugs maintained at an air-liquid interface (Figure 1A). Over the course of 10-14 days, the cells stratify and differentiate, forming a full thickness epithelium that produces differentiation-specific cytokeratins. Harvested rafts can be examined histologically, as well as by standard molecular and biochemical techniques. In this article, we describe a method for the generation of raft cultures from primary human keratinocytes. The same technique can be used with established epithelial cell lines, and can easily be adapted for use with epithelial tissue from normal or diseased biopsies8. Many viruses target either the cutaneous or mucosal epithelium as part of their replicative life cycle. Over the past several years, the feasibility of using organotypic raft cultures as a method of studying virus-host cell interactions has been shown for several herpesviruses, as well as adenoviruses, parvoviruses, and poxviruses9. Organotypic raft cultures can thus be adapted to examine viral pathogenesis, and are the only means to test novel antiviral agents for those viruses that are not cultivable in permanent cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aHerpesviridae 3aPapillomaviridae 3aParvoviridae 3aantiviral agents 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acollagen 3adrugs 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3akeratinocytes 3aliquid-air interface 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aviruses1 aMoody, Cary0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Feb. 22, , no. 60 p.e3668-e3668dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/36683Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3668/generation-organotypic-raft-cultures-from-primary-human  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009800166300001800264520038200282592002800664650001100692650001400703650003600717650002300753650002300776650000900799650001400808700002000822700001800842700002000860773010600880856008500986852000901071655001201080IND60579316520221119072634.0170816e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057931652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b016722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Zhigao10aTri-Substituted Triazole-Enabled C–H Activation of Benzyl and Aryl Amines by Iron Catalysis  ap. 3795-3798.  aThe design of trisubstituted triazoles set the stage for proximity-induced iron-catalyzed C–H activation of benzyl and aryl amines with ample scope.

Sediment transport in all environments, however, contains many of the same physical ingredients, albeit in varying proportions: grain entrainment due to a shear force, that is a combination of fluid flow, particle-particle friction and gravity. We present a new take on the perspective originally advanced by Bagnold, that views the long profile of a hillsope-river-shelf system as a continuous gradient of decreasing granular friction dominance and increasing fluid drag dominance on transport capacity. Recent advances in understanding the behavior and regime transitions of dense granular systems suggest that the entire span of granular-to-fluid regimes may be accommodated by a single-phase rheology. This model predicts a material-flow effective friction (or viscosity) that changes with the degree of shear rate and confining pressure. We present experimental results confirming that fluid-driven sediment transport follows this same rheology, for bed and suspended load. Surprisingly, below the apparent threshold of motion we observe that sediment particles creep, in a manner characteristic of glassy systems. We argue that this mechanism is relevant for both hillslopes and rivers. We discuss the possibilities of unifying sediment transport across environments and disciplines, and the potential consequences for modeling landscape evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3afriction 3agravity 3aingredients 3alandscapes 3alandslides 3amodels 3arheology 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asoil creep 3asuspended sediment 3atopographic slope 3aviscosity 0aGranular physics 0aPhase transitions 0aLandscape evolution models 0aRheology1 aJerolmack, Douglas J.0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 277 p.251-264dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245011600173520160100289592002801890650001301918650001401931650002701945650001101972650001301983650001101996650000902007650000902016650001402025650001102039650002202050650001902072650001602091650001102107650001102118650001302129650000902142700002702151773012302178856008002301852000902381655001202390IND60715184520221120052945.0201026e20201018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071518452DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101015972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyszkowski, Mirosław 10aPhytoextraction with Maize of Soil Contaminated with Copper after Application of Mineral and Organic Amendments  aThis study aimed to determine the possibility to increase the the effect of different amendments (compost, bentonite and zeolite) on the shoot yield and the concentration of trace elements in shoots of maize (Zea mays L.) on soil contaminated with Cu. The yield of shoots and concentration of the trace elements in shoots of maize depended on Cu dose and amendment incorporation into the sandy soil. Cu-spiked soil caused an increase the yield of shoots (only to 100 mg Cu/kg of soil), in the concentration of Cu, Co, Mn, Ni and Fe in shoots of maize and, to a smaller degree, in the concentration of Zn and bioconcentration factor (BCF) of all elements except copper, compared to the control soil without Cu. Under the influence of 150 and 200 mg Cu per kg of soil, a decrease in yield of shoots of maize was observed. Compost, bentonite and zeolite increased the yield of shoots and reduced the concentration of Cu, Co, Mn, Fe and Zn in shoots of maize. Bentonite had a more positive effect than compost and zeolite on the yield of shoots and the concentration of Co, Mn and Zn in shoots of maize. The effect of these amendments on the Cu and Fe concentration in shoots of maize was reverse. A reverse effect of these amendments (especially bentonite and zeolite) on the Ni concentration in plants was observed. The amendments applied to soil, especially compost, increased the BCF of Ni and, to a small degree, BCF of Cu in shoots of maize, compared to the control series. Compost, zeolite and especially bentonite are very good amendments in the restoration of maize growth in polluted areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abentonite 3abioaccumulation factor 3acobalt 3acomposts 3acopper 3acorn 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3aphytoaccumulation 3apolluted soils 3asandy soils 3ashoots 3ayields 3azeolites 3azinc1 aBrodowska, Marzena  S.0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101015973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245012200161300001800283520089100301592002801192650001601220650001801236650002101254650002801275700001501303700001801318700005501336700005601391700005701447773012001504856008401624852000901708655001201717IND60767692420221121195645.0220220e20220205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076769242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c038332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Di,10aBoronic-Acid-Accelerated Electrophilic Activation of Unprotected Maltols to N-Substituted Hydroxypyridinones in Water  ap. 1263-1267.  a3,4-Hydroxypyridinone (3,4-HOPO) is a vital metal-chelating pharmacophore. However, the efficient synthesis has been a long-standing problem in drug development. In this paper, we report an efficient electrophilic activation of unprotected maltols via reversible covalent bonds between boronic acid and 3-hydroxyl/4-carbonyl. This one-pot reaction proceeded well on a gram scale in water with excellent efficiencies up to 97%. Moreover, taking advantage of the covalent interactions via the transient boronate, most of the previously tough amine donors, including sterically hindered amines, aromatic amines, and amino acids and amino alcohols, were well-tolerated. Importantly, the potential of this strategy in the pharmaceutical industry was highlighted with a successful synthesis of 3,4-HOPOs containing iron-chelating active pharmaceutical ingredients on 10 g and kilogram scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aboronic acids 3adrug development 3apharmaceutical industry1 aZhang, Lei1 aZhong, Xiuwen1 aShao, Jiaan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8735-32361 aYu, Yongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1761-30871 aChen, Wenteng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9366-36790 tOrganic letters.g2022 Feb. 05, v. 24, no. 6 p.1263-1267dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c038333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245009200213300001800305506007600323520049900399592002800898506003700926650001100963650001100974650002300985650002301008650001501031650001301046650001301059700002001072700001901092700001801111700003201129700001801161773010601179856008501285852000901370655001201379IND60579316820221207063657.0170816e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057931682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b016782doi7 aPMC55251022pmcid7 a287035992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Mauro, Giovanni10aMechanistic Pathways in Amide Activation: Flexible Synthesis of Oxazoles and Imidazoles  ap. 3815-3818.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe preparation of substituted aminooxazoles and aminoimidazoles from α-arylamides and α-aminoamides through triflic anhydride-mediated amide activation is reported.

Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (5′-AMP) was then self-assembled onto ZrO2/SiO2 via Lewis acid–base interaction, generating 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2. The chromatographic properties of 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2 were systemically studied by evaluating the effect of acetonitrile content, pH and buffer concentration in the mobile phase. The results demonstrated that the 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2 possessed hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) property comprising hydrophilic, hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic and ion-exchange interactions. For basic analytes, the column efficiency of ZrO2/SiO2 and 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2 was superior to the bare ZrO2, and different selectivity was obtained after the introduction of 5′-AMP. For acidic analytes, good resolution was obtained on 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2 while the analysis failed on the bare ZrO2 column owing to strong adsorption. Hence, the proposed 5′-AMP-ZrO2/SiO2 had great potential in analyzing acidic compounds in HILIC mode. It was an extended application of ZrO2 based SP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aion exchange 3apH 3asilica 3azirconium oxide 0aAdenosine 5′-monophosphate 0aZrO2-coated SiO2 0aLayer-by-layer 0aHydrophilic interaction chromatography1 aLuo, Zhi-Yuan1 aYe, Mao1 aWang, Yu-Zhuo1 aXu, Li1 aShi, Zhi-guo1 aXu, Lanying0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Feb. 27, v. 1383 p.58-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017600168300001600344520108400360592002801444650001701472650001601489650004101505650003301546650002001579650003201599650001101631700002001642700001801662700001801680700001601698700001901714773009601733856008401829852000901913655001201922IND60113052920221118222719.0141111e20130222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011305292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shiqing10aCoordinating fingerprint determination of solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and chemometric methods for quality control of oxidized tallow  ap. 145-152.  aBased on optimized solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME/GC–MS) and chemometric methods, simple, reliable and reproducible methods were described for the first time for developing a chromatographic fingerprint of oxidized tallow. Eight optimal oxidized tallow samples were used to establish the chromatographic fingerprint. Spectral correlative chromatogram was adopted to identify 33 “common components”. The validation of fingerprint analysis was performed based on the relative retention time, the relative peak area of common peaks, sample stability and similarity analysis. The correlation coefficient of similarity of eight optimal oxidized tallow samples was more than 0.962, which showed that samples from different batches were consistent to some extent in spite of slightly different chemical indexes. Through principal component analysis (PCA), 14 constituents were further screened out to be the main chemical markers, which could be applied to more accurate quantitative discrimination and quality control of oxidized tallow.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3acorrelation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3asolid phase microextraction 3atallow1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aHayat, Khizar1 aXiao, Zuobing1 aNiu, Yunwei1 aEric, Karangwa0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Feb. 22, v. 1278 p.145-152dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015900167300002000326500001900346520191300365592002802278650001602306650001602322650001202338650001102350650001102361650001302372650002002385650002002405650001802425650001102443650001202454650002002466650002102486650001302507650001602520650001602536650001102552653002702563653001902590653001002609653001902619700001802638700005902656700001802715700002702733700002402760773014602784856008502930852000903015655001203024IND60719217320221123044240.0201130e20201117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071921732DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c048712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazar, Adil10aIntegrated Multiproduct Biorefinery for Furfural Production with Acetic Acid and Lignin Recovery: Design, Scale-Up Evaluation, and Technoeconomic Analysis  ap. 17345-17358.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFurfural is a versatile platform and multipurpose chemical that can be produced with no carbon efficiency loss from pentose sugars present in prehydrolysate streams. Existing processes for the production of furfural are typically energy-intensive with limitations to recover value-added molecules and byproducts such as lignin and acetic acid. In this work, we demonstrate a novel integrated biorefinery process for furfural production with significant sustainability improvements to current production pathways. Higher conversion efficiency for C₅ sugars into furfural is achieved with a novel reactor for producing and recovering furfural in the vapor phase that has been validated at the laboratory scale. Low molecular weight and sulfur-free lignin is also recovered while minimizing energy consumption by employing membrane filtration. Synergy was observed when lignin recovery is performed prior to furfural production. On the basis of experimental results, the scalability of the process for valorizing 3200 metric tonne/day of prehydrolysate solutions that is typically combusted in kraft dissolving pulp mills was evaluated. For a furfural production capacity of 36 tonne/day, a process configuration that stands out among four proposed alternatives was identified and designed. Significant heat energy savings (99.5%) for driving the process was achieved through a heat exchanger network design for internal heat recovery, which resulted in an energy intensity of 0.47 GJ/tonne, corresponding to 1% of the energy intensity for conventional processes. The technoeconomic assessment confirmed that even the least performing process is profitable, robust, and capital-efficient as indicated by metrics such as the internal rate of return (IRR) ranging from 30% to 46%, resistance to market uncertainty (RTMU) between 0.9 and 4.3 $/$, as well as return on capital employed (ROCE) between 49% and 91%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abiorefining 3acapital 3acarbon 3aenergy 3afurfural 3agreen chemistry 3aheat exchangers 3aheat recovery 3alignin 3amarkets 3amicrofiltration 3amolecular weight 3apentoses 3auncertainty 3avalue added 3avapors 0aIntegrated biorefinery 0aHemicelluloses 0aXylan 0aPrehydrolysate1 aAjao, Olumoye1 aBenali, Marzouk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1920-70201 aJemaa, Naceur1 aWafa Al-Dajani, Waleed1 aPaleologou, Michael0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Nov. 17, v. 8, no. 47 p.17345-17358dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c048713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245005700204300001800261500001100279520088100290592002801171596001901199596003401218596003801252650001701290650002001307650001701327650002001344650001701364650002201381700006301403773011601466856008001582852000901662655001201671IND60786888520221119133605.0220806e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078688852DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.136722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidalgo, Paloma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5867-012810aFormation of adenovirus DNA replication compartments  ap. 3518-3530.  aREVIEW  aAdenoviruses induce an extensive reorganization of the host cell nucleus during replication. Such a process results in the assembly of viral and cellular macromolecules into nuclear structures called adenovirus replication compartments (AdRCs), which function as platforms for viral DNA replication and gene expression. AdRCs co‐opt host proteins and cellular pathways that restrict viral replication, suggesting that the mechanisms that control AdRC formation and function are essential for viral replication and lay at the basis of virus–host interactions. Here, we review the hallmarks of AdRCs and recent progress in our understanding of the formation, composition, and function of AdRCs. Furthermore, we discuss how AdRCs facilitate the interplay between viral and cellular machineries and hijack cellular functions to promote viral genome replication and expression.  aPublisher supplied data  aS8696cCONACyT  aS0016‐280365cCONACyT‐SRE  cAlexander von Humboldt Foundation 3aAdenoviridae 3aDNA replication 3acell nucleus 3agene expression 3aviral genome 3avirus replication1 aGonzalez, Ramón A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9689-85290 tFEBS letters.g2019 Dec., v. 593, no. 24 p.3518-3530dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.136723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245015700179300001600336520189600352592002802248650002302276650001902299650001802318650000902336650002202345650001202367650002002379650001002399650001102409650005202420650002102472650001202493650001702505700001802522700001902540700001402559700001502573700001602588773010602604856007302710852000902783655001202792IND60082124220221120143945.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008212422DNAL7 a247203782pmid7 a10.1111/ppl.122062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hou‐Ling10aIdentification and validation of reference genes for Populus euphratica gene expression analysis during abiotic stresses by quantitative real‐time PCR  ap. 529-545.  aPopulus euphratica is the only arboreal species that is established in the world's largest shifting‐sand desert in China and is well‐adapted to the extreme desert environment, so it is widely considered a model system for researching into abiotic stress resistance of woody plants. However, few P. euphratica reference genes (RGs) have been identified for quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) until now. Validation of suitable RGs is essential for gene expression normalization research. In this study, we screened 16 endogenous candidate RGs in P. euphratica leaves in six abiotic stress treatments, including abscisic acid (ABA), cold, dehydration, drought, short‐duration salt (SS) and long‐duration salt (LS) treatments, each with 6 treatment gradients. After calculation of PCR efficiencies, three different software tools, NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper, were employed to analyze the qRT‐PCR data systematically, and the outputs were merged by means of a non‐weighted unsupervised rank aggregation method. The genes selected as optimal for gene expression analysis of the six treatments were RPL17 (ribosomal protein L17) in ABA, EF1α (elongation factor‐1 alpha) in cold, HIS (histone superfamily protein H3) in dehydration, GIIα in drought and SS, and TUB (tubulin) in LS. The expression of 60S (the 60S ribosomal protein) varied the least during all treatments. To illustrate the suitability of these RGs, the relative quantifications of three stress‐inducible genes, PePYL1, PeSCOF‐1 and PeSCL7 were investigated with different RGs. The results, calculated using qBasePlus software, showed that compared with the least‐appropriate RGs, the expression profiles normalized by the recommended RGs were closer to expectations. Our study provided an important RG application guideline for P. euphratica gene expression characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus euphratica 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3acold 3acomputer software 3adrought 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astress tolerance 3atubulin 3awoody plants1 aChen, Jinhuan1 aTian, Qianqian1 aWang, Shu1 aXia, Xinli1 aYin, Weilun0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2014 Nov., v. 152, no. 3 p.529-545dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.122063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245013700179300001400316520135700330592002801687650001501715650002701730650003101757650001901788650001101807650001801818650001601836653002701852653001801879653001701897653001201914653001501926653003101941700002401972773013201996856009002128852000902218655001202227IND60093707320221118004946.0190214e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravkova, Oksana G.10aAdsorption of the antimicrobial peptide arenicin and its linear derivative to model membranes – A maximum insertion pressure study  ap. 43-50.  aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature representing an ancient tool of host defence against bacterial invasion. The ability of the cyclic cationic antimicrobial peptide arenicin, Ar-1, and its novel and highly efficient linear derivative, C/S-Ar-1, to interact with 2D model membranes (POPC, DPPC, POPG, and DPPG) has been studied. Different phospholipid monolayers at the air–buffer interface, as simple and easy to manipulate models of the membrane surface, were used for these studies. The equilibrium adsorption pressure of both peptides depends on the charge of the lipid head group as well as on the lipid packing density (the largest value is observed for POPG). Only in the case of DPPG, the original Ar-1 penetrates much faster into the DPPG monolayer compared to the linear derivative C/S-Ar-1. Additionally, C/S-Ar-1 has been injected under lipid layers compressed to different starting pressures. In this way, the maximum insertion pressure (MIP) has been determined. Only for the negatively charged POPG, the MIP is clearly above the commonly accepted membrane pressure values, whereas they are between 30 and 34mN/m for the zwitterionic lipids and the condensed DPPG. The results point to the importance of the membrane charge and fluidity. Electrostatic interactions can be clearly enhanced by hydrophobic ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aphospholipids 3azwitterions 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aPhospholipids 0aZwitterionic 0aAnionic 0aMonolayers 0aMaximum insertion pressure1 aBrezesinski, Gerald0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2013 Feb.,  Mar., v. 167-168 p.43-50dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169300001800265520162400283592002801907650001301935650002001948650001601968650001901984650001902003650002302022650001902045650001502064650002502079650001602104650001002120651000902130700001902139700002002158700002802178700002102206700001902227773013902246856008502385852000902470655001202479IND60686296820221122101517.0200316e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068629682DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17243452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaee, Sasan10aLand subsidence from interferometric SAR and groundwater patterns in the Qazvin plain, Iran  ap. 4780-4798.  aQazvin plain as one of the important plains in northwest Iran in terms of industrial and agricultural activities, reveals evidence of land subsidence in the last decade. We used a descending ENVISAT dataset during 2003–2006 and two ascending and descending Sentinel-1 tracks acquired during 2014–2016 to study the subsidence in the area. Our time-series analysis of the ENVISAT data reveals that the area is subsiding at an average rate of 40 mm yr⁻¹ with a maximum value of 50 mm yr⁻¹ in the line of sight direction. Moreover, our result for the Sentinel-1 ascending and descending tracks shows that the average subsidence rate reaches 65 mm yr⁻¹ in the line of sight direction. Comparing the obtained mean velocity maps of the two datasets indicates the growing subsidence pattern in the northwest-southeast direction inside the plain. The investigation of the water source reveals that the overexploitation of aquifers caused an approximately 17 m decline in the groundwater level from 2001 to 2011. This drastic drop in the groundwater level has resulted in progressive subsidence over time. The comparison between the extent of subsidence from the image processing and the water level depletion contour map in the Qazvin plain depicts that subsidence is occurring in areas with a high decrease in underground water level. This study suggests that, besides decreasing the number of deep wells as well as their outflow water, the types of agricultural production related to water consumption and irrigation methods in an area such as Iran can play an important role in decreasing the stress on aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3airrigation systems 3aremote sensing 3asubsidence 3atime series analysis 3awater table 3awells 3aIran1 aMousavi, Zahra1 aMasoumi, Zohreh1 aMalekshah, Ahmad Hojati1 aRoostaei, Mahasa1 aAflaki, Mahtab0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 June 17, v. 41, no. 12 p.4780-4798dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17243453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012000176300001400296520074400310592002801054650001601082650001401098650001501112650001401127650001901141650001701160650001901177650001601196653000801212653000901220653000801229653000801237653001001245653000801255653000701263653000701270653002801277653001501305653001801320653001301338653001101351653002701362700002301389700001601412700001901428700002201447773013201469856009001601852000901691655001201700IND60093707520221118004810.0190214e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009370752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhyayauch, Hasna14aThe onset of Triton X-100 solubilization of sphingomyelin/ceramide bilayers: effects of temperature and composition  ap. 57-61.  aThe early stages of Triton X-100 solubilization of bilayers consisting of sphingomyelin/ceramide (SM/Cer) mixtures have been studied using a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques. Compositions based on sphingomyelin, containing up to 30mol% Cer, at 4, 20 and 50°C have been examined. The presence of Cer does not modify the affinity (in terms of ΔG of binding per mol total lipid) of the SM-based bilayers for Triton X-100, although it does increase the amount of detergent required for the onset of solubilization. At 50°C more detergent was required to solubilize the SM/Cer bilayers than at 20°C. The data can be rationalized in terms of lipid and detergent geometries and interactions (Lichtenberg et al., 2013).  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3aceramides 3adetergents 3aoctoxynol 3asolubilization 3aspectroscopy 3asphingomyelins 3atemperature 0aCer 0aDPPC 0aITC 0aLUV 0aMC540 0aMLV 0aPC 0aSM 0aMembrane solubilization 0aDetergents 0aSphingomyelin 0aCeramide 0aTriton 0aIsothermal calorimetry1 aArnulphi, Cristina1 aSot, Jesús1 aAlonso, Alicia1 aGoñi, Félix M.,0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2013 Feb.,  Mar., v. 167-168 p.57-61dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009100177300001600268520140200284650001701686650001801703650001401721650001401735650001301749650001101762650001401773650001001787650001801797650002201815650001901837651001101856653001601867653002101883653002501904653002301929653002401952653002701976653002902003700002902032700003502061700002202096700002102118700001702139700003302156773011702189852000902306856009202315930003302407946001102440655001202451IND4393773620221119114602.0070805e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiore, Marli Fátima14aThe cyanobacterial genus Brasilonema, gen. nov., a molecular and phenotypic evaluation  ap. 789-798.  aTwelve populations of filamentous, heterocytous scytonematoid cyanobacteria from subaerophytic (mainly epiphytic) habitats in subtropical and tropical Brazil (São Paulo) were studied. The populations form a uniform cluster, which differs from the traditional scytonematoid genera genetically and by several indistinct, but typical morphological characters (fasciculation of filaments, rare false branching). Two strains were isolated in monospecific cultures. Molecular analyses were performed on these strains from natural populations taken from bromeliad leaves and iron water pipes. Because the results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated the separate position of this cyanobacterium at the generic level, a new genus, Brasilonema, is proposed with the type species Brasilonema bromeliae. The new genus is described using combined molecular and cytomorphological criteria, in accordance with the nomenclatorial recommendations of both the Bacteriological Code and the Botanical Code of Nomenclature (cf. Oren 2004). The ultrastructure of the type species was studied, and vacuole-like structures in the cells were explained. The genus Brasilonema is commonly distributed, particularly in subaerophytic habitats from southeastern Brazil. The type species (B. bromeliae) has a rather curious ecology, living epiphytically (in phytothelmes) inside the vase-shaped leaf rosettes of bromeliads. 3aBromeliaceae 3aCyanobacteria 3abranching 3aepiphytes 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3anew genus 3apipes 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aultrastructure 3aBrazil 0aBrasilonema 0acyanoprokaryotes 0amolecular evaluation 0aphenotype analysis 0apolyphasic approach 0asubaerophytic habitats 0atropical microvegetation1 aSant'Anna, Célia Leite.1 aAzevedo, Maria Teresa de Paiva1 aKomárek, Jiří.1 aKaštovský, Jan1 aSulek, Josef1 aLorenzi, and Adriana Sturion0 tJournal of phycology.g2007 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.789-798dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00376.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03119naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010700172300001600279520171500295650001802010650001402028650001302042650001802055650004402073650001502117650001402132650002502146650001002171650001102181650001302192650001402205650002202219650001802241650001502259650001502274653001402289653001302303700001802316700002202334700001902356773011702375852000902492856009202501930003302593946001102626655001202637IND4393773420221119114428.0070805e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00371.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUku, Jacqueline10aCharacterization and comparison of prokaryotic epiphytes associated with three East African seagrasses  ap. 768-779.  aProkaryotic epiphytes on leaves of three seagrass species, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Thalassia hemprichii, and Cymodocea rotundata, from two Kenyan coastal sites, Nyali (a high-nutrient site) and Vipingo (a low-nutrient site), were characterized genetically and morphologically. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were used to study prokaryotes associated with these seagrasses. In general, the epiphytic coverage was greater in the high-nutrient site, while the microbial diversity was linked to seagrass species rather than the study sites. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) were associated with T. ciliatum and T. hemprichii mainly in the nutrient-poor site, while α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria were associated with all three species at the two study sites. Some bacteria phylotypes were closely related to sequences of microorganisms previously recovered from wastewaters or other contaminated sources, indicating the influx of land-based wastes into these coastal lagoon ecosystems. The abundance of potential nitrogen (N₂)-fixing cyanobacteria on C. rotundata, particularly in the low-nutrient site, suggested that this association may have been acquired to meet N demands. Unicellular cyanobacteria were dominant and associated with C. rotundata and T. hemprichii (with those on T. hemprichii being closely related to cyanobacterial symbiotic species), while T. ciliatum was almost devoid of cyanobacterial associations at the same site (Nyali), which suggests specificity in the cyanobacteria-seagrass associations. The abundance of prokaryotic epiphytes was considered to be linked to water depth and tidal exposure. 3aCyanobacteria 3aThalassia 3abacteria 3acoastal water 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecosystems 3aepiphytes 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphylotype 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3aseagrasses 3awastewater 0adiversity 0aseagrass1 aBjörk, Mats.1 aBergman, Birgitta1 aDíez, Beatriz0 tJournal of phycology.g2007 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.768-779dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2007.00371.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02560naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009600128300001600224520139200240650002201632650001701654650001601671650001801687650001401705650002001719650001801739650002601757650002601783650001901809650001501828650002301843650001401866650001301880650002101893651001401914653001601928653001701944700001501961773007001976852000902046930003302055945001302088946001302101655001202114IND2206097520221119114540.0000731e200001  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220609752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierolf, T.S.10aStover and potassium management in an upland rice-soybean rotation on an Indonesian Ultisol  ap. 106-114.  aFertilizer and stover management greatly determine the extent of K deficiency on weathered, low-K soils in the humid tropics. This study quantified the effects of K fertilization and stover management on soil properties and crop yields on a Typic Kanhapludult in Indonesia. Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. subsp. unguiculata]-cowpea-rice (Oryza sativa L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-rice-soybean were grown during a 2-yr period. Fertilizer KCI was applied as 70 and 250 kg K ha(-1) to the first crop only, and as a total of 250 and 600 kg K ha(-1) applied to several crops. The effect of stover removal or return was examined for each K rate. Critical soil K levels were 0.14 cmol(c)kg(-1) for the final rice crop and 0.14 and 0.16 cmol(c)kg(-1) for the two soybean crops. By returning stover, a single application of 70 kg K ha(-1) to the first crop was adequate to maintain soil K above the critical level for all six crops. When stover was removed, a total of 250 kg K ha(-1) applied during several crops maintained soil K above critical levels. A one-time 250 kg K ha(-1) application to the first crop, however, resulted in yield declines by the fifth crop. A maintenance rate of about 45 kg K ha(-1) per crop was required when stover was removed. Stover removal also hastened soil Mg depletion, and thus a maintenance rate of about 6 kg Mg ha(-1) crop(-1) is recommended. 3aVigna unguiculata 3aOryza sativa 3aGlycine max 3acrop residues 3apotassium 3asoil management 3acrop rotation 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient availability 3asoil fertility 3acrop yield 3apotassium chloride 3amagnesium 3aUltisols 3aapplication rate 3aIndonesia 0aupland rice 0ayield losses1 aYost, R.S.0 tAgronomy journal.g2000 , v. 92, no. 1 p.106-114x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02765naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245013200170300001800302500002400320520157100344650002101915650001501936650001301951650002101964650002501985650001502010650002302025650002502048650001002073650001102083650002002094650001502114650001102129650001802140650002102158650001002179650001102189773008602200852000902286856004802295655001202343IND4385531020221119113111.0061126e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438553102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-005-0103-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Daniel W.10aProcess Control as Ecosystem Management: Using the History of Sewage Treatment Plants to Analyze Ecosystem Management Practices  ap. 1156-1169.  aIncludes references  aIndustrial ecosystems are fruitful sites for examining ecosystem management. Sewage treatment plants, breweries, biotechnology reactors, and ethanol production plants are all ecosystems--complex biophysical systems in which communities of bacteria, yeast, fungi, and other organisms are maintained to extract services or resources. The industrial analog to ecosystem management is “process control”, where the industrial operator is the ecosystem manager. Process control is the management of a production process through the careful measurement and adjustment of its physical and chemical conditions. By analyzing the history of process control in activated sludge sewage treatment plants, I show the importance of craft knowledge in ecosystem management. Sewage treatment plant workers, through their experience in operating the plants, developed means of evaluating process conditions based on sight and smell rather than laboratory analysis. These craft techniques developed and persisted in spite of concerted efforts on the part of sanitary scientists to institute “scientific” control of the process based on laboratory analysis and models of microbial kinetics, suggesting that craft knowledge of ecosystem function can contribute to successful management. The craft knowledge of sewage plant workers is a kind of adaptive management, in which workers constantly adjust ecosystem parameters and observe the results. This approach is contrasted to “command and control” approaches to treatment plant automation, which have met with uneven success. 3aactivated sludge 3aautomation 3abacteria 3abrewing industry 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aethanol production 3aindustrial symbiosis 3alabor 3amodels 3aprocess control 3ascientists 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3asmell 3ayeasts0 tEcosystems.g2006 Nov., v. 9, no. 7 p.1156-1169dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0103-9 7aarticle03821naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245017100185300001600356500002400372500001500396520198000411650003002391650001402421650001302435650001502448650001002463650001602473650001202489650001202501650003902513650002602552650002202578650004202600650003902642650003202681650002002713650003102733650004102764650004402805650002802849650004602877650002902923653000902952700001202961700001302973700001302986700001102999700001203010700001703022700001203039773011603051852000903167856005503176655001203231IND4431609120221119113027.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443160912DNAL7 a191440162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01262.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, B.10aGeneration of Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) Transgenic Chimeric and Nuclear Transfer Embryos Using Embryonic Germ-Like Cells Expressing Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein  ap. 103-108.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe possibility of producing transgenic buffalo embryos by chimera and nuclear transfer (NT) using buffalo embryonic germ (EG)-like cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) has been explored in this study. Buffalo EG-like cells and fibroblasts with two to eight passages were transfected with the lined plasmid (pCE-EGFP-IRES-Neo-dNdB) using LipofectamineTM 2000 and selected by culturing in 200 μg/ml G418 for 6-8 days. G418 resistant fibroblasts and EG-like cells were used for embryo chimera and NT. To produce blastocysts by chimera, 8-16 cells embryos were injected with EG-like and fibroblast cells. Then, to produce blastocysts by NT, in vitro maturated oocytes were enucleated and afterwards EG-like/fibroblast cells transferred into the perivitelline space. No statistical differences were observed for the total blastocyst produced by the chimeric method, using EG-like and fibroblasts as donor cells, resulting on an accomplishment of 35.6% vs 33.3%, respectively. Nevertheless, besides from the 37 blastocysts produced, 23 (62.2%) from EG-like cells expressed EGFP, none of blastocysts from foetal fibroblasts expressed this protein. When the NT method was used, no statistical difference among different generations was observed in the percentage of oocytes fused, cleaved, and developed to blastocysts after NT for EG-like cells. On average, the percentage of oocytes fused, cleaved, and developed to blastocysts after NT was respectively 81.8%, 67.7% and 10.7%. For the expression of EGFP, from the 12 blastocysts produced by NT, 7 of them were positive, while none of NT embryos from EGFP positive fibroblasts developed to blastocysts. Results of the present study clearly demonstrated that gene transfected buffalo EG-like cells have the ability to form chimeric embryos after injecting into buffalo early embryos and reprogramming ability after NT, which can be employed to produce transgenic buffalos through either embryo chimera or NT. 3agreen fluorescent protein 3abuffaloes 3aplasmids 3ablastocyst 3agenes 3afibroblasts 3aoocytes 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxchemistryxphysiology. 2aBuffaloesxembryology 2aChimeraxgenetics 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aFibroblastsxultrastructure 2aGene Expression 2aGerm Cellsxultrastructure 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aNuclear Transfer Techniquesxveterinary 2aOocytesxultrastructure 2aOrganisms, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aTransfectionxveterinary 0agerm1 aCui, K.1 aLi, Tao.1 aWang, X.1 aLu, F.1 aLiu, Q.1 ada Silva, FM1 aShi, D.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2010 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.103-108dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01262.x 7aarticle03359naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002500193245008300218300001800301500002400319506007600343520142500419506003701844650002001881650000801901650001201909650001601921650001301937650001601950650000901966650001901975650001501994650001402009650001102023650001502034650001902049650001302068650002102081650005602102650004602158650001002204650004502214650003202259650004502291650005402336650003602390650004802426700002402474773013402498852000902632856009202641856004802733655001202781IND4375808620221207105011.0051106e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437580862DNAL7 a162697262pmid7 aPMC12877312pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.11.6918-6925.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemidova, Tatiana N.10aPhotodynamic Inactivation of Bacillus Spores, Mediated by Phenothiazinium Dyes  ap. 6918-6925.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpore formation is a sophisticated mechanism by which some bacteria survive conditions of stress and starvation by producing a multilayered protective capsule enclosing their condensed DNA. Spores are highly resistant to damage by heat, radiation, and commonly employed antibacterial agents. Previously, spores have also been shown to be resistant to photodynamic inactivation using dyes and light that easily destroy the corresponding vegetative bacteria. We have discovered that Bacillus spores are susceptible to photoinactivation by phenothiazinium dyes and low doses of red light. Dimethylmethylene blue, methylene blue, new methylene blue, and toluidine blue O are all effective, while alternative photosensitizers such as Rose Bengal, polylysine chlorin(e6) conjugate, a tricationic porphyrin, and a benzoporphyrin derivative, which easily kill vegetative cells, are ineffective. Spores of Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis are most susceptible, B. subtilis and B. atrophaeus are also killed, and B. megaterium is resistant. Photoinactivation is most effective when excess dye is washed from the spores, showing that the dye binds to the spores and that excess dye in solution can quench light delivery. The relatively mild conditions needed for spore killing could have applications for treating wounds contaminated by anthrax spores, for which conventional sporicides would have unacceptable tissue toxicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus cereus 3aDNA 3aanthrax 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3adye binding 3aheat 3amethylene blue 3aporphyrins 3ared light 3aspores 3astarvation 3atoluidine blue 3atoxicity 3avegetative cells 2aBacillusxclassificationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aColoring Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aLight 2aMethylene Bluexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPhenothiazinesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPhotosensitizing Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSpores, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aTolonium Chloridexchemistryxpharmacology.1 aHamblin, Michael R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Nov., v. 71, no. 11 p.6918-6925dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.11.6918-6925.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02325naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008400204300002000288506007600308520099300384506003701377650001001414650004801424650001401472650001101486650001301497650001201510650001401522650001801536650002401554650002601578700001601604700001401620773017601634852000901810856008301819946001301902655001201915IND4448187020221207083612.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10100251082doi7 aPMC30098202pmcid7 a211352342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuen, Eunice Y.10aHomeostatic regulation of glutamatergic transmission by dopamine D₄ receptors  ap. 22308-22313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlterations of synaptic transmission have been considered a core feature of mental disorders; thus, we examined the role of dopamine D₄ receptors, which is highly implicated in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia, in regulating synaptic functions of prefrontal cortex, a brain region critical for cognitive and emotional processes. We found that D₄ stimulation caused a profound depression or potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons when their activity was elevated or dampened, respectively, which was accompanied by a D₄-induced decrease or increase of AMPARs at synapses. The dual effects of D₄ on AMPAR trafficking and function was dependent on the D₄-mediated bidirectional regulation of CaMKII activity via coupling to distinct signaling pathways, which provides a unique mechanism for D₄ receptors to serve as a homeostatic synaptic factor to stabilize cortical excitability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acognition 3acortex 3adopamine 3aneurons 3areceptors 3aschizophrenia 3asignal transduction 3asynaptic transmission1 aZhong, Ping1 aYan, Zhen0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22308-22313dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10100251083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02748naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002300139245010000162300001400262500002400276520152300300650001201823650001201835650001501847650002201862650001901884650002701903650002701930650001601957650001301973650002401986650002102010650001802031651001602049700002202065700002202087700001802109773012302127852000902250856007902259655001202338IND4465839120221119112942.0130407s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446583912DNAL7 a10.5849/sjaf.11-0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanberry, Brice B.10aSmall Mammal Responses to Intensively Established Pine Plantations in Coastal Plain Mississippi  ap. 53-58.  aIncludes references  aIn the southeastern United States, there is a wide range of pine plantation establishment practices, varying by chemical or mechanical site preparation before planting and chemical herbaceous controls after planting. To investigate small mammal responses to a gradient of pine plantation establishment practices, we monitored small mammals for 5 years in pine plantations established with chemical, mechanical, or chemical and mechanical site preparation, followed by chemical herbaceous control after planting, in the Lower Coastal Plain of Mississippi. We captured small mammals at four study sites during February 2002-2006 in each of five different establishment practices. We caught 2,476 individuals of five common species (Blarina carolinensis, Neotoma floridana, Peromyscus spp., Reithrodontomys fulvescens, and Sigmodon hispidus). There were no differences by species or overall abundance among treatments that used a range of stand establishment practices in the Lower Coastal Plain. However, excluding Peromyscus spp., total small mammal abundance was greater in the lesser intensity establishment practices. Although increasing plantation establishment intensity in the southeastern Coastal Plain may not be detrimental to common species that are abundant in young plantations, further research is necessary to support our results. Future research should identify differences in demographics among establishment practices through mark-recapture studies, which can address mechanisms of population dynamics. 3aBlarina 3aNeotoma 3aPeromyscus 3aSigmodon hispidus 3acoastal plains 3ademographic statistics 3amark-recapture studies 3aplantations 3aplanting 3apopulation dynamics 3asite preparation 3asmall mammals 3aMississippi1 aEdwards, Scott L.1 aDemarais, Stephen1 aJones, Jeanne0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2013 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.53-58dSociety of American Forestersx0148-44197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5849/sjaf.11-0273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02338naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005400131300001800185520141200203650001901615650002401634650001501658650001401673650001201687650001401699650002901713650002201742650002501764651001301789700001601802700001801818773007201836852000901908930003301917945001301950946001301963655001201976IND2204016020221119112813.0000420e199912  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220401602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravchenko, A.N.10aMultifractal analysis of soil spatial variability  ap. 1033-1041.  aMultifractal formalism was utilized to study variability of different soil properties, including soil-test P and K, organic matter content, pH, Ca and Mg contents, and cation exchange capacity. Data from 1752 samples collected from a 259-ha agricultural field in central Illinois were used in the study. Based on the theory of multifractals a set of generalized fractal dimensions, D(q), and an f(alpha) spectrum were computed for each of the studied soil properties. The D(q) curves were fitted with a three-parameter mathematical function, which produced excellent fitting results with the coefficient of determination between measured and fitted values higher than 0.98 for all the studied data sets. We analyzed precision produced by the inverse distance interpolation procedure with different power to distance values and found the optimal power value to be related to one of the studied multifractal parameters. For the studied data, the multifractal parameter was the only data property that could be used as an a priori indicator of an optimal power value. The research demonstrated, first, that multifractal parameters reflected many of the major aspects of soil data variability and provided a unique quantitative characterization of the data spatial distributions and, second, that multifractal parameters might be useful for choosing an appropriate interpolation procedure for mapping soil data. 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3acation exchange capacity 3aspatial variation 3astatistical analysis 3aIllinois1 aBoast, C.W.1 aBullock, D.G.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 , v. 91, no. 6 p.1033-1041x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02576naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008200126300001800208520164700226650001601873650001701889650001601906650002601922650001501948650001901963650001101982650001401993650002102007650002602028653001402054773009002068852000902158930003302167945001302200946001302213655001202226IND2204015820221119112801.0000420e199912  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220401582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, R.H.10aPotential effect of soybean heliotropism on ultraviolet-B irradiance and dose  ap. 1017-1023.  aAssessing the potential for decreases in crop yield due to stratospheric ozone loss and concomitant increases in ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation requires knowledge of the characteristics of UVB irradiance above and within crops and the sensitivity of crops to the detrimental effects of the irradiance. Evaluations of the tolerance of many crops to increases in UVB irradiance have been made. The tolerance or intolerance of a crop to UVB irradiance is in part a result of physical characteristics of the plant. This study evaluated both the distribution of irradiance and the effects of plant leaf heliotropic movement of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars on the irradiance received on the leaf surface. Measurements of the above-canopy UVB irradiance on planes having a wide range of slope and aspect were made under cloud-free skies in a soybean field during the summer of 1990. Results showed that the relative irradiance was strongly dependent on the leaf inclination angle and could be modeled by a simple function having a relative irradiance accuracy of 0.14 (root mean square error); with greater model error at small incidence angles to the sun than at large incidence angles. The developed model was then used to evaluate the influence of heliotropy on the UVB dose received on the terminal leaflet. These results suggest that heliotropy in the leaflet acts to reduce irradiance. Since the more tolerant soybean cultivars appear to orient leaflets away from the sun, results suggest that the classification of UVB tolerance may be due in part to the capacity for paraheliotropic response reducing the UVB radiation received. 3aGlycine max 3aheliotropism 3airradiation 3aultraviolet radiation 3acrop yield 3aclimate change 3aleaves 3acultivars 3aapplication rate 3abiological resistance 0atolerance0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 , v. 91, no. 6 p.1017-1023wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02473naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245005000201300002000251506007600271520125000347506003701597650001501634650001801649650001101667650003101678650001301709650001101722700002001733700001601753700001801769700001901787773017601806852000901982856008301991946001302074655001202087IND4448187820221207104832.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818782DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10168231082doi7 aPMC30097952pmcid7 a211352192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyberg, Lars10aConsciousness of subjective time in the brain  ap. 22356-22359.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a"Mental time travel" refers to conscious experience of remembering the personal past and imagining the personal future. Little is known about its neural correlates. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the hypothesis that mental time travel into "nonpresent" times (past and future) is enabled by a special conscious state (chronesthesia). Well-trained subjects repeatedly imagined taking one and the same short walk in a familiar environment, doing so either in the imagined past, present, or future. In an additional condition, they recollected an instance in which they actually performed the same short walk in the same familiar setting. This design allowed us to measure brain activity correlated with "pure" conscious states of different moments of subjective time. The results showed that the left lateral parietal cortex was differentially activated by nonpresent subjective times compared with the present (past and future > present). A similar pattern was observed in the left frontal cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus. There was no evidence that the hippocampal region is involved in subjective time travel. These findings provide support for theoretical ideas concerning chronesthesia and mental time travel.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acerebellum 3aconsciousness 3acortex 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3athalamus 3atravel1 aKim, Alice S.N.1 aHabib, Reza1 aLevine, Brian1 aTulving, Endel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22356-22359dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10168231083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02632naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012700202300002000329506007600349520123300425506003701658650001801695650000801713650001501721650001501736650002301751650001101774650002001785650002701805700001801832700002101850700001801871700001901889700002101908773017601929852000902105856008302114946001302197655001202210IND4448185620221207105442.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818562DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10125911082doi7 aPMC30097942pmcid7 a211352202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKracker, Sven10aImpaired induction of DNA lesions during immunoglobulin class-switch recombination in humans influences end-joining repair  ap. 22225-22230.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIg class-switch recombination (CSR) is a region-specific process that exchanges the constant Ig heavy-chain region and thus modifies an antibody's effector function. DNA lesions in switch (S) regions are induced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and uracil-DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2), subsequently processed to DNA breaks, and resolved by either the classical nonhomologous end-joining pathway or the alternative end-joining pathway (XRCC4/DNA ligase 4- and/or Ku70/Ku80-independent and prone to increased microhomology usage). We examined whether the induction of DNA lesions influences DNA end-joining during CSR by analyzing Sμ-Sα recombination junctions in various human Ig CSR defects of DNA lesion induction. We observed a progressive trend toward the usage of microhomology in Sμ-Sα recombination junctions from AID-heterozygous to AID-autosomal dominant to UNG2-deficient B lymphocytes. We thus hypothesize that impaired induction of DNA lesions in S regions during CSR leads to unusual end-processing of the DNA breaks, resulting in microhomology-mediated end-joining, which could be an indication for preferential processing by alternative end-joining rather than by classical nonhomologous end-joining.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantibodies 3acytidine deaminase 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3auracil-DNA glycosylase1 aImai, Kohsuke1 aGardès, Pauline1 aOchs, Hans D.1 aFischer, Alain1 aDurandy, Anne H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22225-22230dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10125911083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02447naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245012900159300001400288500002400302520147200326650000901798650001601807650001401823650001201837650001601849650001301865650001201878651001201890700001701902773010801919852000902027856008502036655001202121IND4465845720221119112631.0130408s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446584572DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797020010722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, S.10aFactors affecting the adoption of leguminous cover crops in Nigeria and a comparison with the adoption of new crop varieties  ap. 81-97.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents the results of: (a) On-farm trials (eight) over a two-year period designed to test the effectiveness of leguminous cover crops in terms of increasing maize yields in Igalaland, Nigeria. (b) A survey designed to monitor the extent of, and reasons behind, adoption of the leguminous cover crop technology in subsequent years by farmers involved, to varying degrees, in the trial programme. Particular emphasis was placed on comparing adoption of leguminous cover crops with that of new crop varieties released by a non-governmental organization in the same area since the mid 1980s. While the leguminous cover crop technology boosted maize grain yields by 127 to 136% above an untreated control yield of between 141 and 171 kg ha−1, the adoption rate (number of farmers adopting) was only 18%. By way of contrast, new crop varieties had a highly variable benefit in terms of yield advantage over local varieties, with the best average increase of around 20%. Adoption rates for new crop varieties, assessed as both the number of farmers growing the varieties and the number of plots planted to the varieties, were 40% on average. The paper discusses some key factors influencing adoption of the leguminous cover crop technology, including seed availability. Implications of these results for a local non-governmental organization, the Diocesan Development Services, concerned with promoting the leguminous cover crop technology are also discussed. 3acorn 3acover crops 3acultivars 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3aplanting 3asurveys 3aNigeria1 aMcNamara, N.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2003 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.81-97dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797020010723Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008700130300001600217500001500233520186900248650001602117650002302133650002302156650001802179650002002197650001602217650001502233650002002248650002202268650001702290650000902307650002502316650001102341650001802352651001002370653001802380653001702398653001802415700001802433773007002451852000902521930003302530945001302563946001302576655001202589IND2204002720221119112646.0000420e199912  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220400272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumhardt, R.L.10aWater budget and yield of dryland cotton intercropped with terminated winter wheat  ap. 922-927.  a2019-12-05  aA Texas South Plains production system for reducing wind erosion in irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), a low-residue crop, is to plant winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) after cotton harvest, chemically terminate the wheat in the spring, and plant cotton using conservation tillage. The terminated wheat-cotton system (TWC) utilizes fall rain to grow wheat residue. This system has increased irrigated cotton lint yields compared with continuous clean-tillage cotton (CCC), but there is limited information on the annual water budget and adaptability of TWC under dryland conditions. This study compares CCC and TWC effects on (i) runoff and infiltration of rain, (ii) the annual water balance, and (iii) cotton lint yield under dryland conditions. The water budget of TWC and CCC was measured in 3- by 30-m subplot watersheds from May 1992 to December 1995 on an Amarillo sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Aridic Paleustalf) at Wellman, TX. Compared with CCC plots, the TWC residue reduced average annual runoff by 43 mm, but increased average fallow water use by 28 mm (for growing wheat). The use of TWC did not significantly (P = 0.05) increase either water conservation or cotton lint yields compared with CCC. Cotton establishment was problematic, due to limited soil water at planting in 1993 for TWC and CCC. This prevented 1994 TWC cotton establishment, thus offsetting improved establishment in 1992, when residue protected cotton seedlings during above-average rain. In semiarid regions, inadequate soil water for crop establishment is an uncontrolled risk with dryland TCW production. Because no significant gains in water storage or cotton lint yield were observed under dryland conditions with TWC compared with CCC, undertaking the greater crop establishment risk with TWC cotton production is not recommended in the Texas South Plains. 3alint cotton 3asoil water content 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acrop residues 3arisk assessment 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3adryland farming 3aTriticum aestivum 3awind erosion 3arain 3aconservation tillage 3arunoff 3acrop rotation 3aTexas 0aestablishment 0ainfiltration 0awater balance1 aLascano, R.J.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 , v. 91, no. 6 p.922-927x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013700161300001300298500002400311520137000335650002001705650001301725650001201738650000901750650001201759650001601771650001001787650002101797651001101818700002301829700001801852700002101870773010701891852000901998856008502007655001202092IND4465845120221119112937.0130408s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446584512DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797020011262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEilitta, M.10aOn-farm experiments with maize-mucuna systems in the Los Tuxtlas Region of Veracruz, Mexico.

To determine on-farm performance, an agronomic assessment was conducted in 1995–97 replicating farmer conditions in four fields. Treatments were first- and second-season maize with first-season mucuna (system Zm-Mp/Zm), first-season maize with first- and second-season mucuna (system Zm-Mp/Mp), second-season maize following first-season mucuna (system Mp/Zm), and first- and second-season maize, no mucuna control. Data on mucuna biomass amount and quality as well as maize yield, yield components, and nutrient status were collected. Highest mucuna biomass was obtained in system Mp/Zm (leaf-stem-mulch biomass in 1996/97, 7.34 t ha−1, 147 kg ha−1 N), followed by systems Zm-Mp/Mp (5.06 t ha−1, 101 kg N ha−1) and Zm-Mp/Zm (2.75 t ha−1, 50 kg N ha−1). Second-season maize yield was increased over that of the control by 45–58% (0.15–0.23 t ha−1) in system Zm-Mp/Zm and by 118% (0.60 t ha−1) in system Mp/Zm. Mucuna did not increase first-season maize yield. Climatic constraints make second-season maize production risky and yield increases due to mucuna are low in absolute terms, perhaps not offsetting labour costs (systems Zm-Mp/Zm and Mp/Zm) or loss of first-season maize (Mp/Zm). 3aMucuna pruriens 3aZea mays 3abiomass 3acorn 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3alabor 3ayield components 3aMexico1 aSollenberger, L.E.1 aLittell, R.C.1 aHarrington, L.W.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2003 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.5-17dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797020011263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02033naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002100132245009400153300001800247300003200265520068200297650002700979650001101006650001601017650001301033650001601046650001201062650001601074650001201090650002101102650002701123650001601150650003601166650001901202650002401221650002401245653002701269653002401296700002301320700002401343700002201367773009901389852000901488939003301497945000801530946001301538655001201551991562886460742620221119112914.0800806e197909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800017792DNAL7 a1128512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAusman, Lynne M.10aAssessment of the efficiency of protein utilization in young squirrel and macaque monkeys  ap. 1813-1823.  ap. 1813-1823. ill., charts.  aThe ability to utilize protein seems to vary greatly among species; to further the understanding of this process, 3 groups of young squirrel monkeys and a control group of macaques were fed diets designed to isolate the effects of lactalbumin, casein, and soy protein.

The objective of this paper is to show how the different models can be used together to form an integrated crop modeling system. The software engineering methods that are employed include the needs of potential users in the system requirements. As a specific example, the process of development and implementation of an integrated crop simulation system, DIASPORA (DIAlog Simulator and PredictOr for Research in Agriculture), is described. The DIASPORA system is primarily designed to make more effective use of the field treatment data collected at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture (LIA) and to allow a multitasking application of crop growth and development models. To achieve these tasks, a simulation environment has been developed that includes the complex simulation model, model database, multilingual user interface, and the set of simplified models for particular applications. Three local research stations of the LIA-Traku Voke (south-eastern Lithuania), Dotnuva (central Lithuania), and Vezhaichai (western Lithuania)-serve as sources of experimental information, and therefore, as sites for further implementation of the system. The models of cereal crops implemented within the system have also been verified using experimental data sets from several regions in Russia; Gornyj Lozen in Bulgaria; and Morris, MN, USA. 3ameteorological data 3asimulation models 3aplant development 3asoil 3agrowth models 3adatabases 3acrops 3aLithuania 0amathematical models0 tAgronomy journal.g2001 , v. 93, no. 3 p.660-666x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013300207300002000340506007600360520099500436506003701431650002601468650001301494650002801507650001201535650000901547650001401556650001101570700001901581700002101600773017601621852000901797856008301806946001301889655001201902IND4448186920221207100343.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10087751082doi7 aPMC30098112pmcid7 a211352382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkis, William B.10aNon-cell-autonomous factor induces the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABA signaling in retina independent of activity  ap. 22302-22307.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring development, the effect of activating GABAA receptors switches from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Several environmental factors have been implicated in the timing of this GABA switch, including neural activity, although these observations remain controversial. By using acutely isolated retinas from KO mice and pharmacological manipulations in retinal explants, we demonstrate that the timing of the GABA switch in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is unaffected by blockade of specific neurotransmitter receptors or global activity. In contrast to RGCs in the intact retina, purified RGCs remain depolarized by GABA, indicating that the GABA switch is not cell-autonomous. Indeed, purified RGCs cocultured with dissociated cells from the superior colliculus or cultured in media conditioned by superior collicular cells undergo a normal switch. Thus, a diffusible signal that acts independent of local circuit activity regulates the maturation of GABAergic inhibition in mouse RGCs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironmental factors 3aexplants 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aganglia 3amice 3areceptors 3aretina1 aFord, Kevin J.1 aFeller, Marla B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22302-22307dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10087751083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011000163300001600273500002400289520170000313650001102013650001102024650002602035650002502061650001702086650001302103650001502116650001502131650001802146650001102164650002302175650002402198650001102222650001602233650002102249650001502270651001102285700002502296700002202321700001902343773008502362852000902447856004802456655001202504IND4458237320221119113009.0110520e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445823732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-011-9429-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParé, David.10aSoil Carbon Stocks and Soil Carbon Quality in the Upland Portion of a Boreal Landscape, James Bay, Quebec  ap. 533-546.  aIncludes references  aAs part of a multidisciplinary project on carbon (C) dynamics of the ecosystems characterizing the Eastmain Region Watershed (James Bay, Quebec), the objective of this study is to compare the soil C stocks and soil organic matter quality among the main upland vegetation types in a boreal region subjected to a high fire frequency. On average, the organic layer contained twice the amount of C than the mineral soil. Closed canopy vegetation types had greater C stocks both in the mineral and in the organic layers than the other more open canopy vegetation types. Landscape features such as drainage and surficial deposit could not discriminate between vegetation types although closed vegetation types were on average found on wetter site conditions. Average soil C contents varied more than 2-fold across vegetation types. On the opposite, except for the organic layer C:N ratio, which was smaller in closed vegetation types, other measured soil organic matter properties (namely specific rate of evolved C after a long-term incubation, hydrolysis acid-resistant C as well as the rate of changes in soil heterotrophic respiration with increasing temperature (Q10)) remained within a narrow range between vegetation types. Therefore, total soil C stocks were a major determinant of both labile C and estimated summer soil heterotrophic respiration rate. The homogeneity of soil organic matter quality across the vegetation types could be attributable to the positive relationship between soil C storage and soil C fluxes observed in this landscape experiencing a high fire frequency. The low variability in soil C quality could help simplify the modelling of soil C fluxes in this environment. 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3ahydrolysis 3amineral soils 3amodels 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic matter 3asummer 3atemperature 3avegetation types 3awatersheds 3aQuebec1 aBanville, Jessica L.1 aGarneau, Michelle1 aBergeron, Yves0 tEcosystems.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 4 p.533-546dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-011-9429-7 7aarticle02882naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245013900170300001600309500002400325520182100349650001202170650001002182650001002192650001102202650001302213650001802226650001902244650001002263650001502273650002102288650001502309700002302324700001902347773008502366852000902451856004802460655001202508IND4414602620221119112945.0090105e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441460262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1146-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlendinger, Pedro G.10aCrop size, plant aggregation, and microhabitat type affect fruit removal by birds from individual melastome plants in the Upper Amazon  ap. 273-283.  aIncludes references  aWe studied the efficiency (proportion of the crop removed) and quantitative effectiveness (number of fruits removed) of dispersal of Miconia fosteri and M. serrulata (Melastomataceae) seeds by birds in lowland tropical wet forest of Ecuador. Specifically, we examined variation in fruit removal in order to reveal the spatial scale at which crop size influences seed dispersal outcome of individual plants, and to evaluate how the effect of crop size on plant dispersal success may be affected by conspecific fruit abundance and by the spatial distribution of frugivore abundance. We established two 9-ha plots in undisturbed terra-firme understory, where six manakin species (Pipridae) disperse most seeds of these two plant species. Mean levels of fruit removal were low for both species, with high variability among plants. In general, plants with larger crop sizes experienced greater efficiency and effectiveness of fruit removal than plants with smaller crops. Fruit removal, however, was also influenced by microhabitat, such as local topography and local neighborhood. Fruit-rich and disperser-rich patches overlapped spatially for M. fosteri but not M. serrulata, nonetheless fruit removal of M. serrulata was still much greater in fruit-rich patches. Fruit removal from individual plants did not decrease in patches with many fruiting conspecifics and, in fact, removal effectiveness was enhanced for M. fosteri with small crop sizes when such plants were in patches with more conspecifics. These results suggest that benefits of attracting dispersers to a patch balanced or outweighed the costs of competition for dispersers. Spatial pattern of fruit removal, a measure of plant fitness, depended on a complex interaction among plant traits, spatial patterns of plant distribution, and disperser behavior. 3aMiconia 3abirds 3acrops 3afruits 3alowlands 3amicrohabitats 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3atopography 3atropical forests 3aunderstory1 aLoiselle, Bette A.1 aBlake, John G.0 tOecologia.g2008 Nov., v. 158, no. 2 p.273-283dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1146-3 7aarticle03249naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002200118024001900140040001800159100002100177245009300198300001600291500002400307506007600331520193600407506003702343650001902380650002902399650001702428650001802445650001202463650004302475650001402518650001102532650001102543700001502554700002002569700001802589700002202607700002002629700001802649773008802667852000902755856003902764655001202803IND4422853520221207083534.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442285352DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.16712doi7 aPMC44098262pmcid7 a193999132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSporty, Jennifer10aQuantitation of NAD⁺ biosynthesis from the salvage pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 363-369.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is synthesized via two major pathways in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems: the de novo biosynthesis pathway from tryptophan precursors, or the salvage biosynthesis pathway from either extracellular nicotinic acid or various intracellular NAD⁺ decomposition products. NAD⁺ biosynthesis via the salvage pathway has been linked to an increase in yeast replicative lifespan under calorie restriction (CR). However, the relative contribution of each pathway to NAD⁺ biosynthesis under both normal and CR conditions is not known. Here, we have performed lifespan, NAD⁺ and NADH (the reduced form of NAD⁺) analyses on BY4742 wild-type, NAD⁺ salvage pathway knockout (npt1Δ) and NAD⁺ de novo pathway knockout (qpt1Δ) yeast strains cultured in media containing either 2% glucose (normal growth) or 0.5% glucose (CR). We have utilized ¹⁴C labelled nicotinic acid in the culture media combined with HPLC speciation and both UV and ¹⁴C detection to quantitate the total amounts of NAD⁺ and NADH and the amounts derived from the salvage pathway. We observed that wild-type and qpt1Δ yeast exclusively utilized extracellular nicotinic acid for NAD⁺ and NADH biosynthesis under both the 2% and 0.5% glucose growth conditions, suggesting that the de novo pathway plays little role if a functional salvage pathway is present. We also observed that NAD⁺ concentrations decreased in all three strains under CR. However, unlike the wild-type strain, NADH concentrations did not decrease and NAD⁺: NADH ratios did not increase under CR for either knockout strain. Lifespan analyses revealed that CR resulted in a lifespan increase of approximately 25% for the wild-type and qpt1Δ strains, while no increase in lifespan was observed for the npt1Δ strain. In combination, these data suggest that having a functional salvage pathway is required for lifespan extension under CR.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiosynthesis 3aculture media 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alongevity 3aniacin 3ayeasts1 aLin, Su-Ju1 aKatō, Michiko.1 aOgnibene, Ted1 aStewart, Benjamin1 aTurteltaub, Ken1 aBench, Graham0 tYeast.g2009 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.363-369dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1671 7aarticle02658naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010000204300002000304506007600324520110800400506003701508650002201545650001401567650001401581650001801595650001301613650001301626650001001639650001301649650001701662650001801679650003701697650001401734700001801748700001501766700002201781700001901803700002101822700002201843700001801865773017601883852000902059856008302068946001302151655001202164IND4448186020221207100337.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10097511082doi7 aPMC30098162pmcid7 a211352362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Christopher10aDevelopment of atopic dermatitis-like skin disease from the chronic loss of epidermal caspase-8  ap. 22249-22254.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 20% of children worldwide. Left untreated, the barrier function of the skin is compromised, increasing susceptibility to dehydration and infection. Despite its prevalence, its multifactorial nature has complicated the unraveling of its etiology. We found that chronic loss of epidermal caspase-8 recapitulates many aspects of atopic dermatitis, including a spongiotic phenotype whereby intercellular adhesion between epidermal keratinocytes is disrupted, adversely affecting tissue architecture and function. Although spongiosis is generally thought to be secondary to edema, we found that suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity is sufficient to abrogate this defect. p38 MAPK induces matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression to cleave E-cadherin, which mediates keratinocyte cohesion in the epidermis. Thus, the conditional loss of caspase-8, which we previously found to mimic a wound response, can be used to gain insights into how these same wound-healing processes are commandeered in inflammatory skin diseases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatopic dermatitis 3acadherins 3acaspase-8 3acell adhesion 3achildren 3acohesion 3aedema 3aetiology 3agelatinase A 3akeratinocytes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphenotype1 aLasse, Samuel1 aLee, Pedro1 aNakasaki, Manando1 aChen, Shih-Wei1 aYamasaki, Kenshi1 aGallo, Richard L.1 aJamora, Colin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22249-22254dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10097511083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02670naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011500166300001800281300002300299500001500322520126800337650002001605650002101625650003401646650001101680650001401691650001201705650003401717650008101751650001101832650004601843650006101889650004401950650002901994653003202023700001702055700001702072773008002089852000902169939003302178946001302211655001202224IND8905931020221119112900.0891031e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890593102DNAL7 a25480072pmid7 aPMC2509902pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorapi, W.V.10aSevere thrombocytopenia in young calves experimentally infected with noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus  ap. 3934-3943.  ap. 3934-3943. ill.  a2019-12-05  aSeven calves between 1 week and 2 months of age were infected with a noncytopathic field isolate of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BDV) in order to evaluate the effect of BDV infection on the concentration of circulating platelets in the blood. All calves were determined to be free of BDV and neutralizing antibodies to BDV before infection. Platelet counts were performed on a daily basis over a 30-day period beginning at the time of infection. By 2 weeks postinfection, all calves showed a significant drop in the number of circulating platelets and a marked hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. In three of the seven calves, thrombocytopenia was severe (less than or equal to 5,000/microliter) for 1 to 6 days. In two of these three animals, extensive petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages were observed on all mucosal surfaces and on various internal organs during the period of severe thrombocytopenia. BDV was consistently isolated from the platelets during the early phases of the infection, and viral antigen was occasionally detected on platelets by a fluorescent-antibody assay. The results demonstrate that BDV infection is associated with decreases in platelet numbers and suggest that platelets may serve as carriers of circulating virus. 3ablood platelets 3athrombocytopenia 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3acalves 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBlood Plateletsxmicrobiology 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexcomplicationsximmunologyxpathology. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxcomplicationsxetiology. 2aDiarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viralxisolation & purification 2aThrombocytopeniaxetiologyxveterinary. 2aViral Proteinsxanalysis 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aFrench, T.W.1 aDubovi, E.J.0 tJournal of virology.g1989 Sept., v. 63, no. 9 p.3934-3943x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03433naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245015300161300001600314500002400330520207600354650002302430650002202453650001602475650001702491650001002508650001202518650001202530650002002542650001002562650002202572650001502594650001402609650001402623650000802637650001302645650002302658650002602681650001202707650001002719651001302729700001702742773011002759852000902869856008502878655001202963IND4465844520221119112938.0130408s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446584452DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797020030462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsegaye, A.10aAnalysis of enset (Ensete ventricosum) indigenous production methods and farm-based biodiversity in major enset-growing regions of Southern Ethiopia  ap. 291-315.  aIncludes references  aEnset (Ensete ventricosum) production is declining, and it faces genetic erosion due to drought, diseases and population pressure. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and additional formal survey studies on 315 households were conducted over three consecutive years (1998–2000) in the Sidama, Wolaita and Hadiya ethnic regions of southern Ethiopia to assess traditional cultivation methods, analyse the production systems, and evaluate farm-based enset biodiversity. The regions differ in terms of cultural background, resources, farming systems, population density, and agro-ecology. Furthermore, the methods for initiating suckers and the frequency of transplanting vary among the three regions. Diverse enset landraces were identified in the Sidama (52), Wolaita (55) and Hadiya (59) regions. Sidama farmers had the highest number of landraces per farm, 57% and 21% more than found on Wolaita and Hadiya farms respectively. In all three regions, landrace diversity was influenced by household resources, cultural background, population pressure, and agro-ecology. There were significant differences in the average number of enset landraces and livestock between rich and poor households in the three regions. Rich farmers had more land and manure-producing livestock, and they planted more enset landraces than did poor farmers. In all three regions, women proved to be more experienced than men in identifying enset landraces. The number of enset landraces per farm was significantly correlated with other household characteristics for resource-rich Sidama farmers and with the number of livestock and area of farmland for resource-rich Hadiya farmers. This suggests that middle-income or poor farmers concentrate on annual crops, rather than on growing the perennial enset plant. More research is needed to identify, characterize and conserve genetic diversity, and to improve the cultivation practices for enset. The cultural, socio-economic, and gender-associated aspects of enset cultivation need to be assessed to understand the dynamics of enset biodiversity. 3aEnsete ventricosum 3aagricultural land 3aagroecology 3abiodiversity 3acrops 3adrought 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3ahouseholds 3alandraces 3alivestock 3amen 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3aproduction technology 3asurveys 3awomen 3aEthiopia1 aStruik, P.C.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2002 July, v. 38, no. 3 p.291-315dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797020030463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02422naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002200132245008400154300001800238300003200256500001500288520092600303650002201229650001801251650002101269650001201290650001601302650001301318650001201331650002101343650001201364650001101376650001001387650002801397650002301425650001201448650001101460650002701471650001101498650001801509650001901527650001701546650002501563653002801588700001501616700002001631700002201651700002101673773009901694852000901793930003301802945000801835946001301843655001201856991562883610742620221119112831.0800806e197909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800017762DNAL7 a4744692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendrikx, Achiel.10aChanges in some lipid variables in obese women during the early days of fasting  ap. 1799-1804.  ap. 1799-1804. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aSome aspects of lipid metabolism in obese women were investigated during a 7-day fast.

Subjects with normal carbohydrate tolerance averaged lower initial serum triglyceride levels; a dependency of glyceride blood levels on clearance efficiency was noted. Changes during the fast were clearly related to initial levels--plasma triglycerides increased in patients with lower levels and decreased in patients with higher levels. Increased triglyceride is related to a decreased fractional removal rate, and vice versa. Patients who responded to fasting with a decrease of triglyceridemia had the lowest initial cholesterol levels which decreased even more during the fast. 3aglucose tolerance 3alipid content 3atriacylglycerols 3afasting 3acholesterol 3aresearch 3aobesity 3alipid metabolism 3afemales 3aadults 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCholesterolxblood 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aObesityxblood 2aTime Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0acarbohydrate metabolism1 aBoni, Luc.1 aKieckens, Lena.1 aMeulepas, Ernest.1 aDe Moor, Pieter.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.1799-1804x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02465naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001300157245009700170300001600267500002400283520133000307650002601637650001301663653002101676653001901697653001701716653003001733653001901763653003501782700001401817773011001831852000901941856007201950930003302022945002502055946001102080655001202091IND4388622720221119112838.0070306e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438862272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2006.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN2001 aKise, M.10aSensor-in-the-loop tractor stability control: Look-ahead attitude prediction and field tests  ap. 107-118.  aIncludes references  aRollover protective structures (ROPS) have been recognized as the most effective device to prevent tractor-related fatalities due to tractor rollover. However, ROPS provide only passive protection from rollover-caused fatalities. The most effective way to eliminate rollover-caused fatalities is to prevent the rollover from occurring. This research proposes the use of "sensor-in-the-loop (SIL)" online tractor attitude and motion simulation to provide rollover warnings based on estimated look-ahead tractor attitude and motion status. A stereovision camera was used as the visual sensor for the SIL system to create a three-dimensional virtual terrain map on which a virtual vehicle travels. This progressively estimates the tractor attitude and motion on the terrain to provide warning of potential rollovers. A series of field tests on various terrains were conducted to evaluate the dynamic performance of the SIL tractor motion simulator in an actual field environment. The validation test results indicated that the SIL vehicle attitude simulator could predict the attitude and motion status of the vehicle approximately 8.0 m ahead of its actual position with favorable and consistent accuracy at all test sites. Such information can be used as baseline data for a warning signal to prevent rollovers from occurring. 3afarm equipment safety 3atractors 0atractor rollover 0aroll and pitch 0astereovision 0avehicle motion simulation 0a3D terrain map 0arollover protective structures1 aZhang, Q.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2006 June, v. 52, no. 1-2 p.107-118dElsevierx0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.02.0033electronic resource  a20070316b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02899naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013100202300002000333506007600353520162400429506003702053650001602090650002702106650001602133650001502149650001102164650002002175650001702195650001302212700001902225773017602244852000902420856008302429946001302512655001202525IND4448194720221207083625.0110126e20101228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444819472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10077471082doi7 aPMC30124652pmcid7 a211497362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Yu-Chen10aATP-binding cassette-like transporters are involved in the transport of lignin precursors across plasma and vacuolar membranes  ap. 22728-22733.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLignin is a complex biopolymer derived primarily from the condensation of three monomeric precursors, the monolignols. The synthesis of monolignols occurs in the cytoplasm. To reach the cell wall where they are oxidized and polymerized, they must be transported across the cell membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transport process are unclear. There are conflicting views about whether the transport of these precursors occurs by passive diffusion or is an energized active process; further, we know little about what chemical forms are required. Using isolated plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from Arabidopsis, together with applying different transporter inhibitors in the assays, we examined the uptake of monolignols and their derivatives by these native membrane vesicles. We demonstrate that the transport of lignin precursors across plasmalemma and their sequestration into vacuoles are ATP-dependent primary-transport processes, involving ATP-binding cassette-like transporters. Moreover, we show that both plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles selectively transport different forms of lignin precursors. In the presence of ATP, the inverted plasma membrane vesicles preferentially take up monolignol aglycones, whereas the vacuolar vesicles are more specific for glucoconjugates, suggesting that the different ATP-binding cassette-like transporters recognize different chemical forms in conveying them to distinct sites, and that glucosylation of monolignols is necessary for their vacuolar storage but not required for direct transport into the cell wall in ARABIDOPSIS:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiopolymers 3acell walls 3alignin 3aplasma membrane 3atransporters 3avacuoles1 aLiu, Chang-Jun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 28, v. 107, no. 52 p.22728-22733dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10077471083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02848naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245005000164300001600214500001500230520186400245650000902109650003202118650002402150650001902174650001702193650002202210653001602232653002302248700002302271700002602294773007602320852000902396930003302405945002502438946001102463655001202474IND4420997320221119112833.0090526s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442099732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design/methodology/approach -- The paper is a review of the pork supply chain literature, and the main objective is to describe and analyze the complexity of the pork production industry from a holistic perspective. An extensive review of the relevant literature was done together with discussions and reflexions carried out with pork sector researchers. Findings -- The paper highlights the complexity involved in the pork supply chain in order to obtain quality products and demonstrates that, by looking at pork production as a chain instead of as individual steps made by different companies, the meat sector can more easily meet the challenge of accurately responding to changing customer demands. Research limitations/implications -- The contribution describes the main factors and attributes found along the pork supply chain, which are relevant to the quality of the final product as perceived by the consumer. Further research could be done on the effects of the interactions between the factors on pork chain analysis and consumer satisfaction. Practical implications -- The main lesson to be learned from this work is the opportunity supply-chain agents get from collaboration, which allows them to become more competitive than if they stay isolated and without a global perspective of the whole chain. The findings contribute to further research on the pork sector from a supply chain perspective. Originality/value -- The paper provides a holistic perspective of the pork supply chain and can be useful for researchers and practitioners involved in the management of pork product quality and new product development. 3apork 3alivestock and meat industry 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood marketing 3ameat quality 3afood availability 0afood supply 0aliterature reviews1 aCastro, Rodolfo de1 aFont i Furnols, Maria0 tBritish food journal.g2009, v. 111, no. 2-3 p.257-274x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090708b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/10  aNon-US 7aarticle01982naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009800167300001600265500002400281520107000305650002501375650001101400650001101411650001301422650001301435650001301448651001301461700001601474773011401490852000901604856005501613655001201668IND4389692620070402000000.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438969262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2006.00833.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuer, N.A.10aAssessment of lake sturgeon spawning stocks using fixed-location, split-beam sonar technology  ap. 113-121.  aIncludes references  aFixed-location, split-beam sonar technology was used successfully to identify adult lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens as they moved upstream and downstream for spawning in the Sturgeon River, Michigan, May-June 2004. A Hydroacoustic Technology Inc. Model 241 Split-Beam Echo Sounder operating at 200 kHz and a single 4 x 10° elliptical-beam transducer with a near field range of 1.7 m set perpendicular to the river flow was used. Data collected from migrating lake sturgeon included direction of movement, swimming speed, range from transducer, time and date of passage, and target strength. The spawning population of lake sturgeon was estimated to be at 350-400 fish, with almost equal numbers of fish seen moving upstream as downstream. Most fish were recorded moving within the mid-section of the river, 1.5-1.65 m deep, and swimming speeds upstream were slower than those for downstream moving fish. These results show that spilt-beam sonar can be applied to lake sturgeon assessments, without the stress of actually handling these large, pre-spawning fish. 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3amodels 3arivers 3aspawning 3asturgeon 3aswimming 3aMichigan1 aBaker, E.A.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2007 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.113-121dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2006.00833.x 7aarticle03353naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245011700164300001600281500002400297520198500321650002102306650000802327650001102335650001902346650001402365650002302379650002002402650001302422650001602435650001702451650001902468650000902487650003002496650002502526650002802551650004702579700001402626700001502640700001302655700001702668700001202685773008802697852000902785856008902794655001202883IND4465850220221119112813.0130408s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446585022DNAL7 a10.1016/S0378-4290(03)00103-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillan, T.10aMarkers associated with Ascochyta blight resistance in chickpea and their potential in marker-assisted selection  ap. 373-384.  aIncludes references  aA chickpea recombinant inbred line (RIL) population F6:7 was evaluated for disease reaction to blight caused by Ascochyta rabiei in three different environments. In Spain, disease was measured in the field by the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and in the greenhouse by the linear infection index (LII). In Tunisia, disease was measured in the field by the 1–9 scale of Reddy and Singh [Plant Dis. 68 (1984) 900]. Twenty RILs showing extreme values for resistance and susceptibility were selected from field and greenhouse data obtained in Spain and assessed individually for DNA markers linked with disease resistance. Previously, 1028 DNA markers were found polymorphic in a collection of resistant and susceptible accessions of chickpea and 39 of them were associated with resistance. Both the more resistant and the more susceptible RILs, evaluated in Spain, were scored for the 39 chosen markers and 20 of them maintained a clear association with resistance or susceptibility. These loci formed a linkage group covering a map distance of 18.8 cM when the entire RIL population (n=76) was analysed. The markers on the linkage group were significantly associated with disease reaction in the three environments, indicating the presence of a QTL for resistance to blight in this genomic region and explaining from 20 to 23.7% of the total phenotypic variation of the character. The resistant genotype for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker OPAC04/1200, in the middle of the group, was the most frequent (84%) in a set of cultivars and breeding lines selected as resistant to Ascochyta blight. The association of the other markers with resistance on each side of OPAC04/1200 decreased in frequency inversely with their distance from this locus. This result suggests that the QTL for resistance to blight would be close to OPAC04/1200 and we therefore propose to use this marker jointly with two others (OPAI09/1276 and OPM02/935) that flank it in MAS. 3aAscochyta rabiei 3aDNA 3ablight 3abreeding lines 3achickpeas 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3ainbred lines 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique1 aRubio, J.1 aIruela, M.1 aDaly, K.1 aCubero, J.I.1 aGil, J.0 tField crops research.g2003 Dec., v. 84, no. 3 p.373-384dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4290(03)00103-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02804naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003600164245019600200300001600396500002400412520107400436650001701510650001801527650001301545650001601558650001401574650003901588650001001627650001601637650001201653650001201665650001401677650002301691650002301714650002301737650003301760650002501793650002001818650004001838650001601878650001401894700002801908700002501936700002401961700002501985700002802010700003102038773009902069852000902168856008502177655001202262IND4435681220221119112946.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443568122DNAL7 a201984172pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-010-9117-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Edivaldo H.

Drastic chromosomal reshuffling has been documented in birds of prey by FISH. However, the available probes, derived from chicken, have the limitation of not being capable of determining if breakpoints are similar in different species: possible synapomorphies are based on the number of segments hybridized by each of chicken chromosome probes. Hence, we employed FACS to construct chromosome paint sets of the white hawk (Leucopternis albicollis), a Neotropical species of Accipitridae with 2n = 66. FISH experiments enabled us to assign subchromosomal homologies between chicken and white hawk. In agreement with previous reports, we found the occurrence of fusions involving segments homologous to chicken microchromosomes and macrochromosomes. The use of these probes in other birds of prey can identify important chromosomal synapomorphies and clarify the phylogenetic position of different groups of Accipitridae. 3aAccipitridae 3abirds of prey 3achickens 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ahawks 3akaryotyping 3atropics 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aChickensxgenetics 2aChromosome Banding 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosome Paintingxmethods 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHawksxgenetics 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aKaryotyping 2aMetaphase1 aTagliarini, Marcella M.1 aRissino, Jorge Dores1 aPieczarka, Julio C.1 aNagamachi, Cleusa Y.1 aO'Brien, Patricia C.

This pattern comprised two elements: the ridge mulched by plastic film that acts as the runoff area and the furrow as the infiltration basin or planting area. The conventional planting pattern for potato production in semiarid regions of northwestern China is the opposite with mulched ridges for planting and the furrow as an infiltration zone. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the ridge with or without mulching on rainwater harvesting and the response in potato yield and to determine the optimal cross-sectional area of the ridge and furrow. A ratio defined as the width of the ridge to the width of the furrow or the planting area was used to evaluate the cross-sectional area. Three ratios of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 were tested under the conditions of mulched ridge, bare earth ridge, and no ridge or flat planting, respectively. No matter what ratio used, the width of the planting belt was the same at 0.6 m. The results showed that for tuber yield, the ridge with the plastic mulching was more effective than the bare earth ridge and that the bare earth ridge was better than flat planting. In the mulched ridges, a ridge width of 0.45 m or a ratio of ridge to furrow of 0.75 led to higher yield than that of ridges with a width of 0.3 and 0.6 m. For the bare earth ridges, the yield in the 0.6 m ridge width was higher than that of the other two ridges. Besides improving potato yield, the mulched ridge and furrow planting had the added advantage of collecting considerable rainwater for soil moisture. In addition, the percentage of small-sized potatoes was low. Therefore, we recommend that the mulched ridge with a ridge width of 0.45 m and a furrow width of 0.6 m as a successful method to increase potato yield in semiarid areas where potato production relies totally on rainwater. 3acrop yield 3afurrow irrigation 3afurrows 3aharvesting 3amulching 3aplanting 3aplastic film 3apotatoes 3arain 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3awater harvesting 3aChina1 aSu, Derong1 aLi, Fengmin1 aLi, Xiaoling0 tField crops research.g2003 Dec., v. 84, no. 3 p.385-391dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4290(03)00118-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02357naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001300166245007400179300001400253500002400267500001500291520110400306650001101410650003701421650003101458650002101489650001601510653004301526653001201569653001701581700001401598700001501612700001401627700002401641773010801665852000901773856007201782930003301854945002501887946001101912655001201923IND4388620220221119113054.0070306e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438862022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2006.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX600 0aQ5051 aXing, J.10aBruise detection on 'Golden Delicious' apples by vis/NIR spectroscopy  ap. 11-20.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVisible and near-infrared reflectance spectra were used to distinguish the bruises from the intact surfaces on 'Golden Delicious' apples. Reflectance spectra of apples were acquired for both bruised and intact surfaces within the range of 400-1700 nm. The effective wavebands for detecting bruises were determined by analysis of the correlelogram. The wavebands around 545 and 1200 nm clearly show the time evolution of the bruised tissue. The mean-normalized reflectance difference between wavebands centred at 745 and 905 nm was also an effective discriminator for detecting old bruises. Afterwards, a quadratic discrimination analysis was performed based on the selected discriminators. The total classification error for the 1-day-old bruises was about 16.3%. A more extensive study was carried out to determine the effects of storage time on classification performance. The detection error was decreased with the elapse of storage time after bruising. However, it was difficult to remove the time influence on the classification accuracy if only depending on the intensity value of reflectance. 3aapples 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3abruising (plant) 3areflectance 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0abruises 0atime effects1 aBravo, C.1 aMoshou, D.1 aRamon, H.1 aDe Baerdemaeker, J.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2006 June, v. 52, no. 1-2 p.11-20dElsevierx0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.01.0063electronic resource  a20070316b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03018naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002200163245008200185300001800267500001500285520123600300650004501536650002101581650001201602650000901614650002101623650003001644650002001674650001901694650001201713650002001725650001801745650002301763650002301786650002601809650001601835650002501851650002501876650002801901650003901929650002201968650004701990653004502037653002802082653002502110700002302135700001602158700001902174700002002193700002102213773009202234852000902326930003302335945002502368946001102393655001202404IND4370672320221119113044.0050529e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067232DNAL7 a157238232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, despite considerable recent advances in molecular genetics, nothing is known about the molecular basis of floral heteromorphy. The first molecular marker for the Primula S-locus is reported here. This DNA sequence was identified by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, further defined as a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, and subsequently shown to correspond to a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that is linked to the thrum allele of the Primula S-locus. The sequence of 8.8 kb of genomic DNA encompassing this thrum-specific RFLP is presented. Analysis of this DNA reveals a highly repetitive sequence structure similar to that found at the S-locus in other species; it also contains sequences similar to elements of a Gypsy-like retrotransposon. The identification of a specific DNA sequence associated with the thrum allele of the Primula S-locus provides the first molecular probe with which to investigate the molecular basis of heteromorphic flower development in PRIMULA: 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aretrotransposons 3aalleles 3aloci 3aPrimula vulgaris 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplant fertility 3amating systems 3aselfing 3agenetic markers 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPrimulaxgenetics 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 0asequence characterized amplified regions 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aPavlov, Vassily K.1 aLi, Jinhong1 aCook, Holly E.1 aHummel, Florian1 aGilmartin, P.

Fecal bile acid and neutral sterol content from six adult volunteers were studied after exposure to Escherichia coli B7a (0148:H28), a travellers' diarrhea which produces heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. Consistent with results from previous studies, bile acids and cholesterol metabolites were lower during diarrhea, and excretion of acidic and neutral steroids were higher, though differences were not statistically significant. These results are in marked contrast to the gastrointestinal steroid changes noted in acute shigellosis, which is an invasive intestinal infection. The fecal steroid profile is therefore being studied further to provide a reliable means of differentiating large and small bowel diarrheas. 3asteroids 3adiarrhea 3aetiology 2aAdult 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aChenodeoxycholic Acidxmetabolism 2aCholic Acidsxmetabolism 2aDiarrheaxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmetabolism 2aFecesxanalysis. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSterolsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTravel 0aFecal analysis1 aLevine, Myron M.1 aDaoud, Georgette S.1 aNalin, David R.1 aNichols, Buford L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.40-44x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800610c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01660naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002300136245012400159300001600283500001500299520062700314650001100941650001000952650001500962650001200977650002200989650001501011653000901026700001901035700001701054773011001071852000901181856007601190930003301266946001101299655001201310IND4420981320221119112937.0090522e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442098132DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.15612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZins, Emilie-Laure10aFormation of complexes between uracil and calcium ions: an ESI/MS/MS study in combination with theoretical calculations  ap. 813-820.  a2019-12-04  aCationized uracil clusters around calcium metal ions were generated in the gas phase by electrospray ionization (ESI).

Lower population densities of Td22 were achieved under non-sterile conditions in the compost:millet mix of between 10(7)-10(9) cfu/g after 28 days, depending on pretreatment. Viable spore density of Td22 in raw WFW amended with nutrients and 20% w / w millet seed reached approximately 10(10) cells/ g after 14 days incubation.

The manure was composted in aerated pilot-scale vessels for four weeks or a mechanically turned windrow for ten weeks. Total dry matter losses during the pilot-scale studies were 30 and 32.5 % for continuously and intermittently aerated systems, respectively. Compost from both systems was stable with emission rates of 0.07-0.11 mgC02 h1 g(vs)-1. Moisture, 02, CO2 and NH3 use/losses during the process as well as chemical properties of the initial and composted manure are presented. Incorporation of the compost at a 5% amendment rate (v/v) into a standard pine bark container medium significantly (P = 0.05) increased growth of two woody plant species. Higher amendment rates were toxic to some plants due to high initial NH4 + concentrations in the medium. The compost significantly (P=0.05) increased growth and suppressed Pythium root rot of poinsettia when incorporated at 10% (v/v) into a standard sphagnum peat mix.

In the present study, the effect of prebiotics administered from the first day of life on fecal counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were studied during and after the administration of the prebiotics. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, explorative study, 20 newborns of hepatitis C virus-infected mothers who decided not to breast feed due to their concerns regarding their plasma viral load were randomly assigned to either a formula with 8 g/L of a specific prebiotic mixture (short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, ratio 9:1) or a formula containing the same amount of maltodextrin (placebo). Clinical examination including anthropometric measurements, microbiological analysis of fecal samples, and blood leukocyte population analysis were performed at birth and 3, 6, and 12 mo age. At the age of 12 mo, hepatitis B vaccine-specific IgG serum titers (Hepatitis B virus surface antibodies) were also measured. Prebiotic supplementation resulted in more fecal bifidobacteria (P < 0.0001) and lactobacilli (P = 0.0044) compared with the placebo group. These differences between the groups were maintained during the second half of the first year without any prebiotic supplementation. There was no influence of the different diets on anthropometric data or the measured immunological variables. The data from this small explorative study indicate that early colonization of the intestine might have long-lasting effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis B virus 3aLactobacillus 3aanthropometric measurements 3aantibodies 3abreasts 3aclinical examination 3afeces 3afructooligosaccharides 3agalactooligosaccharides 3ahepatitis B 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfant formulas 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aleukocytes 3amothers 3aneonates 3aparturition 3aplacebos 3aprebiotics 3aviral load 2aBacterial Load 2aBifidobacteriumxisolation & purification 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Formulaxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aInfant, Newborn 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aLactobacillusxisolation & purification 2aMale 2aMetagenome 2aOligosaccharidesxadministration & dosage 2aPrebiotics 2aPregnancy1 aRiva, Enrica1 aSalvatici, Elisabetta1 aBoehm, Günther1 aJelinek, Jürgen1 aBanderali, Giuseppe1 aGiovannini, Marcello0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 July, v. 141, no. 7 p.1335-1339dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1367473Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02932naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245007900186300001600265500002400281520135300305650001701658650002601675650001601701650001601717650001701733650001401750650001001764650001501774650002101789650001401810650002601824650002501850650001301875650001401888650000901902650002201911650001201933650002401945650003901969650002802008650002002036650001202056650002802068650005302096650003002149700002302179700002002202773009902222852000902321856004802330655001202378IND4435987320221119112943.0100423e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443598732DNAL7 a203364772pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-010-0330-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRychel, Amanda L.10aPlant twitter: ligands under 140 amino acids enforcing stomatal patterning  ap. 275-280.  aIncludes references  aStomata are an essential land plant innovation whose patterning and density are under genetic and environmental control. Recently, several putative ligands have been discovered that influence stomatal density, and they all belong to the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE family of secreted cysteine-rich peptides. Two of these putative ligands, EPF1 and EPF2, are expressed exclusively in the stomatal lineage cells and negatively regulate stomatal density. A third, EPFL6 or CHALLAH, is also a negative regulator of density, but is expressed subepidermally in the hypocotyl. A fourth, EPFL9 or STOMAGEN, is expressed in the mesophyll tissues and is a positive regulator of density. Genetic evidence suggests that these ligands may compete for the same receptor complex. Proper stomatal patterning is likely to be an intricate process involving ligand competition, regional specificity, and communication between tissue layers. EPFL-family genes exist in the moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, and rice, Oryza sativa, and their sequence analysis yields several genes some of which are related to EPF1, EPF2, EPFL6, and EPFL9. Presence of these EPFL family members in the basal land plants suggests an exciting hypothesis that the genetic components for stomatal patterning originated early in land plant evolution. 3aOryza sativa 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aSelaginella 3aamino acids 3aembryophytes 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3aleaf development 3amesophyll 3amosses and liverworts 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3areceptors 3arice 3asequence analysis 3astomata 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxmetabolism 2aBody Patterning 2aLigands 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stomataxembryology1 aPeterson, Kylee M.1 aTorii, Keiko U.0 tJournal of plant research.g2010 May, v. 123, no. 3 p.275-280dSpringer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-010-0330-9 7aarticle02678naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245009300183300001400276500002400290520144100314650001701755650002001772650002001792650002901812653001601841653002901857653002301886653002401909700002101933700001701954700001401971700001301985773010801998852000902106856007202115930003302187945002502220946001102245655001202256IND4388620520221119112754.0070306e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438862052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2006.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX200 0aL2001 aDiplaris, S.12aA decision-tree-based alarming system for the validation of national genetic evaluations  ap. 21-35.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this work was to explore possibilities to build an alarming system based on the results of the application of data mining (DM) techniques in genetic evaluations of dairy cattle, in order to assess and assure data quality. The technique used combined data mining using classification and decision-tree algorithms, Gaussian binned fitting functions, and hypothesis tests. Data were quarterly national genetic evaluations, computed between February 1999 and February 2003 in nine countries. Each evaluation run included 73,000-90,000 bull records complete with their genetic values and evaluation information. Milk production traits were considered. Data mining algorithms were applied separately for each country and evaluation run to search for associations across several dimensions, including bull origin, type of proof, age of bull, and number of daughters. Then, data in each node were fitted to the Gaussian function and the quality of the fit was measured, thus providing a measure of the quality of data. In order to evaluate and ultimately predict decision-tree models, the implemented architecture can compare the node probabilities between two models and decide on their similarity, using hypothesis tests for the standard deviation of their distribution. The key utility of this technique lays in its capacity to identify the exact node where anomalies occur, and to fire a focused alarm pointing to erroneous data. 3adairy cattle 3asire evaluation 3aquality control 3adecision support systems 0adata mining 0adairy cattle evaluations 0aalarming technique 0agenetic evaluations1 aSymeonidis, A.L.1 aMitkas, P.A.1 aBanos, G.1 aAbas, Z.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2006 June, v. 52, no. 1-2 p.21-35dElsevierx0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.01.0013electronic resource  a20070316b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03927naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245011400178300001600292500001500308520272000323650002303043650002703066650001803093650002103111650002603132650001803158650002003176650002103196650001203217650002003229653002503249653002803274653002003302700001703322773007603339852000903415930003303424945002503457946001103482655001203493IND4420996920221119112559.0090526s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442099692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGrewal, Antu10aChemical composition and digestibility (in vitro) of green gram as affected by processing and cooking methods  ap. 235-242.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose -- Digestibility of pulses is affected due to presence of antinutritional and toxic compounds. Various processing treatments are known to destroy heat labile toxic compounds and other enzyme inhibitors, hence, to improve the texture, palatability and nutritive value of pulses. This paper, therefore, aims to focus on improving the digestibility and availability of nutrients of green gram (Vigna radiata L.) through processing treatments. Design/methodology/approach -- The present study was undertaken to see the effect of common processing and cooking treatments on newly released green gram cultivars. To achieve this objective, green gram seeds were soaked in plain water (1:4 w/v) for 12 hours at 37°C. One portion of the soaked seeds was dried at 55°C and left-over soaked seeds were divided into three portions. One portion of the soaked seeds was dehulled manually. The second portion of the soaked seeds was ordinary and pressure-cooked (water two times the weight of soaked seeds) for 35 minutes at 95-100°C and at 1.05kg/cm2 pressure for 15 minutes, respectively. The third portion of the soaked seeds was sprouted for 24 hours at 37°C. All the processed seeds were dried at 55°C in a hot air oven and then ground in a cyclone sample mill and stored for estimation of nutritional parameters using standard methods. Findings -- Soaking and cooking treatments had no significant effect on proximate composition, whereas sugar contents increased and starch contents decreased significantly. Soaking and cooking treatments also improved in vitro starch digestibility significantly. De-hulling of soaked seeds further improved starch digestibility and also caused significant change in protein, fat, ash, crude fibre and sugar contents. Germination decreased starch, thereby raising the level of the soluble sugars and improved starch digestibility by 49 and 48 percent, respectively, in both cultivars. Similarly, pressure-cooking also increased starch digestibility by about 44 and 49 percent, respectively, in both cultivars. Cooking may gelatinize starch and germination may mobilize starch, resulting in improved digestibility of starch by a-amylase. Practical implications -- Evolving high-yielding crop varieties is one of the most important strategies to fill the gap between demand and supply of food legumes and also to improve the nutritional status of the population consuming such foods. Hence, it is imperative to judge their chemical composition and improve them through inexpensive processing techniques. Originality/value -- The paper gives an overall view of nutritive values of new and traditional varieties of vegetables and will be of value to those who supply the consumer. 3ain vitro digestion 3ain vitro digestibility 3afood analysis 3anutrient content 3anutrient availability 3aVigna radiata 3anutritive value 3afood composition 3acooking 3acooking quality 0achemical composition 0afood processing quality 0afood processing1 aJood, Sudesh0 tBritish food journal.g2009, v. 111, no. 2-3 p.235-242x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090708b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03226naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002600148245008900174300001600263500002400279520199400303650001602297650001502313650001002328650001302338650001102351650002502362650002902387650001502416650002402431650001302455650001202468650002002480650001502500650000902515650002002524650001202544650002302556650001602579700002002595773010502615852000902720856005102729655001202780IND4430210220221119112616.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443021022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2009.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButchart, Stuart H.M.10aData Deficient birds on the IUCN Red List: What don't we know and why does it matter  ap. 239-247.  aIncludes references  aSpecies are classified as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List if there is inadequate information to make an assessment of their extinction risk based on distribution and/or population status. Data Deficient is probably the most controversial and misunderstood of IUCN Red List categories. All 63 globally Data Deficient bird species lack sufficient information on population size, trends, distribution and/or threats to assess them against the Red List criteria. For 10 species (16%) the paucity of data may be a consequence of taxonomic uncertainty. Three species are known only from specimens of uncertain geographic provenance. Since 1988, 58 Data Deficient birds have been recategorised, mainly as Near Threatened (48%) or Least Concern (16%). We speculate that of the remaining Data Deficient birds, just 14% may prove to be threatened. Proportionately fewer birds (0.6%) are listed as Data Deficient as compared with mammals (15%), amphibians (25%), corals (17%), conifers (4%) and cycads (6%), because birds are better known and perhaps because for birds greater use is made of contextual information (e.g. condition of habitats, likely ecology/habitat preferences and trends in known threatening processes) to assign alternative categories where this is plausible and precautionary. Ensuring consistency between taxonomic groups is essential for the credibility of the IUCN Red List. For non-avian taxa, the higher proportions of Data Deficient species introduces greater uncertainty in estimates of overall extinction risk, but the results from birds hint that the real values may fall at the lower end of these estimates. Data Deficient species should be treated precautionarily in terms of protection and assessing environmental impacts, and regarded as urgent priorities for surveys and research to elucidate their true status. Greater attention should also be given to documenting data quality and uncertainty for Red List assessments of threatened and non-threatened species. 3aCycadopsida 3aamphibians 3abirds 3aconifers 3acorals 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3aextinction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3amammals 3apopulation size 3aprovenance 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3auncertainty1 aBird, Jeremy P.0 tBiological conservation.g2010 Jan., v. 143, no. 1 p.239-247dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.10.008 7aarticle03004naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002500163245014100188300001800329500001500347520132000362650001201682650001701694650001401711650001801725650001201743650001501755650002601770650002201796650002001818650001301838650001201851650001501863650001601878650003301894650002401927650003101951650001301982650002501995650006502020650004902085650004002134653001002174653001102184700002102195700001702216700002302233773009202256852000902348930003302357945002502390946001102415655001202426IND4370672520221119112725.0050529e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067252DNAL7 a157379842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Oxalate efflux from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Quanneng) roots was rapidly stimulated (within 30 min) by aluminium (Al) treatment. The efflux was constant within 6 h, but increased with increasing Al concentration. The efflux was confined to the root tip (0-5 mm), which showed a 5-fold greater efflux than the root zone distal to the tip (5-10 mm). Oxalate efflux could not be triggered by treatment with the trivalent cation lanthanum or by phosphorus deficiency, indicating that the efflux was specific to the Al treatment. All this evidence suggested that spinach possesses Al-resistance mechanisms. However, spinach was found to be as sensitive to Al toxicity as the Al-sensitive wheat line ES8, which had no Al-dependent organic acids efflux. The Al accumulated in the apical 5 mm of the roots of spinach which was also similar to that in the Al-sensitive wheat after 24 h treatment with 50 [micro]M AlCl₃, indicating a non-exclusion mechanism. In addition, root elongation in spinach was significantly inhibited at pH 4.5, compared with that at pH 6.5. Based on this evidence, it is concluded that the sensitivity to acid stress in spinach could mask the potential role for oxalate to protect the plant roots from Al toxicity. 3aacidity 3aplant stress 3aroot tips 3aphytotoxicity 3aspinach 3aacid soils 3anutrient deficiencies 3aSpinacia oleracea 3ametal tolerance 3aaluminum 3aprotons 3aphosphorus 3aoxalic acid 2aAluminum Compoundsxtoxicity 2aChloridesxtoxicity 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aOxalatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSpinacia oleraceaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTriticumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aroots 0aefflux1 aZheng, Shao Jian1 aHe, Yun Feng1 aMatsumoto, Hideaki0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Apr., v. 56, no. 414 p.1197-1203x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle01546naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001700132245005700149300001600206300003000222520044800252650002700700650001400727650001300741650001800754650001900772650001200791650002300803650000900826650004400835650001800879650001100897650004300908650000900951700001700960773009600977852000901073939003301082945000801115946001301123655001201136991562878380742620221119112915.0800521e197903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006932DNAL7 a2836882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, M.J.10aAnorexia of infection as a mechanism of host defense  ap. 593-596.  ap. 593-596. ill., charts.  aExtract: The role of anorexia of infection as a mechanism of host defense was studied by force-feeding infected mice to a normal energy intake. Their mortality and survival times were then compared with those of infected mice feeding ad libitum. Mortality was increased and survival time shortened in force fed animals.

In this study, five barley varieties were malted at industrial and micro scale, and quality parameters of the resulting malts were measured (diastatic power, friability, β-glucan content, antiradical power, reducing power, lipoxygenase activity, and nonenal potential) and correlated with the sensory data obtained for the corresponding fresh and forced aged beers. A statistical strategy using multiple linear regressions was applied to explore relationships between the malt chemical parameters and beer sensory data, showing antiradical power as the major contribution of malt to beer flavor stability. Additionally, the measured antiradical power, which is well correlated with the polyphenolic content, was found to be very similar for malt and barley, emphasizing the key role of barley endogenous polyphenols. 3amalting barley 3amalt 3acarbohydrate content 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3avarieties 3aaldehydes 3amalting quality 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-glucans 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidant activity 3abeers 0anonenal potential 0afriability 0adiastatic power 0alipoxygenase1 aCurto, A.F.1 aBoivin, P.1 aBenismail, N.1 aGoncalves, C.R.1 aBarros, A.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Feb. 7, v. 55, no. 3 p.728-733dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06230793Available from publisher's Web site  a20070627b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/27  aOther US 7aarticle01947naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001800132245003800150300001600188300003000204520070400234650002400938650002400962650001900986650001501005650001101020650002801031650003401059650003601093650001501129650001301144650001301157650002201170650002201192653002101214653002301235653002701258700002201285700002301307773009601330852000901426939003301435945000801468946001301476655001201489991562877960742620221119112918.0800521e197902  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006672DNAL7 a4201342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugdale, A.E.10aKnowledge and belief in nutrition  ap. 441-445.  ap. 441-445. ill., charts.  aQuestions about common nutritional problems were given to physicians, medical students, nurses, and theology students.

Maintenance of endogenous CK levels by genetic transformation with ipt in leaves and roots undergoing senescence may promote stress tolerance. This study was designed to determine the physiological effects of ipt expression on immature and mature leaves and in roots for plants exposed to different levels of water stress for creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). Plants containing the ipt gene, encoding the enzyme adenine isopentenyl phosphotransferase for CK synthesis ligated to a senescence-activated promoter (SAG12), and wild-type 'Penncross' (WT) were grown hydroponically in a growth chamber and exposed to water stress by weekly additions of polyethylene glycol 8000 to reduce the growing solution osmotic potential from -0.05 to -0.3, -0.5, -0.7, -1.0, and -1.4 MPa. Immature and mature leaves and roots of SAG12-ipt creeping bentgrass were evaluated for ipt expression, CK content, leaf relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content (Chl), photochemical efficiency (FvFm), osmotic adjustment (OA), photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE), carbon isotope discrimination (Δ), and root viability. Expression of ipt was detected in all plant parts and a higher CK content, primarily in the form of isopentyladenine (iPa), was found in SAG12-ipt plants but not in the WT plants under water stress. Immature leaves exhibited higher iPa and OA at all treatment levels. Mature leaves of SAG12-ipt plants maintained higher OA, Pn, Chl, WUE, and Δ, whereas gs and E were relatively unaffected compared to the WT. Roots of SAG12-ipt plants had higher levels of iPa and greater root viability than the WT. The results demonstrate that expression of ipt enhanced the tolerance of creeping bentgrass to water stress, which could be attributed to the positive effects on osmotic adjustment, efficient water use, and maintaining higher photosynthetic rate primarily for mature leaves, as well as increased root viability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3aviability 3aadenine 3astomatal conductance 3aenzymes 3aisotopes 3aosmotic pressure 3awater use efficiency 3awater stress 3acarbon 3apolyethylene glycol 3agenes 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3awater content 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3agrowth chambers 3aroots 3aleaves 3astress tolerance 2aAgrostisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytokininsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aWaterxmetabolism 0asenescence1 aGianfagna, Thomas1 aHuang, Bingru0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.383-395dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq2853Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01919naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002400132245007000156300001600226300002400242500001500266520062400281650001600905650001000921650002700931650001400958650002100972650001600993650002201009650001201031650001601043650003601059650001701095650002101112650000901133650000901142650000901151653000901160700002301169700002501192700002601217700002301243773009601266852000901362939003301371945000801404946001301412655001201425991562877200742620221119113110.0800521e197903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006942DNAL7 a4201512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKritchevsky, David.10aInfluence of whole or skim milk on cholesterol metabolism in rats  ap. 597-600.  ap. 597-600. charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Male Wistar rats were fed commercial ration and given whole milk, skim milk, or water to drink.

After 1 week the increased size of the soleus and plantaris in the leg in which the gastrocnemius was severed, relative to that of the sham operated leg, was determined for each rat. Despite differences in body weight and serum calcium among the groups, no difference in the percent of muscle hypertrophy was found. Muscle hypertrophy can occur in response to local mechanical forces despite a deficient hormonal environment that otherwise retards growth. 3aanimal experimentation 3amuscles 3avitamin D 3avitamin deficiencies 3ahypertrophy 2aAnimals 2aHindlimb 2aHypertrophyxetiology 2aMale 2aMusclesxpathology 2aPhysical Exertion 2aRats 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxcomplicationsxpathology. 0astress 0aPhysical activities1 aHagler, Louis.1 aLollini, Lance O.1 aHull, Sam F.1 aHerman, Robert H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.515-516x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800521c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03334naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014100183300001600324500002400340520159800364650002201962650002601984650000802010650001102018650001402029650001502043650001602058650001302074650001102087650001502098650003502113650001702148650001502165650001902180650002902199650003102228650001402259650004202273650002002315650003002335650001702365651001002382651001802392651001002410700002102420700001502441700001702456700001502473700001202488700001802500773013202518852000902650856008502659655001202744IND4435677520221119113029.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443567752DNAL7 a201274202pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-010-0295-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Yan-Ping10aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers in background surface soils from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China: occurrence, sources, and inventory  ap. 948-956.  aIncludes references  aPurposes Very few data for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were available in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), one of the most developed and urbanized region in China. In this study, Chongming Island, located at the estuary of the Yangtze River, was selected as background area to investigate the occurrence, sources, and inventory of PBDEs. Methods Forty-two PBDE congeners were determined in surface soils from farmland, woodland, grassland, tideland, and road collected in Chongming Island. Results The mean concentrations of Σ₂₆PBDE (not including BDE-209) and BDE-209 in soils were 0.76 and 12 ng/g dry weight, respectively. BDE-209 contributed more than 90% of the total of 27 frequently detected BDE congeners, followed by BDE-99 and BDE-47. Weak correlations were found between total organic carbon content and PBDE congeners concentrations in surface soils. PBDE levels varied with land use. Farmland and woodland soils contained higher Σ₂₆PBDE concentrations. BDE-209 levels were the highest in road soils. The mass inventories of PBDEs in soils of Chongming Island were estimated at 3.1 and 310 kg for Σ₂₆PBDEs and BDE-209, respectively. Conclusions The PBDE levels in Chongming Island were similar to those in European background soils, suggesting minimum influence of pollutants from the YRD via air, and wastewater inputs or few PBDE products were used herein. From the standpoint of eco-inland, more studies are needed to explore the reasons of PBDE difference by land use and to assess people intake PBDEs via agriculture products consumption in this region. 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural products 3aair 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3agrasslands 3ainventories 3aland use 3apeople 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3awoodland soils 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aGeography 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Supply 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aChina1 aMeng, Xiang-Zhou1 aYang, Chao1 aPan, Zhao-Yu1 aChen, Ling1 aYu, Ran1 aLi, Feng-Ting0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2010 May, v. 17, no. 4 p.948-956dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-010-0295-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03964naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011900164300001400283500002400297520242500321650001102746650001302757650001102770650001202781650002002793650001202813650001602825650001102841650001602852650001102868650001402879650001302893650002102906650002002927650001402947650001502961650001702976650001402993650001303007650001003020650000903030650002103039650001103060650001703071700001403088700001503102700001803117700001703135700001603152700001403168773011003182852000903292856008503301655001203386IND4465843520221119112901.0130408s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446584352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2004.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagliavini, M.10aDynamics of nutrients uptake by strawberry plants (Fragaria × Ananassa Dutch.) grown in soil and soilless culture  ap. 15-25.  aIncludes references  aTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the dynamics of nutrient uptake by strawberry plants grown under field conditions and the root nitrogen (N) uptake, storage and remobilisation by soilless grown plants. Uptake and partitioning of nutrients were determined by successive destructive plant harvest and mineral analysis of plant organs of two field grown varieties (‘Idea’ and ‘Marmolada’). Plants were destructively harvested at different developing stages and divided into roots, crowns, leaves, flower stalks, fruits. In an additional trial, the same approach was applied to two sets of plants either not fertilised or receiving (in kg ha−1) 55 N, 10 phosphorus (P), 108 potassium (K) and 22 magnesium (Mg). In both cultivars the growth rate increased after blossom until end of fruit ripening, and nutrient uptake rate was lower in autumn than in spring. For K no net uptake was observed between mid autumn and the dormant period. Potassium was the nutrient absorbed in spring at the highest rates followed by N, calcium (Ca), Mg and P. Calculated on hectare basis, total plant removal by fertilised plants ranged between 78 and 91 kg N, 12 and 17 kg P, 92 and 125 kg K, 58 and 91 kg Ca, 19 and 23 kg Mg. Mineral partitioning among plant organs varied with nutrients: Ca was mainly recovered in leaves, magnesium was almost equally partitioned between leaves and fruit while N, P and K were especially found in fruits. The roots and the crowns accounted for only small proportion of total plant nutrients at the end of fruiting season. Root N uptake in autumn, winter storage, remobilisation of N reserves and spring N uptake were studied applying 15N technique to potted strawberry plants of cv. Onda grown under greenhouse conditions. Nitrogen at high and low levels was supplied as unlabelled calcium nitrate in autumn. Plants were transferred in February into new pots filled with sterile sand. In spring both sets of plants were supplied with labelled Ca(15NO3)2. High N supply in autumn significantly increased biomass and N content in plant organs, but did not affect fruit yields and quality. In spring, N was remobilised from roots and crowns to sustain growth. Remobilisation of N to new growth was completed by blooming, and around 40% of stored N was translocated to new growth. Plant partitioned to fruits a significant fraction of absorbed N, especially during the fruit ripening stage. 3aAnanas 3aFragaria 3aautumn 3acalcium 3acalcium nitrate 3aflowers 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant organs 3apotassium 3aripening 3aroots 3asoil 3asoilless culture 3aspring 3astrawberries1 aBaldi, E.1 aLucchi, P.1 aAntonelli, M.1 aSorrenti, G.1 aBaruzzi, G.1 aFaedi, W.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2005 July, v. 23, no. 1 p.15-25dElsevier Science Pub.

Unsupplemented and supplemented infants were tested at 15 days of age: a 2 x 2 checkerboard was presented eight times followed by a single presentation of a 6 x 6 checkerboard. Unsupplemented infants showed less initial attention followed by slower habituation and higher levels of movement than the supplemented infants.

The rhizosphere of willows (Salix viminalis) was screened for cultivable bacteria with high enzymatic activity (proteolytic, pectolytic, cellulolytic, amylolytic) and production of siderophores at four test sites with broad spectrum of anthropogenic soil disturbance: sewage-sludge application, impoverishment by unfavorable arable use, ash dumping, and household-waste depositing. The density of bacteria in the rhizosphere ranged from 7.92 to 8.56 log₁₀ of colony-forming units per gram dry weight of soil and varied in a site- and willow-clone-specific manner. Within the 240 bacterial strains, a high diversity of metabolic activities was observed but was rarely combined in one strain (1.2% having six and 5.8% having five out of seven metabolic activities, respectively). The majority of strains (79.2%) revealed just one or two metabolic activities. Most common was a combination of lipolytic, proteolytic activities, and siderophore production as found in 13.8% of the bacterial strains. The 50 strains with the highest metabolic activity belonged predominantly to the Gammaproteobacteria (66%), the others to Flavobacteria (18%), Betaproteobacteria (8%), Actinobacteria (4%), and Bacilli (4%). The highest portion of cultivable strains of rhizosphere bacteria with high metabolic activities belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Flavobacterium. We hypothesize that these genera include strains that support willow growth and soil remediation. Therefore, the described strain collection from the rhizosphere of S. viminalis provides a valuable basis for a subsequent selection of these candidates for applications in improvement of site adaptation of plants or remediation of soils. 3aActinobacteria 3aFlavobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aSalix viminalis 3aSerratia 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3adisturbed soils 3aenzyme activity 3alandfills 3aplant adaptation 3aproteolysis 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3ascreening 3asewage sludge 3asiderophores 3asoil remediation1 aBaum, Christel1 aLeinweber, Peter0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2010 Oct., v. 173, no. 5 p.747-756dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900286 7aarticle03717naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002200163245011200185300001600297500001500313520143700328650002301765650002601788650002101814650001801835650001101853650002101864650002001885650002401905650002501929650002901954650001901983650002502002650001802027650001602045650003102061650002102092650001202113650001902125650002402144650001802168650002402186650005802210650005002268650002802318650003702346650002802383650002402411650001702435650004202452650001602494650004202510650003502552650003802587650002702625653002802652653001002680700002602690700002002716700001602736700002102752700001802773773009002791852000902881930003302890945002502923946001102948655001202959IND4370674020141222000000.0050529e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067402DNAL7 a156111492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMartínez, Manuel14aThe barley cystatin gene (Icy) is regulated by DOF transcription factors in aleurone cells upon germination  ap. 547-556.  a2019-12-05  aA genomic clone (Icy gene) encoding a barley cystatin has been characterized. The gene contains one intron interrupting its ORF that encodes a protein of 107 amino acid residues. A DNA fragment of -1058 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon has been sequenced and several promoter deletions fused to the {szligbeta}-glucuronidase (GUS; uidA gene) reporter gene obtained. Transient expression assays in different barley tissues have indicated that a -631 bp promoter fragment was sufficient for full activity. In bombarded barley aleurone layers the GUS-driven expression by this promoter is repressed by GA₃ incubation, as is the accumulation of the Icy transcripts detected. A spatial and temporal location of cystatin transcripts by in situ hybridization techniques indicates that this gene is ubiquitously expressed and its transcripts are particularly abundant in leaves and roots, and in seeds, both during development and upon germination. Two DOF transcription factors, SAD and BPBF, previously described as involved in gene expression regulation in seeds, interact specifically in vitro with oligonucleotides containing DOF binding-sites derived from the Icy gene promoter. Transient expression experiments in co-bombarded aleurone layers demonstrate that BPBF strongly represses transcription of the native Icy promoter, even when co-transfected with SAD that behaves as an activator in this in vivo system. 3atemporal variation 3atranscription factors 3aseed germination 3amessenger RNA 3abarley 3aoligonucleotides 3aHordeum vulgare 3aopen reading frames 3aspatial distribution 3atranscription (genetics) 3aaleurone cells 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3astart codon 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3aintrons 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCystatinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGerminationxphysiology 2aHordeumxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Roots 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxphysiology 2aSeedsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxphysiology 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes1 aRubio-Somoza, Ignacio1 aFuentes, Rebeca1 aLara, Pilar1 aCarbonero, Pilar1 aDiaz, Isabel.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Feb., v. 56, no. 412 p.547-556x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060816b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02545naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072000900138100001700147245013500164300001800299500002400317500001500341520096400356650002301320650001801343650001901361650003001380650001601410650001501426650001501441650002401456650002001480650001001500650002001510650001801530650001101548650002201559650001701581650002701598650001401625650002301639653001601662653002001678700001801698700001901716773011001735852000901845856007801854930003301932945002501965946001301990655001202003IND4388615520221119112626.0070306e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438861552DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-15112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aLlorente, I.10aInfection Potential of Pleospora allii and Evaluation of Methods for Reduction of the Overwintering Inoculum of Brown Spot of Pear  ap. 1511-1516.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe capacity for germination and pathogenicity to pear leaves of ascospores of Pleospora allii, the teleomorph of Stemphylium vesicarium, causal agent of brown spot of pear, were studied in vitro. Most ascospores germinated within 1 h at temperatures between 15 and 20°C, and the optimum temperature for germination was 18.9°C. Infections developed on wounded and nonwounded detached pear leaves, but were more frequent on wounded leaves. The minimum infective dose was one ascospore per wound. Biological, chemical, and mechanical methods for decreasing overwintering inoculum of P. allii were evaluated. Ascospores were discharged from March to May, depending on the orchard and year. Leaf shredding or removal were the most effective methods of reducing overwintering inoculum. Biological control methods based on application of Thichoderma sp. formulations were partially effective. Chemical methods based on copper and urea treatments were ineffective. 3afungal antagonists 3aoverwintering 3aPyrus communis 3afungal diseases of plants 3aTrichoderma 3afungicides 3aascospores 3aambient temperature 3aspore discharge 3apears 3adisease control 3apathogenicity 3aleaves 3aspore germination 3aplant damage 3aStemphylium vesicarium 3aPleospora 3abiological control 0asporulation 0aPleospora allii1 aVilardell, A.1 aMontesinos, E.0 tPlant disease.g2006 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.1511-1516dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-15113Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/07/09  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001900132245015700151300001600308300003000324500001500354520081700369650002201186650002001208650001701228650002701245650003201272650001201304650002101316650002001337650003001357650003101387650003901418650002301457650002801480650002201508650001101530650001501541650001801556650002401574650002901598650002901627650003001656650001901686650000901705650002501714650002501739653002801764653001101792653001101803653003401814700001901848700002001867700001701887773009601904852000902000939003302009945000802042946001302050655001202063991562874290742620221119112409.0800519e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006362DNAL7 a2196782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallahan, M.M.14aThe effect of coffee consumption on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and the development of aortic atherosclerosis in rhesus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet  ap. 834-845.  ap. 834-845. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: The effect of coffee consumption on the turnover of lipoproteins and the development of aortic atherosclerosis in rhesus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet was evaluated.

The atherogenic diet induced fatty streaks in the aorta of all monkeys to a greater extent in males than females. However, there were no gross differences in the quantity or distribution of the streaks between control and coffee-drinking monkeys. 3acoffee (beverage) 3aatherosclerosis 3alipoproteins 3aanimal experimentation 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAorta, Abdominal 2aAorta, Thoracic 2aAortic Diseasesxetiology 2aArteriosclerosisxetiology 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCoffeexadverse effects 2aDiet, Atherogenic 2aFemale 2aHaplorhini 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aLipoproteins, HDLxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxblood 2aLipoproteins, VLDLxblood 2aMacaca mulatta 2aMale 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0acardiovascular diseases 0aplasma 0alipids 0aTherapeutic and special diets1 aRohovsky, M.W.1 aRobertson, R.S.1 aYesair, D.W.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.834-845x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800519c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02261naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002000132245014400152300001600296300002400312520075800336650002301094650000901117650001501126650001401141650002201155650001001177650004201187650000901229650001101238650001101249650003901260650002601299650002501325650002901350650002701379650001401406650001801420653002401438653002801462653002001490653002701510700002601537700002101563773009601584852000901680939003301689945000801722946001301730655001201743991562873970742620221119112309.0800519e197902  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006532DNAL7 a4201262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshe, Jessie R.14aThe retention of calcium, iron, phosphorus, and magnesium during pregnancy: The adequacy of prenatal diets with and without supplementation  ap. 286-291.  ap. 286-291. charts.  aExtract: The retention of calcium and iron was determined in pregnant women consuming supplemented or unsupplemented self-selected diets.

Seven-day metabolic balance experiments spaced periodically throughout the pregnancy were conducted on 10 healthy pregnant white women. The retention of calcium by the supplemented group was comparable to that of the unsupplemented group, while the retention of iron was more dependent on the magnitude of the iron intake than on its source. The intake of phosphorus met the recommended allowances for this mineral and reflected diets providing adequate calcium.

Major findings were as follows. First, a high diversity in N-terminal metal binding motifs was observed. These motifs were distributed throughout bacterial and archaeal lineages, suggesting multiple loss and acquisition events. Second, the CopA locus separated into two distinct phylogenetic clusters, CopA1, which contained ATPases with documented Cu(I) influx activity, and CopA2, which contained both efflux and influx transporters and spanned the entire diversity of the bacterial domain, suggesting that CopA2 is the ancestral locus. Finally, phylogentic incongruences between 16S rRNA and P[subscript IB]-type ATPase gene trees identified at least 14 instances of lateral gene transfer (LGT) that had occurred among diverse microbes. Results from bootstrapped supported nodes indicated that (i) a majority of the transfers occurred among proteobacteria, most likely due to the phylogenetic relatedness of these organisms, and (ii) gram-positive bacteria with low moles percent G+C were often involved in instances of LGT. These results, together with our earlier work on the occurrence of LGT in subsurface bacteria (J. M. Coombs and T. Barkay, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70:1698-1707, 2004), indicate that LGT has had a minor role in the evolution of P[subscript IB]-type ATPases, unlike other genes that specify survival in metal-stressed environments. This study demonstrates how examination of a specific locus across microbial genomes can contribute to the understanding of phenotypes that are critical to the interactions of microbes with their environment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aloci 3ametals 3anatural history 3aopen reading frames 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atransporters 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArchaeaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenome, Archaeal 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGenomics 2aHomeostasis 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny1 aBarkay, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Nov., v. 71, no. 11 p.7083-7091dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.11.7083-7091.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245019100154300001800345500002400363520112500387650001801512650001701530650001001547650001601557650001701573650002301590650001301613650002101626650002001647650001301667650002801680650002301708651001101731651001401742700001801756700001901774700001201793700001701805700002901822773010701851852000901958856003901967655001202006IND4442129220221119112201.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444212922DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.31162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFibach, Eitan10aAmelioration of oxidative stress in red blood cells from patients with β-thalassemia major and intermedia and E-β-thalassemia following administration of a fermented papaya preparation  ap. 1334-1338.  aIncludes references  aIn β-hemoglobinopathies, such as β-thalassemia (thal) and sickle cell anemia, the primary defects are mutations in the β-globin gene. However, many aspects of the pathophysiology are mediated by oxidative stress. Fermented papaya preparation (FPP), a natural health food product obtained by biofermentation of carica papaya, has been shown to limit oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. We studied the effect of FPP on two groups of β-thal patients: β-thal, major and intermedia, (in Israel) and E-β-thal (in Singapore). The results indicated that in both groups FPP treatment increased the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in red blood cells (RBC), and decreased their reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, membrane lipid peroxidation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), indicating amelioration of their oxidative status, without a significant change in the hematological parameters. Since the turnover of the erythron is relatively slow, it is possible that longer duration of treatment, probably with the addition of an iron chelator, is required in order to achieve the latter goals. 3aCarica papaya 3aerythrocytes 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahealth foods 3alipid peroxidation 3amutation 3aoxidative stress 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3areactive oxygen species 3asickle cell anemia 3aIsrael 3aSingapore1 aTan, Ee-Shien1 aJamuar, Saumya1 aNg, Ivy1 aAmer, Johnny1 aRachmilewitz, Eliezer A.0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.1334-1338dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3116 7aarticle07029naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012300161300001600284500002400300500001500324520513600339650002105475650002505496650002605521650002605547650002205573650001405595650002705609650001605636650001805652650001405670650001005684650001905694650001605713650001005729650001205739650003805751650002005789650002105809650002505830650002605855650001505881650002805896650002405924650001305948650002505961650001405986650001606000650001106016650001906027650001506046653002406061700001806085700002906103700003306132773013206165852000906297856008506306655001206391IND4435676420221119112228.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443567642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-010-0301-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wenxin10aRemoval of estrone, 17α-ethinylestradiol, and 17ß-estradiol in algae and duckweed-based wastewater treatment systems  ap. 824-833.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground, aim, and scope Many pollutants have received significant attention due to their potential estrogenic effect and are classified as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Because of possible ecological effects and increased attention for water reuse schemes, it is important to increase our understanding of the EDC removal capacities of various wastewater treatment systems. However, there has so far been little research on the fate and behavior of EDCs in stabilization pond systems for wastewater treatment, which represent an important class of wastewater treatment systems in developing countries because of their cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to study the fate and behavior of EDCs in algae and duckweed ponds. Because the synthetic hormone 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and the natural hormones estrone (E1), as well as 17β-estradiol (E2), have been detected in effluents of sewage treatment plants and been suggested as the major compounds responsible for endocrine disruption in domestic sewage; E1, E2, and EE2 were therefore chosen as target chemicals in this current work. Materials and methods Both batch tests and continuous-flow tests were carried out to investigate the sorption and biodegradation of estrogens in algae and duckweed pond systems. The applied duckweed was a Lemna species. The applied algae was a mixture of pure cultures of six different algae genera, i.e., Anabaena cylindrica, Chlorococcus, Spirulina platensis, Chlorella, Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Anaebena var. Synthetic wastewater were used in all tests. The concentrations of estrogens were measured with three different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits specific for E1, E2, or EE2. When the concentrations of estrogens in water samples were below the lowest quantitative analysis range (0.05 µg/l), preconcentration of the water samples were performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges. Results The 6-day batch tests show that the presence of algae or duckweed accelerated the removal of the three estrogens from the synthetic wastewater. More estrogens were removed in the tests with duckweed than in tests with algae or with wastewater. In the sorption tests, a swift sorption of the three estrogens was observed when the estrogens were contacted with duckweed or algae, while the estrogen concentrations in tap water kept unchanged during the 3-h sorption tests. The mass balances indicated that only about 5% of the estrogens were bound to the algae sediment or duckweed at the end of the 6-day tests. Results of the continuous-flow tests revealed that the algae and duckweed ponds effectively removed E1, E2, and EE2 even at nanograms per liter level. Interconversion of E1 and E2 occurred both in batch and continuous-flow tests. E2 could be readily transformed to E1, especially in the tests with algae. Discussion Different processes like sorption, biodegradation and photolytic degradation might play an important role in the removal of estrogens from the aquatic phase. The 3-h sorption tests support the importance of sorption for estrogen removal, in which a rapid initial sorption was observed over the first 2 min for E1/E2/EE2 to both duckweed and algae. In the 6-day batch tests, estrogens were sorbed by algae or duckweed during the early stage when algae and duckweed were contacted with the synthetic wastewater and the sorbed estrogens were further biodegraded by the microorganisms developed in the wastewater. The persistent estrogen concentrations in tap water, however, implied that no sorption, biodegradation, or photolytic degradation occurred in tap water under the specific experimental conditions. Under aerobic or anoxic conditions, E2 could be first oxidized to E1, which is further oxidized to unknown metabolites and finally to CO₂ and water. Under anaerobic conditions, E1 can also be reduced to E2. However, the interconversion might be much more complex especially in the tests with algae because both aerobic and anaerobic conditions occurred in these tests due to the variation of the dissolved oxygen concentration induced by the light regime. Conclusions This study shows that estrogens, E1, E2, and EE2, can be effectively removed from the continuous-flow algae and duckweed ponds even when their concentrations are at nanograms per liter level. The presence of algae and duckweed accelerate the removal of estrogens from the synthetic wastewater because estrogens can be quickly sorbed on duckweed or algae. The sorbed estrogens are subsequently degraded by microorganisms, algae, or duckweed in the wastewater treatment system. E1 and E2 are interconvertible in both duckweed and algae pond systems. E2 can be readily transformed to E1, especially in the tests with algae. Recommendation and perspectives Based on the tests performed so far, one can conclude that both sorption and biodegradation are important to the estrogens removal from stabilization pond systems for wastewater treatment. Further research using, e.g., radioimmunoassay is needed to investigate the biodegradation pathway of estrogens in algae and duckweed ponds. 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 3aestrogenic properties 3aArthrospira platensis 3aradioimmunoassays 3aestradiol 3asolid phase extraction 3ametabolites 3awaste lagoons 3aChlorella 3aLemna 3acarbon dioxide 3awater reuse 3aponds 3aestrone 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3asewage effluent 3adissolved oxygen 3aanaerobic conditions 3aquantitative analysis 3aphotolysis 3aScenedesmus quadricauda 3aAnabaena cylindrica 3asorption 3adeveloping countries 3atap water 3aphotoperiod 3asewage 3abiodegradation 3awastewater 0aSpirulina platensis1 aWang, Lizheng1 aRousseau, Diederik P.

Thirty Cobb 500 chicken (22-day-old) were exposed to 40 °C/4 hrs/day for ten days. Blood samples were collected before and after heat exposure at 3 stages during experimental, (1st, 5th and 10th day) samples which were taken at the first day before heat exposure were served as control group (Basal level). The result revealed that heat stress led to significant (p < 0.01) decrease in plasma ascorbic acid, Antibodies (IgG and IgM) levels in all stage, whereas percentage lymphocyte and heterophil and H/L ratio showed significant changes during three stage of experiment. It is suggested that alteration of plasma ascorbic acid and immunoresponse may reflect heat stress in chicken. 3abroiler chickens 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aanimal stress 3apoultry housing 3alymphocytes 3aheat stress 3aseasonal variation 3aimmune response 3aheterophils 3aascorbic acid 3aSaudi Arabia 0ablood chemistry1 aAl-Ghamdi, H.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2008, v. 7, no. 10 p.964-968x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03762naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002400180245015600204300001800360500001500378520145300393650000901846650001801855650002001873650002201893650002101915650001701936650002601953650000901979650002001988650002502008650002002033650001002053650001502063650002502078650003102103650001002134650002102144650001102165650002302176650002302199650002202222650002802244650001702272650003402289650003802323650002702361650004502388650003302433650002902466650002902495650002502524650003702549653002802586653002102614653002502635700002102660700002002681700002602701700002302727700002202750700001802772700002402790773008802814852000902902930003302911945002502944946001102969655001202980IND4370685720221119112233.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437068572DNAL7 a157814412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role. 3arice 3amessenger RNA 3aplant nutrition 3acomplementary DNA 3achelating agents 3aOryza sativa 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3anutrient uptake 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3agenes 3amethionine 3aplant micronutrients 3agene expression regulation 3aroots 3apromoter regions 3aleaves 2aBlotting, Northern 2aConserved Sequence 2aEnzymesxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenes, Plant 2aIronxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aIron Chelating Agentsxmetabolism 2aMethioninexmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aS-Adenosylmethioninexmetabolism 0amolecular sequence data 0amethionine cycle 0anucleotide sequences1 aSuzuki, Motofumi1 aInoue, Haruhiko1 aItai, Reiko Nakanishi1 aTakahashi, Michiko1 aNakanishi, Hiromi1 aMori, Satoshi1 aNishizawa, Naoko K.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 415 p.1305-1316x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03763naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245020900216300001600425520187100441650001102312650006502323650003102388650003202419650006202451650003502513650003102548650001102579650002502590650002602615650006802641650002702709650005202736650004102788650002902829653001102858653001902869653003202888653001502920653001102935700002402946700002202970773010802992852000903100856009203109930003303201946001103234655001203245IND4426979420221119112303.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442697942DNAL7 a200675342pmid7 aPMC27706822pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberlin, Dominique10aInsulin-like growth factor I messenger RNA and protein are expressed in the human lymph node and distinctly confined to subtypes of macrophages, antigen-presenting cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells  ap. 342-350.  aInsulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent hormone that stimulates growth and differentiation and inhibits apoptosis in numerous tissues. Preliminary evidence suggests that IGF-I exerts differentiating, mitogenic and restoring activities in the immune system but the sites of synthesis of local IGF-I are unknown. Identification of these sites would allow the functional role of local IGF-I to be clarified. The presence of IGF-I in non-immune cells suggests that it acts as a trophic factor, while its occurrence in subtypes of lymphocytes or antigen-presenting cells indicates paracrine/autocrine direct regulatory involvement of IGF-I in the human immune response. The present study investigated the location of IGF-I messenger RNA and protein on archival human lymph node samples by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence staining using an IGF-I probe and antisera specific for human IGF-I and CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD68 (macrophages), CD21 (follicular dendritic cells), S100 (interdigitating dendritic cells) and podoplanin (fibroblastic reticular cells). Numerous cells within the B- and T-cell compartments expressed the IGF-I gene, and the majority of these cells were identified as macrophages. Solitary follicular dendritic cells exhibited IGF-I. A few T lymphocytes, and no B lymphocytes, contained IGF-I immunoreactive material. Furthermore, IGF-I immunoreactive cells outside the follicles that did not react with CD3, CD20, S100 or podoplanin markers were identified as high-endothelial venule (HEV) cells. From this we conclude that the main task of IGF-I in human non-tumoral lymph node may be autocrine and paracrine regulation of the differentiation, stimulation and survival of lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and macrophages and the differentiation and maintenance of HEV cells. 3ahumans 2aAntigen-Presenting Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aAntigens, CDxbiosynthesis 2aCalgranulin Axbiosynthesis 2aEndothelium, Vascularximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLymph Nodesxpathology 2aLymphocytesximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 0aB-cell 0adendritic cell 0afibroblastic reticular cell 0amacrophage 0aT-cell1 aFellbaum, Christian1 aEppler, Elisabeth0 tImmunology.g2009 Nov., v. 128, no. 3 p.342-350dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03136.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01933naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245008800170300001600258500002400274520065200298650001600950650002000966650002600986650001501012650002501027650001401052650002301066700001801089700001501107700001601122700001501138700001501153700001501168773015901183852000901342856007701351930003301428945002501461946001301486655001201499IND4388631320221119112339.0070306e20070207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438863132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06309732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ204 0aH0001 aCaboni, P.10aDegradation of Pyrethrin Residues on Stored Durum Wheat after Postharvest Treatment  ap. 832-835.  aIncludes references  aIn this paper, pyrethrin levels during a postharvest treatment on stored durum wheat were studied.

In a 2-yr grazing experiment, replicate 0.40-ha paddocks in established dallisgrass pasture were continuously stocked, or replicate 0.40-ha paddocks were subdivided into two 0.20-ha (RS2), three 0.13-ha (RS3), or four 0.10-ha (RS4) cells and rotationally stocked with yearling beef steers. Individual cells within the RS2, RS3, and RS4 treatments were stocked for 7 d followed by 7, 14, or 21 d of rest, respectively. In 2007, 3 Angus x Simmental crossbred steers (initial BW, 354 ± 6 kg) were assigned randomly to each paddock on July 16; in 2008, 3 Angus x Simmental crossbred steers (initial BW, 310 ± 6 kg) were assigned randomly to each paddock on July 14. In 2007, there was no effect (P = 0.25) of stocking treatment on ADG. Steers grazing RS4, RS2, and continuously stocked paddocks had 106 (P = 0.01), 86 (P = 0.03), and 83 (P = 0.03) kg greater total BW gain per ha, respectively, than steers grazing RS3 paddocks. In 2008, there were no differences among treatments in ADG (P = 0.43) or total BW gain per ha (P = 0.90). Correlation and regression analyses revealed positive associations between steer performance and forage concentration of CP, areal mass (kg/ha) of forage DM, and areal mass of forage CP. Results indicate that productivity and quality of dallisgrass for stocker cattle production were comparable between continuous and rotational-stocking methods. 3aAngus 3aPaspalum dilatatum 3aSimmental 3abeef 3acattle production 3aforage 3agrazing 3agrazing management 3apastures 3aregression analysis 3asteers 3astocker cattle 3astocking rate 3ayearlings 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPaspalumxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRegression Analysis1 aPereira, A.C.1 aLin, J.C.1 aHolliman, J.L.1 aMuntifering, R.B.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.571-580dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-31023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02724naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100002200164245017800186300001600364500002400380520101200404650002201416650001401438650001201452650000901464650001201473650002901485650001401514650001901528650002101547650003101568650001401599650001101613653004901624653002201673700001701695700001701712700001701729700001601746700001601762700001601778700001501794700001701809700001601826773015901842852000902001856007702010930003302087945002502120946001302145655001202158IND4388630820221119112259.0070306e20070207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438863082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf062749k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aT300 0aX3801 aDenery-Papini, S.10aInfluence of the Allelic Variants Encoded at the Gli-B1 Locus, Responsible for a Major Allergen of Wheat, on IgE Reactivity for Patients Suffering from Food Allergy to Wheat  ap. 799-805.  aIncludes references  aWheat presents an important genetic diversity that could be useful to look for cultivars with reduced allergencity. omega 5-Gliadins have been described as major allergens for wheat allergic patients suffering from wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) and some cases of chronic urticaria (U). Our objective was to study the influence of genetic variability at the Gli-B1 locus encoding for omega 5-gliadins on the reactivity of IgE antibodies from these patients. We selected cultivars expressing 13 alleles at Gli-B1 including a wheat/rye translocation and studied the reactivity to gliadins of a rabbit antiserum specific for omega 5-gliadins and of IgE from 10 patients. The antiserum and IgE from nine patients with WDEIA and U strongly detected omega 5-gliadins expressed by most of the Gli-B1 alleles but showed no or faint responses to the gliadins and secalins extracted from the translocated wheat. The selection of genotypes lacking the Gli-B1 locus may reduce wheat allergenicity. 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3aalleles 3aloci 3agliadin 3abiochemical polymorphism 3aallergens 3afood allergies 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aurticaria 3ahumans 0awheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis 0achronic urticaria1 aLauriere, M.1 aBranlard, G.1 aMorisset, M.1 aPecquet, C.1 aChoudat, D.1 aMerlino, M.1 aPineau, F.1 aPopineau, Y.1 aBoulenc, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Feb. 7, v. 55, no. 3 p.799-805dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf062749k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070627b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/27  aOther US 7aarticle03038naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245010100166300001600267500009800283500001500381520128700396650002101683650004401704650001901748650001501767650004401782650003601826650002201862650002301884650002601907650001701933650001601950650002601966650003601992650005002028650003102078650003502109653002302144653001102167653002802178700002102206700002602227700002102253700002002274700002202294773009002316852000902406930003302415945002502448946001102473655001202484IND4370676520221119112232.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067652DNAL7 a156182982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Burrell and N. Smirnoff.  a2019-12-05  aAn overview is presented of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), the two major hyphenated techniques employed in metabolic profiling that complement direct 'fingerprinting' methods such as atmospheric pressure ionization (API) quadrupole time-of-flight MS, API Fourier transform MS, and NMR. In GC/MS, the analytes are normally derivatized prior to analysis in order to reduce their polarity and facilitate chromatographic separation. The electron ionization mass spectra obtained are reproducible and suitable for library matching, mass spectral collections being readily available. In LC/MS, derivatization and library matching are at an early stage of development and mini-reviews are provided. Chemical derivatization can dramatically increase the sensitivity and specificity of LC/MS methods for less polar compounds and provides additional structural information. The potential of derivatization for metabolic profiling in LC/MS is demonstrated by the enhanced analysis of plant extracts, including the potential to measure volatile acids such as formic acid, difficult to achieve by GC/MS. The important role of mass spectral library creation and usage in these techniques is discussed and illustrated by examples. 3aplant physiology 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant extracts 3ametabolome 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical constituents of plants 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolomics 3ametabolites 2aBiochemistryxmethods 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aPlantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aliterature reviews 0aplants 0achemical derivatization1 aWaterman, Daniel1 aPrzyborowska, Anna M.1 aPatel, Raj K.

Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management. 3aCynomys 3aextinction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aislands 3akeystone species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3aurban areas 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aReyes, Perla1 aZhu, Jun1 aCrooks, Kevin R.0 tBiological conservation.g2010 Sept., v. 143, no. 9 p.2146-2155dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.05.027 7aarticle03580naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001700192245012000209300001600329500002400345500001500369520166800384650001502052650002302067650002002090650002902110650001802139650002502157650001602182650002302198650002002221650001302241650002802254650002002282650001102302650002002313650003102333650006102364650002302425650005502448650005702503653001902560653002502579653002202604653003702626700001502663773013402678852000902812856008602821930003302907945002502940946001302965655001202978IND4388629520221119112520.0070306e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438862952DNAL7 a173246662pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2006.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aIsaacs, J.S.10aSingle-Gene Autosomal Recessive Disorders and Prader-Willi Syndrome: An Update for Food and Nutrition Professionals  ap. 466-478.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis review is an update for food and nutrition professionals about single-gene autosomal recessive disorders and Prader-Willi syndrome. These disorders highlight the application of new genetic tools for screening newborns for conditions managed by medical nutrition therapy. Early detection and dietary treatment have been crucial since the 1960s for patients diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The same concept of reducing the dietary substrate that accumulates in disease is applied today for some conditions difficult to diagnose a decade ago. More than 6,000 human single-gene disorders have been identified to date, including more than 100 protein-based metabolic disorders. Tandem mass spectrometry has facilitated newborn screening for more disorders at low cost and high speed. Presently, screening newborns for 29 disorders is recommended in the United States and many states are doubling or tripling the number of tests offered in their screening programs. Complex dietary therapies have evolved for rare disorders, such as fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, organic acid metabolism, glycogen storage, and energy production. Diagnosis-specific therapy may challenge routine dietary recommendations, such as encouraging fatty and sugary foods or avoiding fruits and milk, and treatment options have spawned a market in special formulas and substitute foods; recommended references and Web sites are provided to assist food and nutrition professionals in navigating this territory. Single-gene autosomal recessive disorders have increased the need for, and created opportunities for, food and nutrition professionals, especially those who enjoy biochemistry. 3adietitians 3ametabolic syndrome 3aphenylketonuria 3anutritional intervention 3anutritionists 3aprotein deficiencies 3akwashiorkor 3aclinical nutrition 3aearly diagnosis 3aneonates 3adietary recommendations 2aGenetic Testing 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMetabolism, Inborn Errorsxdiagnosisxgeneticsxtherapy. 2aNeonatal Screening 2aNutrition Disordersxdiagnosisxgeneticsxtherapy. 2aPrader-Willi Syndromexdiagnosisxgeneticsxtherapy. 0ahuman diseases 0asingle-gene disorder 0agenetic disorders 0aprotein-based metabolic disorder1 aZand, D.J.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Mar., v. 107, no. 3 p.466-478dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2006.12.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/09/02  aOther US 7aarticle03522naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002200160245012400182300001600306500002400322520215200346650000802498650001002506650002202516650002402538650001202562650001202574650001102586650001402597650001502611650002302626650001902649650001202668650001202680650001302692650001202705650003102717650000902748650001802757700001302775700001202788700002002800700001602820773010202836852000902938856008102947655001203028IND4449838820221119112547.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444983882DNAL7 a213252412pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2010-008452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerumalla, A.V.S.10aMarination properties and sensory evaluation of breast fillets from air-chilled and immersion-chilled broiler carcasses  ap. 671-679.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of carcass chilling methods on marination properties, tenderness, sensory attributes, and consumer acceptance of broiler breast fillets. A total of 120 broilers were slaughtered at 6 wk of age. Carcasses were either immersion chilled (in a 2-stage prechill-chill system; IC) or air chilled (AC) and then deboned at 3 h postmortem to allow sufficient chilling time for the AC carcasses. Fillets were tumble marinated in a 16.5% solution (0.75% salt and 0.45% phosphate, final concentration) at 24 h postmortem for 30 min. Weight change attributable to chilling of the ready-to-cook carcasses, marination pickup, marination retention, cook loss, and total loss of raw fillets was measured. Instrumental tenderness of cooked fillets was measured using the Meullenet-Owens razor shear method. Fillets were also evaluated by a consumer sensory panel (n = 72) for texture, flavor, and juiciness, including overall acceptance. During the chilling process, the IC birds had a significantly greater percentage of weight change in the ready-to-cook carcass (3.94%) than did the AC birds (-2.02%). Although carcasses had weight changes caused by the chilling method, chilling method did not affect marination properties, as indicated by no significant differences between treatments in marination pickup and marination retention. However, significant differences were observed in cook loss and total loss in marinated breast fillets, with lower losses in the AC method, whereas nonmarinated fillets from the 2 chilling methods demonstrated similar cook losses and total losses. Tenderness was not affected by chilling method (IC and AC), based on instrumental Meullenet-Owens razor shear values of marinated and nonmarinated breast fillets. Results of consumer testing followed similar trends, showing no significant differences in overall acceptance, texture, and flavor attributes between IC and AC broiler breast fillets regardless of the chilling method. When marinating breast fillets, air chilling had a yield advantage over immersion chilling, as evidenced by the lower cook loss in breast fillets. 3aair 3abirds 3achicken carcasses 3aconsumer acceptance 3acooling 3afillets 3aflavor 3ajuiciness 3amarinating 3asensory evaluation 3ashear strength 3atexture 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aCooking 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aMeat 2aRefrigeration1 aSaha, A.1 aLee, Y.1 aMeullenet, J.F.1 aOwens, C.M.0 tPoultry science.g2011 Mar., v. 90, no. 3 p.671-679dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2010-008453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01906naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002200127245006400149300001600213500011900229500001500348520074400363650002001107650001501127650001701142650002201159650001401181650000701195650002101202650001601223650002901239653003201268653002301300653001701323773009001340852000901430930003301439945002501472946001101497655001201508IND4370678320221119112536.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The recent isolation of mutants that appear to lack cyclic electron transport, as well as new data providing functional evidence for its occurrence, support the notion that this pathway plays an important role in plant responses to stress, providing a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane to trigger non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. At present, little is known about the regulation of cyclic electron transport, but it is possible that this is activated in response to a low redox potential in the chloroplast stroma. 3aredox potential 3athylakoids 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3aC3 plants 3apH 3aplant physiology 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transport chain 0anon-photochemical quenching 0aliterature reviews 0achloroplasts0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Jan., v. 56, no. 411 p.407-416x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060816b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02533naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245010400164300001600268500011900284520106800403650002201471650001001493650001601503650001201519650001701531650002201548650001301570650002001583650002201603650002001625650002201645650001801667650002101685650001901706650001101725650001301736700002501749700002001774700001801794700002301812700002401835773009001859852000901949930003301958945002501991946001102016655001202027IND4370678420221119112503.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Maxwell and G.N. Johnson.  aPlants co-ordinate information derived from many diverse external and internal signals to ensure appropriate control of gene expression under optimal and stress conditions. In this work, the relationships between catalase (CAT) and H₂O₂ during drought in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are studied. Drought-induced H₂O₂ accumulation correlated with decreases in soil water content and CO₂ assimilation. Leaf H₂O₂ content increased even though total CAT activity doubled under severe drought conditions. Diurnal regulation of CAT1 and CAT2 mRNA abundance was apparent in all conditions and day/night CAT1 and CAT2 expression patterns were modified by mild and severe drought. The abundance of CAT1 transcripts was regulated by circadian controls that persisted in continuous darkness, while CAT2 was modulated by light. Drought decreased abundance, and modified the pattern, of CAT1 and CAT2 mRNAs. It was concluded that the complex regulation of CAT mRNA, particularly at the level of translation, allows precise control of leaf H₂O₂ accumulation. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3agrain crops 3adrought 3awater stress 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression 3adiurnal variation 3amessenger RNA 3acircadian rhythm 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aisozymes1 aPastori, Gabriela M.1 aDriscoll, Simon1 aGroten, Karin1 aBernard, Stephanie1 aFoyer, Christine H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Jan., v. 56, no. 411 p.417-423x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060816b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02228naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001400175245010400189300001600293500002400309500001500333520106400348650002301412650002301435650002001458650001901478650002001497650002901517653001201546700001301558773010901571852000901680856007201689930003301761945002501794946001101819655001201830IND4388624220221119112411.0070306e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438862422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2006.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX200 0aP200 0aJ2001 aMilla, K.12aA low-cost microprocessor and infrared sensor system for automating water infiltration measurements  ap. 122-129.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUnderstanding the nature of soil infiltration properties is important for a number of applications, including planning efficient irrigation and erosion control practices, evaluating effectiveness of linings for sanitary landfills and waste lagoons, and landscape design and management. A common method for measuring infiltration is with the use of cylinder infiltrometers. This method can be very labor intensive and time-consuming, thus limiting its practicality. We describe the construction of an inexpensive system that can be readily adapted to single- and dual-ring infiltrometers to provide automated measurements on the scale of seconds to days. The system is comprised of an infrared distance-measuring sensor and microcontroller that can be programmed to collect water level measurements at various time intervals. Data are logged by the system in the field and can be downloaded for processing and analysis. This system is not only inexpensive, but also small, lightweight and versatile, and can be readily adapted to collect additional parameters. 3asoil water content 3ainfrared radiation 3ainstrumentation 3ainfiltrometers 3amicroprocessors 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 0asensors1 aKish, S.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2006 Sept., v. 53, no. 2 p.122-129dElsevierx0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.05.0013electronic resource  a20070316b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02799naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245011700189300001600306500002400322520142100346650001701767650001701784650001301801650002301814650001401837650001101851650002201862650001001884650003001894650001401924650003701938650003201975650000902007650002402016650003202040650002102072651001002093651001002103700001302113700001902126773012002145852000902265856005502274655001202329IND4405178720221119112308.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440517872DNAL7 a187134182pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Run-Guo10aSeed Dynamics in Relation to Gaps in a Tropical Montane Rainforest of Hainan Island, South China: (II) Seed Bank  ap. 513-521.  aIncludes references  aSpatial and temporal patterns of seed bank dynamics in relation to gaps in an old growth tropical montane rainforest of Hainan Island, South China, were studied over two consecutive years. From June 2001 to June 2003, soil seed bank sampling blocks were taken near each of the four sides of each seed trap and immediately put into a nursery for observation of seedling emergence dynamics in four seasons (each experiment in each season). The abundances of seedlings that emerged from seed banks showed the trend of vine functional group (VFG) > shrub functional group (SFG) > tree functional group (TFG) > herb functional group (HFG), but the trend in species richness of seedlings that emerged from the soil seed banks was TFG > VFG > SFG > HFG. The abundances of seedlings that emerged from seed banks in the three gap zones showed no significant differences, but significant differences did exist for the species richness. The time of sampling or seasons of experiments had significant influences on both the species richness and seedling abundances. The seedling emergence processes of each experiment all revealed the unimodal patterns. Few emergences occurred 1 year after each experiment. Compared with those under closed canopies, the recruitment rates from seed to seedlings and from seedlings to saplings in gaps were higher, but the mortality rates from saplings to big trees were also higher in the gaps. 3aburied seeds 3arain forests 3asaplings 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3avines 2aBiological Specimen Banks 2aGeography 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & development. 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxgrowth & development 2aTropical Climate 3aChina 0aChina1 aDing, Yi1 aZhang, Wei-Yin0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2008 May, v. 50, no. 5 p.513-521dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00662.x 7aarticle03036naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100004200146245016400188300001600352500001500368520116800383650002001551650004301571650002501614650001501639650001601654650001101670650001401681650001601695650001901711650002001730650002201750650001501772650001701787650001801804650005701822650003701879650004701916650004601963650002402009650002802033650005102061650003002112653002102142653004002163700002702203700002502230700003502255773009002290852000902380930003302389945002502422946001102447655001202458IND4370675420141222000000.0050529e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067542DNAL7 a155829272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Treatment with both molecules resulted in an enhanced accumulation of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate along the root axis, but the distribution of these redox forms was not uniform along the root, as detected in intracellular (symplastic) and extracellular (apoplastic) compartments. Thus, those radicular zones metabolically more active, such as the meristem and the elongation zone, accumulated the highest amount of both redox forms of ascorbate. On the other hand, ascorbate and L-galactono-[gamma]-lactone also stimulated cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and inhibited peroxidase activity as deduced from in vivo and in vitro experiments. Differences were also found when comparing apoplastic and symplastic activities. These results are compatible with the idea of an ascorbate-mediated stimulation of root growth by inhibiting cell wall stiffening and increasing root metabolism. 3aredox potential 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3adehydroascorbic acid 3acell walls 3aAllium cepa 3aonions 3acytoplasm 3aroot growth 3asugar lactones 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aperoxidase 3aroot radicle 3aascorbic acid 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aDehydroascorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aOnionsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeroxidasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSugar Acidsxpharmacology 0agalactonolactone 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aVillalba, José Manuel1 aCórdoba, Francisco.1 aGonzález-Reyes, José Antonio0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Feb., v. 56, no. 412 p.685-694x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060817b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03670naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002400163245016300187300001800350500001500368520154400383650002601927650001801953650002201971650002201993650003002015650002002045650001902065650002502084650002502109650002602134650001202160650002002172650002502192650002302217650003102240650001102271650002402282650001802306650001602324650003802340650001002378650004202388650002802430650004902458650005202507650005602559650003802615650002702653653001702680653002802697653001002725700001802735700001802753700002002771700002302791773009202814852000902906930003302915945002502948946001102973655001202984IND4370671620221119112334.0050529e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437067162DNAL7 a157106302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Light and expression of the transgene increased the level of CT in a synergistic way. To monitor how the changes in accumulation of condensed tannins were achieved, the level of expression of four key genes in the flavonoid pathway was estimated by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Early genes of the pathway (PAL and CHS) were affected less in their expression and so appeared to be less involved in influencing the final level of CT than later genes in the pathway (DFR and ANS). Steady-state levels of DFR and ANS transcripts showed a strong positive correlation with CT and these genes might be considered the first rate-limiting steps in CT biosynthesis in Lotus leaves. However, additional factors mediated by light are limiting CT accumulation once these genes are up-regulated by the transgene. Therefore, the increment of the steady-state mRNA level for DFR and ANS might not be sufficient to up-regulate condensed tannins in leaves. The real-time RT-PCR approach adopted showed that members within the CHS and DFR gene families are differentially regulated by the exogenous bHLH gene and light. This finding is discussed in relation to the approaches for controlling CT biosynthesis and for studying the expression profile of multi-gene families. 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3aproanthocyanidins 3atransgenic plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3alight intensity 3aforage legumes 3abiochemical pathways 3aamino acid sequences 3asecondary metabolites 3atannins 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aLotus corniculatus 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLight 2aLotusxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTanninsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aforage crops 0amolecular sequence data 0alight1 aBovone, Tessa1 aTosti, Nicola1 aArcioni, Sergio1 aDamiani, Francesco0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Apr., v. 56, no. 414 p.1093-1103x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03104naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152100001400161245011000175300001800285500002400303520153100327650002201858650001701880650001301897650000901910650002001919650002101939650002301960650002301983650001602006650001602022650001602038650002502054650002302079650002702102650002302129650001702152650001502169651001002184653002302194700001202217700001302229700001202242700001302254773012002267852000902387856008302396930003302479945002502512946001302537655001202550IND4388667420221119112628.0070308e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438866742DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2005.03582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aP2101 aZhang, X.10aPerformance of Double-Cropped Winter Wheat-Summer Maize under Minimum Irrigation in the North China Plain  ap. 1620-1626.  aIncludes references  aThe double cropping of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) in the North China Plain (NCP) requires intensive irrigation that results in rapidly depleting aquifers and threatens the sustainable agricultural development in the region. This study investigated the possibility of growing winter wheat and maize with minimum irrigation (MI) by bringing soil moisture in the top root zone to field capacity at sowing with no further irrigation afterwards. Results over 8 yr (1997-2005) showed that grain yield of winter wheat was over 5000 kg ha-1 and maize was over 6000 kg ha-1 in most of the seasons under MI. The average yield was decreased by 14% for winter wheat and 13% for maize compared with the fully irrigated treatment (FI). Water use efficiency (WUE) under MI was increased by 15% for winter wheat and 10% for maize compared with that under FI. Average seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was 335 mm under MI and 447 mm under FI for winter wheat, and 319 mm and 403 mm for maize, respectively. The annual irrigation requirement of MI was only half that of FI. Yield reduction in MI was negatively related to seasonal rainfall (significant at P < 0.05). The success of MI depended on the deeper root system of winter wheat using soil moisture that accumulated below the shallower rooted maize over the summer rainfall season. The results showed that an MI strategy that would be simple to implement for farmers would contribute significantly to the sustainability of the groundwater resource. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adouble cropping 3airrigation rates 3airrigation systems 3asoil water content 3arhizosphere 3asowing date 3agrain yield 3awater use efficiency 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation requirement 3aseasonal variation 3aroot systems 3asoil depth 3aChina 0aminimum irrigation1 aPei, D.1 aChen, S.1 aSun, H.1 aYang, Y.0 tAgronomy journal.g2006 , v. 98, no. 6 p.1620-1626dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2005.03583Available from publisher's Web site  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aOther US 7aarticle02102naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245003900182300001600221500002400237520102000261650001801281650002101299650002001320650002101340650001601361650001601377700002401393700001801417700001701435773009601452852000901548856009001557930003301647945002501680946001101705655001201716IND4388666220140723000000.0070308s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438866622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.07.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aT2001 aRibar, S.10aSphingoid bases in infant formulas  ap. 173-180.  aIncludes references  aSphingolipids are a group of lipids present in all eukaryotic cells. They consist of a long-chain sphingoid base that is amide-bound to a fatty acid and a polar group on C-1 sphingosine. Sphingosine is the most widespread base in mammals. The goal of this study is to determine the concentrations of free and total sphingosine and sphinganine in infant formulas and human milk. Following the extraction of sphingolipids, base and acidic hydrolysis was preformed. Sphinganine and sphingosine were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. The results of this research illustrate the differences between the concentrations of sphingoid bases in infant formulas and human milk. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that despite all efforts made to produce infant formulas as similar to human milk as possible, in terms of their structure and the amount of their constituents, there are differences that could be biologically significant and thus need to be further researched. 3asphingolipids 3aeukaryotic cells 3ainfant formulas 3ainfant nutrition 3asphingosine 3abreast milk1 aFeher-Turković, L.1 aKarmelić, I.1 aMesarić, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 103, no. 1 p.173-180dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.07.0693Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02322naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002100132245004600153300001400199300002200213520072300235650001400958650001300972650002300985650001701008650004601025650002101071650004501092650001101137650001101148650001101159650004701170650000901217650004501226650002201271650003001293650007601323651001401399651001401413653001801427653003501445700002201480700002201502700002101524700001901545700002701564700002001591773009401611852000901705939003301714945000801747946001301755655001201768991562861590742620221119112216.0800222e197901  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800003872DNAL7 a3106392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrink, Edward W.10aVitamin A status of children in Sri Lanka  ap. 84-91.  ap. 84-91. charts.  aThe extent and distribution of vitamin A deficiency in Sri Lanka in children 6 through 71 months of age and the presence or absence of selected ophthalmological signs and symptoms associated with vitamin A deficiency in 13,450 children were determined.

Imbalancing nutritionally adequate diets with an excessive amount of fat calories and cholesterol has obscured the fact that intimal thickening occurs spontaneously in time on low-fat cholesterol-free diets during the aging process, and that intimal thickening can be accelerated by dietary angiotoxic "risk factors". Laboratory studies have identified oxidized cholesterol as an angiotoxic factor. Since population groups that consume less vitamin D-supplemented foods, less deep fat fried cholesterol-containing foods, and less hydrogenated fats have a lower incidence of coronary heart disease than Americans, it seems judicious for food processors to reduce these previously unconsidered risk factors to a minimum. 3aetiology 3aheart diseases 3arisk factors 3acholesterol 3aoils 3avitamin D 3atoxins 3aatherogenesis 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAorta, Thoracicxpathology 2aAortic Diseasesxetiology 2aArteriosclerosisxchemically inducedxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCholecalciferolxpoisoning 2aCholesterolxanalogs & derivativesxpoisoning. 2aCholesterol, Dietary 2aCoronary Diseasexetiology 2aDietxstandards 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteins 2aEnergy Intake 2aFats, Unsaturated 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipoproteins, LDLxblood 2aMyocardiumxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPregnancy 2aRisk 0alipids 0aDietary goals0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.58-83x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800222c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02863naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002700146245012000173300001800293500001500311520101900326650002101345650001401366650002201380650001701402650001901419650001401438650001701452650001701469650001401486650002901500650005001529650003701579650002701616650002801643650003001671650003101701650001001732650002601742650002901768650002401797650001701821650002801838650001001866650003301876653001901909653002701928653002801955700002101983700001702004700002102021700002502042773009202067852000902159930003302168945002502201946001102226655001202237IND4370682020221119112304.0050529e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437068202DNAL7 a157238292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Rubi) seed germination and cause cell death in the embryo  ap. 1029-1038.  a2019-12-05  aThe mechanism of inhibition of coffee (Coffea arabica cv. Rubi) seed germination by exogenous gibberellins (GAs) and the requirement of germination for endogenous GA were studied. Exogenous GA₄₊₇ inhibited coffee seed germination. The response to GA₄₊₇ showed two sensitivity thresholds: a lower one between 0 and 1 [micro]M and a higher one between 10 and 100 [micro]M. However, radicle protrusion in coffee seed depended on the de novo synthesis of GAs. Endogenous GAs were required for embryo cell elongation and endosperm cap weakening. Incubation of coffee seed in exogenous GA₄₊₇ led to loss of embryo viability and dead cells were observed by low temperature scanning microscopy only when the endosperm was surrounding the embryo. The results described here indicate that the inhibition of germination by exogenous GAs is caused by factors that are released from the endosperm during or after its weakening, causing cell death in the embryo and leading to inhibition of radicle protrusion. 3aseed germination 3aviability 3acoffee (beverage) 3abiosynthesis 3aCoffea arabica 3aendosperm 3agibberellins 3aroot radicle 3aapoptosis 2aCell Deathxdrug effects 2aCoffeaxdrug effectsxembryologyxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFructosexpharmacology 2aGalactosexpharmacology 2aGerminationxdrug effects 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aLight 2aMannosexpharmacology 2aMannosidasesxmetabolism 2aSeedsxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aTriazolesxpharmacology 2aWater 2abeta-Mannosidasexmetabolism 0aembryo (plant) 0aexogenous gibberellins 0aendogenous gibberellins1 aToorop, Peter E.1 aNijsse, Jaap1 aBewley, J.

Also, the serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were unaffected. The development of a mild degree of osteomolacia was suggested by decreases in EDTA-extractable mineral content and in the calcium/hydroxyproline ratio in the tibiae of the ethanol-fed animals. The urinary excretion of peptide-bound hydroxyproline was increased. The minimal bone changes are an unlikely cause for the observed increases in the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. 3aanimal experimentation 3aethanol 3abones 3acollagen 3aexperimental diets 3aminerals 3aosteomalacia 2aAlcoholismxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aGlycosaminoglycansxurine 2aHumans 2aHydroxyprolinexmetabolismxurine. 2aMale 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOsteomalaciaxetiology 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aRats 2aTibiaxmetabolism 0aurine analysis 0aHydroxyproline index1 aPotter, James J.1 aMerchant, Clifford R.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.25-29x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800222c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02210naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010100180300001600281500002400297520041000321650002600731650001200757650001800769650001500787650001000802650001000812650003300822650002100855650001800876650001900894650003000913650005500943650002100998650002901019650003801048650004101086650004801127650001601175650002801191650001401219650002601233650003401259650002701293650007001320700001801390700001701408700001901425773011801444852000901562856008501571655001201656IND4435251920221119112649.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443525192DNAL7 a201121282pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-010-0201-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kaihui10a10-Hydroxycamptothecin produced by a new endophytic Xylaria sp., M20, from Camptotheca acuminata  ap. 689-693.  aIncludes references  aA new 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)-producing fungus was isolated from Camptotheca acuminata.

  1 aBouton, Sophie12aA gene encoding a protein with a proline-rich domain (MtPPRD1), revealed by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), is specifically expressed in the Medicago truncatula embryo axis during germination  ap. 825-832.  aA gene MtPPRD1, encoding a protein of 132 amino acids containing a proline-rich domain (PRD), has been revealed by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) with two mRNA populations of embryo axes harvested immediately before and after radicle emergence. Although at the protein level MtPPRD1 showed low homology with plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), it did exhibit the eight cysteine residues conserved in all plant LTPs, a characteristic signature that allows the formation of a hydrophobic cavity adapted for loading hydrophobic molecules. Expression studies of MtPPRD1 have been carried out by quantitative real time RT-PCR throughout germination and post-germination processes in control seeds and seeds in which germination was delayed by abscisic acid (ABA) or the glutamine synthetase inhibitor methionine sulphoximine (MSX) treatments. The results showed that MtPPRD1 expression is developmentally regulated, induced in the embryo axis immediately before radicle emergence, reaches its maximum expression and declines during the early post-germination phase. Organ specificity studies showed that, except for a low and probably constitutive expression in roots, MtPPRD1 is specifically expressed in the embryo axis. Based on both experimental and in silico studies several putative roles are proposed for MtPPRD1 in Medicago truncatula, this protein can intervene (i) as an LTP in membrane biogenesis and regulation of the intracellular fatty acid pool by binding and transferring fatty acids and phospholipids between membranes, (ii) in the control of a developmental process specific to late germination and to early phases of post-germination, and (iii) and/or pathogen defence. 3aMedicago truncatula 3aplant proteins 3agene expression 3aembryo (plant) 3aseed germination 3amessenger RNA 3atransport proteins 3aroots 3aphospholipids 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGerminationxphysiology 2aMedicago truncatulaxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProline 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTime Factors 2aWater 0amolecular sequence data1 aViau, Laure1 aLelièvre, Eric1 aLimami, Anis M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Mar., v. 56, no. 413 p.825-832x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02755naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001800186245011400204300001600318500002400334506007600358520077200434506003701206650002101243650001901264650002001283650001701303650001301320650001801333650001701351650002601368650002401394650001201418650001301430650005301443650004801496650004001544650002201584650003101606650005801637650005501695650002401750650005401774650002001828650005701848650002401905700001801929700001801947700001801965773010001983852000902083856008502092655001202177IND4435251520221207110310.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443525152DNAL7 a201310812pmid7 aPMC28520312pmcid7 a10.1007/s10529-010-0209-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, E.

This study shows EMFR9, a furfural-tolerant mutant of ethanologenic E. coli LY180, has also acquired tolerance to 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF). The mechanism of action of 5-HMF and furfural appear similar. Furan tolerance results primarily from lower expression of yqhD and dkgA, two furan reductases with a low Km for NADPH. Furan tolerance was also increased by adding plasmids encoding a NADPH/NADH transhydrogenase (pntAB). Together, these results support the hypothesis that the NADPH-dependent reduction of furans by YqhD and DkgA inhibits growth by competing with biosynthesis for this limiting cofactor.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiosynthesis 3afurfural 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amechanism of action 3amutants 3aplasmids 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAldehyde Reductasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiotransformation 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFuraldehydexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aOxidation-Reduction1 aTurner, P.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) were used to characterize the compounds in C. pyrenoidosa. The highest yield of 44.8 g kg⁻¹ was achieved at 400 W of ultrasound for 800 s and then followed by incubation in water bath at 100 °C for 4 h in 80% ethanol. Two polysaccharide fractions (S1 and S2) were separated from the extracts of C. pyrenoidosa using Sepharose 4B column chromatography. The average molecular weights (M(w)) of S1 and S2 were 81,877 Da and 1749 Da, respectively. Gas chromatographic (GC) traces of the hydrolyzed polysaccharides showed that most of the majority of monosaccharide in both fractions was mannose (78.0% and 76.5% of relative mass from S1 and S2, respectively) with low levels of glucose (13.2% and 8.4% of relative mass from S1 and S2, respectively). The Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of S1 and S2 revealed typical characteristics of polysaccharides. Both samples had the characteristics of hydroxyl groups, weak C-H band and α-pyranoses; however, only S2 had a carboxyl group. 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3apolysaccharides 3aedible seaweed 0apurification1 aSheng, J.1 aYang, F.1 aHu, Q.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 103, no. 1 p.101-105dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.07.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle04117naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245014400170300001800314520280400332650001703136650001903153650002403172650001203196650001503208650001103223650001803234650001403252650002303266650001203289650001103301650001003312650002203322650001103344651001203355653003103367653002203398773011803420852000903538856009203547930003303639946001103672655001203683IND4426981620221119112450.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442698162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02258.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aELLIOTT, J.M.10aValidation and implications of a growth model for brown trout, Salmo trutta, using long-term data from a small stream in north-west England  ap. 2263-2275.  a1. The objectives were: (i) to check the validity of a new growth model; (ii) to examine the relationship between population density and both mean mass and mean growth rate and (iii) to discover if compensatory growth occurred. First (0+) and second (1+) year-old juvenile sea-trout were sampled by electrofishing at the beginning and end of the summer from 1967 to 2000. Additional samples were taken in some years in winter and in the critical period for survival when the fry first emerge from the gravel. The trout left the stream as pre-smolts in May, soon after their second birthday. 2. A growth model ( Elliott, Hurley '' Fryer, 1995 ) estimated the mean mass of the trout over the 2 years spent in fresh water. The date and mean mass at the start of the growth period were defined as the median date for fry emerging from the gravel and their mean mass at emergence, both being estimated from individual-based models ( Elliott '' Hurley, 1998a, b ). 3. The variation in mean mass among year-classes was small for newly-emerged fry (CV = 6.2%), maximum at the start of the first summer of the life cycle (CV = 38.1%), and then decreased gradually for successive life-stages to a low value for pre-smolts (CV = 10.8%). Mean mass was not related to population density and, therefore, mean growth rate was density-independent. Growth in the first, but not the second, winter of the life cycle was lower than model prediction, but when it was assumed in the model that there was no first-winter growth, there was good agreement in most year-classes between model estimated values and observed mean mass. Exceptions were that mean masses and growth rates for 0+ trout after four summer droughts were lower than expected, but compensatory growth followed, so that observed and expected masses were similar for 1+ trout. 4. Pre-smolt mean mass on 30 April measured total growth achieved in the freshwater phase of the life cycle. This was significantly related to mean mass at the end of the first and second summers of the life cycle, but not to the emergence date and mean mass of emerging fry. 5. These juvenile sea-trout were growing at their maximum potential in most year-classes but when this was not achieved, compensatory growth soon restored their mass to values expected from the model. This ensured a low variation in the mean mass of pre-smolts just before they migrated to the sea. However, the latter mass was higher in more recent year-classes (1987-98) than in previous ones (1967-86), demonstrating the effect of slightly higher stream temperature. This study has shown the importance of developing realistic growth models in order to detect departure from maximum potential growth, and the more subtle effects of temperature change, possibly due to the effects of climate change. 3aSalmo trutta 3aclimate change 3acompensatory growth 3adrought 3afreshwater 3agravel 3agrowth models 3ajuveniles 3apopulation density 3astreams 3asummer 3atrout 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aEngland 0adensity-independent growth 0along-term studies0 tFreshwater biology.g2009 Nov., v. 54, no. 11 p.2263-2275dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02258.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03410naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245023600160300001600396500001500412520210500427650001702532650002202549650002102571650001102592650002002603650001302623650002002636650002002656650001902676650001802695650001102713650001102724653001702735700001602752700001402768700001402782773009002796852000902886930003302895945002502928946001102953655001202964IND4370683820221119112624.0050529e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437068382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLemaire, G.10aDevelopmental changes in shoot N dynamics of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in relation to leaf growth dynamics as a function of plant density and hierarchical position within the canopy. [Erratum: 2005 May, v. 56, no. 415, p. 1437.]  ap. 935-943.  a2019-12-05  aShoot N concentration in plants decreases as they get bigger, due to the fact that N accumulates less rapidly than dry matter in plants during the plant growth process, leading to an allometric relationship between shoot N content (N[subscript sh]) and shoot mass (W[subscript sh]): N[subscript sh]=a(W[subscript sh])[superscript b]. The results obtained on lucerne plants growing either under controlled low density conditions or in dense stands under field conditions show that the value of the allometric coefficient b that represents the ratio between the relative N accumulation rate in shoots [dN[subscript sh]/(N[subscript sh]dt)] and the relative growth rate [dW[subscript sh]/(W[subscript sh]dt)], decreases from 0.88 for a low plant density to 0.72 for a dense stand. Therefore, the fractional increase of shoot N per unit of shoot dry matter is lower when plants are in competition for light in dense canopies. This decrease can be entirely explained by the parallel decline in the leaf area per unit of shoot mass. Thus, a remarkably constant linear relationship can be established between N[subscript sh] and leaf area (LA): N[subscript sh]=1.7 g m⁻² LA, regardless of the conditions (low versus high density, controlled versus field conditions). Moreover, in a field dense stand, the comparison of plants with contrasting positions between the top and the bottom of the canopy (dominant, intermediate or suppressed plants), also shows that the difference in N[subscript sh] at similar shoot mass is explained by the proportion of leaf mass to shoot mass. These data support the idea that leaf growth drives the dynamics of shoot N accumulation. These results also indicate that competition for light among individual plants within a dense canopy induces developmental changes in plant morphology (leaf:stem ratio) that explain the differences observed in shoot N concentration. This last observation could be extrapolated to multispecific plant stands. Therefore, the sharing of N resources among plant species could partially be the result of the sharing of light within the canopy. 3aplant growth 3aplant development 3anitrogen content 3acanopy 3aplant nutrition 3anitrogen 3aMedicago sativa 3anutrient uptake 3aforage legumes 3aplant density 3aleaves 3ashoots 0aforage crops1 aAvice, J-C.1 aKim, T-H.1 aOurry, A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Mar., v. 56, no. 413 p.935-943x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060302b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02926naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245015900212300001600371520183100387650001302218653002402231653002802255653002202283653002402305700001802329773010802347852000902455856009202464930003302556946001102589655001202600IND4426980220221119112453.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442698022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03128.x2doi7 aPMC27706902pmcid7 a200675422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTam, Miguel A.10aMyD88 and interferon-α/β are differentially required for dendritic cell maturation but dispensable for development of protective memory against Listeria  ap. 429-438.  aSignalling pathways mediated by MyD88 are important for sensing Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and directing an immune response. However, the influence of MyD88-derived cytokines and interferon (IFN)-α/β, the latter being made by both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways, in phenotypic and functional dendritic cell (DC) maturation during infection is poorly understood. Here we investigate the contribution of MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways to DC maturation, CD8 T-cell activation and the generation of protective memory against Listeria monocytogenes. We show that neither MyD88 deficiency alone nor MyD88/IFN-αβR double deficiency alters Listeria-induced costimulatory molecule up-regulation on DCs in vivo. In contrast, DCs from infected IFN-αβR⁻/⁻ mice had higher CD80 and CD86 expression than wild-type DCs. We then examined the function of DCs matured in infected knockout mice. We found that DCs from Listeria-infected MyD88⁻/⁻ and MyD88⁻/⁻ IFN-αβR⁻/⁻ mice induced little or no IFN-γ by CD8 T cells, respectively. In contrast, DCs from infected IFN-αβR⁻/⁻ mice had a greater capacity to induce IFN-γ compared with DCs from infected wild-type mice. When the CD8 T-cell memory response was analysed, infected MyD88⁻/⁻ and MyD88⁻/⁻ IFN-αβR⁻/⁻ mice were found to have fewer bacteria-specific memory CD8 T cells than wild-type mice. However, the fraction of bacteria-specific CD8 T cells making IFN-γ was similar in all mouse strains, and MyD88⁻/⁻ and MyD88⁻/⁻ IFN-αβR⁻/⁻ mice survived lethal challenge. Together the data suggest an inhibitory effect of IFN-α/β on functional DC maturation during Listeria infection and reveal overlapping roles of MyD88-induced cytokines and IFN-α/β in DC maturation and protective anti-Listeria immunity. 3aimmunity 0abacterial infection 0acostimulatory molecules 0aT-cell activation 0aToll-like receptors1 aWick, Mary Jo0 tImmunology.g2009 Nov., v. 128, no. 3 p.429-438dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03128.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04128naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245016400185300001600349520184400365650002102209650003902230650001102269650001902280650001002299650000902309650001002318650001502328650001902343650003002362650001402392650001202406650001002418650001002428650001402438650001202452650001302464650001302477650005202490650001102542650001702553650001902570650001202589650001202601650001202613650001402625650003902639650004402678650001302722650002802735650003902763650008102802650005202883650002002935650001402955651001602969651001302985651005402998653001703052653001603069653001603085700001503101773012103116852000903237856009203246930003303338946001103371655001203382IND4436925120221119112552.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443692512DNAL7 a203677422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01150.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, R.K.14aThe Laurentian Great Lakes strain (MI03) of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus is highly pathogenic for juvenile muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill)  ap. 513-527.  aThe Great Lakes strain of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolated from adult subclinical muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill), in Lake St. Clair, MI, USA was shown to be highly pathogenic in juvenile muskellunge through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and waterborne challenge. Mortality began as early as 3 days after exposure in waterborne challenged fish, whereas fish infected by the i.p. route experienced the first mortality by 5 days post-infection (p.i.). The median lethal intraperitoneal injection dose (IP-LD₅₀) was approximately 2.21 plaque forming units (PFU) as opposed to the median lethal immersion challenge dose (IM-LD₅₀) of 1.7 x 10⁴ PFU mL⁻¹. A high, medium and low dose of infection caused acute, subacute and chronic progression of the disease, respectively, as was evident by the cumulative mortality data. Clinical signs of disease observed in dead and moribund fish were very pale gills, dermal petechial haemorrhages along the flanks, severe nuchal haemorrhages, intramuscular haemorrhages at the fin-muscle junction and focal haemorrhaging on the caudal peduncle. Internal lesions included livers that were pale, discoloured and friable, and kidneys that were either congested or degenerative in appearance, and petechial to ecchymotic haemorrhages on the swim bladder wall. Histopathologic examination demonstrated massive haemorrhages in the swimbladder wall and muscle, severe vacuolation and multifocal necrosis of the liver, multifocal necrosis of the gills and depletion of lymphoid tissues within the spleen.

Five Japanese-fermented soybean paste samples and three Chinese-fermented soybean paste samples were analyzed for bacteria and fungi. Extracted DNA was used as a template for PCR to amplify 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes. The nearly complete 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were amplified using universal primers, and the resulting products were subsequently used as a template in a nested PCR to obtain suitable fragments for DGGE. Tetragenococcus halophilus and Staphylococcus gallinarum were found to dominate the bacterial microbiota in Japanese samples, whereas Bacillus sp. was detected as the predominant species in Chinese samples. DGGE analysis of fungi in soybean pastes determined the presence of Aspergillus oryzae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii in most of the Chinese and Japanese samples. Some differences were observed in the bacterial diversity of Japanese- and Chinese-fermented soybean pastes. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aStaphylococcus gallinarum 3aTetragenococcus halophilus 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afungal communities 3apastes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asoybeans 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMetagenome 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoybeans 0aChina 0aJapan1 aLee, Jun-Hwa1 aPark, Min-Hee1 aKim, Hae-Yeong0 tCurrent microbiology.g2010 May, v. 60, no. 5 p.315-320dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-009-9542-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03236naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006300124300001400187500014900201500002400350520203900374650001702413650002802430650001902458650001702477650002302494650001202517650003302529650001302562700001502575700001802590700001702608700001602625773013802641852000902779856008602788655001202874IND4463038320221119112721.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeitz, C.10aBeing acyanic: an unavoidable fate for many white flowers?  ap. 83-88.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Classical versus Molecular Breeding of Ornamentals, held August 25-29, 2003, Munchen, Germany.  aIncludes references  aFor a range of white flowering ornamental species possessing favourable phenotypical and economical properties there is an ardent desire of breeders to get them coloured. Unfortunately, classical approaches often fail in this respect which has led to an increased interest in understanding the underlying reasons for this failure. Here attention is focussed on flavonoids as the main group of colour-giving compounds in flowers. Flavonoid biosynthesis is a well-examined pathway. In particular it has been possible to demonstrate and characterise the activity of flavonoid enzymes resulting in the formation of anthocyanins, which are responsible for colours ranging from orange and red to lilac and blue. The lack of activity of one ore more enzymes of this pathway leads to acyanic flowers. In white spatha of Zantedeschia aethiopica cv. ‘Nili’ and white petals of Osteospermum-Hybrid cv. ‘Zimba’ early enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis – chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (FHT) were proven to be active, resulting in the formation of dihydrokaempferol (DHK). This compound was shown to be 3’-hydroxylated to dihydroquercetin (DHQ) by flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase (F3’H) in Zantedeschia and to be 3’- and 5’-hydroxylated to DHQ and dihydromyrecetin (DHM) by flavonoid 3’5’-hydroxylase (F3’5’H) in Osteospermum. Whereas reduction of dihydroflavonols by DFR to leucoanthocyanidins did not occure in ‘Zimba’, it was clearly detected in ‘Nili’. This suggests a lack of anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) activity in ‘Nili’. ANS converts leucoanthocyanidins to respective anthocyanidins. Particle gun bombardment of ‘Nili’ spatha with plasmids containing Ans from M. incana led to red spots, thus supporting this hypothesis. On the other hand, ‘Zimba’ petals did not show any spotting under bombardment both with plasmids containing Ans and plasmids containing Dfr from Gerbera-Hydrids suggesting the regulatory blocking of a complete set of late enzymes. 3aOsteospermum 3aZantedeschia aethiopica 3aanthocyanidins 3abiosynthesis 3achalcone isomerase 3acorolla 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aplasmids1 aOswald, N.1 aBorstling, D.1 aForkmann, G.1 aMartens, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 July, , no. 612 p.83-88dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/612/612_10.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02917naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011300126300001500239500014900254500002400403520142800427650002901855650000801884650002601892650001901918650001401937650002301951650001001974650002001984650001902004650003002023650001202053650004702065650001402112650001202126651001002138700001402148700001702162700001602179700001302195700001702208773013902225852000902364856008602373655001202459IND4463038520221119112827.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnozaki, T.10aIdentification of random amplified polymorphic DNA markers linked to bacterial wilt resistance in carnations  ap. 95-103.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Classical versus Molecular Breeding of Ornamentals, held August 25-29, 2003, Munchen, Germany.  aIncludes references  aBacterial wilt (caused by Burkholderia caryophylli) is one of the most serious diseases of carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus) in Japan. This disease is very difficult to control with chemicals once it has occurred. Breeding of resistant cultivars is considered the optimum strategy to overcoming this disease. However, it takes over 3 months to determine the resistance of breeding materials by inoculation assays. DNA markers, which can be identified within days, should therefore be a powerful alternative tool for disease-resistance screening. Therefore, we decided to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers associated with genes controlling wilt resistance in a resistance-segregating population of 134 progeny derived from a cross between ‘Carnation Nou No. 1’ (a carnation breeding line resistant to bacterial wilt) and ‘Pretty Favvare’ (a susceptible cultivar). We screened a total of 465 primers to obtain RAPD markers useful for selecting resistant carnation lines: 11 RAPD markers were linked to genes for resistance to bacterial wilt, and 3 linkage groups were identified by linkage analysis. The results suggest that at least 3 genes are concerned with resistance to bacterial wilt. In particular, 4 RAPD markers identified by bulked segregant analysis were linked to a major resistance gene. These markers should be useful for marker-assisted selection in carnation breeding programs. 3aBurkholderia caryophylli 3aDNA 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3abacterial wilt 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3aprogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascreening 3awilting 3aJapan1 aIkeda, H.1 aTanikawa, N.1 aShibata, M.1 aKudo, K.1 aFunayama, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 July, , no. 612 p.95-103dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/612/612_12.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01647naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010400171300001400275500002400289520073400313650001501047650001601062650001801078650002101096650001101117650002501128773013801153852000901291856005701300655001201357IND4456021620221119112747.0110408e196103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445602162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1961.tb00483.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUMEYA, KENJI10aStudy on the free amino acid composition of mid-intestine in several species of lamellicorn beetles  ap. 54-61.  aIncludes references  aThe patterns of the free amino acid composition in the mid-intestine tissue of twelve species of Lamellicornia (Coleoptera) were compared by means of paper chromatography. As tested in Allomyrina dichotomus L., the contents of amino acids of the tissue seemed to be constant not only among individuals of the same sex, but also among those of both sexes in a single species. The beetles tested could be divided into five groups by their amino acid constituents of the mid-gut. This division does not necessarily parallel the taxonomic classification, nor the anatomical grouping of the digestive system. The food habits of the beetles seem to have a certain bearing upon the amino acid composition of their mid-intestinal tissue. 3aColeoptera 3aamino acids 3aeating habits 3afree amino acids 3amidgut 3apaper chromatography0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1961 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.54-61dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1961.tb00483.x 7aarticle02787naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008300144300001800227520139700245650000901642650000901651650001501660650001301675650001501688650002101703650000901724650002701733650001501760650001201775650002401787650004101811650002401852650002501876650003001901650003401931650001301965650000901978650002901987650004302016650000902059650002402068650003502092700001802127773008102145852000902226939003302235946001302268655001202281IND8905655020221119112825.0891019e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890565502DNAL7 a25063182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHempe, J.M.10aEffect of EDTA and zinc-methionine complex on zinc absorption by rat intestine  ap. 1179-1187.  aThe effects of zinc chelators on 65Zn uptake, absorption and tissue distribution were determined in rats using ligated duodenal loops. 65Zn was supplied as Zn-methionine complex, ZnCl2, ZnCl2 + L-methionine or ZnCl2 + EDTA. The effect of EDTA was also determined in the presence of phytic acid. Absorption of 65Zn was markedly reduced in rats given Zn-methionine complex or ZnCl2 + EDTA. The 65Zn level in tissues (liver, bone, muscle, skin, kidney, and thymus) of rats given ZnCl2 + EDTA was also significantly reduced compared to that of rats given ZnCl2. Reduced absorption due to phytic acid was not improved by EDTA, although EDTA increased mucosal 65Zn retention. High performance gel filtration chromatography showed six 65Zn-binding peaks in the mucosal cytosol of rats given ZnCl2a. A seventh peak attributable to Zn-EDTA was observed in cytosol from rats given ZnCl2 + EDTA. A comparable peak in plasma was not observed. Both EDTA and Zn-methionine complex reduced 65Zn-binding to a low-molecular-weight component of mucosal cytosol that was not metallothionein. The results suggest that Zn-EDTA is transported intact from the lumen into mucosal cells but not across the basolateral membrane. The adverse effects of EDTA and Zn-methionine complex on zinc absorption were associated with reduced 65Zn-binding to a component of mucosal cytosol that may be involved in zinc absorption. 3adiet 3azinc 3aabsorption 3aduodenum 3amethionine 3abinding proteins 3arats 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolism 2aLigation 2aMale 2aMethioninexpharmacology 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aTissue Distribution 2aZincxbloodxpharmacokinetics.1 aCousins, R.J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.1179-1187x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02472naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001600097040001800113100002200131245012900153300001600282300003000298520068900328650002401017650001501041650002401056650001601080650001901096650001701115650002101132650001601153650002301169650002901192650001501221650001501236650001701251650002401268650001801292650001101310650001101321650003901332650003401371650001801405650000901423650001601432650003601448650003101484650002501515653002501540653002401565700002201589700001901611700002001630700001901650700001801669773009601687852000901783939003301792945000801825946001301833655001201846991562850960742620221119112608.0800519e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006412DNAL7 a862922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Richard J.12aA randomized study of instructional variations in nutrition counseling and their efficacy in the treatment of hyperlipidemia  ap. 884-904.  ap. 884-904. ill., charts.  aExtract: The importance of the educational diagnosis in instructing patients in a fat modified diet was examined in a double blind study.

Analysis of variance showed an interaction between the preferred and instructional level of structure as related to the change in total calories, total fat, and saturated fat of the diet after 3 months. 3anutrition education 3acounseling 3aeducational methods 3acholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3atherapeutics 2aAudiovisual Aids 2aBody Weight 2aCholesterolxblood 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aCounseling 2aCurriculum 2aDietary Fats 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxdiet therapy 2aHyperlipidemiasxdiet therapy 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0aFat-restricted diets 0aTeaching techniques1 aTurner, Dorothea.1 aGinther, John.1 aBrandt, Bertha.1 aSlowie, Linda.1 aLauger, Gary.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.884-904x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800519c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle04133naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002000193245012900213300001600342506007600358520162700434506003702061650001602098650002402114650001202138650002602150650003102176650001002207650001202217650002202229650001302251650001602264650002302280650002402303650002002327650002902347650002602376650001702402650001102419650003002430650002402460650005102484650003702535650005902572650001902631650003802650650003802688650001702726650002802743650002902771650005002800650004902850650003602899650003202935653002502967653001402992653004003006653002703046700002103073700001403094700002303108773011103131852000903242856009203251930003303343946001103376655001203387IND4435469320221207095545.0100416e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443546932DNAL7 a176620352pmid7 aPMC21561722pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian-Xiang10aSalt stress responses in Arabidopsis utilize a signal transduction pathway related to endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling  ap. 897-909.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a signaling pathway that mediates salt stress responses in Arabidopsis. The response is mechanistically related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses described in mammalian systems. Such responses involve processing and relocation to the nucleus of ER membrane-associated transcription factors to activate stress response genes. The salt stress response in Arabidopsis requires a subtilisin-like serine protease (AtS1P), related to mammalian S1P and a membrane-localized b-ZIP transcription factor, AtbZIP17, a predicted type-II membrane protein with a canonical S1P cleavage site on its lumen-facing side and a b-ZIP domain on its cytoplasmic side. In response to salt stress, it was found that myc-tagged AtbZIP17 was cleaved in an AtS1P-dependent process. To show that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17, cleavage was also demonstrated in an in vitro pull-down assay with agarose bead-immobilized AtS1P. Under salt stress conditions, the N-terminal fragment of AtbZIP17 tagged with GFP was translocated to the nucleus. The N-terminal fragment bearing the bZIP DNA binding domain was also found to possess transcriptional activity that functions in yeast. In Arabidopsis, AtbZIP17 activation directly or indirectly upregulated the expression of several salt stress response genes, including the homeodomain transcription factor ATHB-7. Upregulation of these genes by salt stress was blocked by T-DNA insertion mutations in AtS1P and AtbZIP17. Thus, salt stress induces a signaling cascade involving the processing of AtbZIP17, its translocation to the nucleus and the upregulation of salt stress genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA-binding domains 3aagarose 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amammals 3amembrane proteins 3amutation 3asalt stress 3aserine proteinases 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransfer DNA 3ayeasts 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aProprotein Convertasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 0atranscription factor 0asubtilase 0aregulated intramembrane proteolysis 0aproteolytic processing1 aSrivastava, Renu1 aChe, Ping1 aHowell, Stephen H.0 tPlant journal.g2007 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.897-909dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03195.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03581naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002200189245007900211300001800290506007600308520159700384592002801981506003702009650001302046650001302059650002602072650001002098650002202108650002002130650001302150650001902163650001402182650002702196650001302223650001402236650002202250651002502272653000702297653000702304653000802311653000802319653003002327653000802357653001402365653002102379700002802400700001802428700002002446700002802466700002202494700001902516700002002535700001702555700001902572700001902591700002202610700002002632700002302652773012802675856008302803852000902886655001202895IND60690704920221207112020.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069070492DNAL7 a323823962pmid7 aPMC72001742pmcid7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahfouz, Nour Abu10aUtility of clinical exome sequencing in a complex Emirati pediatric cohort  ap. 1020-1027.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClinical exome sequencing (CES) has become a routine diagnostic tool in several pediatric subspecialties, with a reported average diagnostic yield of ~25% in this patient poulation. The utility of CES in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not been previously investigated, most likely due to the lack of the appropriate tertiary pediatric centers and diagnostic genomic facilities in this country. Here, we report, for the first time, CES findings on a multispecialty pediatric cohort in the UAE (N = 51). This cohort, which was mostly Emirati (86%; 44/51), was followed at Al Jalila Children’s Hospital (AJCH), the first and only dedicated tertiary pediatric center in the country. CES demonstrates a high diagnostic yield (41%; 21/51) in this cohort, where 55% (28/51) had previous non-diagnostic genetic testing while for the remaining individuals (45%), CES was the first-tier test. Given the reported high consanguinity rate in this population, 48% of the positive cases (10/21) were due to genes associated with recessive conditions. However, 11 out of 21 positive cases (52%) were due to heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes known to cause dominantly inherited disorders, including a case with a dual diagnosis attributed to two different genes (2%; 1/51), and another case with a novel de novo variant and new phenotypic features for a known gene (2%; 1/51). Overall, we have identified 13 novel clinically significant variants and showed that application of CES as a first-tier test plays a significant role in genetic diagnosis and management of Emirati pediatric patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaluminum 3achildren 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic testing 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3ahospitals 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aDD 0aID 0aASD 0aMCA 0aClinical exome sequencing 0aWES 0aPediatric 0aDiagnostic yield1 aKizhakkedath, Praseetha1 aIbrahim, Alia1 aEl Naofal, Maha1 aRamaswamy, Sathishkumar1 aHarilal, Divinlal1 aQutub, Yasmeen1 aUddin, Mohammed1 aTaylor, Alan1 aAlloub, Zeinab1 aAlBanna, Ammar1 aAbuhammour, Walid1 aFathalla, Basil1 aTayoun, Ahmad Abou0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.1020-1027dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245008600157300001600243520144100259592002801700650001701728650001501745650001901760650001601779650001401795650001001809650002301819650001401842650002601856650001201882650002101894650000901915650001001924650002101934653001701955653002501972653002601997653002302023653002102046700001402067700001802081700001602099700001702115700001502132700001902147700001502166773013402181856007702315852000902392655001202401IND60480959320221119115016.0200226e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048095932DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2012.15312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViegas, S.10aOccupational exposure to aflatoxin B₁: the case of poultry and swine production  ap. 309-315.  aAlthough there is an abundance of literature concerning the ingestion of food contaminated with aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁), only a small number of studies explore mycotoxin exposure in occupational settings. Taking this into consideration, our study was developed with the intention of elucidating whether there is occupational exposure to AFB₁ in Portuguese poultry and swine production facilities. A specific biomarker was used to assess exposure to AFB₁. A total of 45 workers (34 from poultry farms; 11 from swine production facilities) participated in this study, providing blood samples. Additionally, a control group (n=30) composed of subjects without any type of contact with agricultural activity was considered. All participants signed a consent form and were provided with the study protocol. Eighteen poultry workers (58.6%) and six workers from the swine production facilities (54.5%) showed detectable levels of AFB₁. In the control group, the AFB₁ values were all below 1 ng/ml. No significant differences in AFB₁ levels in serum between workers from poultry and swine farms were found. Poultry workers, however, showed the highest serum levels and a significant statistical difference between this group and the control group was found. Results suggest that exposure to AFB₁ by inhalation occurs in both occupational settings representing an additional risk that needs to be recognised, assessed and prevented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abreathing 3afarms 3afood contamination 3aingestion 3aoccupational exposure 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3arisk 3aswine 3aswine production 0aaflatoxin B1 0afungal contamination 0aoccupational exposure 0apoultry production 0aswine production1 aVeiga, L.1 aFigueredo, P.1 aAlmeida, A.1 aCarolino, E.1 aSabino, R.1 aVeríssimo, C.1 aViegas, C.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.309-315dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2012.15313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245016300165300002000328520100400348592002801352650001101380650002401391650002301415650002501438650001801463650001201481650001601493650002201509650001001531700001901541700002501560700001801585700002601603700002601629773012101655856007501776852000901851655001201860IND60550292720221116143833.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029272DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501885z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatlock, Johnathan V.10aSynthesis of α-Substituted Vinylsulfonium Salts and Their Application as Annulation Reagents in the Formation of Epoxide- and Cyclopropane-Fused Heterocycles  ap. 10226-10239.  aThe discovery of new methods for the synthesis of classes of potentially bioactive molecules remains an important goal for synthetic chemists. Vinylsulfonium salts have been used for the synthesis of a wide variety of small heterocyclic motifs; however, further developments to this important class of reagents has been focused on reaction with new substrates rather than development of new vinylsulfonium salts. We herein report the synthesis of a range of α-substituted vinylsulfonium tetraphenylborates (10 examples) in a 3 step procedure from commercially available styrenes. The important role of the tetraphenylborate counterion on the stability and accessibility of the vinylsulfonium salts is also detailed. The α-substituted vinylsulfonium tetraphenylborates gave good to excellent yields in the epoxyannulation of β-amino ketones (15 examples) and the cyclopropanation of allylic amines (4 examples). Hydrogenation of an epoxyannulation product proceeded with good diastereoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3abioactive compounds 3achemical structure 3adiastereoselectivity 3ahydrogenation 3aketones 3amethodology 3aorganic chemistry 3asalts1 aFritz, Sven P.1 aHarrison, Stephen A.1 aCoe, Diane M.1 aMcGarrigle, Eoghan M.1 aAggarwal, Varinder K.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Nov. 07, v. 79, no. 21 p.10226-10239dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo501885z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009400174520144600268592002801714650001801742650002601760650002701786650003101813650002901844650001301873650001701886650001501903650001501918650001901933650001701952650002501969650001001994650001402004650002602018650002102044700002302065700001902088700001802107700002202125700002602147700001902173773012302192856008202315852000902397655001202406IND60768468820221123013145.0220225e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076846882DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110202092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Shelby M. B.10aEngineered Cell Line Imaging Assay Differentiates Pathogenic from Non-Pathogenic Bacteria  aCell culture systems have greatly expanded our understanding of how bacterial pathogens target signaling pathways to manipulate the host and cause infection. Advances in genetic engineering have allowed for the creation of fluorescent protein readouts within signaling pathways, but these techniques have been underutilized in pathogen biology. Here, we genetically engineered a lung cell line with fluorescent reporters for extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and the downstream transcription factor FOS-related antigen 1 (Fra1) and evaluated signaling after inoculation with pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Cells were inoculated with 100 colony-forming units of Acinetobacter baylyi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, or Staphylococcus epidermidis and imaged in a multi-mode reader. The alamarBlue cell viability assay was used as a reference test and showed that pathogenic P. aeruginosa induced significant (p < 0.05) cell death after 8 h in both wild-type and engineered cell lines compared to non-pathogenic S. epidermidis. In engineered cells, we found that Fra1 signaling was disrupted in as little as 4 h after inoculation with bacterial pathogens compared to delayed disruption in signaling by non-pathogenic S. epidermidis. Overall, we demonstrate that low levels of pathogenic versus non-pathogenic bacteria can be rapidly and sensitively screened based on ERK-Fra1 signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantigens 3acell culture 3acell death 3acell lines 3acell viability 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3alungs 3apathogens 3atranscription factors 3aviability assays1 aBergstrom, Carson 1 aWalker, Brian 1 aWang, George 1 aAlfaro, Trinidad 1 aStromberg, Zachary R.1 aHess, Becky M.0 tPathogens.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110202093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007500172300001600247520116600263536018001429592002801609650002401637650001701661650001301678650001301691650001001704650002001714650002001734650001801754650001401772650002201786650001201808653001001820653002001830653002301850700002001873773012501893856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60689900020221117231314.0200424e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068990002DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2019.16149042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, Hadi M.14aThe role of viral infections in the development of autoimmune diseases  ap. 394-412.  aThe exact aetiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown, nonetheless, several factors contributing to the induction or exacerbation of autoimmune reactions have been suggested. These include the genetic profile and lifestyle of the affected individual in addition to environmental triggers such as bacterial, parasitic, fungal and viral infections. Infections caused by viruses usually trigger a potent immune response that is necessary for the containment of the infection; however, in some cases, a failure in the regulation of this immune response may lead to harmful immune reactions directed against the host’s antigens. The autoimmune attack can be carried out by different arms and components of the immune system and through different possible mechanisms including molecular mimicry, bystander activation, and epitope spreading among others. In this review, we examine the data available for the involvement of viral infections in triggering or exacerbating autoimmune diseases in addition to discussing the mechanisms by which these viral infections and the immune pathways they trigger possibly contribute to the development of autoimmunity.  aElias A.

The effect of EO concentrations, types and their combinations on the physical, thermal and antimicrobial properties of films were investigated. The results showed that the incorporation of EOs decreased the ζ-potential and viscosity, but increased the particle size of film-forming dispersions. Films incorporated with CEO and combined EOs exhibited better water barrier properties compared to those with CLO and single EO. Films containing CEO showed lower EO loss and higher thermal stability compared to those containing CLO, and the reason was attributed to the stronger interactions between chitosan, gum arabic and CEO. The combination of EOs resulted in higher retention and delayed release rate in food stimulant, resulting in stronger antimicrobial activities. The performance of films with the CEO and the combined EOs brought new formulation ideas in antimicrobial films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3achitosan 3acinnamon 3acloves 3adispersions 3aelectrolytes 3aessential oils 3agum arabic 3aparticle size 3athermal stability 3aviscosity 3azeta potential 0aEOs 0aCEO 0aCLO 0aCinnamon essential oil 0aClove essential oil 0aPolyelectrolyte complexed films1 aGao, ChengCheng1 aFeng, Xiao1 aHuang, Meigui1 aYang, Yuling1 aShen, Xinchun1 aTang, Xiaozhi0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 217 p.116-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.03.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006500155300001400220500001100234520168500245592002801930650001301958650001701971650002801988650001302016650002302029650001202052650002102064650001302085651001402098700002402112773011002136856007302246852000902319655001202328IND60626788220221119051317.0181228e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062678822DNAL7 a10.1111/mam.121412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroto, Bayu14aThe status of research on the mammals of Sulawesi, Indonesia  ap. 78-93.  aREVIEW  aThe Indonesian island of Sulawesi is widely considered a mammal conservation hotspot, mainly due to the high number of threatened endemic species with limited geographical ranges that are found there, and also due to the biogeographical importance of Sulawesi as the largest island in the Wallacea region. To date, there has been no comprehensive review to evaluate the status of what we know about mammals in Sulawesi. The overarching goal of our review is to contribute towards identifying knowledge gaps in the biology and ecology of mammals in Sulawesi. Our specific aims were to: 1) identify taxonomic and geographic bias in published research; 2) identify biases within existing ecological knowledge; and 3) identify key research priorities for the future. Our review covers a total of 280 articles (published between 1921 and 2017) on 144 species of mammal from Sulawesi. Through our review we found: 1) a strong taxonomic bias, with the majority of studies being conducted on primates (59% of published articles); 2) a geographic bias, where significantly fewer studies took place in the provinces of West Sulawesi and Gorontalo; and 3) a bias in research topics, with most studies (50% of published research) focusing on taxonomy and behaviour. As an outcome of this review, we provide specific recommendations for future researchers, including: 1) a checklist of understudied species, with particular emphasis on understudied species of conservation concern; 2) a checklist of understudied research topics, with an emphasis on the need to conduct detailed auto‐ecological studies; and 3) suggestions on how to adjust research methods on population and habitat studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrimates 3abiogeography 3aenvironmental knowledge 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amammals 3aresearch methods 3ataxonomy 3aIndonesia1 aMortelliti, Alessio0 tMammal review.g2019 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.78-93dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl7552x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.121413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04759naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011800186300001600304520183300320592002802153650002002181650002802201650001002229650001902239650001302258650001602271650001502287650002202302650001602324650001702340650001602357650002602373650001702399650002602416650002702442650000902469650001302478650002702491650001802518650000902536650001702545650002402562650001202586650009402598650005702692650002202749650003302771650003602804650003702840650007002877650003602947650002902983650006603012650002703078650000903105650006503114650002903179650008503208650002203293650005303315650000903368650001703377650005403394650003103448650008903479700002603568700002603594700002703620700002603647700001903673700002303692773011203715856008103827852000903908655001203917IND4468533120221122041826.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446853312DNAL7 a217627682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamkaew, Natakorn10aBacopa monnieri and its constituents is hypotensive in anaesthetized rats and vasodilator in various artery types  ap. 790-795.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) provides traditional cognitive treatments possibly reflecting improved cerebral hemodynamics. Little is known about the cardiovascular actions of Brahmi. We sought to assess its effects on blood pressure and on isolated arteries, thus providing insights to clinical applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intravenous Brahmi (20–60mg/kg) was tested on arterial blood pressure and heart rate of anaesthetized rats. In vitro vasorelaxation was assessed in arteries, with and without blockers of nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME), cyclooxygenase (indomethacin), and mechanical de-endothelialisation. The effects of Brahmi on Ca²⁺ influx and release from stores were investigated. RESULTS: Intravenous Brahmi extract (20–60mg/kg) decreased systolic and diastolic pressures without affecting heart rate. Brahmi evoked relaxation in isolated arteries in order of potency: basilar (IC50=102±16μg/ml)>mesenteric (171±31)>aortae (213±68)>renal (IC50=375±51)>tail artery (494±93)>femoral arteries (>1000μg/ml). Two saponins, bacoside A3 and bacopaside II, had similar vasodilator actions (IC50=8.3±1.7 and 19.5±6.3μM). In aortae, without endothelium or in L-NAME (10–4M), Brahmi was less potent (IC50=213±68 to 2170±664 and 1192±167μg/ml, respectively); indomethacin (10–5M) was ineffective. In tail artery, Brahmi inhibited K⁺-depolarization induced Ca²⁺ influx and Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by phenylephrine (10–5M) or caffeine (20mM). CONCLUSIONS: Brahmi reduces blood pressure partly via releasing nitric oxide from the endothelium, with additional actions on vascular smooth muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Some Brahmi ingredients could be efficacious antihypertensives and the vasodilation could account for some medicinal actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacopa monnieri 3aantihypertensive agents 3aaorta 3ablood pressure 3acaffeine 3aendothelium 3aheart rate 3ahematologic tests 3ahomeostasis 3aindomethacin 3aingredients 3aintravenous injection 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3asaponins 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3asmooth muscle 3atail 3avasodilation 2aAnesthesia, General 2aAnimals 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aArteriesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aBacopaxchemistry 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCalcium Signalingxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEndothelium, Vascularxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aHypotensionxchemically inducedxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aInfusions, Intravenous 2aMale 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Components, Aerial 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProstaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSarcoplasmic Reticulumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aVasodilationxdrug effects 2aVasodilator Agentsxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxpharmacology.1 aScholfield, C.

We used standing dead grass moisture observations collected within a large latitudinal spectrum in Eastern Australia to evaluate the predictive capacity of six different fuel moisture prediction models. The best-performing models, which ranged from a simple empirical formulation to a physically based process model, yield mean absolute errors of 2.0% moisture content, corresponding to a 25–30% mean absolute percentage error. These models tended to slightly underpredict the moisture content observations. The results have important implications for the authenticity of fire danger rating and operational fire behaviour prediction, which form the basis of community information and warnings, such as evacuation notices, in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3afire behavior 3afire hazard 3afuels 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3amodels 3aprediction 3awater content 3aAustralia1 aKidnie, Susan1 aMatthews, Stuart1 aHurley, Richard J.1 aSlijepcevic, Alen1 aNichols, David1 aGould, Jim S.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 9 p.995-1001dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF160363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100006400169245008400233300001800317500002000335506002800355506003000383520143100413592002801844596004401872596004501916596007501961596013202036506003702168650001602205650002302221650002002244650002602264650001002290650001602300650001402316650002202330650001402352650003502366650001402401700003702415700002002452700002302472773011902495856007302614903002202687961001202709852000902721655001202730IND60644710020221207061938.0190520e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064471002DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.150132doi7 a10.1111/mec.150132chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiculell, Bridget J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4771-719110aAssociation mapping of ectomycorrhizal traits in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)  ap. 2088-2099.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aTo understand how diverse mutualisms coevolve and how species adapt to complex environments, a description of the underlying genetic basis of the traits involved must be provided. For example, in diverse coevolving mutualisms, such as the interaction of host plants with a suite of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, a key question is whether host plants can coevolve independently with multiple species of symbionts, which depends on whether those interactions are governed independently by separate genes or pleiotropically by shared genes. To provide insight into this question, we employed an association mapping approach in a clonally replicated field experiment of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to identify genetic components of host traits governing ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbioses (mycorrhizal traits). The relative abundances of different EM fungi as well as the total number of root tips per cm root colonized by EM fungi were analyzed as separate mycorrhizal traits of loblolly pine. Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes of loblolly pine were associated with loblolly pine mycorrhizal traits, mapped to the loblolly pine genome, and their putative protein function obtained when available. The results support the hypothesis that ectomycorrhiza formation is governed by host genes of large effect that apparently have independent influences on host interactions with different symbiont species.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  aDBI-0501763cNational Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program  a2009-85606-05680cUS Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture AFRI Applied Plant Genomics CAP award0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus taeda 3achromosome mapping 3aectomycorrhizae 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amutualism 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroot tips 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asymbionts1 aJosé Martínez‐García, Pedro1 aNelson, C.

A wide range of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been extensively studied for their ability to produce extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs), which are repeating units of mono/oligosaccharides with various chemical compositions and properties. Despite the conventional belief regarding probiotics that states bacteria must be alive to exert their beneficial effects, mounting evidence opened up new perspectives on health-promoting effects of bacterial-derived molecules/metabolites. Employing EPSs seems safer alternative in complicated disorders like cancer and immune related diseases. EPSs have potential applications in textiles, cosmetology, wastewater treatment, food, and pharmaceutical industries, but little is known about their function therefore the present review aims to discuss the health-promoting properties of EPSs produced by LAB. Antioxidant, antiviral, antitumor and immunomodulating activity, with focus on the mechanisms involved, are discussed in the study. Ever-growing number of researches indicate that EPSs beneficiary effects have a promising future ahead.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aexopolysaccharides 3afabrics 3ahuman health 3alactic acid bacteria 3ametabolites 3aneoplasms 3aoligosaccharides 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprobiotics 3awastewater treatment 0aACE 0aAIDS 0aAPC 0aARE 0aCVD 0aDC 0aDNA 0adsRNA 0aEPSs 0aGalNAc 0aGH 0aGIT 0aGlcA 0aGlcNAc 0aGRAS 0aHMW 0aHePS 0aHoPS 0aIFN 0aIg 0aIL 0aISG 0aLAB 0aNK 0aNrf-2 0aNSAID 0aQPS 0aRNA 0aRNase 0aROS 0aSHR 0aTG 0aTh 0aTLR 0aTNF 0aTreg 0aAnti-cancer 0aAntioxidant 0aImmunomodulation1 aYari Khosroushahi, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3854-73111 aPourghassem Gargari, Bahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7667-099X0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 217 p.79-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013700166300001500303520109700318592002801415650002501443650001101468650001201479650001201491650001201503650001101515650001101526650001701537650001001554650001801564650000901582650001201591650001401603650001401617650001201631650001101643650002001654650001401674650001101688650002301699650001101722650000901733700001501742700001901757700001701776773012701793856008201920852000902002655001202011IND60089468520221120051446.0141102e20111014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008946852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinxin10aCharacterization of an AtCCX5 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana that involves in high-affinity K⁺ uptake and Na⁺ transport in yeast  ap. 96-100.  aThe gene for a putative cation calcium exchanger (CCX) from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtCCX5, was cloned and its function was analyzed in yeast. Green fluorescent protein-tagged AtCCX5 expressed in yeast was localized in the plasma membrane and nuclear periphery. The yeast transformants expressing AtCCX5 were created and their growth in the presence of various cations (K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, Co²⁺, Cd²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ba²⁺, Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, and Li⁺) were analyzed. AtCCX5 expression was found to affect the response to K⁺ and Na⁺ in yeast. The AtCCX5 transformant also showed a little better growth to Zn²⁺. The yeast mutant 9.3 expressing AtCCX5 restored growth of the mutant on medium with low K⁺ (0.5mM), and also suppressed its Na⁺ sensitivity. Ion uptake experiments showed that AtCCX5 mediated relatively high-affinity K⁺ uptake and was also involved in Na⁺ transport in yeast. Taken together, these findings suggest that the AtCCX5 is a novel transport protein involves in mediating high-affinity K⁺ uptake and Na⁺ transport in yeast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acations 3acobalt 3acopper 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aion transport 3airon 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amutants 3anickel 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3asodium 3atransport proteins 3ayeasts 3azinc1 aZhang, Min1 aTakano, Tetsuo1 aLiu, Shenkui0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 414, no. 1 p.96-100dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300001600265520088400281592002801165650001501193650001301208650001101221650001501232650001301247650001201260650001801272650001201290653001501302653001101317653001301328653001801341653001201359700001701371700001601388700001601404700001901420700002001439700001301459700001701472773008901489856008401578852000901662655001201671IND60546002320221119065455.0160903e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054600232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Zhiguo10aEffects of copper and aluminum on the adsorption of sulfathiazole and tylosin on peat and soil  ap. 579-585.  aEffects of copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) on the adsorption of sulfathiazole (STZ) and tylosin (T) to peat and soil were investigated using a batch equilibration method. Results show that Cu suppressed STZ adsorption onto peat and soil at pH < 5.0 because of the electrostatic competition, while increased STZ adsorption at pH > 5.0 due to the formation of STZ–Cu complexes and/or Cu bridge. In contrast, Al only decreased STZ adsorption at pH < 6.0, and exerted slight effect on STZ adsorption at >6.0. As for T, both Cu and Al suppressed its adsorption over the entire pH range owing to three reasons: 1) electrostatic competition between Cu/Al and T+; 2) Cu/Al adsorption made the soil and peat surface less negatively charged, which was unfavorable for T+ adsorption; 3) the shrunken pore size of peat and soil retarded the diffusion of large-sized T into these pores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acopper 3apeat soils 3aporosity 3asoil pH 3asulfathiazole 3atylosin 0aAdsorption 0aCopper 0aAluminum 0aSulfathiazole 0aTylosin1 aYang, Shuang1 aLi, Lingyun1 aLi, Chunmei1 aZhang, Shuzhen1 aShan, Xiao-quan1 aWen, Bei1 aGuo, Baoyuan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Jan., v. 184 p.579-585dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014200171300001600313520145800329592002801787596010501815650002401920650002601944650002701970650001401997650002102011650001402032650001502046650001502061650001502076650001702091650001802108650003202126650001502158650001502173650001902188650001402207700002002221700002502241700001702266700006702283773012802350856008202478852000902560655001202569IND60687054220221117175723.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068705422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01905-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, Hanaa Ali10aCytotoxic effects of Tetraselmis suecica chloroform extracts with silver nanoparticle co-application on MCF-7, 4 T1, and Vero cell lines  ap. 127-143.  aIn the present study we evaluated the effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Tetraselmis suecica chloroform (CHL) crude extracts as single and co-applications against MCF-7 and 4 T1 breast cancer cells and normal Vero cell-lines. The AgNPs single application exhibited the highest cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner with IC₅₀ of 5.3, 17.78, and 25.11 μg mL⁻¹ against MCF-7, 4 T1 and Vero cell lines, respectively, after 72 h treatments. The AgNPs-T. suecica-CHL co-application at 2:1 ratio achieved the IC₅₀ of 6.60 and 53.7 μg mL⁻¹ on MCF-7 and 4 T1 cells, respectively, while the T. suecica-CHL single application only showed the IC₅₀ of 46.77 and 83.17 μg mL⁻¹, respectively. However, both the T. suecica-CHL and AgNPs-T. suecica-CHL showed no cytotoxic activity against the Vero cells. The AgNPs-T. suecica-CHL exhibited the highest late apoptotic events on MCF-7 (38.8%), followed by Tamoxifen (TMX), AgNPs and T. suecica-CHL. The cell cycle analysis of AgNPs-T. suecica-CHL–treated cells showed a significant increase in the accumulation of events at sub-G1 phase with increased ADP/ATP ratio and Caspase 3/7, suggesting the induction of apoptosis. The results brought new insights into the formulation of microalgal crude extracts (MCEs) and AgNPs co-applications in exerting strong cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and 4 T1 cancer cells, but without having any cytotoxicity on the normal Vero cell-lines.  aPublisher supplied data  aFundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2015/SG05/UMT/02/4)cMinistry of Higher Education Malaysia 3aTetraselmis suecica 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amicroalgae 3ananosilver 3aneoplasm cells 3atamoxifen1 aMohamad, Habsah1 aGhazaly, Maziah Mohd1 aLaith, A.

An approach using a special purpose soil identification key and conceptual toposequence models was developed to assist non-soil experts with identifying soil types in Kuwait. The approach supports the restoration of Kuwait rangelands, where there is a need to assist revegetation success by removing uncertainty regarding soil conditions and targeting the planting of appropriate vegetation communities to the soil type. Legacy data from soil survey reports were available for reinterpretation. The soil identification key developed is in a matrix form and allowed soil types to be determined by the presence or absence of three recognizable soil features, which generally typify arid zone soils worldwide: hardpan, gypsum, and calcium carbonate. The soil type categories are descriptively named for ease of understanding by non-technical users, and were structured to align with the previously identified Soil Taxonomy classes to maintain linkages with the soil survey and other interpreted information. To complement the soil identification key, conceptual soil toposequence models presented the general soil distribution patterns in a visual format to aid understanding of spatial variation and soil type relationships. The approach is flexible and can be scaled with additional criteria as more knowledge is acquired regarding the relationship between soil types and vegetation communities, and while the detail is applicable to Kuwait the approach could be adjusted and applied elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acalcium carbonate 3aexperts 3agypsum 3ahardpans 3aindigenous species 3aland restoration 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aplanting 3arangelands 3asoil surveys 3asoil taxonomy 3asoil types 3auncertainty 3aKuwait 0aclassification matrix 0aconceptual toposequence 0alegacy data 0asoil taxonomy 0aspecial-purpose soil classification1 aFitzpatrick, R.

Various signal processing techniques have been introduced to solve the task, which is especially challenging when the decay is multiexponential with an unknown number of components. Here, we introduce a new method for the processing of such types of signals. Our approach modifies the Tikhonov’s regularization, known previously in CONTIN and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) methods, by using the l1-norm penalty function. The modification enforces sparsity of the result, which improves resolution, compared to both mentioned methods. We implemented the Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Multiexponential Decay (ITAMeD), which employs the l1-norm minimization, using the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). The proposed method is compared with the Levenberg–Marquardt-Fletcher fitting, Non-negative Least Squares (NNLS), CONTIN, and MaxEnt methods on simulated datasets, with regard to noise vulnerability and resolution. Also, the comparison with MaxEnt is presented for the experimental data of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer solutions and mixtures of these with various molecular weights (1080 g/mol, 11 840 g/mol, 124 700 g/mol). The results suggest that ITAMeD may be the method of choice for monodispersed samples with “discrete” distributions of diffusion coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adiffusivity 3aleast squares 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3ashrinkage1 aBernin, Diana1 aKoźmiński, Wiktor1 aKazimierczuk, Krzysztof0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 85, no. 3 p.1828-1833dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30320043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006900206300001800275520168400293592002801977650001702005650003002022650001502052650001902067650000902086651001902095651001902114651002002133651001902153700002402172700001902196700002202215700002902237700002202266700001802288773012902306856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60779055320221119095312.0220613e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077905532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-022-02394-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeisher, Craig1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2371-224110aRanking the direct threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa  ap. 1329-1343.  aSub-Saharan Africa receives large investments in biodiversity conservation, and if these investments can be concentrated on the highest threats to biodiversity, the benefits to conservation from the investments would increase. Yet there is no available prioritization of the many direct threats to biodiversity to inform organizations developing sub-Saharan or sub-regional conservation strategies. Consequently, regional investments by funders of biodiversity conservation such as international conservation organizations, foundations, and bilateral and multilateral donors may be suboptimal. The objective of this study was to determine what are the highest direct threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa and its sub-regions. To do this, we collected threat data using standardized IUCN threat categories from a Delphi consensus of sub-Saharan Africa biodiversity experts, known threats to IUCN Red-listed sub-Saharan African species, and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans from 40 sub-Saharan African countries. After averaging the threat ranking from the three sources, the highest threats were: (1) annual and perennial crops (non-timber); (2) fishing and harvesting aquatic resources in marine and freshwater areas; (3) logging and wood harvesting in natural forests; and (4) hunting and collecting terrestrial animals. The highest-ranked sub-regional threats were hunting in Central Africa and agriculture in East Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Aligning biodiversity investments to address these threats and tailoring activities to reflect local socio-ecological contexts would increase the conservation of biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3afreshwater 3aprioritization 3awood 3aCentral Africa 3aEastern Africa 3aSouthern Africa 3aWestern Africa1 aRobinson, Nathaniel1 aBrown, Matthew1 aKujirakwinja, Deo1 aSchmitz, Mauricio Castro1 aWieland, Michelle1 aWilkie, David0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 4 p.1329-1343dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-022-02394-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520099000298536013201288592002801420650001501448650001401463650001701477650002301494650002801517653001801545653003701563700001901600773013101619856008601750852000901836655001201845IND60754914320221122052034.0211027e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075491432DNAL7 a10.1080/07352689.2021.19591372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Shubham10aRhizospheric Engineering by Plant-Mediated Indirect Selection of Microbiome for Agricultural Sustainability  ap. 379-397.  aIn an attempt to attain sustainability in agriculture, microbiome-based approaches have been investigated as “next-generation biologicals”. The top-down strategy of plant-mediated indirect selection of rhizospheric microbiome holds potential in generating a robust and efficient microbiome for enhancement of desired plant phenotype and its overall fitness. It involves multiple rounds of plant growth experiments under selection pressure such that the plant recruits a microbiome optimal for its fitness over the course of selection. In the review, we have critically discussed various aspects related to the approach, viz. methodological details, the current challenges faced by the technique, and the concerns related to the adoption of the plant-mediated indirect selection of microbiome at a larger scale. Besides, based on recent methodological developments and knowledge gained, we have proposed solutions for some of the issues, which will aid in popularizing the strategy.  aThe work was funded by a grant received from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India (BT/PR27680/BCE/8/1434/2018).  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrobiome 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aselection pressure 3asustainable agriculture 0aplant fitness 0arhizospheric microbial community1 aSharma, Shilpi0 tCritical reviews in plant sciences.g2021 Sept. 3, v. 40, no. 5 p.379-397dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl34283x1549-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07352689.2021.19591373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166300001600252520239000268592002802658650001602686650003502702650001502737650001102752650002502763650001102788653001302799653001802812653001502830653001502845653001402860773011202874856008102986852000903067655001203076IND60610835820221116165223.0180830e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061083582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillings, Mark10aMapping liminality: Critical frameworks for the GIS-based modelling of visibility  ap. 121-128.  aSince the widespread adoption of GIS by archaeologists in the early 1990s, analyses of visibility have steadily gained traction, becoming commonplace in landscape and regional analysis. This is in large part due to the routine way in which such products can be generated, bolstered by a raft of landscape-based studies that have placed varying degrees of emphasis upon human perception and direct bodily engagement in seeking to understand and explore the past. Despite this seeming popularity, two worrying trends stand out. The first is the lack of any coherent theoretical framework, applications preferring instead to seek justification in the very first wave of experiential landscape approaches that emerged in the early 1990s. Needless to say, the intervening 20 or so years have seen considerable development in the conceptual tools we draw upon in order to make sense of past landscapes, not to mention considerable finessing of the first-wave developments alluded to above. Second is the tendency to relegate viewshed analysis to certain types of predictable problem or question (i.e. viewshed analysis has become typecast). These trends have been compounded by a host of other issues. For example, whilst there have been refinements, tweaks and variations to the basic viewshed (and the frequency with which they are generated and combined), not to mention establishment of robust calibration criteria for controlling them and statistical approaches for assessing the patterns tendered, these have yet to be brought together in any coherent fashion and their veracity critically assessed. Likewise, a failure to establish an agreed vocabulary has resulted in a number of proverbial wheels being reinvented time and again. The argument presented here is that viewsheds have considerably more to offer archaeology but to realise this entails confronting these issues head on. That this is possible and desirable is illustrated through discussion of a new theoretical framework for visibility-studies that draws upon developments in assemblage theory and the author's own work on affordance and relationality. To demonstrate the value of this approach in encouraging different ways of thinking about what viewsheds are and how we might begin to draw creatively upon them, a case-study is described where viewsheds are folded into a detailed exploration of landscape liminality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3ageographic information systems 3alandscapes 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3awheels 0aViewshed 0aRelationality 0aAssemblage 0aLiminality 0aEmergence0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2017 Aug., v. 84 p.121-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013600165520099600301592002801297650001401325650002001339650001701359650001401376650002501390650001101415650001801426650003301444650002301477650001001500650001101510653003801521653003101559653004001590653003201630653001401662653004401676653001601720653002401736653003701760700001401797700001501811700001701826700001501843700005601858773010001914856008702014852000902101655001202110IND60696066920221119032654.0200619e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069606692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dan10aMultivariate analysis reveals effect of glutathione-enriched inactive dry yeast on amino acids and volatile components of kiwi wine  aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression were applied to investigate the effect of glutathione-enriched inactive dry yeast (g-IDY) on the amino acids and volatile components of kiwi wine. Results indicated that the addition of g-IDY had positive effect on most amino acids of kiwi wine, especially glutamine and glycine. In case of pure juice fermentation, the concentrations of ethyl decanoate, 2-methylbutyric acid, trans-2-nonenal and hexyl butyrate had notably positive correlation with the addition of g-IDY. PLS regression indicated that the amino acids were highly interrelated to the volatile compositions, and glycine had the strongest positive impact on the concentrations of esters and total volatile components. This might explain the similar effect of g-IDY on the amino acids and volatile components of kiwi wine. Besides, PLS regression showed that E-nose was a good method to predict volatile compositions of kiwi wine, especially esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyrates 3aelectronic nose 3afermentation 3aglutamine 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ajuices 3aleast squares 3aprincipal component analysis 3avolatile compounds 3awines 3ayeasts 0aGlutathione (PubChem CID: 124886) 0aGlycine (PubChem CID: 750) 0aEthyl decanoate (PubChem CID: 8048) 0aLeucine (PubChem CID: 6106) 0aKiwi wine 0aGlutathione-enriched inactive dry yeast 0aAmino acids 0aVolatile components 0aPartial least squares regression1 aQi, Yiman1 aZhao, Ning1 aCao, Youfang1 aXu, Junnan1 aFan, Mingtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8085-44920 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 329 p.127086-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245014900168300001800317500001900335520102000354592002801374650001501402650002401417650001501441650001001456650000901466650002001475650001401495700005601509700001601565700005401581700005901635700001801694773013601712856008001848852000901928655001201937IND60710489020221119014940.0200910e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c045372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaskhodchikov, D.10aMechanism of Thermal Charge Relaxation in Poled Silicate Glasses in a Wide Temperature Range (From Liquid Nitrogen to Glass Melting Temperature)  ap. 7948-7956.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aData on thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) study of the same poled glass in the temperature range 100–1000 K are analyzed. Four specific temperature ranges in the TSDC spectrum of this glass are identified, with each range being attributed to the charge relaxation processes of different natures. During linear heating in the temperature range 100–250 K, charge relaxation is related to the adsorption/desorption of particles from the atmosphere, supposedly water cluster ions H⁺(H₂O)ₙ. The next TSDC band, which is observed at room temperature and above, is related to the disordering of the polar structural entities. The TSDC band in the temperature range 500–750 K is attributed to the relaxation of spatial charge by the diffusion mechanism. The TSDC band in the temperature range 750–1000 K is attributed to the relaxation of spatial charge by the viscous flow mechanism. All these data allowed drawing a schematic TSDC spectrum of silicate glasses in the full temperature range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3adesorption 3aglass 3aheat 3aliquid nitrogen 3asilicates1 aReshetov, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8661-36541 aBrunkov, P.1 aKaasik, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9976-67211 aLipovskiĭ, A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9472-91901 aTagantsev, D.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 124, no. 36 p.7948-7956dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c045373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168300001600286520133200302592002801634650001101662650002401673650001301697650002601710650002001736650002301756650001501779650002601794650001401820650001001834650001301844650001901857650001401876653002301890653001601913653001701929773012501946856008502071852000902156655001202165IND60689900420221117231414.0200424e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068990042DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2019.16244992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, Léa10aQuorum sensing in Vibrio spp.: the complexity of multiple signalling molecules in marine and aquatic environments  ap. 451-471.  aQuorum sensing (QS) is a density-dependent mechanism enabling bacteria to coordinate their actions via the release of small diffusible molecules named autoinducers (AIs). Vibrio spp. are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions by using a wide range of physiological mechanisms and many species pose a threat for human health and diverse marine and estuarine ecosystems worldwide. Cell-to-cell communication controls many of their vital functions such as niche colonization, survival strategies, or virulence. In this review, I summarize (1) the different known QS pathways (2) the diversity of AIs as well as their biological functions, and (3) the QS-mediated interactions between Vibrio and other organisms. However, the current knowledge is limited to a few pathogenic or bioluminescent species and in order to provide a genus-wide view an inventory of QS genes among 87 Vibrio species has been made. The large diversity of signal molecules and their differential effects on a particular physiological function suggest that the complexity of multiple signalling systems within bacterial communities is far from being fully understood. I question here the real level of specificity of such communication in the environment and discuss the different perspectives in order to better apprehend QS in natural habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioluminescence 3acell communication 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3agenes 3ahabitats 3aquorum sensing 3avirulence 0aMarine environment 0aVibrio spp. 0aautoinducers0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2019 July 4, v. 45, no. 4 p.451-471dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2019.16244993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010200160300002000262520149100282592002801773650004401801650002101845650001501866650001601881650001301897650002201910650001901932650001501951650002301966650001201989650002102001650001502022700001702037700001702054700001802071700001402089773012402103856007402227852000902301655001202310IND60640777220221122002715.0190505e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064077722DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra05211h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Tianlong10aMicrowave regeneration of spent activated carbon for the treatment of ester-containing wastewater  ap. 60815-60825.  aIn this study, an integrated granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption/microwave (MW) irradiation process was used for the treatment of ester-containing wastewater from a lithium-ion battery (LIB) factory. Firstly, ester-containing organic matter was adsorbed onto GAC, then the pollutants were decomposed. The GAC was then regenerated by MW irradiation. The efficacy of this procedure was analyzed by determining adsorption effectiveness, adsorption kinetics and the textural properties of GAC in successive GAC adsorption/MW cycles. The mechanism of MW regeneration was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results show that the adsorption isotherms and kinetics for the adsorption of ester contaminants are in accordance with Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second-order kinetic models. It was also found that though the adsorption rate constant (k₂) of GAC increased with the adsorption/MW regeneration cycles, the adsorption capacity (qₘ) decreased where the qₘ of GAC at the 5th regeneration cycle had a 20.4% reduction in comparison to the determined original GAC, which could be explained by changes in the GAC's textural properties. The GAC adsorption/MW process mainly occurred at the peak of 1117 cm⁻¹ by FTIR. Through TG and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses, the weight loss of saturated GAC took place between 120 °C and 260 °C, caused by the decomposition of ester organic molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3airradiation 3akinetics 3alithium batteries 3aorganic matter 3apollutants 3asorption isotherms 3atexture 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater1 aWang, Qunhui1 aShi, Zhining1 aZhang, Zhihui1 aMa, Yuhui0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 23, v. 6, no. 65 p.60815-60825dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra05211h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245016400215300001800379520127300397592002801670650001601698650001201714650001201726650002301738650001101761650002001772700005801792773012001850856008401970852000902054655001202063IND60752072120221117185226.0210929e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075207212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c010282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenier, Francielli S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-872710aEffect of Coordination Behavior in Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium-Ion Conduction: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Poly(ethylene oxide) and Poly(tetrahydrofuran)  ap. 8553-8562.  aAlternatives to lithium-ion batteries are extensively studied due to concerns about lithium availability considering the constant increase in demand for rechargeable batteries. While several studies have investigated different liquid electrolytes, the transport of those ions in their polymer counterparts remains understudied. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the main factors that affect sodium-ion transport in two polymer hosts: poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF). We analyzed the influence of oxygen density in each chain and its effect on diffusivity, conductivity, and cation–anion interactions. It is inferred that the weaker coordination in PTHF resulted in differences in the Na⁺-transport mechanism, with interchain hopping being more prominent in PTHF than in PEO. The faster diffusion observed in PTHF was, however, hindered by the significantly larger formation of ion clusters in the PTHF electrolyte, which could lead to smaller transference numbers in battery settings. These findings elucidate the fundamental influences and correlations of varied polymer ether content to ion coordination and transport, which can inform on novel syntheses that improve polymer electrolyte properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aliquids 3alithium 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3atetrahydrofuran1 aHosein, Ian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-26440 tMacromolecules.g2021 Aug. 03, v. 54, no. 18 p.8553-8562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c010283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015000167300001600317500001500333520258200348592002802930650001402958650001902972650001202991650001703003650001703020650001403037650001203051650001503063650001203078650001303090650001403103651002103117653001703138653001403155700001903169700001603188773009603204856008403300852000903384655001203393IND60085222820221119130654.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008522282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2011.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartes, J.E.10aDeep-sea suprabenthos assemblages (Crustacea) off the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean): Mesoscale variability in diversity and production  ap. 340-354.  a2019-12-06  aThe composition of suprabenthic crustacean assemblages, their diversity, production (P) and production/biomass (P/B) ratios, were analyzed at species level along two transects situated to the north (N) and south (S) of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean) at depths between 134m and 760m, based on a ca. bi-monthly sampling performed between August 2003 and June 2004. Differences with depth and season in assemblage composition and diversity were analyzed as a function of the contrasting environmental features (e.g. water mass dynamics) of the two areas. We identified 187 species (18 decapods, 5 euphausiids, 16 mysids, 76 gammaridean amphipods, 13 hyperiids, 1 caprellid, 21 isopods and 37 cumaceans). Substantial mesoscale variability in the deep-sea suprabenthic assemblages coupled with diversity trends between the N and S transects were found. Seasonality was the most important gradient influencing the dynamics of suprabenthos over the upper (350m) and middle (650–750m) slope in the N area. Conversely, the S area appeared to be more stable temporally with depth as the main gradient inducing assemblage differences. Different depth-related patterns were observed both for diversity and P/B. To the north diversity was very low at the shelf-break, increasing on the upper-slope (H′>3.00) and then decreasing again on the middle-slope. To the south diversity increased smoothly downward, reaching the highest values on the middle-slope. Regarding productivity, P/B was highest at intermediate depths to the north (over ca. 450–500m), while to the south highest P/Bs were found deeper (over ca. 600–650m). The higher P/B at intermediate depths found along N are likely due to higher % of organic matter (OM) in sediments, a product of oceanographic frontal systems. In particular, P/B was higher along N among omnivores and detritus feeders (e.g. Andaniexis mimonectes, Lepechinella manco and combined cumaceans), coupled to enriched OM in sediments, while along S mesoplanktonic carnivores (Rhachotropis spp.) had higher P/Bs. We conclude that on the north slope the influence of frontal systems and more active flow dynamics of different water masses (WIW and LIW) increases natural disturbance in the area, increasing productivity and diversity of suprabenthic peracarids in the Benthic Boundary Layer. Also, species showed a displacement of their average distributions (their Centres of Gravity, CoG) to shallower depths along N, which is another indicator of more favorable habitat conditions for suprabenthos in the 400–500m range at N.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aorganic matter 3aIsopoda 3aEuphausiacea 3adetritivores 3aAmphipoda 3agravity 3acarnivores 3abiomass 3ahabitats 3aomnivores 3aBalearic Islands 0aMalacostraca 0aMysidacea1 aMamouridis, V.1 aFanelli, E.0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Apr., v. 65, no. 3 p.340-354dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012200170300001400292520164800306592002801954650001301982650001101995650001602006650002302022650000902045650002602054650001302080650001302093650002302106650001902129650001502148650001302163650003002176650001602206651001802222651001602240653001302256653002202269653001302291653001602304653001202320700002102332700002102353700002302374700001802397700002302415773013002438856008402568852000902652655001202661IND60606231720221119174453.0190318e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060623172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakubas, Dariusz10aForaging behavior of a high-Arctic zooplanktivorous alcid, the little auk, at the southern edge of its breeding range  ap. 89-99.  aZooplanktivorous seabirds as central-place foragers are constrained by the need to repeatedly return to the colony. Breeding within a cost-effective distance from food-abundant foraging grounds may be crucial for successful reproduction. In this study, foraging areas, ranges and habitats of high-Arctic little auks (Alle alle) breeding on Bjørnøya in the Barents Sea, at the southern edge of their breeding range, were investigated combining GPS-tracking and satellite remote sensing. Birds were expected to forage in areas with productive oceanographic features (cold shelf and frontal zone waters) close to their breeding colony. Contrary to expectation, they foraged in warm waters (sea surface temperature median 6.6°C), optimal for boreal zooplankton. Little auks preferred shallow shelf waters (mean depth 74m) characterized by higher chlorophyll a concentrations. Parent birds performed both short (ST) and long (LT) foraging trips, both of considerably longer duration compared to other colonies in more high-Arctic environment. During ST they probably spent more time searching for preferred Arctic prey (dominating in chick diet samples) among abundant Atlantic zooplankton. Long duration of LT resulted from exploring distant cold waters abundant in Arctic zooplankton community. This confirms that little auks are able to respond to various environmental conditions through the plasticity of their foraging behavior without negative consequences for chick survival. To date, observed changes in marine environment have not posed a threat to the ability of little auks on Bjørnøya to feed their chicks energy-rich zooplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3achicks 3achlorophyll 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3amarine environment 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseabirds 3asurface water temperature 3azooplankton 3aArctic region 3aBarents Sea 0aSeabirds 0aForaging behavior 0aTracking 0aArctic zone 0aDovekie1 aIliszko, Lech M.1 aStrøm, Hallvard1 aDarecki, Mirosław1 aJerstad, Kurt1 aStempniewicz, Lech0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 475 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245010600220300001600326520096500342592002801307650001901335650004401354650001501398650001701413650002401430650001801454650001501472650001101487650001101498650001401509650001201523650001301535650001601548650002001564650001701584653001601601653001901617653001401636653001901650653001101669700003101680700003301711700003901744700002901783700002201812700003201834700004101866773010801907856008602015852000902101655001202110IND60540817220221120161600.0190318e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054081722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lima, Rogério Barbosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9453-345410aSalt stress alters the cell wall polysaccharides and anatomy of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) leaf cells  ap. 686-694.  aCoffea arabica is the most important agricultural commodity in the world, and salinity is a major threat to its sustainable irrigation. Coffee leaf polysaccharides from plants subjected to salt stress were extracted and the leaves visualized through optical and electron microscopy. Alterations were detected in the monosaccharide composition of the pectin and hemicelluloses, with increases in uronic acid in all fractions. Changes in the polysaccharides were confirmed by HPSEC and FTIR. Moreover, the monolignol content was increased in the final residue, which suggests increased lignin content. The cytoplasm was altered, and the chloroplasts appeared irregular in shape. The arrangement of the stroma lamellae was disordered, and no starch granules were present. It was concluded that leaves of C. arabica under salt stress showed alterations in cell wall polysaccharides, increased monolignol content and structural damage to the cells of the mesophyll.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3aelectron microscopy 3ahemicellulose 3airrigation 3aleaves 3alignin 3amesophyll 3apectins 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3astarch granules 3auronic acids 0aSalt stress 0aCoffea arabica 0aCell wall 0aPolysaccharide 0aLignin1 ados Santos, Tiago Benedito1 aVieira, Luiz Gonzaga Esteves1 ade Lourdes Lúcio Ferrarese, Maria1 aFerrarese-Filho, Osvaldo1 aDonatti, Lucélia1 aBoeger, Maria Regina Torres1 ade Oliveira Petkowicz, Carmen Lúcia0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 112 p.686-694dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111040001800132100002400150245013600174300001800310506017300328520084600501650002501347650002301372650001301395650001601408650001301424650001101437650001801448650001401466650001501480650001201495650001101507650002201518650002101540650001301561700002201574700002101596773007101617856011201688856009701800956010201897961000901999852000902008655001202017IND60006185820221214225257.0160217e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000618582DNAL7 a3211602aris7 a10113/618582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhlenfeldt, Mark K.10a‘Nocturne’ Hybrid Blueberry: A Winter-hardy, Mixed-species Hexaploid with Ornamental Landscape Interest and Novel Fruit Quality  ap. 1825-1827.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  a‘Nocturne’ is a dark-fruited, hexaploid blueberry selection with significant (50%) rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei Reade, syn.

Here, we further analyzed the transcriptional regulation of NIS gene expression by excess iodide using PCCl3 cells. NIS promoter activity was reduced in cells treated for 12–24 h with 10−5 to 10−3 M NaI. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pax8 and NF-κB cis-acting elements abrogated the iodide-induced NIS transcription repression. Indeed, excess iodide (10−3 M) excluded Pax8 from the nucleus, decreased p65 total expression and reduced their transcriptional activity. Importantly, p65-Pax8 physical interaction and binding to NIS upstream enhancer were reduced upon iodide treatment. PI3K/Akt pathway activation by iodide-induced ROS production is involved in the transcriptional repression of NIS expression. In conclusion, the results indicated that excess iodide transcriptionally represses NIS gene expression through the impairment of Pax8 and p65 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the data presented herein described novel roles for PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and oxidative status in the thyroid autoregulatory phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aiodides 3aregulatory sequences 3asignal transduction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asymporters 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aExcess iodide 0aNa+/I− symporter (NIS) 0aPaired box 8 (Pax8) 0aNuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aPI3K/Akt pathway 0aNIS 0aTSH 0aNUE 0aNF-κB 0aPax8 0aRPL19 0aTSHR 0aIκB-α 0aIL-6 0aTPO 0aTg 0aNAC 0aROS 0aPI3K 0aAkt 0aChIP 0aPTEN1 aNicola, Juan Pablo1 aTeixeira, Silvania da Silva1 aPoyares, Leonice Lourenço1 aLellis-Santos, Camilo1 aBordin, Silvana1 aMasini-Repiso, Ana Maria1 aNunes, Maria Tereza0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 May 05, v. 426 p.73-90dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012700173300001600300520171900316592002802035650001902063650002402082650001302106650002002119650001102139650001802150650001602168650002202184650001302206650002302219650001602242700002202258700002102280700002102301700002902322700001602351773009602367856008402463852000902547655001202556IND60085222920221119130616.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008522292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuarini, Jean-Marc10aSeasonal variations in ectotherm growth rates: Quantifying growth as an intermittent non steady state compensatory process  ap. 355-361.  aGenerally, growth rates of living organisms are considered to be at steady state, varying only under environmental forcing factors. For example, these rates may be described as a function of light for plants or organic food resources for animals and these could be regulated (or not) by temperature or other conditions. But, what are the consequences for an individual's growth (and also for the population growth) if growth rate variations are themselves dynamic and not steady state? For organisms presenting phases of dormancy or long periods of stress, this is a crucial question. A dynamic perspective for quantifying short-term growth was explored using the daily growth record of the scallop Pecten maximus (L.). This species is a good biological model for ectotherm growth because the shell records growth striae daily. Independently, a generic mathematical function representing the dynamics of mean daily growth rate (MDGR) was implemented to simulate a diverse set of growth patterns. Once the function was calibrated with the striae patterns, the growth rate dynamics appeared as a forced damped oscillation during the growth period having a basic periodicity during two transitory phases (mean duration 43days) and appearing at both growth start and growth end. This phase is most likely due to the internal dynamics of energy transfer within the organism rather than to external forcing factors. After growth restart, the transitory regime represents successive phases of over-growth and regulation. This pattern corresponds to a typical representation of compensatory growth, which from an evolutionary perspective can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to coping with a fluctuating environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPecten maximus 3acompensatory growth 3adormancy 3aenergy transfer 3amodels 3aorganic foods 3aperiodicity 3apopulation growth 3ascallops 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature1 aChauvaud, Laurent1 aCloern, James E.1 aClavier, Jacques1 aCoston-Guarini, Jennifer1 aPatry, Yann0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Apr., v. 65, no. 3 p.355-361dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04240naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002300191245013300214300001800347506007600365520221900441592002802660506003702688650001602725650001002741650001002751650001302761650003502774650001402809650002602823650002202849650001202871650001302883650002102896650003402917650002702951650001902978650002402997650000903021650002003030650002903050650001003079651001303089653003503102653003003137653001303167653001303180653002203193700001803215700001503233700002503248700002703273700006703300700001803367773012303385856008503508852000903593655001203602IND60616060620221207104543.0210415e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061606062DNAL7 a302967592pmid7 aPMC62219902pmcid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhassabian, Akhgar10aConcentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances and bisphenol A in newborn dried blood spots and the association with child behavior  ap. 1629-1636.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExperimental studies suggest that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals interferes with developmental processes in the fetal brain. Yet, epidemiological evidence is inconclusive.In a birth cohort (2008–2010, upstate New York), we quantified concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and bisphenol A (BPA) in stored newborn dried blood spots using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Mothers reported on children's behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 7 (650 singletons and 138 twins). Difficulties in total behavior (i.e., emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems) and prosocial behavior were classified using validated cut-offs. We used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to estimate the odds of having difficulties per exposure category.In total, 111 children (12.1%) had total behavioral difficulties and 60 (6.5%) had difficulties in prosocial behavior. The median (interquartile range) of PFOS, PFOA, and BPA were 1.74 ng/ml (1.33), 1.12 ng/ml (0.96), and 7.93 ng/ml (10.79), respectively. Higher PFOS levels were associated with increased odds of having behavioral difficulties (OR per SD of log PFOS = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.03–1.65). We observed associations between PFOS in the highest relative to the lowest quartile and behavioral difficulties (OR for PFOS₁.₁₄₋₁.₇₄ = 1.65, 95%CI: 0.84–3.34; PFOS₁.₇₅₋₂.₄₇ = 1.73, 95%CI: 0.87–3.43; and PFOS>₂.₄₇ = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.29–4.72 compared to PFOS<₁.₄₁). The associations between higher concentrations of PFOS and behavioral difficulties at age 7 years were driven by problems in conduct and emotional symptoms. Higher PFOA levels were associated with difficulties in prosocial behavior (OR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.03–1.75). There was an inverse association between BPA concentrations and difficulties in prosocial behavior but only in the 2nd and 4th quartiles. We found no interactions between sex and chemical concentrations.Increasing prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, as reflected in neonatal concentrations, may pose risk for child behavioral difficulties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abisphenol A 3ablood 3abrain 3achildren 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aequations 3aliquid chromatography 3amaternal exposure 3amothers 3aneonates 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asocial behavior 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwins 3aNew York 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aNeonates 0aBehavior 0aDried blood spots1 aBell, Erin M.1 aMa, Wanli,1 aSundaram, Rajeshwari1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam1 aBuck Louis, Germaine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1774-44901 aYeung, Edwina0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Dec., v. 243 p.1629-1636dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165520128900250592002801539650001501567650002001582650002001602650001301622650001201635650000701647650002201654650001601676653002501692653003601717653003901753653002201792653001801814653001701832653002301849700001301872700001501885700001801900773009401918856008202012852000902094655001202103IND60725302220221119064453.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlagiello, D.10aDataset of wet desulphurization scrubbing in a column packed with Mellapak 250.X  aFlue-Gas Desulphurization (FGD) is a fundamental process commonly adopted for the treatment of exhausts deriving from both stationary and mobile sources. The removal of SO₂ from flue gasses can be made through different technologies and absorption offers the highest versatility for a large spectrum of applications.The data presented in this paper derive from FGD experiments carried out in a pilot wet scrubber equipped with a structured packing (Hastelloy C-22, Mellapak 250.X). The experiments aim to determine the SO₂ removal efficiency from a simulated flue-gas in different operating conditions, similar to those observed in common wet FGD processes. Experimental data are reported in terms of gas velocity, concentration of SO₂ in the flue-gas, liquid/gas feed ratio, fluids temperature and pressure. The dataset also includes the measurements of several working parameters, i.e. pressure drops in the column, wash water pH, relative humidity of the outlet gas and temperatures of gas and liquid flowing out of the FGD unit.The collection of these data could be useful in future studies and in the analysis of FGD units, also to design/improve large-scale absorption columns with structured packing, using various scrubbing liquids and in different operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adata collection 3adesulfurization 3aflue gas 3aliquids 3apH 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 0aSulfur dioxide (SO2) 0aFlue-gas desulphurization (FGD) 0aExhaust gas cleaning system (ECGS) 0aAbsorption column 0aWet-scrubbers 0aPacked tower 0aStructured packing1 aErto, A.1 aLancia, A.1 aDi Natale, F.0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106383-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005400188245011900242300001400361506007600375520104200451592002801493506003701521650000801558650001501566650001901581650001401600650002301614650001101637650001901648650000901667650001601676650002101692650002201713650001301735650002001748650002501768653001901793653002501812653002501837653002601862653002101888653001801909700002401927700002301951700002101974773011001995856008102105852000902186655001202195IND60529797920221207081125.0161020e20160505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052979792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.02.0072doi7 aPMC48181742pmcid7 a268726142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Lisi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5935-207310a17β-Estradiol alters oxidative damage and oxidative stress response protein expression in the mouse mammary gland  ap. 11-21.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough substantial evidence has demonstrated that parity and 17β-estradiol (E2) reduce mammary carcinogenesis, it is not clear how this protection is conferred. Thus, we examined the effects of parity and E2 treatment in the mammary glands of ovariectomized 15 week-old virgin mice, 15 week-old primiparous mice, and 9 month-old retired breeders. E2 treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and protein nitrosylation in the virgin mice, but not in the age-matched primiparous mice or retired breeders. Mammary gland expression of the oxidative stress response protein Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase was consistently reduced in all of the E2-treated mice regardless of parity. Expression of the oxidative stress and DNA repair protein apurinic endonuclease (Ape1) was significantly increased only in the mammary glands of the E2-treated retired breeders. These findings suggest that E2 and parity help to reduce mammary oncogenesis by maintaining the structure and function of proteins, lipids, and DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3acarcinogenesis 3aestradiol 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amammary glands 3amice 3aovariectomy 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 0a17β-estradiol 0aEstrogen receptor α 0aSuperoxide dismutase 0aApurinic endonuclease 0aOxidative stress 0aMammary gland1 aDietrich, Alicia K.1 aZiegler, Yvonne S.1 aNardulli, Ann M.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 May 05, v. 426 p.11-21dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009300166300001800259520038500277592002800662650002300690650002100713650002300734650002300757650001000780650001400790650002100804700002300825700002000848700002700868773010600895856008501001852000901086655001201095IND60578943920180316000000.0170815e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057894392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b019792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenny, Miles10aRegioswitchable Palladium-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Coupling of 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds  ap. 3926-3929.  aA palladium-catalyzed chemo- and regioselective coupling of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds via an allylic linker has been developed.

Although several PCR assays for HDV RNA have been described none of them incorporate an internal control or use a full-length RNA calibration standard for absolute quantitation. This study describes the development and evaluation of a novel single-step real-time RT-qPCR assay for HDV RNA quantitation which incorporates a Brome Mosaic virus internal control to prevent false negatives and under-reporting due to inhibitors or due to inefficient RNA purification, reverse transcription or PCR amplification. The assay has a dynamic range of ≥7log₁₀ and is designed to detect all HDV genotypes. The 95% detection limit is ∼3800 HDV RNA copies/ml, 700 copies/ml being detectable in 20% of repeats. Both intra-assay and inter-assay variability are low (CV 8% and 17%, respectively). Plasma HDV RNA was detected in 75% of 59 HDV antibody-positive samples with titres ranging from 8.4×10⁴ to 4.4×10⁸ copies/ml. The assay described provides a reliable and sensitive quantitative system for therapeutic monitoring and for studying the dynamic interplay between hepatitis B virus replication and HDV viral load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrome mosaic virus 3aHepatitis B virus 3aHepatitis delta virus 3aRNA 3adetection limit 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3aviral load 3avirus replication1 aNastouli, E.1 aGarson, J.A.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Jan., v. 179, no. 1 p.189-194dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013000158520150200288592002801790650001901818650000801837650002001845650001601865650002301881650001501904650002201919650000901941650001301950650002601963650001601989650002202005651001802027700001702045700001502062700002302077700002102100700002402121773012302145856007402268852000902342655001202351IND60754417420221119054039.0211023e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075441742DNAL7 a10.3390/v131018892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFay, Rachel L.10aExperimental Evolution of West Nile Virus at Higher Temperatures Facilitates Broad Adaptation and Increased Genetic Diversity  aWest Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus introduced to North America in 1999. Since 1999, the Earth’s average temperature has increased by 0.6 °C. Mosquitoes are ectothermic organisms, reliant on environmental heat sources. Temperature impacts vector–virus interactions which directly influence arbovirus transmission. RNA viral replication is highly error-prone and increasing temperature could further increase replication rates, mutation frequencies, and evolutionary rates. The impact of temperature on arbovirus evolutionary trajectories and fitness landscapes has yet to be sufficiently studied. To investigate how temperature impacts the rate and extent of WNV evolution in mosquito cells, WNV was experimentally passaged 12 times in Culex tarsalis cells, at 25 °C and 30 °C. Full-genome deep sequencing was used to compare genetic signatures during passage, and replicative fitness was evaluated before and after passage at each temperature. Our results suggest adaptive potential at both temperatures, with unique temperature-dependent and lineage-specific genetic signatures. Further, higher temperature passage was associated with significantly increased replicative fitness at both temperatures and increases in nonsynonymous mutations. Together, these data indicate that if similar selective pressures exist in natural systems, increases in temperature could accelerate emergence of high-fitness strains with greater phenotypic plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex tarsalis 3aRNA 3aWest Nile virus 3aarboviruses 3adirected evolution 3aectothermy 3agenetic variation 3aheat 3amutation 3aphenotypic plasticity 3atemperature 3avirus replication 3aNorth America1 aNgo, Kiet A.1 aKuo, Lili 1 aWillsey, Graham G.1 aKramer, Laura D.1 aCiota, Alexander T.0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131018893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007600172300001600248520136600264592002801630650002701658650000901685650001801694650001401712650001201726650001701738650001201755650001301767650000901780650001001789650001101799650001001810700002101820700002201841773010501863856008201968852000902050655001202059IND60549012620221121061540.0160906e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901262DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-15-0269-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunulf Åberg, Anna10aRisk of False Positives during Sampling for Heterobasidion annosum s.l.  ap. 175-179.  aA standard method to detect infection by Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato (s.l.) in stumps or stems is to cut a disc and examine it under a microscope. Concerns have been raised that spores can be transferred from the bark to the cut surface, thus contaminating the sample. The aims of this study were to test whether viable basidiospores of H. annosum s.l. can be transferred from the bark onto disc surfaces by a chainsaw and to investigate the impacts of different sampling procedures on the extent of contaminations. Logs were cut with or without adding basidiospores to the bark prior to the cut. Infection measurements were significantly greater for discs with treated bark (100% infected, infection coverage 40 cm² dm⁻² of disc area) compared with control discs (47% infected, infection coverage 0.2 to 0.3 cm² dm⁻²). In addition, trees were sampled under authentic field conditions using different procedures. The infection measurements differed significantly depending on the procedure; sampling involving debarking or disinfection of the bark with 70% ethanol prior to cutting had lower measurements (6 to 19% and 13% infected, respectively) compared with leaving the bark on untreated (63 to 75% infected). Consideration of the contamination risk is warranted when evaluating the results of earlier studies and when planning new experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3abark 3abasidiospores 3achainsaws 3acutting 3adisinfection 3aethanol 3aplanning 3arisk 3astems 3astumps 3atrees1 aWitzell, Johanna1 aRönnberg, Jonas,0 tPlant disease.g2016 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.175-179dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-15-0269-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012200161300001600283520098400299592002801283650001501311650001501326650000901341650001201350650002201362650002101384650001801405650001101423650001901434651001501453651003501468700002301503773010501526856004001631852000901671655001201680IND50069005020221123004436.0130904e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006900502DNAL7 a10.1111/een.120312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSPITZER, BRIAN W.10aEffects of tree mortality caused by a bark beetle outbreak on the ant community in the San Bernardino National Forest  ap. 439-447.  aA severe bark beetle outbreak caused very high levels of tree mortality in the San Bernardino National Forest in southern California in 2003. In 2009, the impact of the outbreak on the ant community was examined by pitfall‐trapping ants in 15 sites that saw high tree mortality (‘red’ sites) and 15 sites that suffered little or no tree mortality (‘green’ sites) during the outbreak. Ant species turnover between green and red sites was low, and no invasive species were observed. However, changes in the abundances of various species resulted in a significant alteration of the ant community. If the ant community is an accurate bioindicator of other taxa in this forest, the effects of the bark beetle outbreak may be described as dramatic but not catastrophic or irreversible. The changes in the ant community are consistent with the hypothesis that this community is structured by nest site limitation rather than inter‐specific competition or thermal limitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aFormicidae 3abark 3aforests 3aindicator species 3ainvasive species 3anesting sites 3asawing 3atree mortality 3aCalifornia 3aSan Bernardino National Forest1 aWILD, ALEXANDER L.0 tEcological entomology.g2013 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.439-447dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12031  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011500169300001800284520167000302592002801972650001502000650001602015650001602031650002002047650001602067650001102083650002302094650002202117650001602139653000802155653000802163653000902171653000802180653000902188653000702197653000802204653000702212653000902219653000702228653000902235653000802244653000802252653001002260653001102270653000702281653002102288653001602309653003402325653001002359653002302369653001102392700001902403700002002422700001802442773012102460856008502581852000902666655001202675IND60536070620221121231819.0190215e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053607062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGötze, Jan P.10aVibrational relaxation as the driving force for wavelength conversion in the peridinin–chlorophyll a-protein  ap. 1509-1517.  aWe present a computationally derived energy transfer model for the peridinin–chlorophyll a-protein (PCP), which invokes vibrational relaxation in the two lowest singlet excited states rather than internal conversion between them. The model allows an understanding of the photoinduced processes without assuming further electronic states or a dependence of the 2Ag state character on the vibrational sub-state. We report molecular dynamics simulations (CHARMM22 force field) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on PCP. In the latter, the QM region containing a single peridinin (Per) chromophore or a Per-Chl a (chlorophyll a) pair is treated by density functional theory (DFT, CAM-B3LYP) for geometries and by DFT-based multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) for excitation energies.The calculations show that Per has a bright, green light absorbing 2Ag state, in addition to the blue light absorbing 1Bu state found in other carotenoids. Both states undergo a strong energy lowering upon relaxation, leading to emission in the red, while absorbing in the blue or green. The orientation of their transition dipole moments indicates that both states are capable of excited-state energy transfer to Chl a, without preference for either 1Bu or 2Ag as donor state. We propose that the commonly postulated partial intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character of a donating Per state can be assigned to the relaxed 1Bu state, which takes on ICT character. By assuming that both 1Bu and 2Ag are able to donate to the Chl a Q band, one can explain why different chlorophyll species in PCP exhibit different acceptor capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3agreen light 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aquantum mechanics 3awavelengths 0aBLA 0aChl 0aCPCM 0aEET 0aHOMO 0aIC 0aICT 0aLE 0aLUMO 0aMD 0aMRCI 0aPCP 0aPer 0aQM/MM 0aTD-DFT 0aVR 0aLight harvesting 0aCarotenoids 0aExcited-state energy transfer 0aQM/MM 0aDensity functional 0aTheory1 aKarasulu, Bora1 aPatil, Mahendra1 aThiel, Walter0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Dec., v. 1847, no. 12 p.1509-1517dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04242naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010900174300001800283520216200301592002802463596006102491596007702552596009902629650002002728650002002748650001002768650002002778650001802798650001102816650002202827650001502849650003102864650001802895650001402913650001402927650002002941650002502961650001302986650000902999650001503008650002203023650001703045651001003062653004003072653002803112653001303140653001203153653002603165653003603191700002203227700002403249700002303273700006103296700005803357773011003415856008203525852000903607655001203616IND60677656220221116232417.0191202e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765622DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-05-19-0173-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe la Lastra, Eduardo10aGenetic Diversity and Vegetative Compatibility of Fusarium solani Species Complex of Strawberry in Spain  ap. 2142-2151.  aFusarium solani is a soilborne fungus that is a pathogen to >100 plant species. It is the causal agent of crown and root rot in strawberry. We collected 100 F. solani isolates from diseased plants and soils from two distinct geographic areas of strawberry production in Spain: plant nurseries located in the north-central region of the country and fruit production fields located in the southwestern region. The aims of this study were to accurately identify the isolates within the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) based on multilocus sequence typing, determine the genetic diversity and population structure of strawberry-associated FSSC based on phylogenetic analysis, and determine the vegetative compatibility among isolates in both strawberry production areas. Seven phylogenetic species, restricted to clade 3 of FSSC, were defined in the Spanish strawberry crops, showing a regional variation of species composition. Isolates from nurseries were composed of four phylogenetic species (i.e., FSSC 2, FSSC 5, FSSC 9, and an unknown FSSC species) that matched with five vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). Isolates from fruit production fields included five phylogenetic species (i.e., FSSC 2, FSSC 3 + 4, FSSC 5, FSSC 6, and FSSC 11) distributed into 29 VCGs not correlated with phylogenetic groups. FSSC 5 and FSSC 2 were the most abundant species in nurseries and fruit production fields, respectively, and they were the only species present in both production areas. Of the 47 sequence-based haplotypes defined, no haplotypes were shared between nurseries and fruit production fields. Pathogenic isolates were present in all but FSSC 6 and FSSC 9 species, and FSSC 3 + 4 contained the higher percentage of pathogenic isolates. No relationship was observed between pathogenicity and the source of isolates (plant or soil). Generally, species present in fruit production fields showed higher genetic diversity than those present in nurseries. This work can contribute to understanding the diversity of this species complex in Spanish strawberry production areas, which will be useful for developing integrated disease management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aRTA2013-00062-C05-02cEuropean Regional Development Fund  cInstituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria  aRTA2013-00062-C05-01cInstituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria 3aFusarium solani 3acrop production 3acrops 3adisease control 3afruit growing 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplant nurseries 3apopulation structure 3aroot rot 3asoil 3asoil fungi 3aspecies diversity 3astrawberries 3aSpain 0aFusarium multilocus sequence typing 0afruit production fields 0amycology 0anursery 0aphylogenetic analysis 0avegetative compatibility groups1 aVillarino, María1 aAstacio, Juan Diego1 aLarena, Inmaculada1 aDe Cal, Antonieta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7725-77821 aCapote, Nieves1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1819-24450 tPhytopathology.g2019 Dec., v. 109, no. 12 p.2142-2151dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-05-19-0173-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011400169300001600283520183700299592002802136650001502164650001302179650001902192650002002211650002402231650001902255650001702274650002102291650002202312650001302334650001802347650001202365650002702377650001402404653003002418653001802448653003102466653000902497653001402506653002902520653002402549653002502573653002202598653002202620700001902642700001802661700001802679700002102697700001902718700002202737773012802759856008502887852000902972655001202981IND60125486320221121141926.0151104e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012548632DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-117.2.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlin, Eric F.10aInvisible in plain sight: recurrent double allopolyploidy in the African Sphagnum ×planifolium (Sphagnaceae)  ap. 187-201.  aMicrosatellites, nucleotide sequences, and flow cytometry were used to determine if two sympatricAfrican peat mosses (Sphagnum ×planifolium and S. ×slooveri) had a history of inter-subgeneric hybridization and to assess their phylogenetic relationship. Both species had previously not been considered to be hybrids. Sphagnum ×slooveri was found to be gametophytically allodiploid. Its maternal parent was S. recurvum (or a closely related species) of subg. Cuspidata and its paternal parent was an unidentified species from the S. africanum complex of subg. Subsecunda. Sphagnum ×planifolium was found to be a cryptic species complex of gametophytic allotriploids, with recurrent double allopolyploidy resulting in at least two evolutionarily distinct lineages. The maternal parent of both lineages was S. ×slooveri. The paternal parent of one lineage (S. ×planifolium I) was an unidentified haploid associated with the S. capense complex of subgenus Subsecunda while the paternal parent of the second lineage (S. ×planifolium II) was S. cuspidatum (or a closely related species) of subg. Cuspidata. Four species having a history of double allopolyploidy are now documented in bryophytes; all are gametophytically allotriploid, all are in Sphagnum, and all had an allodiploid parent having a history of inter-subgeneric hybridization. It is postulated that a high genetic divergence between subgenomes may facilitate double allopolyploidy in Sphagnum. Genetic analyses reveal that S. pulchricoma, S. recurvum and S. sancto-josephense form a complex of non-hybrid and hybrid plants in the Neotropics, with the hybrids having a history of hybridization between S. cuspidatum and S. recurvum. Reticulate evolution needs more attention in bryophyte studies and this requires experimental designs sufficiently robust to detect it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aSphagnum 3aallopolyploidy 3acryptic species 3aexperimental design 3aflow cytometry 3agametophytes 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3ahaploidy 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 0aAllotriploid gametophytes 0ahybridization 0ainterploidal hybridization 0amoss 0aphylogeny 0arecurrent allopolyploidy 0aSphagnum cuspidatum 0aSphagnum planifolium 0aSphagnum recurvum 0aSphagnum slooveri1 aTemsch, Eva M.1 aBizuru, Elias1 aMarino, James1 aBoles, Sandra B.1 aDevos, Nicolas1 aShaw, A.

This cell design enables in situ XAS investigations of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at high operating current densities greater than 1 mA in an oxygen-purged environment. When the cell was used to study the ORR for a Pt on carbon electrocatalyst, the data revealed a progressive evolution of the electronic structure of the metal clusters that is both potential-dependent and strongly current-dependent.

However, GB can attenuate nucleic acid secondary structure stability, although its mechanism of destabilization is not currently understood. Here we quantify GB interactions with the surface area exposed during thermal denaturation of nine RNA dodecamer duplexes with guanine–cytosine (GC) contents of 17–100%. Hyperchromicity values indicate increasing GB molality attenuates stacking. GB destabilizes higher-GC-content RNA duplexes to a greater extent than it does low-GC-content duplexes due to greater accumulation at the surface area exposed during unfolding. The accumulation is very sensitive to temperature and displays characteristic entropy–enthalpy compensation. Since the entropic contribution to the m-value (used to quantify GB interaction with the RNA solvent-accessible surface area exposed during denaturation) is more dependent on temperature than is the enthalpic contribution, higher-GC-content duplexes with their larger transition temperatures are destabilized to a greater extent than low-GC-content duplexes. The concentration of GB at the RNA surface area exposed during unfolding relative to bulk was quantified using the solute-partitioning model. Temperature correction predicts a GB concentration at 25 °C to be nearly independent of GC content, indicating that GB destabilizes all sequences equally at this temperature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3abetaine 3acarbon 3adenaturation 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aprotein unfolding 3asurface area 3asurface interactions 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aMenssen, Ryan J.1 aKohler, James M.1 aSchmidt, Elliot

HEV-infected female BALB/c mice were coupled with healthy male BALB/c mice at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 91 dpi to explore the uterine injury caused by HEV infection. Mice were euthanized after 10 days of copulation, and uteruses were collected for HEV RNA and antigen detection and histopathological analysis. Inflammatory responses; apoptosis; and estrogen receptor ɑ (ER-ɑ), endomethal antibody (ERAb), cytokeratin-7 (CK7), vimentin (VIM), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels were evaluated. After 10 days of copulation, miscarriage and nonpregnancy, as well as enlarged uteruses filled with inflammatory cytokines, were found in HEV-infected mice. HEV RNA and antigens were detected in the sera and uteruses of HEV-infected mice. Significant endometrial thickness (EMT) thinning, severe inflammatory responses, and aggravated apoptosis in the uteruses of HEV-infected mice that experienced miscarriage might contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, significantly suppressed ER-ɑ expression and increased ERAb, CK7, VIM, and VEGF expression levels were found in the uteruses of HEV-infected mice that had miscarried. However, uterine damage recovered after complete HEV clearance, and impaired fertility was improved. EMT injury, severe inflammatory responses, and aggravated apoptosis in the uterus caused by HEV infection are responsible for poor pregnancy outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aRNA 3aabortion (animals) 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aapoptosis 3acopulation 3acytokines 3aendometrium 3aestrogen receptors 3afemales 3agenotype 3ahepatitis E 3ahistopathology 3amales 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3avimentin1 aChen, Shuangfeng 1 aMickael, Houfack K.1 aXu, Liangheng 1 aXia, Yueping 1 aCong, Chao 1 aZhang, Yike 1 aQian, Zhongyao 1 aLi, Tengyuan 1 aWei, Daqiao 1 aYu, Wenhai 1 aHuang, Fen 0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131019503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245010600169520140300275592002801678650001601706650002001722650001101742650001701753650001501770650002101785650001401806650001601820700002001836700002401856700001901880773012101899856007902020852000902099655001202108IND60787861720221120142057.0220811e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786172DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111519462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartucca, Maria Luce10aUse of Biostimulants as a New Approach for the Improvement of Phytoremediation Performance—A Review  aEnvironmental pollution is one of the most pressing global issues, and it requires priority attention. Environmental remediation techniques have been developed over the years and can be applied to polluted sites, but they can have limited effectiveness and high energy consumption and costs. Bioremediation techniques, on the other hand, represent a promising alternative. Among them, phytoremediation is attracting particular attention, a green methodology that relies on the use of plant species to remediate contaminated sites or prevent the dispersion of xenobiotics into the environment. In this review, after a brief introduction focused on pollution and phytoremediation, the use of plant biostimulants (PBs) in the improvement of the remediation effectiveness is proposed. PBs are substances widely used in agriculture to raise crop production and resistance to various types of stress. Recent studies have also documented their ability to counteract the deleterious effects of pollutants on plants, thus increasing the phytoremediation efficiency of some species. The works published to date, reviewed and discussed in the present work, reveal promising prospects in the remediation of polluted environments, especially for heavy metals, when PBs derived from humic substances, protein and amino acid hydrolysate, inorganic salts, microbes, seaweed, plant extracts, and fungi are employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acrop production 3aenergy 3ahydrolysates 3amacroalgae 3aphytoremediation 3apollution 3axenobiotics1 aCerri, Martina 1 aDel Buono, Daniele 1 aForni, Cinzia 0 tPlants.g2022 July 27, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111519463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011300167300001600280520094500296592002801241650001201269650001201281650003001293650001201323650001301335651001101348651001801359653001101377653001701388653001501405653002001420700002301440773012801463856008501591852000901676655001201685IND60125486420221121141932.0151104e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012548642DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-117.3.2232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, Jason10aMicarea micrococca and M. prasina, the first assessment of two very similar species in eastern North America  ap. 223-231.  aMicarea micrococca and M. prasina are two morphologically similar crustose lichens that have been reported from North America. We present the results of the first large scale study of these species, and the first study of them outside of Europe. We examined over 200 specimens referable to these species from eastern North America to determine whether differences in morphology, ecology, or geographic distribution correlated with the differences in chemistry that distinguish the two species. Differences in morphology and ecology were not detected, but geographic distribution was found to be strongly correlated with chemistry. Nonetheless both species are entirely sympatric in the study area. Though overlapping, goniocyst size also appears to correlate with chemistry, a character that has not previously been explored in studies of this group. Treatments for both species are presented, including illustrations and distribution maps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicarea 3aecology 3ageographical distribution 3alichens 3asympatry 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aLichen 0abiogeography 0agoniocysts 0apine-oak forest1 aLendemer, James C.0 tBryologist.g2014 July, v. 117, no. 3 p.223-231dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Inc.x0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745-117.3.2233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011400169300001600283520262200299592002802921650002202949650001202971650002102983650002603004650002603030650002503056650001003081650001403091650001303105650002303118650001503141650001303156650001803169650001403187650002303201650001803224651002103242700002103263700001803284700002103302700001503323700001803338700001803356700002003374700002203394773009503416856008403511852000903595655001203604IND60085223320221116200840.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008522332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Jongseong10aEnvironmentally associated spatial changes of a macrozoobenthic community in the Saemangeum tidal flat, Korea  ap. 390-400.  aEstuarine tidal flats are both ecologically and economically important, hence developing methods to reliably measure ecosystem health is essential. Because benthic fauna play a central role in the food web of tidal flats, in this study we set out to quantitatively describe the intertidal zonation of macro-invertebrates and their associations with specific environmental parameters along three transects in the Saemangeum tidal flat, Korea. The abundance and biomass of intertidal fauna with respect to five environmental parameters (i.e., shore level, mud content, coarse sand content, water content, and organic content) were measured, to identify environmental factors that influence macrofaunal distribution in intertidal soft bottom habitats. A total of 75 species were identified, with dominant species showing distinct zones of distribution along all transects. The number of species recorded in each transect was found to be dependent on sediment characteristics and salinity. Cluster analysis classified the entire study area into three faunal assemblages (i.e., location groups), which were delineated by characteristic species, including (A) ‘Periserrula–Macrophthalmus’, (B) ‘Umbonium–Meretrix’, and (C) ‘Prionospio–Potamocorbula’. Four environmental variables (i.e., shore level, water content, mud content, and organic content) appeared to determine factors that distinguished the three faunal assemblages, based on the discriminant analysis. The faunal assemblage types of the sampled locations were accurately predicted from environmental variables in two discriminant functions, with a prediction accuracy of 98%. It should be noted that the zonation of benthos in the lower section (C) of Sandong had been affected by the construction of a nearby dike, while this parameter had remained essentially unchanged at the other two location groups (A–B). Overall, the zonation of benthos from the Saemangeum tidal flat was explained adequately by the measured environmental variables, implying that faunal assemblages are closely associated with certain combinations of abiotic factors. The identification of such reliable associations may facilitate the development of statistical models to predict faunal distributions based on environmental variables at both local and regional scales. The entire study area was embanked in 2006 (one year after this study), and an integrated plan was set into force to develop claimed land into industrial, residential and agricultural districts, which also included a partial restoration program of the tidal flats located near to the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental health 3afauna 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asand fraction 3asediments 3astatistical models 3awater content 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKhim, Jong Seong1 aChoi, Jin-Woo1 aShin, Hyun Chool1 aAn, Soonmo1 aPark, Jinsoon1 aKang, Daeseok1 aLee, Chang Hee,1 aKo, Chʻŏr-hwan,0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 May, v. 65, no. 4 p.390-400dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01648naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245004400213300001600257506007600273520056200349592002800911506003700939650001100976650004200987650001101029650001301040650002501053700002101078700002401099773008201123856008401205852000901289655001201298IND60553990520221207115713.0161023e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055399052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.05.0042doi7 aPMC44947492pmcid7 a260008442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuter, Jason A.10aHigh-Throughput Sequencing Technologies  ap. 586-597.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe human genome sequence has profoundly altered our understanding of biology, human diversity, and disease.

Three bSOS samples with Mₙ,ₜₒₜₐₗ = 11.7–23.9 kg/mol were doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) with r = [Li⁺]/[EO units] = 0.09. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses reveal that these samples with fO/ₛₐₗₜ = 0.55–0.60 self-assemble into lamellar morphologies, with ionic conductivities as high as σ = 0.19 mS/cm at 90 °C measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The ionic conductivities of LiTFSI-doped bSOS are comparable to those of salt-doped, narrow dispersity nSOS triblocks with Mₙ ≳ 20 kg/mol, and they are 2–3 times greater than those of the narrow dispersity nSO diblock control samples. These findings are rationalized in terms of decreases in the lamellar grain sizes induced by molecular architecture and segment dispersity, which enhance intergrain connectivity and ion transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3adielectric spectroscopy 3alithium 3apolystyrenes 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aMahanthappa, Mahesh K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9871-804X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 54, no. 18 p.8798-8809dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c011003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006600162300001600228520086600244592002801110650002901138650001401167650001401181650002801195700002501223700001701248773012901265856007501394852000901469655001201478IND60538478720171213000000.0171213e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053847872DNAL7 a10.1021/ja210600k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespo, Gastón
A.10aElectrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Potentiometric Sensors  ap. 205-207.  aWe report here on a generic approach to read out potentiometric sensors with electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). In a first example, a potassium ion-selective electrode acts as the reference electrode and is placed in contact with the sample solution. The working electrode of the three-electrode cell is responsible for ECL generation and placed in a detection solution containing tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)₃²⁺] and the coreactant 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE), physically separated from the sample by a bridge. Changes in the sample potassium concentration directly modulate the potential at the working electrode, and hence the ECL output, when a constant-potential pulse is applied between the two electrodes. A linear response of the ECL intensity to the logarithmic potassium concentration between 10 μm and 10 mM was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3apotassium 3aruthenium 3aspecific ion electrodes1 aMistlberger, Günter1 aBakker, Eric0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Jan. 11, v. 134, no. 1 p.205-207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja210600k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245015600164300001600320520151000336592002801846650002001874650001501894650002501909650001101934650001901945650002601964650003201990650001302022650001602035650003302051650001902084650001602103650001202119650001502131650003702146650001902183653002702202653002602229653000902255653002102264700001602285700001602301773012802317856008502445852000902530655001202539IND60125486520221121144527.0151104e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012548652DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-117.3.2322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jihong10aMicro-morphology, ultrastructure and chemical composition changes of Bryum argenteum from a desert biological soil crust following one-year desiccation  ap. 232-240.  aBiological soil crusts dominated by mosses are commonly found in arid and semiarid areas, where mosses spend large parts of their time in a state of intense desiccation. The effective recovery of moss crusts after long-term desiccation is vital for their survival. In this study, we analyzed the changes in micromorphology, ultrastructure and chemical composition in Bryum argenteum samples desiccated for 1 week or 1 year. We used non-destructive and anhydrous methods of analysis, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared analysis. After long-term desiccation (1 year), B. argenteum samples showed a rapid recovery of FV/FM in the light after rehydration. For the 1-year desiccated samples, the thallus remained intact but shrunken. Within the thallus, cell arrangement was disorderly, cell shapes were irregular, and cell walls were thinner. Inside cells, chloroplasts remained intact, but some thylakoids were degraded. In terms of the major cellular components, the lipid and carbohydrate contents increased, the numbers of α helixes and β sheets in protein secondary structures increased, while the number of turn structures in proteins decreased. The changes in protein secondary structure appear to be an important factor in the tolerance of B. argenteum to long-term desiccation. The recovery mechanisms that function after rehydration include processes for the repair of protein conformation and the re-synthesis of thylakoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryum argenteum 3acell walls 3achemical composition 3alipids 3amicrostructure 3amosses and liverworts 3aprotein secondary structure 3aproteins 3arehydration 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiarid zones 3asoil crusts 3athallus 3athylakoids 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aBiological soil crusts 0adesiccation tolerance 0aFTIR 0amicro-morphology1 aLi, Xinrong1 aZhang, Peng0 tBryologist.g2014 July, v. 117, no. 3 p.232-240dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Inc.x0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745-117.3.2323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245014300174300001400317520173100331592002802062650001802090650001702108650002602125650001502151650001602166650001602182650001202198650001102210650001902221650001102240700002302251773010302274856005502377852000902432655001202441IND4476409820221119184332.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447640982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01339.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDERSSON, PETTER10aWhat shapes local density?

The relative effect of migration and local growth on the spatio‐temporal density‐distribution of two co‐existing herbivorous weevils, Cionus scrophulariae L. and C. tuberculosus Scop., in 32 host plant Scrophularia nodosa L. patches of varying sizes was investigated. 2. Predictions of the temporal development of the slope in the density‐patch size relationships were derived from a basic population model with scale‐dependent migration rates. The model indicated that the slopes in the density‐patch size relationships during the early season should be reflected by the net scaling of immigration and emigration rates, whereas the slopes during the later season should increase as a result of local growth. 3. Emigration rates of the weevils were estimated in a field experiment, were the weevils coexisted in space and time. These results were then combined with a previous estimate of immigration rates in order to determine the net scaling of migration rates. 4. The emigration rate differed between species, caused by different movement rates in small patches, which could explain differences in the general slope of the density‐patch size relationships of the weevils in the natural figwort patches throughout the summer. The slopes in the relationships in the early season were largely predicted by the net scaling of migration rates. The slope also increased in the later season for C. tuberculosus, whereas the slope decreased for C. scrophulariae. 5. It was concluded that the understanding of both inter‐ and intra‐specific variations in density‐patch size relationships of insect herbivores can be improved using population models incorporating scale‐dependent migration and local growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aScrophularia 3afield experimentation 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3aimmigration 3ainsects 3amodels 3aspace and time 3asummer1 aHAMBÄCK, PETER A.0 tEcological entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.90-98dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01339.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008900171300001600260520206600276592002802342650001502370650001202385650001402397650002102411650001302432650001202445650002602457650001302483650002202496650001502518650002402533650001002557650001102567650001302578650002002591650001302611650001902624650001602643650001102659650000902670650001002679650001302689650000902702651001102711651001402722651001002736651001602746651001802762651001302780651001902793700002302812700001802835773008602853856008102939852000903020655001203029IND60477629420221118230609.0160405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12231-015-9325-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Frances E.

While displays of decorative dried plant material are popular in homes in Europe and North America, knowledge regarding potpourri ingredients is limited. This study examined the identity, diversity, origin, economic sources, and sustainability of such ingredients used in the United Kingdom (UK). Research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, commencing in 1990 and involving 1,000 samples of individual potpourri ingredients from 12 UK manufacturers and traders, revealed 546 different ingredients, representing up to 455 species, 289 genera, and over 100 families. Despite the wide taxonomic spread, several distinct plant part–family groups contributed the most potpourri ingredients: i.e., fruits from Arecaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Pinaceae, Poaceae, and Rutaceae; seeds from Fabaceae; leaves from Arecaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae; inflorescences from Asteraceae; as well as stems from cane, pith, timber, and pole wood. The vast majority of ingredients imported from Asia, especially India, were byproducts from crops and wild harvested species used by the Indian herbal healthcare industry. Global conservation assessments are lacking for 80% of wild collected Indian potpourri species, and those that have assessments are mainly abundant and widespread in ruderal or wetland habitats and of Least Concern (IUCN 2013), except Pterocarpus marsupium and P. indicus (Fabaceae), which are vulnerable globally, and Calamus andamanicus (Arecaceae) and Oroxylum indicum (Bignoniaceae), which are vulnerable nationally within India. A further eight, primarily medicinally traded species, are regarded as threatened within individual Indian states. Additional unique potpourri ingredients were sourced from Thailand, but only about one-tenth of study samples were from Africa, Middle East, Europe, America, and Australia. Temporal studies of potpourri ingredients could reflect changes in the use and abundance of species in other trades such as medicines, food, and materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCalamus 3aMalvaceae 3aOroxylum indicum 3aPinaceae 3aPoaceae 3aPterocarpus marsupium 3aRutaceae 3abotanical gardens 3abyproducts 3aconservation status 3acrops 3afruits 3ahabitats 3ahealth services 3aindustry 3ainflorescences 3aingredients 3aleaves 3apith 3aseeds 3awetlands 3awood 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aIndia 3aMiddle East 3aNorth America 3aThailand 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLeon, Christine J.1 aNesbitt, Mark0 tEconomic botany.g2015 Dec., v. 69, no. 4 p.330-344dSpringer USx0013-00017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12231-015-9325-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245016300135300001400298500001900312520083600331592002801167650002001195650002901215650001401244650001601258650001601274650001201290653000901302653001501311653002001326653002301346700001401369700002001383700001601403700001701419700001701436773014501453852000901598655001201607IND60716699020221120210133.0201107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Anuj Pratap10aTreatment of spinal cord injuries in dogs with oral Gabapentin and Methylcobalamin: a comparison of functional recovery in ambulatory and non-ambulatory cases  ap. 86-90.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSpinal cord injury may cause a range of neurological deficits ranging from minor ataxia to complete paralysis. In the present study Gabapentin and Methylcobalamin were compared for treatment of spinal cord injury in 26 dogs. The dogs were grouped as ambulatory (n=5) and non-ambulatory (n=21) cases on the basis of diagnosis based on history, physical and haematological examination, complete neurological examination and radiographic evaluation. The results showed that the treatment with oral Gabapentin and Methylcobalmin helped in functional recovery of spinal cord injury in dogs; however ambulatory dogs had faster and complete recovery while non-ambulatory dogs showed only slight recovery. It was concluded that the combination of grbapentin and methylcobalamin may be helpful in management of spinal cord injuries in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aneurological examination 3aparalysis 3aradiography 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 0aDogs 0aGabapentin 0aMethylcobalamin 0aSpinal cord injury1 a, Amarpal1 aKinjavdekar, P.1 aPawde, A.M.1 aKumar, Rohit1 aSaxena, A.C.0 tIndian journal of veterinary surgery.g2017 Dec., v. 38, no. 2 p.86-90dIndian Society for Veterinary SurgerywJournal:2007x0973-97267nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245008600210300001800296520115700314592002801471650002201499650001101521650002001532650000901552650002301561650001701584650001901601650001601620700006401636773012101700856008401821852000901905655001201914IND60752072720221117185253.0210929e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075207272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c011452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYagasaki, Takuma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4969-471510aCrystallization of Polyethylene Brushes and Its Effect on Interactions with Water  ap. 8303-8313.  aThe crystallization process of brushes of polyethylene chains is investigated using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at degrees of polymerization of 40 and 120. Through temperature reduction in nanosecond time scales, spontaneous crystallization is observed for polymer chains that are grafted on gold crystals and are in contact with vacuum on the other side. Crystalline nuclei form in the middle region of the brushes separated by nanometers from the gold and vacuum interfaces. The crystallization actually begins when the density of carbon atoms exceeds a threshold value. Increases in the grafting density and/or the degree of polymerization result in an increase in the density of carbon atoms in the middle region of the brush and thus leads to an elevation in the crystallization temperature. The free energy of inserting a water molecule into the brush is also analyzed. It is found to be more unfavorable in the crystalline brush than in the fluid state. This is due to the high density of the crystalline state, and in locally disordered regions in the crystalline brush, the insertion free energy is comparable to that in the fluid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acarbon 3acrystallization 3agold 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3atemperature1 aMatubayasi, Nobuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7176-441X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 54, no. 18 p.8303-8313dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c011453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015400168520146500322592002801787650001601815650001401831650001601845650001501861650002801876650000901904650001901913650001101932650001101943650002501954653001201979653001901991653001602010653002202026653000802048700001902056700001602075700001202091700001802103700005702121700001402178700001902192700001702211773011402228856008602342852000902428655001202437IND60720008620221122053531.0211123e20210405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072000862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunquan10aClinoptilolite mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate through spherical dispersion and oriented array of NiFe2O4: Upgrading synergy and performance  aInspired by the features of both transition metal oxide and natural clinoptilolite (flaky structure with suitable pore diameter and open skeleton structure), we adopted a robust strategy by immobilization of nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe₂O₄) on the clinoptilolite surface via typical citric acid combustion method. The hybrid catalyst exhibited enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency and bisphenol A (BPA) degradation performance. Calculated by effective equivalent of NiFe₂O₄, it is found that the reaction rate constant (k) of NiFe₂O₄/clinoptilolite/PMS system (0.1859 min⁻¹) was 11.9 times higher than that of bare NiFe₂O₄/PMS system (0.0156 min⁻¹), which demonstrated that catalyst would be conjugated to PMS or contaminant efficiently and renders the rapid degradation and mineralization in the presence of clinoptilolite. After comprehensive characterization analysis and DFT simulations, natural mineral carrier effect (i.e. decreased crystalline size, increased oxygen vacancy content, etc.), abundant surface-bonded and structural hydroxyl groups as well as effective bonding with iron or nickel ions charged for the potential activation mechanism of PMS by NiFe₂O₄/clinoptilolite composite. And it is indicated that not only •OH and SO₄•⁻, but also ¹O₂ was involved into series reactions. Overall, this study put forward a green and promising technology for high-toxic wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3acitric acid 3acombustion 3aferrimagnetic materials 3airon 3amineralization 3anickel 3aoxygen 3awastewater treatment 0aNiFe2O4 0aClinoptilolite 0aBisphenol A 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aDFT1 aYang, Shanshan1 aBian, Runze1 aTan, Ye1 aDong, Xiongbo1 aZhu, Ningyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3767-35781 aHe, Xuwen1 aZheng, Shuilin1 aSun, Zhiming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 407 p.124736-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245017600172300001600348520096300364592002801327650001301355650001301368650001701381650001701398650001301415650001301428650001201441650001901453650001601472651003201488651001801520653001601538653001701554653002501571653002701596653001401623653002201637653002901659653002401688700001901712700001701731773012801748856008501876852000901961655001201970IND60125486820221121082522.0151104e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012548682DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-117.3.2592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLendemer, James C.12aA review of Rinodina (Physciaceae) in Great Smoky Mountains National Park highlights the growing significance of this “island of biodiversity” in eastern North America  ap. 259-281.  aA review of the crustose lichen genus Rinodina in Great Smoky Mountains National Park is presented. Seventeen species are reported from the study area, of which three represent new reports (R. bullata, R. excrescens, and R. oxydata) and one is described as new to science (R. brodoana). Based on current collections, the new species is restricted to old growth hardwoods and occurs at middle to low elevations. Also based on collections information, two species (R. brodoana and R. chrysomelaena) are proposed to have IUCN Red List ranks of critically endangered. We discuss the increasing significance of middle to low elevation habitats in this biodiversity hotspot. All 17 species reported from the study are illustrated, their biogeographic patterns and ecologies are discussed, and maps showing revised North American distributions, are provided. A key to the 21 species of Rinodina known to occur in the southern Appalachian Mountains is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRinodina 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3alichens 3anational parks 3anew species 3aGreat Smoky Mountain region 3aNorth America 0aAppalachian 0abiogeography 0abiodiversity hotspot 0abiodiversity reservoir 0adiaspores 0aold growth forest 0aelevational distribution 0aconservation status1 aTripp, Erin A.1 aSheard, John0 tBryologist.g2014 July, v. 117, no. 3 p.259-281dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Inc.x0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745-117.3.2593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001600281520195200297592002802249650003002277650001102307650001402318650001302332650001302345650003202358650001702390650001502407650001202422650002602434650002602460650002502486650002302511650001402534650001302548650001302561651001402574653001602588653002302604653002502627653001402652653001902666700002702685700002302712700002402735700002202759700002102781773010902802856008202911852000902993655001203002IND60621862820221118190553.0181121e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186282DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826507028002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Pee, Saskia,10aHome Fortification in Emergency Response and Transition Programming: Experiences in Aceh and Nias, Indonesia  ap. 189-197.  aImproving the nutritional status of an emergency-affected population is essential, because undernutrition increases infection risk and is linked to more than 50% of childhood deaths in developing coun- tries. Emergency food aid addresses nutritional needs, including micronutrient deficiencies, but is provided only for a limited time and uses few items, so the needs of specific target groups are often not fully met. To describe the post-tsunami experience with distribution of Vitalita Sprinkles in Aceh and Nias and to analyze the monitoring data gathered for the emergency response. International agencies such as Helen Keller International and partners provided micronutrients in response to the tsunami emergency in Aceh and Nias and to analyze the monitoring data gathered for the emergency response. In March and April 2006, the percentage of children aged 6 months to 59 months who had consumed Vitalita in the previous month was more than 70% in 5 of 11 districts evaluated, 40% to 70% in another five districts, and 32% in one district. An independent survey found 25% less anemia among recipients. Almost all mothers interviewed during March to April 2006 (96.3%) had heard about Vitalita and recognized its packaging, 69% said that Vitalita contained vitamins for under-fives, 86% knew the appropriate target group for Vitalita, and 83% said it had to be mixed with solid food. Of the 26% that reported not having given Vitalita to their child in the last month, 90.5% said that their child did not like it. Because the prod- uct, including its concept, was new, appropriate infor- mation and training was required as well as a thorough introduction to the beneficiaries, particularly on proper use, to ensure acceptance. This experience demonstrates that providing micronutrients as part of emergency relief and transition programming, as recently recommended by the World Health Organization/UNICEF/World Food Program, is feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanemia 3achildhood 3achildren 3afood aid 3afood and nutrition programs 3amalnutrition 3amonitoring 3amothers 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient requirements 3anutrition monitoring 3anutritional status 3apackaging 3atsunamis 3avitamins 3aIndonesia 0aEmergencies 0ahome fortification 0amulti-micronutrients 0asprinkles 0atsunami relief1 aMoench-Pfanner, Regina1 aMartini, Elviyanti1 aZlotkin, Stanley H.1 aDarnton-Hill, Ian1 aBloem, Martin W.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 2 p.189-197dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245018600169300001800355520082000373592002801193650002301221650001601244650001301260650002201273650002201295650003001317700001501347700001501362700001901377773011901396856008101515852000901596655001201605IND60576389320221120165251.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057638932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b007992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchary, Raghavendra10aStereoselective Synthesis of Functionalized 1,3-Disubstituted Isoindolines via Rh(III)-Catalyzed Tandem Oxidative Olefination-Cyclization of 4-Aryl-cyclic Sulfamidate-5-Carboxylates  ap. 7223-7233.  aA new method for the direct, stereoselective synthesis of highly functionalized 1,3-disubstituted isoindolines 6 from enantiomerically enriched cyclic 4-aryl-sulfamidate-5-carboxylates (5) is described. The process involves sulfamidate directed, Rh(III)-catalyzed tandem ortho C–H olefination of the 4-aryl-sulfamidate-5-carboxylates and subsequent cyclization by aza-Michael addition. In the reaction, which generates trans-1,3-disubstituted isoindolines exclusively, the configurational integrity of the stereogenic center in the starting cyclic sulfamidate is completely retained in the product. Examples are provided which show that the cyclic sulfamidate moiety not only serves as a chiral directing group but also as a versatile handle for further functionalization of the generated isoindoline ring system.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3amethodology 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereoselective synthesis1 aJung, In-A1 aSon, Se-Mi1 aLee, Hyeon-Kyu0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7223-7233dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b007993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245007700182300001600259520051000275592002800785650002200813650001200835650001200847650001300859650001900872650001800891650000900909650001400918650001000932653001500942653001900957653001300976653001300989653001901002700003101021700002201052700003201074773008801106856008701194852000901281655001201290IND60583250520221122034003.0180904e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobo Martínez, Fernando,10aInfected breast cyst due to Prevotella buccae resistant to metronidazole  ap. 177-178.  aPrevotella buccae is a Gram-negative anaerobic rod involved in some human infections.

Treatment with drainage and amoxicillin-clavulanate was established, and improvement of this infection was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrevotella buccae 3aabscess 3abreasts 3adrainage 3ahuman diseases 3ametronidazole 3apain 3apathogens 3awomen 0aP. buccae 0aBreast abscess 0aDrainage 0aAnaerobe 0aAntimicrobials1 aRodríguez-Granger, Javier1 aSampedro, Antonio1 aNavarro-Marí, José María0 tAnaerobe.g2017 Dec., v. 48 p.177-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157520182700274592002802101650002002129650001002149650001702159650002102176650001602197650002802213650000902241650001702250650001402267650002102281650002002302651001002322700001502332700001402347700001402361700001502375700001402390700001802404700001702422700001802439700002002457700002402477773012202501856007502623852000902698655001202707IND60768467820221117180355.0220225e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076846782DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140408152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yaqin 14aThe Impact of Dietary Diversity, Lifestyle, and Blood Lipids on Carotid Atherosclerosis: A Cross-Sectional Study  aCarotid atherosclerosis is a common arterial wall lesion that causes narrowing and occlusion of the arteries and is the basis of cardiovascular events. Dietary habits, lifestyle, and lipid metabolism should be considered integrally in the context of carotid atherosclerosis (CAS). However, this area has been investigated less often in China. To understand the prevalence of CAS in China and the impact of dietary diversity and habits, lifestyle, and lipid metabolism on CAS as well as its predictive factors, a cross-sectional study was performed in two northern and southern Chinese tertiary hospitals from 2017 to 2019. Included participants underwent carotid artery color Doppler ultrasonography, blood lipid examination and dietary evaluation. In total, 11,601 CAS patients and 27,041 individuals without carotid artery lesions were included. The prevalence of CAS was 30.0% in this group. High BMI (OR: 1.685, 95% CI [1.315–2.160]), current (1.148 [1.077–1.224]) or ex-smoking (1.349 [1.190–1.529]), abstinence from alcohol ((1.223 [1.026–1.459]), social engagement (1.122 [1.050–1.198]), hypertension (1.828 [1.718–1.945]), and total cholesterol (1.438 [1.298–1.594]) were risk factors for CAS, while higher dietary diversity according to DDS-2 (0.891 [0.805–0.989]), HDL-C (0.558 [0.487–0.639]), sugar-sweetened beverages (0.734 [0.696–0.774]), and no midnight snack consumption (0.846 [0.792–0.903]) were protective factors. This current study demonstrated that higher dietary diversity was a protective factor against CAS in a healthy population. In addition, current recommendations of healthy lifestyle and dietary habits for preventing CAS should be strengthened. In addition, dietary diversity should concentrate on food attributes and dietary balance, rather than increased quantities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood 3ablood lipids 3acarotid arteries 3acholesterol 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3alipid metabolism 3aultrasonography 3aChina1 aLi, Lijun 1 aLi, Ying 1 aLiu, Min 1 aGan, Gang 1 aZhou, Yi 1 aLuo, Xiaofei 1 aZhang, Chun 1 aXie, Jianfei 1 aDuan, Yinglong 1 aCheng, (Andy) S.

This method can lead to optimisation of the carbon sequestration capacity of the biochar, abatement of environmental pollution by P and N and alleviation of the severity of the projected future scarcity of P. A few studies have indicated that sorption can create efficient slow-release fertilisers although all of them utilised charged moieties such as ammonium ions to formulate them and as a result, there is a paucity of data concerning the efficiency of fertilisers formulated using uncharged compounds like urea. It’s against that background that we examined the possibility of leveraging co-pyrolysis and sorption with urea containing solutions to formulate slow-release N and P fertilisers along with assessing the agronomic efficiency of the formulated fertilisers through cultivating lettuce in pots for two seasons. Both urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) and urea were utilised as N sources. UHP (CDBM-UHP) and urea (CDBM-Urea) containing biochars averagely released 64.40% and 87.00% of the added N, respectively over the 28-day incubation period with the amount of N released decreasing with increasing concentrations of BM in the biochar. Lettuce yields and nutrient use efficiencies of N and P were higher in the CDBM-UHP than in the CDBM-Urea treatments. It’s therefore clear that sorption of UHP by BM containing biochar concomitantly slows-down releases of N and P and boosts the agronomic efficiency of the fertilisers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ014253022020cCooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science & Technology Development of the Rural Development Administration of the Republic of Korea 3aammonium 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abone meal 3acarbon sequestration 3acow manure 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3alettuce 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3aseasons 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoaking 3asolutions 3asorption 3aurea 3ayields1 aSung, Jwakyung1 aLee, Jae-Han1 aWoo, Seong-Ah1 aPark, Seong-Jin1 aOh, Taek-Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0215-04270 tApplied biological chemistry.g2020 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.52-52dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00535-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245014100213300001800354520193100372592002802303596002802331650002702359650001302386650003102399650001502430650002502445650001702470650001102487650001102498650001502509650001102524650001102535650003102546650001602577650002402593650001302617650002102630650001402651650002902665650002002694650001902714650001802733650001502751650002602766650001402792650001202806653001802818653001302836653001202849653001802861653001602879700002702895700002002922700001802942700002502960700002102985700002203006700006303028773013303091856008303224852000903307655001203316IND60781790920221119095809.0220702e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078179092DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-21-0302-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagawa, Cíntia H.

Nitrogen metabolism in this bacterial pathogen is dependent on arginine, a nitrogen-enriched amino acid that can either be synthesized or provided by the plant host. The arginine biosynthetic pathway uses argininosuccinate synthase (argG), associated with increased bacterial virulence. We examined the effects of bacterial arginine and nitrogen metabolism on the plant response during WB by proteomic analysis of the mutant strain Xaj argG–. Phenotypically, the mutant strain produced 42% fewer symptoms and survived in the plant tissue with 2.5-fold reduced growth compared with wild type, while showing itself to be auxotrophic for arginine in vitro. Proteomic analysis of infected tissue enabled the profiling of 676 Xaj proteins and 3,296 walnut proteins using isobaric labeling in a data-dependent acquisition approach. Comparative analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed distinct plant responses. Xaj wild type (WT) triggered processes of catabolism and oxidative stress in the host under observed disease symptoms, while most of the host biosynthetic processes triggered by Xaj WT were inhibited during Xaj argG– infection. Overall, the Xaj proteins revealed a drastic shift in carbon and energy management induced by disruption of nitrogen metabolism while the top differentially expressed proteins included a Fis transcriptional regulator and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Our results show the critical role of de novo arginine biosynthesis to sustain virulence and minimal growth during WB. This study is timely and critical as copper-based control methods are losing their effectiveness, and new sustainable methods are urgently needed in orchard environments.

However, overexpressing rhIFN-γ in Escherichia coli was found to accumulate as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. In this work, a system for soluble and active expression of rhIFN-γ was constructed by coexpressing chaperonin GroEL/GroES in E. coli. The rhIFN-γ gene was fused to a pET-28a expression vector, and rhIFN-γ was partially expressed as the soluble form following coexpression with a second vector producing chaperonin GroEL/GroES. The fermentation of recombinant E. coli harboring rhIFN-γ and GroEL/GroES plasmids was investigated, and the optimized conditions were as follows: culture temperature of 25°C, incubation time of 8 h, isopropyl-β-D-thio-galactoside concentration of 0.2 mM, and L-arabinose concentration of 0.5 g/L. As a result, the expression level of rhIFN-γ was improved accordingly by 2.2-fold than the control, while a significantly positive correlation was also found between the ratio of supernatant to precipitate of rhIFN-γ and the amount of chaperonin. Circular dichroism spectra, fluorescence spectra, size exclusion chromatography, and chemical cross-linking method were applied to characterize rhIFN-γ, indicating that the three-dimensional structure of rhIFN-γ was identical to that of the native rhIFN-γ. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for active rhIFN-γ quantification showed that coexpression yielded 72.91 mg rhIFN-γ per liter fermentation broth. Finally, protein–protein interactions between rhIFN-γ and chaperonin were analyzed using the yeast two-hybrid system, which provided the direct evidence that chaperonin GroEL/GroES interacted with rhIFN-γ to increase the soluble expression and presented the potential in producing efficiently recombinant proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afermentation 3abioactive properties 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3afluorescence 3acytoplasmic inclusions 3arecombinant proteins 3ayeasts 3atherapeutics 3aplasmids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3atemperature 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aEscherichia coli 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aChaperonin 10xmetabolism 2aChaperonin 60xmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Folding 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolubility 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aHu, Sheng1 aGuan, Yi-Xin1 aYao, Shan-Jing0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Feb., v. 93, no. 3 p.1065-1074dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3599-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245006400210506007600274520153900350592002801889506003701917650002001954650002901974650001002003650001002013650001902023650002402042650001402066650001002080650002402090650001802114650002402132650002202156650001702178773011902195856007702314852000902391655001202400IND60651299620221207123154.0190711e20190110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065129962DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80100172doi7 aPMC63591332pmcid7 a306345772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Joseph  K. E.10aDimensionless Numbers to Analyze Expansive Growth Processes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCells of algae, fungi, and plants have walls and exhibit expansive growth which can increase their volume by as much as 10,000 times. Expansive growth is central to their morphogenesis, development, and sensory responses to environmental stimuli. Equations describing the biophysical processes of the water uptake rate and the wall deformation rate have been derived, validated, and established. A significant amount of research provides insight into the molecular underpinnings of these processes. What is less well known are the relative magnitudes of these processes and how they compare during expansive growth and with walled cells from other species. Here, dimensionless numbers (&Pi; parameters) are used to determine the magnitudes of the biophysical processes involved in the expansive growth rate of cells from algae (Chara corallina), fungi (Phycomyces blakesleeanus), and plants (Pisum satinis L.). It is found for all three species that the cell&rsquo;s capability for the water uptake rate is larger than the wall plastic deformation rate and much larger than the wall elastic deformation rate. Also, the wall plastic deformation rates of all three species are of similar magnitude as their expansive growth rate even though the stress relaxation rates of their walls are very different. It is envisioned that dimensionless numbers can assist in determining how these biophysical processes change during development, morphogenesis, sensory responses, environmental stress, climate change, and after genetic modification.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChara corallina 3aPhycomyces blakesleeanus 3aPisum 3aalgae 3aclimate change 3aelastic deformation 3aequations 3afungi 3agenetic engineering 3amorphogenesis 3aplastic deformation 3astress relaxation 3awater uptake0 tPlants.g2019 Jan. 10, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80100173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245021900158300001800377520146000395592002801855650003701883650001501920650001301935650002801948650001601976650002501992650002102017650002002038650002802058650002102086650003802107650002002145650001102165650002202176650001802198650001302216650001502229650001102244650003302255650003702288700001902325700001602344700002202360700002302382773011002405856007502515852000902590655001202599IND60529569720221119110406.0160717e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052956972DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303142e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Bongjin10aIncreased Electrocatalyzed Performance through Dendrimer-Encapsulated Gold Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotube-Assisted Multiple Bienzymatic Labels: Highly Sensitive Electrochemical Immunosensor for Protein Detection  ap. 1784-1791.  aA highly sensitive electrochemical carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunosensor was fabricated by covalently immobilizing a monoclonal CEA antibody (anti-CEA, Ab₁) and a mediator (thionine, Th) on a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-encapsulated dendrimer (Den/AuNP). Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-supported secondary antibody (Ab₂)-conjugated multiple bienzymes, glucose oxidase (GOx), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Ab₂/MWCNT/GOx/HRP) were used as electrochemical labels. The highly sensitive detection was achieved by the increased HRP-electrocatalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide, which was locally generated by the enzyme GOx. The immunosensor surface was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance techniques. The Den/AuNP and Ab₂/MWCNT/GOx/HRP bioconjugates were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry techniques were used to monitor the increased electrocatalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide by HRP. The linear dynamic range and the detection limit were determined to be 10.0 pg/mL to 50.0 ng/mL and 4.4 ± 0.1 pg/mL, respectively. The validity of the immunosensor response was tested in various CEA-spiked human serum samples, and the results were compared to those of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aatomic force microscopy 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanoparticles 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglucose oxidase 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3aquartz 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAkter, Rashida1 aHan, Oc Hee1 aRhee, Choong Kyun1 aRahman, Md.

However, the success and practicality of this approach is often criticized because of the return to nitrification; yet, previous studies conducted in full-scale distribution systems do not contain the sampling frequency to determine how quickly nitrification can return. In this research, a total of 15 hydrants distributed across hydraulically modeled water ages were sampled for 21 sampling events over a period spanning two annual FClPs (2018 and 2019) to investigate the water quality, planktonic community, and, using a new sampling technique, established biofilm community impacts within a single, distribution system pressure zone. Hydrants measured elevated nitrite only 10 weeks after the end of the FClP and live cell counts in the bulk and scour samples statistically significantly increased within two weeks after the FClP ended and chloramine disinfection resumed, indicating limited impacts from a FClP. Furthermore, the FClP significantly increased iron concentrations during the period of free chlorine disinfection creating a consumer water quality concern. Microbial fingerprint analysis using flow cytometry revealed that beta diversity did not significantly change for sampling locations that experienced even periodic low total chlorine concentrations. Only locations that maintained high chlorine residuals throughout both chloramine and free chlorine disinfection periods demonstrated significant changes in bulk water microbial community. Even for these locations, microbial communities of the scoured biofilms remained similar over the course of the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abiofilm 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3aflow cytometry 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3anitrites 3aplankton 3aresearch 3aspecies diversity 3awater 3awater quality 0achlorine burn 0amicrobial community 0adistribution system 0adrinking water0 tWater research.g2021 June 01, v. 197 p.117044-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1170443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245009400207520117500301592002801476650003901504650001201543650002001555650002301575650001001598650002201608650001201630650001001642650001401652650002501666650002301691650001101714653001701725653002201742653002101764653003201785700006101817700002201878773010001900856008702000852000902087655001202096IND60696065520221119032521.0200607e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069606552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyl, Catrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4470-285910aChanges in protein structural characteristics upon processing of gluten-free millet pasta  aProso millet exhibits favorable agronomic and nutritional properties but is currently under-utilized in the northern hemisphere. This study compared processing-induced changes in protein characteristics of commercial pasta to fresh gluten-free pasta from proso millet varieties differing in prolamin profile. Protein solubility, accessible thiols and secondary structures were measured in dough, sheeted and cooked pasta. Relationships between protein conformation and characteristics related to pasta quality were determined. Cooking significantly lowered protein solubility and induced exposure of thiol groups as well as a shift in secondary structure distribution, while sheeting only had a minor effect. Random structures positively and significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with solubility, cooking loss and protein digestibility. In contrast, β-sheets, the main secondary structure in cooked pasta, negatively correlated with these properties. The utilization of proso millet in gluten-free pasta is promising, however, processing optimization to elicit targeted protein modifications to balance quality and nutritional attributes requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum 3acooking 3acooking quality 3adigestible protein 3adough 3agluten-free foods 3amillets 3apasta 3aprolamins 3aprotein conformation 3aprotein solubility 3athiols 0aProso millet 0aGluten-free pasta 0aPasta processing 0aProtein secondary structure1 aMarti, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9483-77541 aIsmail, Baraem P.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 327 p.127052-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245007700207506007600284520115200360592002801512506003701540650001101577650002501588650001101613650001801624650001601642650001001658650002701668650002201695650001601717650001501733650001201748650001601760650001801776650002101794650001901815650002601834651001001860700002201870700002201892700003001914700002001944700002401964700002501988700002502013700002102038700002402059700002202083700002002105773011902125856007702244852000902321655001202330IND60651299720221207121823.0190711e20190110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065129972DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80100182doi7 aPMC63590662pmcid7 a306346272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaolis, Angelo  De10aPlant Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology: Following Mariotti’s Steps  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis review is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Domenico Mariotti, who significantly contributed to establishing the Italian research community in Agricultural Genetics and carried out the first experiments of Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation and regeneration in Italy during the 1980s.

If ingested in sufficiently high concentrations, they exert severe toxic effects in humans and animals. In 2004, a survey programme was launched to assess the extent of mycotoxin contamination in feed and feed raw materials. Since then, over 19,000 samples have been analysed and more than 70,000 individual analyses have been conducted. While it is difficult to infer any long-term trends on a global level, the data confirm that high mycotoxin contamination is often linked to unusual weather. Overall, 72% of the samples contained detectable amounts of aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone or ochratoxin A. Co-contamination with two or more mycotoxins was detected in 38% of the samples. In most cases the concentrations were low enough to ensure compliance with EU guidance values or maximum levels. However, co-contaminated samples with concentrations below guidance and maximum values might still exert adverse effects due to synergistic interactions of the mycotoxins. Emerging mycotoxins and masked mycotoxins may also contribute to the overall toxicity of the feed and their presence is frequently detected with multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS. Since by-product feeds, such as distillers dried grain with solubles, often concentrate the mycotoxins of the original substrate, they contribute excessively to the overall contamination of feed rations and therefore need special attention. Regarding food the situation is quite similar: low level contamination is frequently observed in official controls but maximum levels are rarely exceeded in developed countries. As it is very difficult to remove mycotoxins from contaminated commodities, preventing them from accumulation in agricultural commodities is the most effective strategy to combat the problem. Preventive measures range from crop rotation and resistance breeding to inoculation with microbial antagonists. Nevertheless, excessive mycotoxin levels may occur despite all preventive measures. Therefore, continuous monitoring is essential and efficient detoxification strategies are needed to deal with such outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadverse effects 3aaflatoxins 3aantagonists 3abreeding 3acompliance 3acrop rotation 3adeoxynivalenol 3adeveloped countries 3adistillers grains 3afeed contamination 3afeed rations 3afumonisins 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aochratoxins 3aoilseeds 3araw materials 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3aweather 3azearalenone 0amycotoxin co-occurrence 0atrade 0ainteraction 0aprevention 0adetoxification1 aStreit, E.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.213-222dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2013.15723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016100165300001800326520165000344592002801994596010202022596001502124596003802139596012002177650002602297650002802323650001602351650001402367650001402381650001302395650001302408650002002421650001402441650001802455650001402473650001302487650002002500653002102520653002902541653001002570653001902580653003402599653001902633700002102652700003002673700002702703700007202730700007802802773013302880856008303013852000903096655001203105IND60781791020221119095850.0220702e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078179102DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-08-21-0326-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia, Thiago12aA Bacterial Type Three Secretion-Based Delivery System for Functional Characterization of Sporisorium scitamineum Plant Immune Suppressing Effector Proteins  ap. 1513-1523.  aThe facultative biotrophic basidiomycete Sporisorium scitamineum causes smut disease in sugarcane. This study applied an assay to identify S. scitamineum candidate effectors (CEs) with plant immunity suppression activities by delivering them into Nicotiana benthamiana cells via the type-three secretion system of Pseudomonas fluorescens EtHAn. Six CEs were individually cloned into the pEDV6 vector and expressed by P. fluorescens EtHAn for translocation into the plant cells. Three CEs (g1052, g3890, and g5159) could suppress pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses with high reproducibility in different coinfiltration experiments with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. In addition, three CEs (g1052, g4549, and g5159) were also found to be AvrB-induced suppressors of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), demonstrating for the first time that S. scitamineum can defeat both PTI and ETI responses. A transcriptomic analysis at different stages of infection by the smut fungus of three sugarcane cultivars with contrasting responses to the pathogen revealed that suppressors g1052, g3890, g4549, and g5159 were induced at the early stage of infection. By contrast, the two CEs (g2666 and g6610) that did not exhibit suppression activities expressed only at the late stage of infection. Moreover, genomic structures of the CEs and searches for orthologs in other smut species suggested duplication events and further divergence in CEs evolution of S. scitamineum. Thus, the transient assay applied here demonstrated the potential of pEDV6 and P. fluorescens EtHAn as biological tools for identifying plant immune suppressors from S. scitamineum.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/17545-8a2017/2113-6a2018/04555-0cFundação de Ampara à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  cPNPD-CAPES  a88887.615074/2021-00cCAPES PROEX  a142385/2020-4a302412/2018-2a301787/2017-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aSporisorium 3acultivars 3aevolution 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3aplant pathology 3asecretion 3asmut diseases 3asugarcane 3atomatoes 3atranscriptomics 0aeffector biology 0aeffector detector vector 0apEDV6 0aplant immunity 0aPseudomonas fluorescens EtHAn 0asugarcane smut1 aRody, Hugo V.

In 2006, T. absoluta invaded Spain from South America. Since then, it was rapidly spread to most European, African and Asian countries. Such alien invasive species can minimize crop production, whereas the increasing use of insecticides raises various environmental concerns as well as on control costs, control failure and the toxicity to non‐target organisms. The S. American tomato pinworm is mostly controlled by chemical insecticides, and failure to control it is not a rare phenomenon. Resistance to numerous insecticides has been reported and is mainly due to the fact that farmers do not follow a sustainable resistance management scheme. Several examples have been reported from several countries where the tomato pinworm is present. In order to develop a successful insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy for any major pest, one needs to identify the baseline toxicity to insecticides and then monitor susceptibility levels. In Cyprus, the current status of susceptibility levels to the main insecticides that are used to control T. absoluta has never been studied before. Herein, nine Cypriot populations of the pest were subjected to laboratory bioassays between 2016 and 2018 using the main insecticides applied against it. We found that the insecticides chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb could not control the Cypriot T. absoluta populations anymore, with a resistance ratio (RR) >28 and 3–23, respectively. Furthermore, mortality achieved by those two insecticides was 20.6%–72% for chlorantraniliprole and 27.5%–78% for indoxacarb. However, the insecticides emamectin benzoate and spinosad are very effective, since mortality to both of them ranged between 99.5% and 100%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKeiferia lycopersicella 3aTuta absoluta 3abioassays 3acrop production 3afarmers 3aindoxacarb 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3anontarget organisms 3apesticide application 3aresistance management 3aspinosad 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3aCyprus 3aSouth America 3aSpain1 aSeraphides, Nicos1 aPitsillou, Maria1 aSfenthourakis, Spyros0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2019 June, v. 143, no. 5 p.508-517dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.126273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01580naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007500155300002000230520048700250592002800737650002400765650002600789650002100815650002300836650002300859650002100882650001100903650001100914650001100925650002200936650001200958650001100970700002000981773012101001856007501122852000901197655001201206IND60550292020221116143850.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029202DNAL7 a10.1021/jo50185372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wen-Bin10aElectrochemical Cleavage of Aryl Ethers Promoted by Sodium Borohydride  ap. 10189-10195.  aThe NaBH₄ (or TBABH₄)-promoted electrochemically reductive cleavage of aryl C–O bonds in diaryl ethers to produce phenols and arenes with high yields and excellent selectivities at room temperature was reported.

There are two traits for the kind of temperature change scenario. Firstly, the kind of temperature change scenario considers the regional and seasonal differences in North–South transect of eastern China. The character of the temperature change is similar to the observation data due to the observational constraint. Secondly, the kind of temperature change scenario causes the maximal possible impact on the simulated NPP to discuss the maximal uncertainty in the simulated NPP to the temperature change in North–South transect of eastern China. Other two kinds of temperature change scenarios are also applied to explain the above two traits and to analyze variations due to different kinds of temperature change scenarios.It is shown that the kind of temperature change scenario resulted of the CNOP-P approach, which is called as the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, exhibits the regional and seasonal temperature differences in North–South transect of eastern China. The NPP decreases by 1.84% in northern China, and respectively increases by 4.09% and 18.99% in northeastern and southern China as the results of the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, though the NPP increases in small part of northern China and decreases in part of northeastern China. The variations in the NPP caused by the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario are different to those by the other two types of temperature change scenarios in northern, northeastern China and southern China. The impact of the CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario on the NPP is intenser than that of the other two types of temperature change scenarios. The seasonal analyses demonstrate that the differences among the variations in the NPP due to three types of temperature change scenarios principally stem from the variations in spring, summer and autumn. The above results imply that the regional and seasonal temperature change play a key role in estimating the uncertainty of the NPP, and the CNOP-P approach could afford a possible temperature change scenario to reflect the regional and seasonal temperature change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3amodels 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3aChina 0aConditional nonlinear optimal perturbation 0aCNOP-P 0aTerrestrial ecosystem 0aClimate change 0aRegional and seasonal differences1 aMu, Mu0 tEcological modelling.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 289 p.66-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245021200172300001400384520133000398536032401728592002802052596001302080596003002093650002002123650001202143650002302155650002902178650002202207650002802229650002502257650000702282650002202289650001702311650002002328650001902348650001002367650001502377650002002392653002702412653002402439653001702463653001002480653002302490700002802513700001702541700001802558700002002576700001502596700001702611700002402628700002202652700002102674700001502695773012102710856008602831852000902917655001202926IND60754913320221120021310.0220310e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075491332DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2021.19436752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehman, Muzammal10aEffects of rice straw biochar and nitrogen fertilizer on ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.) morpho-physiological traits, copper uptake and post-harvest soil characteristics, grown in an aged-copper contaminated soil  ap. 11-24.  aCopper (Cu) contamination in soils is becoming a serious problem. Therefore, an experiment in plastic pots was carried out to investigate interactive influence of rice straw BC (BC₀:0, BC₁:5, and BC₂:10% w/w) and nitrogen fertilizer (N₀:0, N₁:140, N₂:280, and N₃:420 kg ha⁻ ¹) on plant growth, Cu mobility and phytoavailability to Boehmeria nivea in Cu polluted soil. Results revealed that BC × N fertilizer had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased the growth of B. nivea in terms of biomass, height of plant, diameter of stem and number of leaves. Furthermore, BC × N fertilizer resulted in significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity of soil after harvesting in comparison with control. However, the influence of BC × N fertilizer on soil extractable Cu and Cu uptake by plant varied with levels of N fertilizer. The BC₂N₁ treatment significantly increased the shoot biomass of B. nivea by 635% (fresh biomass) and 452% (dry biomass), but reduced Cu contents in roots, stems and leaves i.e., 52, 23 and 34 mg kg⁻ ¹, respectively. Thereby, high dose of BC along with low N fertilizer could be considered as an efficient soil amendment combination for Cu stabilization and higher biomass production of B. nivea in highly Cu contaminated soil.  aThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31571717) and the earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System (CARS-16-E15).

These approaches focus on how individuals are able to engage in out-of-home activities, participate in social life as well as on their involvement in other activities that contribute to their overall well-being. The paper aims at further investigating such approaches, analysing forms of inequality in job-related mobilities while assuming that a person's accessibility depends on both contextual and individual factors. Taking the Buenos Aires metropolitan area as a suitable testbed, the paper offers an approach to identify the inequalities in job-related accessibility at the neighbourhood scale. The approach considers the relationship between the quality and supply of public transport, level of social exclusion and reachable employment opportunities. The research proposes a synthetic index of inequalities in access to job opportunities (IAO) to identify disadvantaged urban areas characterized by a confluence of problems related to socio-economic deprivations, low accessibility to employment as well as a low mobility and poor quality of transport supply. The approach has an explicit operational dimension and intends to contribute to outlining tailored measures to guarantee better job opportunities, as in the case of people living in areas experiencing sub-standard levels of accessibility to workplaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3aemployment opportunities 3aissues and policy 3ametropolitan areas 3asocioeconomics 3aworking conditions 0aAccessibility 0aJob-related mobility 0aActivity participation 0aSocial inclusion 0aBuenos Aires1 aVecchio, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5920-15071 aBocchimuzzi, Lucía1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6370-34031 aLanza, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1296-56570 tApplied geography.g2019 June, v. 107 p.1-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245011800210300001000328506007600338520178100414592002802195506003702223650001702260650001002277650001602287650001202303650001102315650001102326650001402337650001702351650001902368650001902387650001002406650002002416650001502436650001202451700002202463700001702485700002302502700001902525773011002544856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60572503120221207083406.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057250312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12983-016-0186-52doi7 aPMC52445172pmcid7 a281159762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaetz, EliseM. J.10aPhotosynthate accumulation in solar-powered sea slugs - starving slugs survive due to accumulated starch reserves  ap. 4.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Solar-powered sea slugs are famed for their ability to survive starvation due to incorporated algal chloroplasts. It is well established that algal-derived carbon can be traced in numerous slug-derived compounds, showing that slugs utilize the photosynthates produced by incorporated plastids. Recently, a new hypothesis suggests that the photosynthates produced are not continuously made available to the slug. Instead, at least some of the plastid’s photosynthetic products are stored in the plastid itself and only later become available to the slug. The long-term plastid-retaining slug, Elysia timida and its sole food source, Acetabularia acetabulum were examined to determine whether or not starch, a combination of amylose and amylopectin and the main photosynthate produced by A. acetabulum, is produced by the stolen plastids and whether it accumulates within individual kleptoplasts, providing an energy larder, made available to the slug at a later time. RESULTS: Histological sections of Elysia timida throughout a starvation period were stained with Lugol’s Iodine solution, a well-known stain for starch granules in plants. We present here for the first time, an increase in amylose concentration, within the slug’s digestive gland cells during a starvation period, followed by a sharp decrease. Chemically blocking photosynthesis in these tissues resulted in no observable starch, indicating that the starch in untreated animals is a product of photosynthetic activity. CONCLUSION: This suggests that kleptoplasts function as both, a nutritive producer and storage device, holding onto the polysaccharides they produce for a certain time until they are finally available and used by the starving slug to withstand extended starvation periods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetabularia 3aalgae 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ahistology 3akleptoplasts 3aphotosynthates 3aphotosynthesis 3aslugs 3astarch granules 3astarvation 3atissues1 aMoris, VictoriaC.1 aMoritz, Leif1 aHaubrich, AndréN.1 aWägele, Heike0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.4-4dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-016-0186-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012800205300001600333500001900349520146200368592002801830650002201858650001301880650001701893651001001910700006101920773011801981856008202099852000902181655001202190IND60710487720221119014718.0200910e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048772DNAL7 a10.1007/s40152-020-00164-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnad, Divya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4967-536210aAssembling marine spatial planning in the global south: International agencies and the fate of fishing communities in India  ap. 375-387.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe language and practice of Marine spatial planning (MSP) is typically associated with state-led multi-sectoral planning efforts. Yet in countries like India, where the government is not yet promoting MSP, ocean space has already been divided using principles and practices that are characteristic of MSP elsewhere in the world. Instead of being initiated by the state, these MSP-like processes are initiated by international agencies when industries seek large-scale development of India’s marine ecosystems. Although intended as an inclusive, holistic process to plan industrial development, this assemblage of MSP technologies, processes, and practices mandated by international corporations produces a particular power relation through its rejection of local knowledge and insistence on data, for instance, in the form of discrete, geo-coded polygons. This paper argues that this form of MSP produces an ontological politics, despite emerging from seemingly rational, post-political, and technocratic processes. Engaging with such politics is increasingly possible with access to geographical information systems, and this, therefore, provides a novel space in which to engage in political struggle. The case of externally mandated MSP in India demonstrates that non-state actors can initiate MSP, and therefore, opens the possibility for fishing communities, as non-state actors, to directly engage with the assemblage of practices that produce MSP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustrialization 3apolitics 3aspatial data 3aIndia1 aSt. Martin, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3775-16010 tMaritime studies.g2020 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.375-387dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22889x1872-78597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40152-020-00164-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011300165300001400278520169600292592002801988650001102016650001102027650001302038650001202051650001202063650001302075650001502088650001002103650004102113650003002154650001402184650002602198650001702224650001402241650002202255650003702277650003302314650000902347650001102356650001002367651001002377653003702387653001002424653002602434653001602460653003102476653001502507700001802522700001302540700001102553700001602564700001102580700001402591700001402605773010702619856008602726852000902812655001202821IND60606835420221122005911.0180730e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060683542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuxu10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in atmospheric PM2.5 around 2013 Asian Youth Games period in Nanjing  ap. 85-96.  aEighteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 collected near the Nanjing Olympic Sports Center across the Asian Youth Games (AYG) period (from August 2 to August 28, 2013) were analyzed using GC-MS. Their levels, sources and health risks to human were discussed. Results showed that the total concentrations of PAHs in PM2.5 were 9.43, 7.21 and 8.83ngm⁻³ for pre- (August 3–15), during- (August 16–24) and post- (August 25–28) AYG periods, respectively. They were dominated by 5-ring and 6-ring PAHs. Total PAHs concentrations in PM2.5 during AYG period decreased by 24%, when compared with those for pre-AYG period. For combustion-derived PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs, they decreased by 26% and 21%, respectively. It implied that the pollution control measures implemented during the AYG can effectively reduce the emission of PAHs from various sources. The poor correlations between PAHs and meteorological parameters also favored that the variations of PAHs were raised by the changes of emission sources. Diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis revealed that vehicle emission and coal combustion were the predominant contributors, with minimal effects from biomass burning and petroleum. The health risks for human exposed to PAHs in PM2.5 were quantitatively assessed by BaP equivalent concentration (BaPeq) and the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). The estimated ILCR value of PAHs during the AYG periods decreased by 23% and 27% for children and adults when compared with those for the pre-AYG, respectively. It indicated that the pollution control measures reduced the risks of PAHs to sportsmen or human gathered around the Olympic Sport Center.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aadults 3aathletes 3abiomass 3aburning 3achildren 3acombustion 3agames 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ameteorological parameters 3aneoplasms 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apetroleum 3apollution control 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asports 3ayouth 3aChina 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aPM2.5 0aSource identification 0aHealth risk 0aPollution control measures 0aMega event1 aKong, Shaofei1 aYin, Yan1 aLi, Li1 aYuan, Liang1 aLi, Qi1 aXiao, Hui1 aChen, Kui0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 June 15, v. 174-175 p.85-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245013000162300001600292520118600308592002801494650001701522650002001539650002001559650001601579650001001595650001801605650001101623650001401634650001101648650001501659650001601674650001201690650001301702650001401715653001501729653001701744653002701761653001201788653002201800653002901822653001701851700002301868700002001891700001501911700001601926700002001942773012401962856007802086852000902164655001202173IND60130404320221119224047.0151127e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013040432DNAL7 a10.2983/035.031.04102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurihara, Takeo10aProbability of Symbiosis Establishment by Giant Clams with Fresh and Cultured Symbiodinium Isolated from Various Host Animals  ap. 977-987.  aGiant clams need to establish a symbiotic relationship with the microalgae Symbiodinium in the environment to survive the juvenile stage. In seed production of giant clams, larvae are presented with Symbiodinium but the probability of symbiosis establishment (symbiosis rate) is low. To determine the characteristics of Symbiodinium that improve the symbiosis rate of giant clams (Tridacna crocea and Tridacna maxima), we conducted experiments simulating a typical Japanese seed production method that rears giant clams in unsterilized seawater with no food or antibiotics. After validating this experimental method, we obtained the following results. First, the symbiosis rate was greater than O for Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, corals, anemones, and even coastal seawater. It was slightly higher, albeit not significantly, for the giant clam origin Symbiodinium. Second, the symbiosis rate was sometimes better for cultured Symbiodinium than fresh Symbiodinium. In conclusion, Symbiodinium cultured after being isolated from giant clams can promote a symbiotic establishment of giant clam juveniles that are reared in unsterilized seawater with no food or antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSymbiodinium 3aTridacna crocea 3aTridacna maxima 3aantibiotics 3aclams 3acoastal water 3acorals 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amicroalgae 3aprobability 3arearing 3aseawater 3asymbiosis 0atridacnids 0azooxanthella 0asymbiotic relationship 0astrains 0aculture condition 0aJapanese seed production 0aSymbiodinium1 aYamashita, Hiroshi1 aYamada, Hideaki1 aInoue, Ken1 aIwai, Kenji1 aKoike, Kazuhiko0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2012 Dec., v. 31, no. 4 p.977-987dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.031.04103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013000170300001600300520130800316536010201624592002801726596005401754650002401808650002201832650000901854650001301863650001601876650000901892650001601901650001901917650001801936650001401954650001501968650001601983650001301999650001502012653003302027653001702060653001702077653001302094700001602107700001502123700001802138700001602156700001802172773012402190856008502314852000902399655001202408IND60689899420221119235910.0200424e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068989942DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2019.15931012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, Noreen10aIron/iron oxide nanoparticles: advances in microbial fabrication, mechanism study, biomedical, and environmental applications  ap. 278-300.  aMicrobially synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) hold great potential for biomedical, clinical, and environmental applications owing to their several unique features. Biomineralization, a process that exists in almost every living organism playing a significant role in the fabrication of FeONPs through the involvement of 5–100 nm sized protein compartments such as dodecameric (Dps), ferritin, and encapsulin with their diameters 9, 12, and ∼32 nm, respectively. This contribution provides a detailed overview of the green synthesis of FeONPs by microbes and their applications in biomedical and environmental fields. The first part describes our understanding in the biological fabrication of zero-valent FeONPs with special emphasis on ferroxidase (FO) mediated series of steps involving in the translocation, oxidation, nucleation, and storage of iron in Dps, ferritin, and encapsulin protein nano-compartments. Secondly, this review elaborates the significance of biologically synthesized FeONPs in biomedical science for the detection, treatment, and prevention of various diseases. Thirdly, we tried to provide the recent advances of using FeONPs in the environmental process, e.g. detection, degradation, remediation and treatment of toxic pesticides, dyes, metals, and wastewater.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. U1632126].  aPublisher supplied data  a126cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abiomedical research 3abiomineralization 3adyes 3aferritin 3aferroxidase 3airon 3airon oxides 3amicroorganisms 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apesticides 3aremediation 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aMicrobial synthesis of FeNPs 0aapplications 0aeco-friendly 0aproteins1 aAhmad, Fiaz1 aDa-Wei, Li1 aZhou, Ren-Bin1 aFeng-Li, He1 aYin, Da-Chuan0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2019 May 4, v. 45, no. 3 p.278-300dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2019.15931013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010000178300001400278500001500292520227800307592002802585650001502613650001202628650001102640650002002651650001202671650001402683650001102697650001102708650002202719650002002741651001002761653001802771653001902789653002902808653002702837653001902864653001802883700006702901773009602968856008503064852000903149655001203158IND60637934820221122150821.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakrabarti, Sandip K.,14aThe geography of medical travel in India: Differences across states, and the urban-rural divide  ap. 12-25.  a2019-12-06  aThere is a large body of literature exploring spatial disparity in access to healthcare services, and the resultant geographic inequality in the demand for medical travel. We are, however, unaware of any such study conducted in India in the past. The transportation implications of inequitable healthcare access, therefore, remains unknown to Indian planners and policymakers. We use a unique dataset, the 2014–15 Domestic Tourism Expenditure survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India, to address this critical gap in the literature. We use trip-making information of 42,547 persons (13,525 urban and 29,022 rural residents) belonging to 28 Indian states in order to analyze the variation in individuals' medical trip destination choice, on average, across states. We analyze overnight trips (i.e., trips involving at least one night stay away from home) made for medical purposes only. Specifically, we isolate and compare the independent influence of state of residence (i.e., the state-effect) on residents' choice of within-district and out-of-state medical care location, after controlling for various personal and household factors that also govern choice. Additionally, we select a sub-sample of individuals who made out-of-state medical trips, and analyze state-level differences in the likelihood of long or >1500 km (vs. short or ≤1500 km) distance medical travel. We analyze urban and rural residents separately, and estimate a pooled model to explore intra-state urban-rural differences in medical trip destination choice. Our analyses reveal significant variation in urban and rural residents' destination choice for medical trips across India's states. We also find within-state urban-rural differences in destination choice to vary significantly across states. Our analysis provides new information on the geography of medical travel in India, underscoring the need for further research on the causes and consequences of the geographic disparity in healthcare access, and targeted action to improve healthcare access equitably across states. We expect our paper to stimulate further research to guide national and state health and transportation policies in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3astatistics 3atourism 3amodels 3adata collection 3asurveys 3ageography 3atravel 3apeople 3aissues and policy 3ahealth services 3aIndia 0aTravel demand 0atransportation 0aTransportation geography 0aRegional accessibility 0aMedical travel 0aHealth policy1 aTatavarthy, Aruna Divya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7249-03660 tApplied geography.g2019 June, v. 107 p.12-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001400289520144200303592002801745650001601773650001001789650001401799650001201813653001201825653001901837653001201856653002201868653001401890653001101904700001701915700001901932700001701951773011001968856008102078852000902159655001202168IND60610834920221116165133.0180830e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061083492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2017.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapir-Hen, Lidar10aWet sieving a complex tell: Implications for retrieval protocols and studies of animal economy in historical periods  ap. 72-79.  aThe understanding that fine mesh sieving is the optimal procedure for the recovery of minute finds poses two challenges for archeologists of historical periods: it is costly and time consuming, and it puts into question the value of data collected in excavations where sieving was conducted minimally or not at all. That hand picking causes loss of data pertaining to microfaunal remains is indisputable, but the extent of information loss regarding larger fauna is not as clear. In order to evaluate these challenges for macrofaunal remains, we carried out, for the first time, a comprehensive sieving experiment at Tel Dor, a multi-layered complex site, the most prominent site type in historical periods. We examine the effects of wet sieving on the macro- and microfauna frequencies, and discuss its implications in terms of the interpretations of the faunal assemblages and the choice of excavations' collection protocols. We demonstrate that while sieving has a substantial effect on microfauna frequencies, it has a limited effect on those of the macrofauna. We also suggest that faunal assemblages of livestock animals that were hand collected or partially sieved, are valid for comparison with sieved assemblages. Finally, we call for an explicit presentation of the retrieval protocol in site reports and other studies, differentiating clearly between sieved and un-sieved material, and raise some points for future discussion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3afauna 3alivestock 3asieving 0aTel Dor 0aArchaeozoology 0aSieving 0aCollection method 0aLivestock 0aLevant1 aSharon, Ilan1 aGilboa, Ayelet1 aDayan, Tamar0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2017 June, v. 82 p.72-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245010900154300001500263520178400278592002802062650002502090650001202115650001002127650001402137650002202151650003502173650002002208650001002228650003502238650001602273650001302289700001902302700002502321773015102346856006902497856010402566990002302670852000902693655001202702IND60644623320221118034838.0190517e20190511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064462332DNAL7 a10.3791/592422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiola, Simone10aIntraventricular transplantation of engineered neuronal precursors for in vivo neuroarchitecture studies  ap. e59242.  aGene control of neuronal cytoarchitecture is currently the subject of intensive investigation. Described here is a simple method developed to study in vivo gene control of neocortical projection neuron morphology. This method is based on (1) in vitro lentiviral engineering of neuronal precursors as "test" and "control" cells, (2) their co-transplantation into wild-type brains, and (3) paired morphometric evaluation of their neuronal derivatives. Specifically, E12.5 pallial precursors from panneuronal, genetically labeled donors, are employed for this purpose. They are engineered to take advantage of selected promoters and tetON/OFF technology, and they are free-hand transplanted into neonatal lateral ventricles. Later, upon immunofluorescence profiling of recipient brains, silhouettes of transplanted neurons are fed into NeurphologyJ open source software, their morphometric parameters are extracted, and average length and branching index are calculated. Compared to other methods, this one offers three main advantages: it permits achieving of fine control of transgene expression at affordable costs, it only requires basic surgical skills, and it provides statistically reliable results upon analysis of a limited number of animals. Because of its design, however, it is not adequate to address non cell-autonomous control of neuroarchitecture. Moreover, it should be preferably used to investigate neurite morphology control after completion of neuronal migration. In its present formulation, this method is exquisitely tuned to investigate gene control of glutamatergic neocortical neuron architecture. Taking advantage of transgenic lines expressing EGFP in other specific neural cell types, it can be re-purposed to address gene control of their architecture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal use reduction 3aanimals 3abrain 3abranching 3acomputer software 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amorphometry 3aneurites1 aSanto, Manuela1 aMallamaci, Antonello0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 May 11, , no. 147 p.e59242-e59242dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/592423Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59242/intraventricular-transplantation-engineered-neuronal-precursors-for  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010600165300001600271520120900287536022201496592002801718596007501746596011401821650002701935650001401962650002601976650001602002650002402018650002602042650002902068653002502097653002602122700001602148700001402164700001902178773012402197856008502321852000902406655001202415IND60689899520221119235753.0200424e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068989952DNAL7 a10.1080/1040841X.2019.15998132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuan10aAntibiotic adjuvants: an alternative approach to overcome multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria  ap. 301-314.  aAntibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens has emerged and constituted a global crisis, thereby novel antibiotics and other anti-infective strategies are urgently needed. However, the growing gap between clinical need and drug innovation, coupled with the membrane permeability barrier in Gram-negative bacteria restricts the discovery of Gram-negative antibiotics. Antibiotic adjuvants approach provides an alternative and complementary strategy for new antibiotic discovery. These compounds restore or potentiate the activity of commonly used antibiotics against multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria by targeting resistance or enhancing action of antibiotics. In this review, we first provide a brief overview of antibiotic resistance mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria, which can be used to guide the development of new antibiotic adjuvants. Additionally, we summarize the recent achievements in the search for antibiotic adjuvants based on their modes of action. Lastly, we discuss our perspectives in developing next-generation adjuvants such as broad-spectrum adjuvants and hybridization approach, which would contribute to enrich our arsenal against MDR Gram-negative bacteria.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0501310) and A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0501310cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  cA Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD) 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadjuvants 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3amultiple drug resistance 0aAntibiotic adjuvants 0amulti-drug resistance1 aLi, Ruichao1 aXiao, Xia1 aWang, Zhiqiang0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2019 May 4, v. 45, no. 3 p.301-314dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2019.15998133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245014900167300001700316520149900333592002801832650001901860650001601879650001601895650001101911650001001922650001501932650001201947650000901959650001201968650001901980650001101999650001102010651001802021653001602039653001902055653004002074653001102114653002002125700002602145700002402171700002302195773012502218856007802343852000902421655001202430IND60130404520221119224225.0151127e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013040452DNAL7 a10.2983/035.031.04122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLander, Terralynn R.10aEnhanced Growth Rates and Condition Index of Blue Mussels (Mytilus edulis) Held at Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture Sites in the Bay of Fundy  ap. 997-1007.  aAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms in the Southwest Bay of Fundy area of New Brunswick were investigated for possible advantages of nutritional enrichment for the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) when grown in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. Mussels grown in IMTA systems may be exposed to higher concentrations of organic matter at the salmon farms that can enhance growth rates and decrease time to market for the grower. In this experiment, mussels were sock-cultured at 2 distances from 2 separate salmon farms (0 m and 200 m), with 3 growth parameters (shell length, wet meat weight, and condition index) measured monthly and compared with the same growth parameters in mussels grown at a reference site outside the aquaculture influence. After a12-mo period, mussels grown directly on the cages grew faster than mussels 200 m away on all parameters except shell length at 1 location. Mussels grown at 0 m and 200 m performed significantly better (P < 0.05) in all growth parameters compared with mussels grown at a reference site outside the aquaculture influence. Differences in growth and condition index were most pronounced in the fall and winter, when ambient seston concentrations were low. Results of a second study in which growth rates for individually tagged mussels was monitored for a 6-mo period confirmed that there is a significant growth benefit for mussels in integrated aquaculture with salmon compared with mussels grown 500 m away at a reference site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aSalmo salar 3aaquaculture 3aautumn 3acages 3afish farms 3amarkets 3ameat 3amussels 3aorganic matter 3asalmon 3awinter 3aNew Brunswick 0ablue mussel 0aMytilus edulis 0aintegrated multitrophic aquaculture 0agrowth 0acondition index1 aRobinson, Shawn M.

We tested this approach in the context of multiple stressors (i.e. chemical and physical) in a selection of six run-of-river reservoirs with different levels of sediment contamination and associated upstream and downstream river sites. A niche-based approach was tested using three functional traits (habitat, food preferences and body size) and discrepancy between the realized and theoretical niches. We first identified three groups of taxa and then recorded differences along the disturbance gradients, such as an increase in competition, a narrowing of spatial and trophic niche breadth (e.g. of Leuctra major and Gammarus pulex), a widening of spatial niche breadth (e.g. of Ephemerella ignita), a greater proportion of small individuals (e.g. of G. pulex) and a decreasing or an increasing (e.g. L. major) discrepancy between realized and theoretical niches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemerella 3aGammarus pulex 3aLeuctra 3abody size 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3afood choices 3amacroinvertebrates 3aniches 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3auncertainty 0aRisk assessment 0aRealized niche 0aTheoretical niche 0aSediment contamination 0aDam presence1 aVigneron, Amandine1 aFelten, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2601-72251 aDevin, Simon0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Feb., v. 185 p.24-34dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011000162500001400272520116600286592002801452650000901480650002301489650002801512650002501540650001701565650001901582650002001601650001901621650001701640650001101657650001101668650002301679650001801702650001101720650001901731650003201750700001701782700001801799700001601817773011901833856007701952852000902029655001202038IND60732066920221120150949.0210326e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073206692DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100305662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Haiying 10aIncreases of Lipophilic Antioxidants and Anticancer Activity of Coix Seed Fermented by Monascus purpureus  aNAL-light  aLipophilic tocols, γ-oryzanol, and coixenolide in coix seed before and after fermentation by Monascus purpureus were determined. Antioxidant and anticancer activities of raw and fermented coix seed were evaluated using free-radical-scavenging assays and polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation model, and human laryngeal carcinoma cell HEp2, respectively. Compared to the raw seed, the tocols, γ-oryzanol, and coixenolide contents increased approximately 4, 25, and 2 times, respectively, in the fermented coix seed. Especially, γ-tocotrienol and γ-oryzanol reached 72.5 and 655.0 μg/g in the fermented coix seed. The lipophilic extract from fermented coix seed exhibited higher antioxidant activity in scavenging free radicals and inhibiting lipid oxidation. The inhibitory concentrations for 50% cell survival (IC₅₀) of lipophilic extract from fermented coix seed in inhibiting HEp2 cells decreased by 42%. This study showed that coix seed fermented by M. purpureus increased free and readily bioavailable lipophilic antioxidants and anticancer activity.

Lamouroux  ap. 23-39.  aReview  aThe genus Caulerpa is highly diverse, especially in the Caribbean Sea, the Indo-Malay archipelago and the temperate waters of southern Australia. Currently, more than 100 species are recognized worldwide. Despite recent advances in taxonomy and phylogeny, there is still confusion about the delimitation and identification of some species due to tremendous phenotypic plasticity. Caulerpa is known to occupy a wide range of environmental niches and to have great invasive potential. More studies are necessary to understand better the ecology (invasiveness, the functional role of its microbiome) and the biology (reproduction, life cycle, and metabolism) of Caulerpa species, especially for economical species. Very few species, mainly C. lentillifera and C. racemosa known as green caviar, have been cultivated. Caulerpa is consumed mostly in Asia and Oceania, but its popularity tends to be on the increase in western countries with new nutritional practices (vegetarians, vegans, health foods). Being naturally enriched in essential nutrients and various health-promoting compounds, Caulerpa species are promising candidates for the design of functional foods and in the health and well-being sectors. The diversity of Caulerpa offers a remarkable potential for valorization with innovation opportunities. Caulerpa farming can bring significant economic and environmental (e.g., bioremediation, blue carbon pump) benefits if these farms are established in a sustainable approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaulerpa racemosa 3abioremediation 3ablue carbon 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afish roe 3ahealth foods 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3aniches 3anutrients 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3areproduction 3ataxonomy 3avegan diet 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aCaribbean Sea 3aPacific Ocean Islands1 aDraisma, Stefano G.

Control of the absolute and relative stereochemistry of the two new 1,3-stereogenic centers was achieved through: (1) direct chiral catalyst controlled asymmetric borylation of the first stereocenter on the unsaturated imine with high e.e.; and (2) a double diastereoselectively controlled borylation of an unsaturated ester employing a chiral catalyst to largely overcome directing effects from the first chiral boryl center to give poor (mismatched) to good (matched) diastereocontrol. Subsequently, the two C–B functions were transformed into C–O systems to allow unambiguous stereochemical assignment of the two borylation reactions involving oxidation and acetal formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3adiastereoselectivity 3aesters 3ahydrolysis 3aimines 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3astereochemistry 3atrapping1 aWhiting, Andrew0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7265-7279dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b008543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04639naa a2201009 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001700189245014900206300001800355506007600373520182000449592002802269506003702297650002002334650001302354650001102367650001502378650002002393650002002413650002002433650002102453650001102474650001002485650001802495650001702513650000902530650001302539650001502552650001302567650002102580650001502601650000902616650001902625650001002644650002002654650001602674650001502690650002002705653000902725653001002734653000902744653000702753653000702760653000902767653000702776653000902783653000802792653001002800653000802810653001602818653002302834653002202857653004102879653002602920700002102946700001702967700002102984700002003005700002203025700001803047700002303065700001903088700002003107700001803127700001903145700002403164700002503188700002003213700001903233700001903252700001903271700001903290700002803309700002003337700002303357700001703380773012803397856008303525852000903608655001203617IND60690704620221207095638.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069070462DNAL7 a324199062pmid7 aPMC72182322pmcid7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTitz, Bjoern10aMulti-omics systems toxicology study of mouse lung assessing the effects of aerosols from two heat-not-burn tobacco products and cigarette smoke  ap. 1056-1073.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCigarette smoke (CS) causes adverse health effects and, for smoker who do not quit, modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) can be an alternative to reduce the risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Standard toxicological endpoints can lack sensitivity, with systems toxicology approaches yielding broader insights into toxicological mechanisms. In a 6-month systems toxicology study on ApoE⁻/⁻ mice, we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis to assess the effects of aerosols from the Carbon Heated Tobacco Product (CHTP) 1.2 and Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2—a potential and a candidate MRTP based on the heat-not-burn (HnB) principle—compared with CS at matched nicotine concentrations. Molecular exposure effects in the lungs were measured by mRNA/microRNA transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. Integrative data analysis included Multi-Omics Factor Analysis and multi-modality functional network interpretation. Across all five data modalities, CS exposure was associated with an increased inflammatory and oxidative stress response, and lipid/surfactant alterations. Upon HnB aerosol exposure these effects were much more limited or absent, with reversal of CS-induced effects upon cessation and switching to CHTP 1.2. Functional network analysis revealed CS-induced complex immunoregulatory interactions across the investigated molecular layers (e.g., itaconate, quinolinate, and miR-146) and highlighted the engagement of the heme–Hmox–bilirubin oxidative stress axis by CS. This work exemplifies how multi-omics approaches can be leveraged within systems toxicology studies and the generated multi-omics data set can facilitate the development of analysis methods and can yield further insights into the effects of toxicological exposures on the lung of mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aaerosols 3acarbon 3acigarettes 3adata collection 3afactor analysis 3aheating systems 3aimmunomodulation 3alipids 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolomics 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amultiomics 3anicotine 3aoxidative stress 3aproteomics 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asmoke 3astress response 3asurfactants 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics 0aCHTP 0acMRTP 0aCOPD 0aCS 0aLC 0aMOFA 0aMS 0aPCSF 0aROS 0asGCCA 0aTHS 0aMulti-omics 0aSystems toxicology 0aCigarette smoking 0aModified risk tobacco product (MRTP) 0aInhalation toxicology1 aSzostak, Justyna1 aSewer, Alain1 aPhillips, Blaine1 aNury, Catherine1 aSchneider, Thomas1 aDijon, Sophie1 aLavrynenko, Oksana1 aElamin, Ashraf1 aGuedj, Emmanuel1 aTsin Wong, Ee1 aLebrun, Stefan1 aVuillaume, Grégory1 aKondylis, Athanasios1 aGubian, Sylvain1 aCano, Stephane1 aLeroy, Patrice1 aKeppler, Brian1 aIvanov, N.

This study examined the primary infection by ODV of midgut cells of bertha armyworm Mamestra configurata fourth instar larvae and measured the expression of viral genes over a time course of infection. Both digital PCR and RNA sequencing methods showed the profile of transcription to be different from those produced by AcMNPV BV infection of in vitro cell cultures. This included having unique collections of genes expressed early, as well as much greater late gene expression of p6.9 and much reduced expression of polh and p10. These differences likely reflect characteristics unique to the critical step of in vivo midgut cell infection, and provide insights into the processes that regulate viral gene expression in different host tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aMamestra configurata 3acell culture 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amidgut 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asecondary infection 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses 0aBaculovirus 0aMacoNPV 0aRNA sequencing 0aDigital PCR 0aTranscriptomics 0aOcclusion derived virus1 aKaplanoglu, Emine1 aTheilmann, David A.1 aBaldwin, Doug1 aSieminska, Edyta1 aHegedus, Dwayne D.1 aErlandson, Martin A.0 tVirology.g2016 Dec., v. 499 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001600258520141900274592002801693650003801721650001101759650001301770650002001783650001001803650001201813650001201825650001801837650001301855650002201868650001201890650001901902650002801921650001801949650001801967650001401985650001701999650002102016700002102037700001802058700001602076700002202092700002102114700002102135773015002156856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60549011420221122123642.0160906e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901142DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-04-16-0071-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakanashi, Kojiro12aA Dicarboxylate Transporter, LjALMT4, Mainly Expressed in Nodules of Lotus japonicus  ap. 584-592.  aLegume plants can establish symbiosis with soil bacteria called rhizobia to obtain nitrogen as a nutrient directly from atmospheric N₂ via symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Legumes and rhizobia form nodules, symbiotic organs in which fixed-nitrogen and photosynthetic products are exchanged between rhizobia and plant cells. The photosynthetic products supplied to rhizobia are thought to be dicarboxylates but little is known about the movement of dicarboxylates in the nodules. In terms of dicarboxylate transporters, an aluminum-activated malate transporter (ALMT) family is a strong candidate responsible for the membrane transport of carboxylates in nodules. Among the seven ALMT genes in the Lotus japonicus genome, only one, LjALMT4, shows a high expression in the nodules. LjALMT4 showed transport activity in a Xenopus oocyte system, with LjALMT4 mediating the efflux of dicarboxylates including malate, succinate, and fumarate, but not tricarboxylates such as citrate. LjALMT4 also mediated the influx of several inorganic anions. Organ-specific gene expression analysis showed LjALMT4 mRNA mainly in the parenchyma cells of nodule vascular bundles. These results suggest that LjALMT4 may not be involved in the direct supply of dicarboxylates to rhizobia in infected cells but is responsible for supplying malate as well as several anions necessary for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, via nodule vasculatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aanions 3acitrates 3agene expression 3agenes 3alegumes 3amalates 3amessenger RNA 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aoocytes 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological transport 3asoil bacteria 3asuccinic acid 3asymbiosis 3atransporters 3avascular bundles1 aSasaki, Takayuki1 aKan, Tomohiro1 aSaida, Yuka1 aSugiyama, Akifumi1 aYamamoto, Yōko,1 aYazaki, Kazufumi0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.584-592dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-04-16-0071-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010400178520140500282592002801687650002501715650002001740650001401760650001901774650001501793650001501808650001301823650001401836650001601850650001701866653001701883653001501900653002001915653002101935700003201956700001701988773009402005856008202099852000902181655001202190IND60725301120221122033318.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemoine-Rodriguez, Richard10aUrban form datasets of 194 cities delineated based on the contiguous urban fabric for 1990 and 2015  aThe present research datasets were processed for the article “The global homogenization of urban form. An assessment of 194 cities across time” [1]. They consist of land cover spatial layers, longitude and latitude point data and tabulated data with computed landscape metrics and the characterization of urban form of 194 cities for 1990 and 2015. Contiguous urban fabric at 30 m spatial resolution was derived from the Atlas of Urban Expansion database for 1990 and 2015 [2]. Landscape metrics were computed as quantitative measures of composition and spatial arrangement of each city and dimensions of the database were reduced employing correlation and principal components analysis. Hierarchical clustering was employed to group cities according to the similarity of their urban form and analysis of variance was applied to test for significant differences between them. The spatial layers contained in this article can be complemented with past and future land cover data to model urban form change at broader temporal scales. The landscape metrics are useful for cross-city comparisons at regional, national and global levels in combination with other complementary indicators. The datasets are valuable for urban planners, urban ecologists, NGO's, decision makers and other with interest on local and global landscape change in urban areas, particularly urban expansion and its impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ahomogenization 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3alongitude 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 0aUrban fabric 0aUrban form 0aUrban expansion 0aLandscape change1 aInostroza Fernández, Luis,1 aZepp, Harald0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106369-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245009800168300001600266500002000282520138500302592002801687650001701715650002301732650001201755650001401767650001501781650000901796650001001805650002601815650002701841650001301868650002201881651001201903651001201915651001101927700002301938700001201961700001701973773011501990856007302105852000902178655001202187IND60595547320221121201926.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059554732DNAL7 a10.1111/age.126592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlskov‐Mortensen, P.10aIdentification of the mutation causing progressive retinal atrophy in Old Danish Pointing Dog  ap. 237-241.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a common cause of blindness in many dog breeds. It is most often inherited as a simple Mendelian trait, but great genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated both within and between breeds. In many breeds the genetic cause of the disease is not known, and until now, the Old Danish Pointing Dog (ODP) has been one of those breeds. ODP is one of the oldest dog breeds in Europe. Seventy years ago the breed almost vanished, but today a population still exists, primarily in Denmark but with some dogs in Germany and Sweden. PRA has been diagnosed in ODP since the late 1990s. It resembles late onset PRA in other dog breeds, and it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In the present study, we performed whole‐genome sequencing and identified a single base insertion (c.3149_3150insC) in exon 1 of C17H2orf71. This is the same mutation previously found to cause PRA in Gordon Setters and Irish Setters, and it was later found in Tibetan Terrier, Standard Poodle and the Polski Owczarek Nizinny. The presence of the mutation in such a diverse range of breeds indicates an origin preceding creation of modern dog breeds. Hence, we screened 262 dogs from 44 different breeds plus four crossbred dogs, and can subsequently add Miniature Poodle and another polish sheepdog, the Polski Owczarek Podhalanski, to the list of affected breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIrish Setter 3aPoodle (dog breed) 3aatrophy 3ablindness 3acrossbreds 3adogs 3aexons 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amutation 3asequence analysis 3aDenmark 3aGermany 3aSweden1 aProschowsky, H.

The etiology underlying HL includes congenital and acquired causes; genetic factors are the main cause in over 50% of congenital cases. Pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene are a major cause of congenital non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL), while their distribution is highly heterogeneous in different populations. To the best of our knowledge, there is no data regarding the genetic etiologies of HL in Peru. In this study, we screened 133 Peruvian families with NSHL living in Lima. We sequenced both exons of the GJB2 gene for all probands. Seven probands with familial NSHL that remained negative for GJB2 variants underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS). We identified biallelic pathogenic variants in GJB2 in 43 probands; seven were heterozygous for only one allele. The c.427C>T variant was the most common pathogenic variant followed by the c.35delG variant. WGS revealed three novel variants in MYO15A in two probands, one of them was predicted to affect splicing and the others produce a premature stop codon. The Peruvian population showed a complex profile for genetic variants in the GJB2 gene, this particular profile might be a consequence of the admixture history in Peru.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aetiology 3aexons 3agenetic factors 3agenetic variation 3ahearing disorders 3aheterozygosity 3asequence analysis 3astop codon 3aPeru1 aBademci, Guney 1 aRajabli, Farid 1 aCornejo-Olivas, Mario 1 aChacón Villanueva, Ruy  Diego1 aBadillo-Carrillo, Rodolfo 1 aInca-Martinez, Miguel 1 aMilla Neyra, Karina 1 aSineni, Claire 1 aTekin, Mustafa 0 tGenes.g2019 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245012000181300001500301506002800316520117100344592002801515506003701543650002501580650001201605650001301617650000901630653004901639653002501688653001401713700001801727700002001745773010401765856009001869852000901959655001201968IND60774385220221207084058.0180129e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077438522DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.habitat.2017.028.3.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasetyo, Agus Subhan10aEffectiveness of Interpersonal Communication of Head of Farmer Group To Maintaining Existence Sidodadi Farmer Group  ap. 99-105.  aResource is Open Access  aThe success of the farmer group depends on communication skills of the head of farmer group.

The calculations are carried out within the PBE-GGA, WC-GGA, and PBE-sol GGA for the exchange correlation potential. The calculated ground state properties such as lattice constant (a₀), bulk modulus (B), and its pressure derivative (B′) are in good agreement with the experimental and other available theoretical results. All the compounds are found to be ductile in nature in accordance with Pugh’s criteria. The computed electronic band structures as well as density of states show that these compounds are metallic with sturdy hybridization near the Fermi level. The bonding features of these compounds are analyzed using the electronic charge density plots in the (100) crystallographic plane and their analysis revealed that the chemical bond between Y and X is mainly ionic along with weak covalent bonding. The Fermi surfaces for these compounds at ambient pressure are also studied. The linear optical properties of these compounds are also studied at the ambient conditions. The variations of elastic constants, elastic moduli, and Debye temperatures of these compounds as a function of pressure are also reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3ahybridization 3alead 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoptical properties 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3atin1 aPagare, Gitanjali1 aChouhan, Sunil Singh1 aSanyal, S.

The present study reports the first successful captive brood stock development, spawning, and larval rearing of P. marcia. Brood stock was developed in a 5-ton recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) using 12 wild caught juveniles. After 6 months of rearing, the fish (8–9.5 cm size) started courtship behavior. Spawning occurred at 1900 to 2100 h. The eggs (mean size - 617.9 ± 14.9 μ) were transparent, pelagic, non-adhesive and with single oil globule. The eggs hatched out after an incubation period of about 14–16 h at a water temperature of 29 °C. Newly hatched larvae measured 1206.6 ± 100.02 μ in total average length and increased to 1852.9 ± 24.68 μ at 48 h post hatch (ph). Mouth opened at 48–50 h post hatch (ph) and measured 76 to 80 μ. Larval rearing trials were conducted using rotifer (L and S type), wild zooplankton, copepod nauplii, artemia nauplii and microparticulate diet. Primordial fin development started by the 10th day post-hatching (dph) (larval size ~2.9 mm) while the opercular and dorsal spines were fully formed by 15 dph (total length of the larva was 4.4 mm). Larvae metamorphosed to miniature adult shape by 32–34 dph and on 50 dph they reached the pink colored juvenile stage (42–43 mm) and at this stage, they were transferred to nursery rearing tank. Four treatments with different feed combination were tried and treatment III with wild copepod gave an average survival of 5.2 ± 1.07% and treatment IV with Parvocalanus crassirostris gave an average survival of 7.3 (±2.51) %.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aCopepoda 3aPseudanthias 3aRotifera 3aadults 3abreeding stock 3acolor 3acourtship 3adiet 3aeggs 3ajuveniles 3anauplii 3aoils 3aornamental fish 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aspawning 3azooplankton 0aSerranidae 0aPseudanthias 0aLarval rearing 0aRAS 0aBreeding 0aSeed production1 aGomathi, P.1 aRaheem, P.K.1 aRaju, B.1 aPhilipose, K.K.1 aGopalakrishnan, A.0 tAquaculture.g2018 July 01, v. 492 p.265-272dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245010000176300001600276520172400292592002802016650001602044650001102060650000902071650001402080650001302094650001202107650000802119700001602127700001802143773010302161856008102264852000902345655001202354IND60119172220221119140532.0150503e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011917222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8640-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannodi-Kanakkithodi, A.10aCompounds based on Group 14 elements: building blocks for advanced insulator dielectrics design  ap. 801-807.  aBeing in the group with the most diverse set of properties among all in the periodic table, the Group 14 elements (C, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb) are particularly interesting candidates for structure–property investigation. Motivated by the need to create new insulators for energy storage and electronics applications, we study a few compounds based on Group 14 elements in this work, namely the dihydrides, dichlorides, and difluorides. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we establish patterns in their properties, including favored coordination chemistry, stability, electronic structure, and dielectric behavior. While a coordination number (CN) of 4 is commonly associated with Group 14 elements, there is a significant deviation from it down the group, with CNs as high as 7 and 8 common in Pb. Further, there is an increase in the relative stability of the +2 oxidation state as opposed to +4 when we go from C to Pb, a direct consequence of which is the existence of the di-compounds of C and Si as polymers, whereas the compounds of Ge, Sn, and Pb are strictly 3D crystalline solids. The coordination chemistries are further linked with the band gaps and dielectric constants (divided into two components: the electronic part and the ionic part) of these compounds. We also see that the more stable difluorides and dichlorides have large band gaps and small electronic dielectric constants, and most of the Ge and Sn compounds have remarkably large ionic dielectric constants by virtue of having polar and more flexible bonds. The staggering variation in properties displayed by these parent compounds offers opportunities for designing derivative materials with a desired combination of properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3alead 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3asilicon 3atin1 aWang, C.

The ability to selectively switch on such pathways upon demand has proven to be a valuable tool in biological systems. Light as a trigger provides the ultimate spatial and temporal control of activation. However, there have been limited examples of phototriggered catalytic systems. Herein, we describe the synthesis and application of a caged proline system that can initiate organocatalysis upon irradiation. The caged proline was generated using the highly efficient 4-carboxy-5,7-dinitroindolinyl (CDNI) photocleavable protecting group in a four-step synthesis. Advantages of this system include water solubility, biocompatibility, high quantum yield for catalyst release, and responsiveness to two-photon excitation. We showed the light-triggered catalysis of a crossed aldol reaction, a Mannich reaction, and a self-aldol condensation reaction. We also demonstrated light-initiated catalysis, leading to the formation of a biocide in situ, which resulted in the growth inhibition of E. coli, with as little as 3 min of irradiation. This technique can be broadly applied to other systems, by which the formation of active forms of drugs can be catalytically assembled remotely via two-photon irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abiocides 3abiocompatibility 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3acondensation reactions 3adrugs 3agrowth retardation 3airradiation 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aproline 3astereoselectivity 3awater solubility1 aRfaish, Saad Y.1 aByrd, Chanel1 aYang, Shukun1 aStarrett, Anthony K.1 aGuisbert, Eric1 aNesnas, Nasri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3511-940X0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 84, no. 9 p.5236-5244dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005000170300001800220500001900238520049800257536024300755592002800998596003301026650001601059650001501075650001501090650001301105650001301118653001301131653002501144653001901169653001901188700001701207700002101224700002001245700002001265700001901285700002401304700001801328700002301346700001901369773014301388856008501531852000901616655001201625IND60711975620221122073051.0201009e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071197562DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2019.16713742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBa, Nguyen Van10aFlavonol glycosides from Fissistigma maclurei  ap. 1011-1017.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo new flavonol glycosides, fissmacosides A (1) and B (2) along with two known flavonol glycosides, kaempferol 3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-d-galactopyranoside (3) and kaempferol 3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-[4-(E)-feruloyl]-β-d-galactopyranoside (4) were isolated from the methanol extract of the leaves of Fissistigma maclurei Merr.

Herein, the polycondensation of dithiooxamide and benzyl aldehydes of C₂, C₃, and D₂ₕ symmetry afforded three TzTz-linked CMPs, namely TzTz-CMP-1, TzTz-CMP-2, and TzTz-CMP-3. Importantly, the porous and flexible characteristics of TzTz-linked CMPs enable the smooth selective aerobic oxidation of amines in ethanol (C₂H₅OH), a clean but redox-active solvent. All three TzTz-linked CMPs significantly surpass the benchmark mesoporous graphite carbonnitride (mpg-C₃N₄) photocatalyst. Intriguingly, TzTz-CMP-2 displays the best photocatalytic activity for the blue-light-mediated selective transformation of primary and secondary amines into imines. The conversions of amines were up to 90% with excellent selectivities for imines. This work highlights that CMPs with TzTz linkages may offer efficient photocatalytic selective transformations under genuinely ambient conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3aethanol 3agraphene 3aimines 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymers 3aporous media 3asolvents 3athiazoles 0aConjugated microporous polymers 0aThiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole linkage 0aVisible light 0aSelective oxidation 0aPhotocatalysis1 aHao, Huimin1 aLang, Xianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-90440 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July, v. 593 p.380-389dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011100168300001600279520121900295592002801514650002001542650001201562650000901574650002401583650002001607650001501627650001901642650001701661650001201678650001001690650002201700651001001722651001001732651002101742653003401763653002401797653001001821653002901831700001401860700001701874700001701891700001801908700005501926700005701981773009902038856009002137852000902227655001202236IND60593369420221122080441.0190318e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059336942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Sha10aGenetic sex identification and the potential sex determination system in the yellow drum (Nibea albiflora)  ap. 253-258.  aSex-specific markers have important implications in genetic improvements of economical traits in aquacultured fish. Yellow drum (Nibea albiflora) is a commercially important fish species distributed in China, Southern Japan and Korea, exhibiting a sex-dependent dimorphic growth pattern where females grow much faster than males. Yet its sex determination mechanism was unclear and sex-specific markers were missing. In this study, a 45 bp deletion within the first intron of Dmrt1 was detected only in males through comparative analysis between males and females. Two pairs of primers (male-specific primers MS-F/R and male and female shared-primers MFS-F/R) were designed to efficiently distinguish the genetic sex of the yellow drum. Importantly, genotyping the deletion in large cohorts of both artificially bred and wild yellow drum confirmed its male-specific property. Our results showed that this male-specific genetic marker could be used to establish a simple and reproducible method for genetic sex identification. Furthermore, the fact in which males are heterozygotes and females are homozygotes of the marker indicates that yellow drum adopted the male heterogametic XX/XY sex determination system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNibea albiflora 3afemales 3afish 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aintrons 3amales 3asex determination 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 0aYellow drum (Nibea albiflora) 0aSex-specific marker 0aDmrt1 0aSex determination system1 aLi, Wanbo1 aXiao, Shijun1 aLin, Aiqiang1 aHan, Zhaofang1 aCai, Mingyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7814-589X1 aWang, Zhiyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2535-18970 tAquaculture.g2018 July 01, v. 492 p.253-258dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009600182300001800278500001500296520125200311592002801563650002301591650002201614650001901636650002501655650001901680650001001699650001401709650002101723650001501744650002101759650002701780650002001807650001201827650005001839650001101889650000901900650002401909650003201933650004201965650004302007653002002050700001902070700002002089773010402109856008102213852000902294655001202303IND4391924720221121080015.0151024e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439192472DNAL7 a174434012pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-007-9295-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWee, Suk-Ling10aPharmacophagy of Methyl Eugenol by Males Enhances Sexual Selection of Bactrocera carambolae  ap. 1272-1282.  a2019-12-06  aAfter pharmacophagy of methyl eugenol (ME), males of Bactrocera carambolae (Diptera: Tephritidae) produced (E)-coniferyl alcohol (CF) along with its endogenously synthesized pheromonal compounds. CF was shown to be released into the air by the ME-fed males only during the courtship period at dusk and attracted significantly more males and females than the ME-deprived males in wind tunnel assays. However, earlier onset of sexual attraction and a higher mating success were observed only in the wind tunnel and field cage assays on the third day posttreatment of ME. Field cage observations on the male-to-male interaction indicated that the ME-deprived males did not exhibit aggregation behavior, but that ME feeding promoted aggregation behavior in B. carambolae. Field cage observations revealed that the ME-deprived males were not only attracted to the ME-fed males, but also appeared to feed on their anal secretions. The secretions were subsequently confirmed to contain CF along with endogenously produced pheromonal compounds. Results obtained for B. carambolae were compared to those previously obtained from its sibling species, Bactrocera dorsalis, and are discussed in light of species advancement in fruit fly–plant relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3avolatile compounds 3aconiferyl alcohol 3amethyl eugenol 3aaggregation behavior 3asex pheromones 3amales 3acourtship 3asexual selection 3aBactrocera 3afeeding behavior 3amating competitiveness 3asex attractants 2aAnimals 2aEugenolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aSex Attractantsxmetabolism 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aTephritidaexdrug effectsxphysiology. 0amating behavior1 aTan, Keng-Hong1 aNishida, Ritsuo0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2007 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.1272-1282dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-007-9295-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245008600161300001800247520041000265592002800675650002600703650002300729650002300752650001400775650000900789650002300798650002200821700001400843700001500857700006000872773013300932856007901065852000901144655001201153IND60639747020221117071022.0190503e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063974702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, He-Ye10aDirectional Transportation of a Helic[6]arene along a Nonsymmetric Molecular Axle  ap. 5872-5876.  aDirectional transportation of a helic[6]arene along a nonsymmetric molecular axle was achieved, which was easily performed in dichloromethane by a stopper reaction and subsequent addition of fluoride ions.

The protocol involved screening mutagenized bacterial cells on solid minimal medium containing 5 % (v/v) glycerol. Colonies were picked onto duplicate solid minimal medium plates and one plate was stained with 1 % (w/v) phloroglucinol. Those colonies staining red were further screened and a mutant, HPAO-1, was identified. The mutant strain produced a several-fold higher 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde concentration than did the parent strain when grown on 5 % (v/v) glycerol. The ratio of culture volume to flask volume influenced 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde production by the mutant cells compared to the parent cells. Aldehyde production was highest when the mutant strain was grown on 5 % (v/v) glycerol at a ratio of culture volume to flask volume of 1:3 or 1:12.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aglycerol 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3ascreening 2aBiomass 2aCitrobacter freundiixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aColoring Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlyceraldehydexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPhloroglucinolxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPropanexanalysisxmetabolism.1 aPeterson, Jessica L.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2014 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.147-152dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1343-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245015600180300001600336520123800352592002801590650001501618650001301633650001201646650001301658650002801671650001301699650001701712650001101729650002501740650001401765650001401779650002301793650001401816650002201830650002301852651001001875700002301885700002001908700001701928700003301945700001801978773009101996856008702087852000902174655001202183IND60547083520221120071935.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054708352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina Chamizo, Pilar,10aSpatial and temporal variability in subtidal macroinvertebrates diversity patterns in a management and exploitation area for benthic resources (MEABRs)  ap. 121-128.  aDiversity and biological variability are key attributes to maintain a viable life system in the marine benthic zone and this balance is heavily affected by human activities. In Chile, Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABRs) are coastal areas administrated by local fishermen, which regulate the extraction of species of commercial of commercial importance (e.g. Concholepas concholepas, Fissurella spp. Loxechinus albus), key components of food webs. Both spatial and temporal impacts these species have on the structure and dynamics of the subtidal community are poorly understood. In one of the oldest MEABRs of Chile we evaluated spatial and temporal effects of controlled extraction of commercial species on subtidal macro invertebrate's diversity. Our results indicate that in a spatial scale MEABRs showed increased species richness, and important temporal changes in diversity and species composition from bivalves, ascidians and gastropods to cnidarians, sponges and bryozoans. We discuss possible mechanisms associated with the combined effects of fishery management and predation by key species on temporal composition variation in the subtidal macro invertebrate assemblage in this regulated area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3aBivalvia 3aBryozoa 3aCnidaria 3aConcholepas concholepas 3aPorifera 3abenthic zone 3acoasts 3afisheries management 3afishermen 3afood webs 3amacroinvertebrates 3apredation 3aspecies diversity 3atemporal variation 3aChile1 aOjeda, F.

Recent advances have allowed these short-lived ions to be directly detected in solution from laser flash photolysis of suitable photochemical precursors, but all of the studies to date have focused on aryloxenium ions having closed-shell singlet ground state configurations. To study alternative spin configurations, we synthesized a photoprecursor to the m-dimethylamino phenyloxenium ion, which is predicted by both density functional theory and MRMP2 computations to have a triplet ground state electronic configuration. A combination of femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, nanosecond time-resolved Resonance Raman spectroscopy (ns-TR³), cryogenic matrix EPR spectroscopy, computational analysis, and photoproduct studies allowed us to trace essentially the complete arc of the photophysics and photochemistry of this photoprecursor and permitted a first look at a triplet oxenium ion. Ultraviolet photoexcitation of this precursor populates higher singlet excited states, which after internal conversion to S₁ over 800 fs are followed by bond heterolysis in ∼1 ps, generating a hot closed-shell singlet oxenium ion that undergoes vibrational cooling in ∼50 ps followed by intersystem crossing in ∼300 ps to generate the triplet ground state oxenium ion. In contrast to the rapid trapping of singlet phenyloxenium ions by nucleophiles seen in prior studies, the triplet oxenium ion reacts via sequential H atom abstractions on the microsecond time domain to ultimately yield the reduced m-dimethylaminophenol as the only detectable stable photoproduct. Band assignments were made by comparisons to computed spectra of candidate intermediates and comparisons to related known species. The triplet oxenium ion was also detected in the ns-TR³ experiments, permitting a more clear assignment and identifying the triplet state as the π,π* triplet configuration. The triplet ground state of this ion was further supported by photolysis of the photoprecursor in an ethanol glass at ∼4 K and observing a triplet species by cryogenic EPR spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3achemical elements 3acooling 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenzymology 3aethanol 3aglass 3aions 3aphotolysis1 aAlbright, Toshia R.1 aHanway, Patrick

From the apparent diffusion coefficients at different concentrations, the diffusion coefficients of surfactant monomers and micelles were deduced and compared to conventional nonionic surfactants. These transport properties were correlated with results from foamability studies in Bartsch tests as well as sparging tests. The obtained foam volumes show a good correlation with the diffusion coefficients of the surfactant monomers multiplied with the concentration of available monomers, the cmc. The same relation is found for the foam stability, expressed in the foam half lifetime. The correlations show for surfactant solutions well above the critical micelle concentration that the transport of surfactant monomers to the interface rather than the micelles is the essential step in both, the foam formation as well as the foam stabilization, following a simple Fickian diffusion law.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acopolymerization 3adiffusivity 3aethylene oxide 3afoams 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3asurface tension 0aDynamic surface tension 0aDiffusion 0aFoam 0aFoam stability1 aKurt-Zerdeli, Sevgi N.1 aBrüggemann, Daniel1 aSpiering, Vivian J.1 aGradzielski, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7262-71151 aSchomäcker, Reinhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3106-39040 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Mar. 05, v. 588 p.124386-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1243863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245006900162300001600231520175400247592002802001650001702029650001902046650001202065650001102077650002302088650000902111650001502120650001502135650002302150650001502173650002502188650001302213650002102226650001502247650001902262650001802281650002502299650001602324650002202340653001702362653002502379653000902404653001802413653001502431653002502446700002602471700001802497700001802515700002202533700002502555773011802580856008202698852000902780655001202789IND4462386720221122024109.0151126e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446238672DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-10-00192.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimb, Ryan F.10aPyric–Herbivory and Cattle Performance in Grassland Ecosystems  ap. 659-663.  aAchieving economically optimum livestock production on rangelands can conflict with conservation strategies that require lower stocking rate to maintain wildlife habitat. Combining the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing (pyric–herbivory) is a conservation-based approach to management that increases rangeland biodiversity by creating heterogeneous vegetation structure and composition. However, livestock production under pyric–herbivory has not been reported. In both mixed-grass prairie and tallgrass prairie, we compared livestock production in pastures with traditional fire and grazing management (continuous grazing, with periodic fire on tallgrass prairie and without fire on mixed-grass prairie) and conservation-based management (pyric–herbivory applied through patch burning) at a moderate stocking rate. Stocker cattle weight gain, calf weight gain, and cow body condition score did not differ (P > 0.05) between traditional and conservation-based management at the tallgrass prairie site for the duration of the 8-yr study. At the mixed-grass prairie site, stocker cattle gain did not differ in the first 4 yr, but stocker cattle gained more (P ≤ 0.05) on conservation-based management and remained 27%% greater for the duration of the 11-yr study. Moreover, variation among years in cattle performance was less on pastures under conservation management. Traditional management in mixed-grass prairie did not include fire, the process that likely was associated with increased stocker cattle performance under conservation management. We conclude that pyric–herbivory is a conservation-based rangeland management strategy that returns fire to the landscape without reduced stocking rate, deferment, or rest.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abody condition 3aburning 3acalves 3acontinuous grazing 3acows 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3agrazing management 3alandscapes 3alivestock production 3apastures 3arange management 3arangelands 3astocker cattle 3astocking rate 3avegetation structure 3aweight gain 3awildlife habitats 0abiodiversity 0aconservation grazing 0afire 0aheterogeneity 0apatch burn 0avegetation structure1 aFuhlendorf, Samuel D.1 aEngle, D.

They mainly address two issues: the curse of dimensionality with respect to spectral features, and the limited number of labeled training samples. Among these DR techniques, the Graph-Embedding Discriminant Analysis (GEDA) framework has demonstrated its effectiveness for HSIs feature extraction. However, most of the existing GEDA-based DR methods largely rely on manually tuning the parameters so as to obtain the optimal model, which proves to be troublesome and inefficient. Motivated by the nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) model, we propose a novel supervised DR algorithm, namely Gaussian Process Graph-based Discriminate Analysis (GPGDA). Our algorithm takes full advantage of the covariance matrix in GP to constructing the graph similarity matrix in GEDA framework. In this way, more superior performance can be provided with the model parameters tuned automatically. Experiments on three real HSIs datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPGDA outperforms some classic and state-of-the-art DR methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aremote sensing 3avariance covariance matrix1 aJiang, Xinwei 1 aGao, Junbin 1 aCai, Zhihua 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Sept. 30, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013600160300001300296520099000309592002801299650001301327650001801340650002501358650001401383650000901397650002001406700001801426700001601444700001301460773013201473856007501605852000901680655001201689IND60765117720221120053808.0220714e20111205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076511772DNAL7 a10.17221/3976-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZavadilová, L.10aDefinition of subgroups for fixed regression in the test-day animal model for milk production ofHolsteincattle in theCzech Republic  ap. 7-13.  aThe investigation was based on roughly 3.9, 2.7 and 1.7 million test-day records from first, second and third lactation, respectively, sampled from 596 200 Czech Holstein cows between the years 1991 and 2002. Breeding values were estimated from multi-lactation random-regression test-day models which contained the fixed effect of herd-test day, fixed regression on days in milk and random regressions on the animal level and the permanent environmental effect. Third degree Legendre polynomials (with four coefficients) were used for both the fixed and random regressions. The models differed in fixed regression. In Analysis I, 96 subclasses were defined according to age at calving, season and year of calving within lactation. In Analysis II, days open were additionally included as a grouping factor resulting in 480 subclasses. Rank correlations over 0.98 between both analyses were observed for breeding values for sires. Grouping according to Analysis I was recommended. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal models 3aenvironmental impact 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk production1 aNěmcová, E.1 aPřibyl, J.1 aWolf, J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 50, no. 1 p.7-13dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3976-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001600296520129800312592002801610650002501638650001601663650002201679650001901701650001801720650001301738650002401751650001001775650002701785650001501812650001101827650002701838650001801865650001301883650001301896650003001909650002101939700001601960700001901976700001801995700001702013700001902030700002102049773011302070856008102183852000902264655001202273IND60119657820221122225133.0141221e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011965782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0596-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Shu Hong,10aEstablishment of an Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation procedure for the experimental model orchid Erycina pusilla  ap. 211-220.  aThe establishment of a genetic transformation system for Erycina pusilla (E. pusilla) would be a major step for orchid research and help establish the species as a potential experimental model. Here we describe the development of an efficient selection and plant regeneration protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of E. pusilla protocorms. Plants were transformed with a binary plasmid containing the Arabidopsis thaliana gene Methionine sulfoxide reductase B7 (MSRB7) using the A. tumefaciens strain EHA105. Explants were selected on hygromycin-containing New Dogashima medium (Tokuhara and Mii in Plant Cell Rep 13(1):7–11, 1993) with 6-benzylaminopurine and α-naphthaleneacetic acid for 5 months to diminish the ratio of false positive explants, and it was determined that 3 month-old E. pusilla protocorms represented the optimal stage for transformation. Positive transformants were confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analyses, and by methyl viologen tolerance assays. Since E. pusilla has a shorter life cycle than most other orchids, self-pollinated T₁progeny was obtained within only 18 months. In addition, the results indicated that overexpression of MSRB genes can be used to avoid the effects of abiotic stress in economically important plants such as orchids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOrchidaceae 3aSouthern blotting 3aabiotic stress 3abenzyladenine 3aexplants 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3amethionine 3amodels 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorgan culture 3aparaquat 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aself-pollination1 aLi, Jiawen,1 aLiau, Chia-Hui1 aChang, Pao-Yi1 aLiao, Li-Jen1 aLin, Choun-Sea1 aChan, Ming-Tsair0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 Jan., v. 120, no. 1 p.211-220dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-014-0596-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002500144245008300169300001600252520160000268592002801868650002401896650001601920650001301936650001801949650001901967650002001986650000902006650002402015650001802039650001302057650001602070650001402086650001002100650001502110650001402125650001502139650001702154650001602171650002402187650001902211650001202230650001202242650001302254653001202267653001702279653001102296653001402307653001502321700001902336700002002355700002002375700002202395773011802417856008202535852000902617655001202626IND4462386920221122023940.0151126e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446238692DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-10-00139.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenchaca, Matthew W.10aJuniper Consumption Does Not Adversely Affect Meat Quality in Boer-Cross Goats  ap. 669-673.  aGoat browsing can be used as an alternative brush management option for redberry (Juniperus pinchotii Sudw.) and ashe (Juniperus asheii Buch) juniper instead of more expensive and invasive brush control methods, assuming consumption of juniper does not adversely affect the marketability of offspring. Some wildlife species reportedly retain juniper flavor when consumed. We determined if juniper consumption affected meat quality or flavoring of Boer-cross kid carcasses. Twenty recently weaned, Boer-cross wethers were randomly assigned to one of four treatments with treatments fed different amounts of juniper (0%%, 10%%, 20%%, 30%% juniper in the diet). All goats were fed juniper for 28 d at the Angelo State University (ASU) Management, Instruction, and Research Center. All goats were also fed a feedlot ration to meet maintenance requirements (2%% body weight). Juniper intake varied (P < 0.05) between all treatments (0%%, 10%%, 20%%, 30%%) primarily because treatments were fed different amounts of juniper. Following a 28-d trial, goats were harvested at the ASU Food Safety and Product Development Laboratory. Carcass characteristics including live weight, hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, loineye area, body wall fat thickness, and leg circumference were similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. Sensory characteristics including tenderness, juiciness, flavor intensity, off-flavor, and overall acceptability were also similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. Landowners can utilize goats as a biological management tool without adversely affecting goat meat quality or flavoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus pinchotii 3abody weight 3abrowsing 3abrush control 3acarcass weight 3acontrol methods 3adiet 3adressing percentage 3afat thickness 3afeedlots 3afood safety 3agoat meat 3agoats 3aintegument 3ajuiciness 3alandowners 3ameat quality 3aoff flavors 3aproduct development 3aproduct safety 3aprogeny 3awethers 3awildlife 0acarcass 0aconditioning 0aflavor 0aJuniperus 0atenderness1 aScott, Cody B.1 aBraden, Kirk W.1 aOwens, Corey J.1 aBranham, Loree A.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2011 Nov., v. 64, no. 6 p.669-673dSociety for Range Managementx1550-74247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-10-00139.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017600159300001800335520106400353592002801417650001601445650001701461650001301478650002101491650001301512650002201525650002901547650001001576650001601586650002301602650002401625650002101649650004401670650001601714700001301730700001901743700001401762700002101776700001201797700002101809700001401830700001501844700001901859700001801878773012801896856007402024852000902098655001202107IND60656781520221121022314.0190814e20140612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065678152DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00730a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei-Hua10aSimultaneous determination of sulindac and its metabolites sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone in human plasma by a sensitive UPLC-PDA method for a pharmacokinetic study  ap. 4679-4685.  aA sensitive, rapid and reliable ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with Photo-Diode Array (PDA) detection method was developed for simultaneous determination of sulindac and its metabolites sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone in human plasma. The analytes were extracted by dichloromethane from human plasma using a liquid–liquid extraction method. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC with a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C₁₈ column (2.1 × 50 mm i.d., 1.7 μm) within 5 minutes. The mobile phase used for gradient elution consisted of ammonium formate buffer (20 mM) containing 1% acetic acid and acetonitrile. The flow rate was maintained at 0.4 mL min⁻¹. The monitor wavelength was set at 328 nm for PDA detection. All calibration curves of the analytes showed good linearity within the test ranges. The validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of sulindac, sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone in 15 healthy Chinese male subjects with oral administration of sulindac tablets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium 3achemical species 3aformates 3ahematologic tests 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amales 3ametabolites 3amethylene chloride 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awavelengths1 aShao, Li1 aLi, Shun-Xiang1 aGuo, Dong1 aWang, Lian-Sheng1 aLi, Zhi1 aPeng, Xiang-Dong1 aChen, Yao1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhou, Hong-Hao1 aTan, Zhi-Rong0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 June 12, v. 6, no. 13 p.4679-4685dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00730a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008900161300001600250520118600266592002801452650002901480650001301509650002701522650001301549650001301562650001001575650002401585650001001609650001101619700004601630773013401676856007901810852000901889655001201898IND60765117820221120053801.0220419e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076511782DNAL7 a10.17221/398/2016-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranc, Čuš10aIndigenous yeasts perform alcoholic fermentation and produce aroma compounds in wine  ap. 329-345.  aThe spontaneous alcoholic fermentations of Moscato Bianco and Welschriesling must were carried out to retrieve indigenous yeasts. We confirmed that those fermentations, conducted with non-Saccharomyces and indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts, can generate high amounts of aroma compounds in wines. Consequently, two of the S. cerevisiae isolates were randomly chosen and further examined in Welschriesling and Sauvignon Blanc must for their ability and efficiency in performing alcoholic fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation with a commercial yeast strain was carried out for comparison. Indigenous isolates showed acceptable fermentation ability and efficiency. Moreover, Sauvignon Blanc produced with indigenous isolates contained significantly higher amounts of 3-mercaptohexyl acetate, linalool, geraniol and 2-phenylethanol and a significantly lower amount of 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol. Differences in Welschriesling wine were less striking but in this case indigenous isolates produced lower amounts of 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol and α-terpineol. Taken together, our results confirm that a suitable aromatic profile of wine can be produced with indigenous S. cerevisiae strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3aalcoholic fermentation 3ageraniol 3alinalool 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3awines 3ayeasts1 aPolona Zabukovec and Hans-Josef, Schroers0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 35, no. 4 p.329-345dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/398/2016-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04068naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245011700162520217100279592002802450650001802478650002002496650001502516650001402531650002102545650001802566650001602584650001402600650001702614650001502631650001402646650001402660650002502674650001402699650001502713650001302728650005002741650002002791650001102811650001802822650001402840650001702854650001302871650001602884650002502900653002002925653002602945653002202971653003702993653002003030700005803050700001803108700002003126700001503146700002003161700002003181700001803201773010503219856008503324852000903409655001203418IND60733338620221120192715.0210624e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073333862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1065432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan10aAnticancer drugs in the aquatic ecosystem: Environmental occurrence, ecotoxicological effect and risk assessment  aAnticancer drugs are a group of therapeutic agents used to enhance cell death in targeted cell types of neoplasia. Because of frequent use and eventual discharge, they have been often detected in wastewater from pharmaceutical factories and hospitals, domestic wastewater, and surface waters. The occurrence of these drugs in aquatic ecosystems and their effects on aquatic organisms have been poorly characterized. This review focuses on the global occurrence of major classes of anticancer drugs in water and sediments of freshwater ecosystems and their ecotoxicological effects at different biological levels. While the availability of data is fairly limited, concentrations of most anticancer drugs range from < 2 ng/L to 762 µg/L in receiving water, while levels in sediments and sludge vary from 0.25 to 42.5 µg/kg. Their detection frequencies were 58%, 52% (78%) and 59% in hospital wastewater, wastewater treatment plant effluents (influents) and surface water, respectively. Predicted log Kₒw values of vincristine, imatinib mesylate and tamoxifen are higher than 3 and have estimated half-lives>60 d in waters using quantitative structure–activity relationship models, indicating high potential for persistence and bioaccumulation. Based on a species sensitivity distribution evaluation of 9 compounds, crustaceans are most sensitive to anticancer drugs. The most hazardous compound is cisplatin which has a hazard concentration at the 5th percentile. For Daphnia magna, the acute toxicities of major classes of anticancer drugs are ranked as platinum complexes > endocrine therapy agents > antibiotics > antimetabolite agents > alkylating agents. Using hazard quotient analysis based primarily on the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs), cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, imatinib mesylate, bicalutamide, etoposide and paclitaxel have the highest hazard for aquatic organisms. Further research is needed to identify appropriate chronic endpoints for risk assessment thresholds as well as to better understand the mechanisms of action and the potential multigenerational toxicity, and trophic transfer in ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3abioaccumulation 3acell death 3acisplatin 3acyclophosphamide 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3aetoposide 3afluorouracil 3afreshwater 3ahalf life 3ahospitals 3amunicipal wastewater 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3aplatinum 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3arisk assessment 3asludge 3asurface water 3atamoxifen 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3avincristine 3awastewater treatment 0aAntineoplastics 0aFreshwater ecosystems 0aAquatic organisms 0aSpecies sensitivity distribution 0aHazard quotient1 aChen, Hongxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1413-60511 aLiu, Hongsong1 aSchlenk, Daniel1 aMu, Jingli1 aLacorte, Silvia1 aYing, Guang-Guo1 aXie, Lingtian0 tEnvironment international.g2021 Aug., v. 153 p.106543-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1065433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001500247520181000262592002802072650002702100650001902127650001802146650002602164650001102190650001502201650001902216650001502235650001502250651001402265653003402279653002102313653001002334653001102344653001202355653001502367653002102382700001702403700001902420700001802439700001602457773009502473856008102568852000902649655001202658IND60558385020221120070635.0170105e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055838502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Eunsang10aDoes AMSR2 produce better soil moisture retrievals than AMSR-E over Australia?  ap. 95-105.  aThe Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), a follow-up microwave sensor to the AMSR for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), was launched on the Global Change Observation Mission 1 – Water (GCOM-W1) satellite in May 2012. It is as yet unclear if instrumental improvements in AMSR2 over AMSR-E have led to better soil moisture (SM) estimates, especially since there is no overlapping period of data between the sensors. This study focuses on comparing the results of AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM over Australia, distinguishing four Köppen climate zones to determine if AMSR2 is better than AMSR-E. This is achieved by selecting two year-long comparative time periods from the operating periods of AMSR-E and AMSR2, based on their statistical similarities in modeled SM as a proxy, using Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-L). The AMSR2 and AMSR-E C- and X-band SM derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was evaluated. Both AMSR2 C- and X-band SM products were found to show similar temporal patterns and spatial agreement with AMSR-E C- and X-band SM, supported by unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and R-values with MERRA-L SM, respectively. Using lag-based instrumental variable analysis to estimate the random error component of SM retrievals, the noise-to-signal ratios in AMSR2 X-band SM were found to be slightly higher than their AMSR-E counterparts. The improvements in AMSR2, such as the superior radiometric sensitivity and spatial resolution, have therefore not led to statistically significant differences in performance for LPRM retrievals at 1/2°×1/2° grid resolution, when compared with AMSR-E. However, similarities in the metrics for AMSR2 and AMSR-E SM suggest that AMSR2 provides a valuable continuation to AMSR-E.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth Observing System 3aclimatic zones 3aglobal change 3amicrowave radiometers 3amodels 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asoil water 3aAustralia 0aRemotely sensed soil moisture 0aMicrowave sensor 0aAMSR2 0aAMSR-E 0aMERRA-L 0aEvaluation 0aError estimation1 aSu, Chun-Hsu1 aRyu, Dongryeol1 aKim, Hyunglok1 aChoi, Minha0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017 Jan., v. 188 p.95-105dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245025000159300001800409520149400427592002801921650002301949650002101972650002301993650002002016650002102036650002202057650002102079650002802100650001802128650001402146650000702160650001402167700002002181700002102201700002402222700001702246773012802263856007402391852000902465655001202474IND60656781620221121022210.0190814e20140710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065678162DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00731j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZare, Hamid R.10aElectrosynthesis and electrochemical characteristics of 2,2′-(4,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-1,2-phenylene)bis(3-oxo-3-phenylpropanenitrile): application as a mediator for determination of hydroxylamine at a carbon nanotube modified electrode surface  ap. 5999-6008.  aElectrosynthesis and electrochemical characteristics of an electrodeposited 2,2′-(4,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-1,2-phenylene)bis(3-oxo-3-phenylpropanenitrile), DMPP, film on a multi-wall carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode (DMPP-MWCNT-GCE) and its role as a mediator for electrocatalytic oxidation of hydroxylamine are described. Cyclic voltammograms of the DMPP-MWCNT-GCE indicate a pair of well-defined and quasireversible redox couples with surface confined characteristics in a wide pH range of 2.0–12.0. The charge transfer coefficient, α, and the charge transfer rate constant, kₛ, of DMPP-MWCNT were calculated to be 0.51 and 10.7 ± 1.7 s⁻¹, respectively. The DMPP-MWCNT-GCE shows a dramatic increase in the peak current and a decrease in the overvoltage of hydroxylamine electrooxidation in comparison with that seen at a bare or MWCNT modified glassy carbon electrode. The kinetic parameters of electron transfer coefficient, α, heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant, k′, and exchange current density, j₀, for the oxidation of hydroxylamine at the modified electrode surface were determined using cyclic voltammetry. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) exhibits two linear dynamic ranges 1.0–10.0 μmol L⁻¹ and 10.0–300.0 μmol L⁻¹ as well as a detection limit of 0.37 μmol L⁻¹ for hydroxylamine determination. Finally, the modified electrode was successfully used for the determination of spiked hydroxylamine in a tap water sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrosynthesis 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydroxylamine 3aoxidation 3apH 3atap water1 aTashkili, Milad1 aKhoshro, Hossein1 aNematollahi, Davood1 aBenvidi, Ali0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 July 10, v. 6, no. 15 p.5999-6008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00731j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010200163300001600265520174500281592002802026596005002054596007102104650001302175650002702188650001202215650001602227650001402243650001502257650002802272650001602300650003102316650001502347650001902362650001402381650002502395650001302420650001202433650002002445650002302465650001502488700001302503700001502516700001802531700001302549700005502562700001502617773012802632856008302760852000902843655001202852IND60765605620221119114333.0220818e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076560562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02609-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommer, V.10aArtificial biocrust establishment on materials of potash tailings piles along a salinity gradient  ap. 405-421.  aBiocrust communities provide a pallet of ecosystem services, such as soil stabilization, altering of hydrological cycles and primary production, and often are the first colonizers of unvegetated surfaces during succession. Therefore, artificially establishing biocrusts can improve soil properties, for example, by stabilizing bare soil surfaces against erosion or by accumulating nutrients. In this study, the establishment of artificial biocrusts was tested for the restoration of potash tailings piles that result from potash fertilizer production and mostly consist of NaCl. A biocrust cover as primary vegetation could decrease the saline seepage waters by trapping rainwaters, thereby reducing the environmental pollution. In a laboratory experiment, we created a salt gradient by mixing the tailings materials with non-saline dune sand. Surface material of the abandoned potash tailings pile Neuhof-Ellers (NE) and material of the Infiltration Hampering Stratum (IHS) were tested, along with a treatment with bone charᵖˡᵘˢ (BCᵖˡᵘˢ) and sodium alginate. A mixture of 50% (w/w) IHS and dune sand was most successful for the establishment of green biocrust microalgae, based on increased biomass and photosynthetic performance. The chlorophyll a content was negatively correlated with the electrical conductivity (EC), and was significantly increased in the BCᵖˡᵘˢ and sodium alginate treatment, while biocrusts failed to establish on pure tailings piles substrates. The limit of the substrates EC for biocrust establishment was 35 mS cm⁻¹. This limit provides a baseline for future studies that should use BCᵖˡᵘˢ and sodium alginate to increase the success of biocrust establishment on potash tailings piles.  aPublisher supplied data  aAz. 20016/462cdeutsche bundesstiftung umwelt  aMBFSt 3583cgesellschaft für chemische technik und biotechnologie 3aalgology 3abiological soil crusts 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adune sand 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizers 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3aseepage 3asodium alginate 3asoil stabilization 3avegetation1 aPalm, A.1 aSchink, A.1 aLeinweber, P.1 aGose, N.1 aKarsten, U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-07571 aGlaser, K.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2022 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.405-421dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02609-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300001800274520097500292592002801267650002301295650002201318650001101340650002201351650002301373650002101396650001501417650001701432650001401449650001301463650001301476700001401489700001901503700001301522773012801535856007401663852000901737655001201746IND60656781720221121022341.0190814e20140612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065678172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00732h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdelean, M.10aElectrochemical detection of sulphide in water/seawater using nanostructured carbon–epoxy composite electrodes  ap. 4775-4782.  aIn this study, the performance of a carbon nanofibre–epoxy composite (CNF) electrode was compared with that of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode for the voltammetric/amperometric direct detection of sulphide in water and seawater by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). Both electrodes allowed direct detection of sulphides in aqueous solutions, and carbon nanofibres exhibited a catalytic effect towards sulphide oxidation, which led to the best sensitivity. The best electroanalytical parameters were achieved using pulsed voltammetric techniques, with optimized square-wave voltammetry achieving the best sensitivity of 347.899 μA mM⁻¹ for sulphide detection. However, the chronoamperometry (CA) results achieved with real water without any supporting electrolyte were also very promising for the practical use of CNF electrodes for the in-field direct detection of sulphide in water and seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aoxidation 3aseawater 3asulfides1 aManea, F.1 aVaszilcsin, N.1 aPode, R.0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 June 12, v. 6, no. 13 p.4775-4782dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00732h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006700169300001800236520176900254592002802023650001502051650001802066650001602084650001002100650001502110650001102125650001602136650002802152650001602180650001102196653002702207653002102234653001902255653001302274653002002287700001802307700001902325700002102344700003302365773009202398856008402490852000902574655001202583IND60542025820221120205910.0161020e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054202582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConrad, Marcus10aROS, thiols and thiol-regulating systems in male gametogenesis  ap. 1566-1574.  aDuring maturation and storage, spermatozoa generate substantial amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are thus forced to cope with an increasingly oxidative environment that is both needed and detrimental to their biology. Such a janus-faceted intermediate needs to be tightly controlled and this is done by a wide array of redox enzymes. These enzymes not only have to prevent unspecific modifications of essential cellular biomolecules by quenching undesired ROS, but they are also required and often directly involved in critical protein modifications.The present review is conceived to present an update on what is known about critical roles of redox enzymes, whereby special emphasis is put on the family of glutathione peroxidases, which for the time being presents the best characterized tasks during gametogenesis.We therefore demonstrate that understanding the function of (seleno)thiol-based oxidases/reductases is not a trivial task and relevant knowledge will be mainly gained by using robust systems, as exemplified by several (conditional) knockout studies. We thus stress the importance of using such models for providing unequivocal evidence in the molecular understanding of redox regulatory mechanisms in sperm maturation.ROS are not merely detrimental by-products of metabolism and their proper generation and usage by specific enzymes is essential for vital functions as beautifully exemplified during male gametogenesis. As such, lessons learnt from thiol-based oxidases/reductases in male gametogenesis could be used as a general principle for other organs as it is most likely not only restricted to this developmental phase.

We report that the precipitates formed in the catanionic surfactant systems at charge ratios deviated from 1:1 can be solubilized by simply increasing the total surfactant concentrations. At higher concentrations, there are vesicles in the supernatant, which will sequester the monomer surfactant in equilibrium with the precipitates. This shifts precipitation-solvation equilibrium continuously. As a result, the precipitates vanish when all the surfactants in the precipitates are taken into the vesicles. In this way, a high-concentration stable phase (HCSP) can be formed in the precipitated surfactant systems, which can be generalized to all catanionic surfactant systems. We envision the concentration-triggered HCSP is very promising in guiding the large-scale application of catanionic surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3acationic surfactants 3acolloids 3amixtures 3asolubilization 3asurfaces 3awills 0aCatanionic surfactant system 0aConcentration 0aPrecipitation-solvation equilibrium 0aVesicles1 aQi, Weilin1 aMa, Cheng1 aWu, Tongyue1 aLi, Xiaoyu1 aChen, Xingyue1 aGao, Shuitao1 aQi, Jinwan1 aYan, Yun1 aHuang, Jianbin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129120-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008700153520199000240592002802230650001502258650003102273650002702304650002402331650001502355650001602370650002002386650001002406650000902416650001902425650001502444650002102459650001502480700001402495700002402509700001402533773012902547856007402676852000902750655001202759IND60672355420221118062953.0191016e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067235542DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111922932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Hao 10aRain Monitoring with Polarimetric GNSS Signals: Ground-Based Experimental Research  aIn recent years, there has been a preliminary research on monitoring rainfall information based on polarimetric Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which is a quite novel concept. After previous theoretical research on monitoring rain based on polarimetric phase shift of GNSS signals, the paper aims to detect rain using polarimetric GNSS signals from a ground-based experiment. Firstly, a conical horn antenna specially designed for receiving dual-polarized (H, horizontal, and V, vertical) GNSS signals was developed, and an experimental system for polarimetric GNSS rain detection was built. Then, taking Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites as signal source, a ground-based experiment was carried out at a mountain in Nanjing, where heavy rain tends to occur frequently in rainy season. Additionally, a data processing algorithm mainly following Padull&eacute;s et al. (2016) to solve the problems of quality control, unlocking, hardware effect, phase ambiguity, multipath effect was applied independently to this ground-based data from the polarimetric GNSS rain detection system. Also, the multi-source data from nearby weather radar and weather stations was used for verification. Results from 14 GPS satellites show that the obtained phase shift is zero in all no-rain days while it is not zero during rainy days, which is in accordance with the actual situation. Compared with weather radar and rain gauges&rsquo; data, the results verify that the phase shift is caused by rain. Besides, when individual cases are examined, many show that their tendencies of accumulated phase shift are quite similar to that of a weather station&rsquo;s rainfall data, even some correlation coefficients are up to 0.99. These demonstrate the reliability of our experimental system and the feasibility of the data processing algorithm. This study will provide technical support for future spaceborne experiment, which has promising applications in global rain monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aglobal positioning systems 3ainformation processing 3ameteorological data 3amonitoring 3apolarimetry 3aquality control 3aradar 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aweather stations 3awet season1 aYan, Wei 1 aBian, Shuangshuang 1 aMa, Shuo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169300001600298520224800314592002802562650001802590650002002608650002302628650002102651650002602672650001502698650002302713650001802736650002602754650001302780650000902793650001302802653001702815653002002832653002402852653002202876653001902898653001802917653002302935700001402958700001402972700001802986700001803004700001703022773016403039856008603203852000903289655001203298IND60527924420221120174028.0190416e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052792442DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61055-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAN, Guang-yu10aIntercropping of rice varieties increases the efficiency of blast control through reduced disease occurrence and variability  ap. 795-802.  aCreating a crop-heterogeneous system by intraspecific mixtures of different rice varieties can substantially reduce blast diseases. Such variety mixtures provide an ecological approach for effective disease control, maintaining high yields with the minimum fungicide applications. Whether such an approach is universally applicable for random rice variety combinations and what is the variation pattern of the diseases under intercropping still remains unclear. We conducted two-year large-scale field experiments involving 47 rice varieties/lines and 98 variety-combinations to compare the occurrence of rice blast in monoculture and intercropping plots at multiple sites. In the experiments, the plant height of the selected traditional varieties was about 30 cm taller, and their life cycle was 10 days longer, than that of the improved rice varieties. The monoculture included either traditional or modern rice varieties grown in separate plots. The intercropping included both traditional and modern rice varieties planted together in the same plots. Results from the field experiments under natural disease conditions demonstrated significant reduction for rice blast disease in intercropping plots, compared with that in monoculture plots. For traditional varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from ~26% in monoculture to ~10% in intercropping, and the disease severity reduced from ~17 in monoculture to ~5 in intercropping. For modern varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from ~19% in monoculture to ~10% in intercropping, and the severity from ~10 in monoculture to ~4 in intercropping. Traditional rice varieties (~72%) had a much greater increase in the efficiency of disease control than modern varieties (~60%). In addition, substantially lower values of variance in the blast incidence and severity was detected among the variety combinations in intercropping plots than in monoculture plots. Based on these results, we conclude that the intercropping or mixture of rice varieties greatly reduces the occurrence and variation of rice blast disease in particular variety combinations, which makes the intercropping system more stable and consistent for disease suppression on a large scale of rice cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablast disease 3adisease control 3adisease occurrence 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3afungicides 3aheirloom varieties 3aintercropping 3apesticide application 3aplanting 3arice 3avariance 0aOryza sativa 0acropping system 0adisease suppression 0adisease variation 0amixed-planting 0apure-planting 0acrop heterogeneity1 aLANG, Jie1 aSun, Yan,1 aWANG, Yun-yue1 aZHU, You-yong1 aLU, Bao-rong0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2016 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.795-802dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61055-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245004900160520135700209592002801566650003101594650001801625650001301643650001101656650002401667650001901691650001501710650002301725650001601748650001501764700002201779700002101801773012901822856007401951852000902025655001202034IND60672355520221118062946.0191016e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067235552DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111922942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespo, Juan A.10aCYGNSS Surface Heat Flux Product Development  aOcean surface heat fluxes play a significant role in the genesis and evolution of various marine-based atmospheric phenomena, from the synoptic scale down to the microscale. While in-situ measurements from buoys and flux towers will continue to be the standard in regard to surface heat flux estimates, they commonly have significant gaps in temporal and spatial coverage. Previous and current satellite missions have filled these gaps; though they may not observe the fluxes directly, they can measure the variables needed (wind speed, temperature and humidity) to estimate latent and sensible heat fluxes. However, current remote sensing instruments have their own limitations, such as infrequent coverage, signals attenuated by precipitation or both. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission overcomes these limitations over the tropical and subtropical oceans by providing improved coverage in nearly all weather conditions. While CYGNSS (Level 2) primarily estimates surface winds, when coupled with observations or estimates of temperature and humidity from reanalysis data, it can provide estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes along its orbit. This paper describes the development of the Surface Heat Flux Product for the CYGNSS mission, its current results and expected improvements and changes in future releases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3aheat transfer 3ahumidity 3aoceans 3aproduct development 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asensible heat flux 3atemperature 3awind speed1 aPosselt, Derek J.1 aAsharaf, Shakeel0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245008000175300001600255520138100271592002801652650002701680650003001707650001401737650002501751650001101776650002401787650001901811650001001830650001101840650002401851650001801875650001301893650001401906650002201920700002001942700001701962700001801979773010101997856007302098852000902171655001202180IND50090279420221120053641.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009027942DNAL7 a245214832pmid7 a10.1111/pbi.121692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Zhouhang12aA versatile system for functional analysis of genes and microRNAs in cotton  ap. 638-649.  aCotton is an important economic crop worldwide. Due to its long growth cycle, large genome size and recalcitrance to stable transformation, traditional methods for the analysis of gene function in this crop are difficult and labour intensive. Here, we report a cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV)‐based vector and its application in gene function analysis through virus‐induced gene silencing (VIGS) and overexpression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small tandem target mimic (STTM) and artificial miRNA (amiRNA) in cotton via an Agrobacterium‐mediated infiltration approach. Using this system, we were able to efficiently silence two endogenous genes, magnesium chelatase subunit I (CHLI) and elongation factor‐1α (EF‐1α), in Gossypium species and the Bacillus thuringiensis cry1A gene in transgenic cotton. Furthermore, our results show that this vector can be used to ectopically express endogenous miR156 in G. hirsutum, causing a reduction in miR156‐targeted RNA transcripts resulting in the development of abnormal leaf phenotypes. Ectopic expression of miR165/166 STTM with this vector led to downward curling and crumpled leaves, and a significant increase in the miR165/166 target mRNAs. This versatile system is easy to use and can provide more uniform and persistent gene silencing in cotton, thereby providing a powerful approach for gene discovery in cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCotton leaf crumple virus 3aGossypium 3aabnormal development 3acotton 3agene overexpression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3aleaves 3amagnesium chelatase 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aphenotype 3atransgenic plants1 aHuang, Changjun1 aLi, Fangfang1 aZhou, Xueping0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 June, v. 12, no. 5 p.638-649dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.121693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245010200186300001800288520195500306592002802261650001602289650002502305650001702330650001502347650001102362650000702373650001502380650001902395650001402414650001102428650002102439650001902460650002002479650002902499650003402528650002102562650004102583650005902624651001002683651001802693651001002711700002002721773011802741856004802859852000902907655001202916IND4466345520221118002550.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446634552DNAL7 a221468162pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2379-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M. Azadur10aTrace metal concentrations in tidal flat coastal sediments, Yamaguchi Prefecture, southwest Japan  ap. 5755-5771.  aGeochemical investigations of tidal flat coastal sediments at Ogori, Ozuki, and Kasado in Yamaguchi Bay of southwest Japan were conducted to determine their metal concentrations and to assess contamination levels, compared with sediment quality guidelines (SQG) and several pollutant indicators. Selected major oxides, trace elements, and total sulfur (TS) were determined by X-ray fluorescence. pH values of most samples were alkaline, indicating anoxic conditions. Average abundances of As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr in Ozuki sediments were 11, 27, 109, 21, 19, and 52 mg/kg, respectively, compared to 9, 29, 80, 16, 18, and 42 mg/kg at Ogori and 12, 27, 151, 34, 30 and 80 mg/kg at Kasado, respectively. Average concentrations of As, Zn, and Cu in all samples and TiO2, Fe2O3, and P2O5 at Kasado were greater than those of the upper continental crust. Contamination levels were assessed based on SQG, contamination factors (CF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), and index of geoaccumulation (Igeo). According to the SQG of the US EPA, the sediments were heavily polluted with respect to As, whereas Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr were classed as moderately polluted. The elevated CF values of As, Pb, and Zn identify moderate to considerable contamination, indicating that these metals are potentially toxic in the study area. Based on PLI and EF, the study sites are moderate to moderately severe polluted with As and Pb, moderately polluted with Zn, and weakly contaminated to noncontaminated with Cu, Ni, and Cr. The highest Igeo values for As, Pb, and Zn in the surface and core sediments reflected the tendency of metal contamination that seems to be related to their fine-grained nature, organic matter-rich sediments, and anthropogenic point sources. Trace metal contents were strongly correlated with Fe2O3 and TiO2, suggesting that Fe oxyhydroxides and detrital clastic load play a role in controlling abundances in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanaerobic conditions 3afluorescence 3aguidelines 3ametals 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution load 3asediments 3asulfur 3atitanium dioxide 3atrace elements 2aBaysxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aJapan 3aUnited States 0aJapan1 aIshiga, Hiroaki0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Sept., v. 184, no. 9 p.5755-5771dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2379-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005500170300001800225500001900243520095100262592002801213650002501241650002201266650001601288650002001304653002001324653002201344653001701366653001101383700001401394773013701408856008501545852000901630655001201639IND60711972920221122131451.0201009e20201205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071197292DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2020.17166982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohout, Michal10aGreen space ideas and practices in European cities  ap. 2464-2483.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor almost two centuries, green spaces in European cities have been rethought and built based on the shifting ideas and practices about the role of nature in cities. Although there is a great diversity in the quantity and quality of green spaces in European cities today, the ideas and practices behind their creation and destruction are quite common across the continent. Starting in the mid-nineteenth century, European city leaders started bringing nature back into the city to counter the negative effects of industrialization. Later, modernist architects and planners began using scientific methods and populist ideas of nature in an attempt to create accessible healthy quality living for a rapidly expanding urban industrial workforce. Most recently, European cities are embracing sustainability, a sometimes contradictory effort to balance neoliberal commodification of nature with its scientifically legitimated quality of life benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen infrastructure 3aindustrialization 3alabor force 3aquality of life 0aurban geography 0aurban environment 0agreen spaces 0aEurope1 aKopp, Jan0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2020 Dec. 5, v. 63, no. 14 p.2464-2483dRoutledgewJournal:12206x1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2020.17166983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005500161300001600216520107700232592002801309650002101337650001201358650001501370650001101385650002201396650000901418650000901427650001401436650002001450650001301470650002101483650002101504650001401525650001001539650002601549650002101575650001301596650002001609650000901629700001501638700001401653700001101667700001501678773013401693856008101827852000901908655001201917IND60603136820221122102237.0180712e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060313682DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437180401802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, X.

Pb contents in subcellular fractions decreased in the following order: cell wall > organelle > soluble fraction. Most of Pb was located in cell wall and membrane system. Contents of K and Ca declined in T. orientalis roots under Pb²⁺ stress, but an opposite effect was noted for some mineral elements (Mg, Cu, Zn, and Fe). H₂O₂ level increased in a concentration-dependent manner, which induced oxidative stress. However, significant reduction in levels of O ₂·⁻ and malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in all Pb²⁺ treatment groups. Findings indicated toxicity of Pb²⁺ to T. orientalis in terms of inducing oxidative stress and causing imbalance in mineral elements. However, T. orientalis also resisted Pb²⁺-induced damage through isolation mechanism, which involves cell wall and membrane systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha orientalis 3acalcium 3acell walls 3acopper 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amalondialdehyde 3aminerals 3aoxidative stress 3aphytoremediation 3apotassium 3aroots 3asubcellular fractions 3asuperoxide anion 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3azinc1 aHou, Y.

In Arabidopsis, there are six CAX genes. However, some members are yet to be characterized fully. • In this study, we show that CAX4 is expressed in the root apex and lateral root primordia, and that expression is increased when Ni²⁺ or Mn²⁺ levels are elevated or Ca²⁺ is depleted. • Transgenic plants expressing increased levels of CAX4 display symptoms consistent with increased sequestration of Ca²⁺ and Cd²⁺ into the vacuole. When CAX4 is highly expressed in an Arabidopsis cax1 mutant line with weak vacuolar Ca²⁺/H⁺ antiport activity, a 29% increase in Ca²⁺/H⁺ antiport is measured. A cax4 loss‐of‐function mutant and CAX4 RNA interference lines display altered root growth in response to Cd²⁺, Mn²⁺ and auxin. The DR5::GUS auxin reporter detected reduces auxin responses in the cax4 lines. • These results indicate that CAX4 is a cation/H⁺ antiporter that plays an important function in root growth under heavy metal stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA interference 3aantiporters 3aauxins 3acadmium 3acalcium 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3amanganese 3amutants 3anickel 3aprotons 3aroot growth 3aroot primordia 3atransgenic plants 3avacuoles1 aCheng, Ning Hui1 aZhao, Jian1 aPark, Sunghun1 aEscareno, Rito A.1 aPittman, Jon K.1 aHirschi, Kendal D.0 tnew phytologist.g2009 July, v. 183, no. 1 p.95-105dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02831.x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02522naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245015300153300001600306520112000322592002801442650001201470650001001482650001701492650001201509650003301521650001601554650001401570650001801584650003301602650001201635651001101647651001801658653001201676653001201688653002401700653000801724653000801732653001301740653000801753653001601761653001601777700002701793700002301820773010501843856007101948852000902019655001202028IND4462402120221122103009.0160315e20111107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446240212DNAL7 a10.1139/b11-0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostea, Mihai10aSystematics of “horned” dodders: phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy, and two new species within the Cuscuta chapalana complex (Convolvulaceae)  ap. 715-730.  aThe Cuscuta chapalana complex (Convolvulaceae) is a recently circumscribed clade within the subgenus Grammica that includes several little-known species from Mexico and Central and northern South America characterized by the presence of peculiar subapical multicelullar appendages on the corolla and often on the calyx lobes. Basic morphology, scanning electron microscopy, and DNA sequence data from the plastid trnL–F region and the 26S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer nuclear regions were used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the group and to test the species limits. Multicellular appendages are horn-like or tubular in shape and bear one or more stomata at their tips; hence the vernacular name “horned” dodders. Eight lineages were reconstructed; two of them, both from Mexico, were described as new species: Cuscuta bonafortunae Costea & I. García, sp. nov., and Cuscuta carnosa Costea & Stefanović, sp. nov. Cuscuta pringlei is redefined as a variety of Cuscuta strobilacea.

Hydrogen peroxide content and levels of lipid peroxidation in terms of malondialdehyde content increased in leaves under salt stress. Salt stress also induced antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and peroxidase.

How plant resistance to pathogens and leaf chemical characteristics shape the phyllosphere bacterial communities is unclear. In this study, the phyllosphere bacterial communities of maize hybrids with various resistance to Setosphaeria turcica were compared using the high-throughput sequencing and large-scale culturing methods. The results showed that Shannon and Simpson indices of phyllosphere bacterial communities were markedly higher in the highly resistant hybrid (HR) compared with the susceptible one. Hierarchical clustering analysis, unweighted UniFrac principal component analysis (PCoA) and the analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) demonstrated that the phyllosphere bacterial communities were significantly distinct between resistant and susceptible hybrids. The redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that leaf chemical characteristics, including nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, and disease resistance play an important role in shaping the phyllosphere bacterial community. Linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe) analysis indicated that Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Tumebacillus were the biomarker species in the phyllosphere of HR. Biocontrol bacteria against S. turcica (such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus) were isolated from the phyllosphere of HR by large-scale culturing. The work contributes to understanding of the phyllosphere bacterial community assembly and provides a new clue to screening for strong biocontrol bacteria from HR and to facilitating future breeding efforts for enhancing disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  a182300410020cNatural Science Foundation of Henan 3aPseudomonas 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3abacterial communities 3abiological control 3abiomarkers 3abiotechnology 3acorn 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3aphyllosphere 3aplant growth 3aprincipal component analysis1 aDan, Xu1 aTingting, Sun1 aSongyu, Zhao1 aYing, Li1 aDiandong, Wang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0625-98170 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.139-139dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02908-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245005200155300002000207520055300227592002800780650001500808650002300823650002300846650001000869650001500879700002000894700001700914700001800931700001900949700001100968700001600979700001400995700002101009700001801030700001501048773013401063856007801197852000901275655001201284IND60541321120221120095132.0160821e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054132112DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b064802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Lin10aAsymmetric Total Synthesis of Propindilactone G  ap. 10120-10123.  aA concise total synthesis of (+)-propindilactone G, a nortriterpenoid isolated from the stems of Schisandra propinqua var. propinqua, has been achieved for the first time.

If the surfactant interacts with the enzyme there may be conformational changes that eventually lead to loss of the enzymatic activity. From a practical point of view it is important to understand the nature and magnitude of these interactions.After an introduction of the topic the review briefly discusses enzyme catalyzed reactions where surfactants are substrates for the enzyme. The rest of the review relates to associations between surfactants and hydrolytic enzymes without the surfactant being a substrate in the reaction. A discussion about general principles for such interactions is followed by a survey of the relevant literature related to four important types of hydrolytic enzymes: lipases, proteases, amylases and cellulases. It is shown in the review that the effect exerted by the surfactant differs between the different types of enzymes; it is therefore difficult to make general statements about which surfactants are most detrimental to the activity of hydrolytic enzymes. However, as a general rule nonionic surfactants can be regarded as more benign to an enzyme than anionic and cationic surfactants. This difference can be ascribed to the difference in binding mode. Whereas a nonionic surfactant only binds to the enzyme through hydrophobic interactions, an ionic surfactant can bind by a combination of electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction. This latter type of binding can be strong and lead to conformational changes already at very low surfactant concentration, often far below its critical micelle concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylases 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3acationic surfactants 3acellulases 3adetergents 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3apersonal care products 3aproteinases 3asurveys 0aEnzyme 0aProtein 0aLipase 0aProtease 0aPeptidase 0aAmylase 0aCellulase 0aSurfactant 0aInteraction0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 168 p.169-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245018500164300002000349520118200369592002801551650004401579650002201623650003701645650001201682650001401694650002301708650002501731650003501756650002201791650001801813650001301831650001801844650001101862650003301873650002101906650003701927653001901964653001701983653001202000653002402012653001102036700001802047700001702065773012902082856007302211852000902284655001202293IND60527708520221123011521.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052770852DNAL7 a10.1021/am503722t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharyya, Shankha S.10aFabrication of Three-Dimensional (3D) Raspberry-Like Copper Chromite Spinel Catalyst in a Facile Hydrothermal Route and Its Activity in Selective Hydroxylation of Benzene to Phenol  ap. 14451-14459.  aThree-dimensional (3D) raspberry-like CuCr₂O₄ spinel nanoparticles were prepared hydrothermally in the presence of cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Detailed characterization of the material was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). XRD revealed the formation of CuCr₂O₄ spinel phase, and SEM showed the formation of a 3D raspberry-like structure, composed of 20–50 nm nanoparticles. The raspberry-like particles exhibited excellent catalytic behavior for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with H₂O₂. The influence of reaction parameters were investigated in detail. A benzene conversion of 68.5% with 95% phenol selectivity was achieved at 80 °C. The catalyst did not show any leaching up to 10 reuses, showing the true heterogeneity of the catalyst. However, significant H₂O₂ decomposition occurs on the catalyst necessitating its use in 5-fold excess.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxylation 3aleaching 3ananoparticles 3aphenol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCuCr2O4 spinel 0a3D raspberry 0abenzene 0aselective oxidation 0aphenol1 aGhosh, Shilpi1 aBal, Rajaram0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.14451-14459dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am503722t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245009300153300001600246520138900262592002801651650002501679650001201704650002801716650001201744650001301756650002001769650000901789650001401798650001501812650001701827650000901844650001001853653000901863653001501872653002001887653002601907653004101933700001901974700001801993700002102011700002402032773008902056856007102145852000902216655001202225IND4462402220221122102920.0160315e20110923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446240222DNAL7 a10.1139/b11-0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirley, Matt10aComparison of iron acquisition from Fe–pyoverdine by strategy I and strategy II plants  ap. 731-735.  aIron is an essential micronutrient for plants and associated microorganisms. However, the bioavailability of iron in cultivated soils is low. Plants and microorganisms have thus evolved active strategies of iron uptake. Two different iron uptake strategies have been described in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous graminaceous species. In bacteria, this strategy relies on the synthesis of siderophores. Pyoverdines, a major class of siderophores produced by fluorescent pseudomonads, were previously shown to promote iron nutrition of the dicotyledonous species Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Heynh.), whereas contradictory reports were made on the contribution of those siderophores to the nutrition of graminaceous annuals. Furthermore, no information has so far been available on graminaceous perennials. Here, the contribution of purified pyoverdine of Pseudomonas fluorescens C7R12 to the iron nutrition of two annual and perennial graminaceous plants was assessed and compared with that of two dicotyledonous plant species. Fe–Pyoverdine promoted the iron status of all plant species tested. With the exception of wheat, this promotion was more dramatic in graminaceous species than in dicotyledonous species and was the highest in fescue, a perennial species. The incorporation of ¹⁵N-labeled pyoverdine was consistent with the effect on the iron status of the plants tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aFestuca 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aannuals 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3airon 3anutrition 3aperennials 3asiderophores 3asoil 3awheat 0airon 0apyoverdine 0aplant nutrition 0adicotyledonous plants 0amonocotyledonous graminaceous plants1 aAvoscan, Laure1 aBernaud, Eric1 aVansuyt, Gérard1 aLemanceau, Philippe0 tBotany.g2011 Sept. 23, v. 89, no. 10 p.731-735dNRC Research Pressx1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b11-0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04009naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010400175300001600279520221400295592002802509650001402537650001502551650001902566650001302585650001302598650001102611650001902622650001402641650002402655650001302679650001302692650001102705650001802716650002402734650000902758650002102767650001902788650001302807650001502820650001602835653002202851653001802873653002202891653002302913653003502936700001602971700001702987700002303004700001803027700002503045700002103070700002103091700001703112700002203129700001903151773010603170856008603276852000903362655001203371IND60679708520221121230942.0191231e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067970852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagisaka, Masanobu10aAnisotropic reversed micelles with fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon hybrid surfactants in supercritical CO2  ap. 201-210.  aPrevious work (M. Sagisaka, et al. Langmuir 31 (2015) 7479-7487), showed the most effective fluorocarbon (FC) and hydrocarbon (HC) chain lengths in the hybrid surfactants FCm-HCn (sodium 1-oxo-1-[4-(perfluoroalkyl)phenyl]alkane-2-sulfonates, where m = FC length and n = HC length) were m and n = 6 and 4 for water solubilization, whereas m 6 and n 6, or m 6 and n 5, were optimal chain lengths for reversed micelle elongation in supercritical CO2. To clarify why this difference of only a few methylene chain units is so effective at tuning the solubilizing power and reversed micelle morphology, nanostructures of water-in-CO2 (W/CO2) microemulsions were investigated by high-pressure small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements at different water-to-surfactant molar ratios (W0) and surfactant concentrations. By modelling SANS profiles with cylindrical and ellipsoidal form factors, the FC6-HCn/W/CO2 microemulsions were found to increase in size with increasing W0 and surfactant concentration. Ellipsoidal cross-sectional radii of the FC6-HC4/W/CO2 microemulsion droplets increased linearly with W0, and finally reached ∼39 Å and ∼78 Å at W0 = 85 (close to the upper limit of solubilizing power). These systems appear to be the largest W/CO2 microemulsion droplets ever reported. The aqueous domains of FC6-HC6 rod-like reversed micelles increased in size by 3.5 times on increasing surfactant concentration from 35 mM to 50 mM: at 35 mM, FC6-HC5 formed rod-like reversed micelles 5.3 times larger than FC6-HC6. Interestingly, these results suggest that hybrid HC-chains partition into the microemulsion aqueous cores with the sulfonate headgroups, or at the W/CO2 interfaces, and so play important roles for tuning the W/CO2 interfacial curvature. The super-efficient W/CO2-type solubilizer FC6-HC4, and the rod-like reversed micelle forming surfactant FC6-HC5, represent the most successful cases of low fluorine content additives. These surfactants facilitate VOC-free, effective and energy-saving CO2 solvent systems for applications such as extraction, dyeing, dry cleaning, metal-plating, enhanced oil recovery and organic/inorganic or nanomaterial synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanisotropy 3acarbon dioxide 3acleaning 3adroplets 3adyeing 3aelectroplating 3aemulsions 3aenergy conservation 3afluorine 3amicelles 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aneutron diffraction 3aoils 3aperfluorocarbons 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3asulfonates 3asurfactants 0aSupercritical CO2 0aMicroemulsion 0aHybrid surfactant 0aSolubilizing power 0aSmall-Angle Neutron Scattering1 aOno, Shinji1 aJames, Craig1 aYoshizawa, Atsushi1 aMohamed, Azmi1 aGuittard, Frédéric1 aEnick, Robert M.1 aRogers, Sarah E.1 aCzajka, Adam1 aHill, Christopher1 aEastoe, Julian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 168 p.201-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011700185300001800302520045100320592002800771650002300799650002000822650001600842650001000858650001000868650001800878650001200896650003100908650002100939650004100960650004101001650004801042650001601090650002801106650001401134650002901148650003401177650003401211650007901245650002701324700001901351700002001370700002301390773009901413856004801512852000901560655001201569IND4469786420221121231434.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446978642DNAL7 a218454122pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2588-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutkienė, Liuda10aDescription of Sarcocystis anasi sp. nov. and Sarcocystis albifronsi sp. nov. in birds of the order Anseriformes  ap. 1043-1046.  aOn the basis of the already published morphological, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA data (Kutkienė et al., Parasitol Res 99:562–565, 2006; Parasitol Res 102:691–696, 2008; Parasitol Res 104:329–336, 2009), and ITS-1 region investigation results of sarcocysts presented in this paper, Sarcocystis albifronsi sp. nov. from the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and Sarcocystis anasi sp. nov. from the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aAnser albifrons 3aSarcocystis 3aducks 3ageese 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aAnseriformesxparasitology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 28Sxgenetics 2aSarcocystisxclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aPrakas, Petras1 aSruoga, Aniolas1 aButkauskas, Dalius0 tParasitology research.g2012 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.1043-1046dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2588-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014900154300001800303520115400321592002801475650002301503650001501526650001601541650001301557650002001570650001601590650002901606650002101635650001401656650001301670650001901683650001501702700002101717700001501738700001201753700001901765700001601784700001201800700001501812700001701827773012801844856007401972852000902046655001202055IND60656782220221121014954.0190814e20140612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065678222DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00750f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Hong10aAmplified electrochemiluminescence of lucigenin triggered by electrochemically reduced graphene oxide and its sensitive detection of bisphenol A  ap. 4746-4753.  aAn amplified and stable electrochemiluminescent signal of lucigenin was observed on an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide-containing sensing platform. Herein, chitosan was used as an excellent dispersant, which favors the better dispersion of graphene oxide in solution and improved electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide. The electrochemically reduced graphene oxide showed outstanding conductivity which was propitious to the transfer of electrons, leading to the enhancement of the electrochemiluminescent signals of lucigenin. In addition, bisphenol A, as a classical food borne pollutant, was first detected due to its strong inhibiting action of the electrochemiluminescent response of lucigenin. Then, we studied the quenched electrochemiluminescent system and the possible mechanism of the platform in detail. Under optimum conditions, the proposed electrochemiluminescent sensor exhibited a linear response range from 1.0 × 10⁻⁹ mol L⁻¹ to 1.0 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ with a low detection limit of 3.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ mol L⁻¹ for bisphenol A, which might find promising applications in developing a new type of biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiosensors 3abisphenol A 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3adispersants 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3apollutants1 aCheung, Shu Pui,1 aLin, Yanyu1 aMa, Yan1 aGong, Lingshan1 aXu, Guifang1 aFu, Mei1 aLi, Xiuhua1 aChen, Guonan0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 June 12, v. 6, no. 13 p.4746-4753dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00750f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01505naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011400167300001800281520044000299592002800739650001400767650002300781650001800804650002700822650001000849650002200859650002000881700006900901773013300970856007901103852000901182655001201191IND60639744520221117065622.0190503e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063974452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManna, Sabyasachi10aVisible-Light-Mediated Direct Decarboxylative Acylation of Electron-Deficient Heteroarenes Using α-Ketoacids  ap. 5067-5077.  aAcylation of electron-deficient heteroaromatic compounds has been developed using visible light. α-Ketoacids have been used as an efficient source of acyl radicals under photoredox conditions.

These microcrystals were structurally characterized using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement, where the orthorhombic structure (α-Ag₂WO₄) with space group and point group of Pn2n and C2v10, respectively. In according, the Raman spectrum and infrared spectrum are characteristic of pure alpha phase of silver tungstate exhibiting the main characteristic bands of orthorhombic structure. Thorough UV–vis by diffuse reflectance employing the Tauc’s method the obtained optical band gap (Egₐₚ) was 3.02(3) eV. While, the survey spectrum and high resolution Ag3d, O1s and W4f by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are shown all biding energy peaks of characteristic elements of silver tungstate as well as, confirming the presence of Ag⁰ for silver nanoparticles. Several rod-like microcrystals were archived by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), all these, exhibiting high definition and grown of silver nanoparticles with the increase of exposure time by electrons gun. Finally, the screening antimicrobial properties of α-Ag₂WO₄ confirm the high antimicrobial activity for main gram-positive and gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than positive control (TIENAM). Therefore, the α-Ag₂WO₄ microcrystals synthesized have been exhibited promissory properties in biomedical applications, particularly, in the multi-drugs gram-positive and gram-negative stains control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantimicrobial properties 3aenergy 3aexposure duration 3ahot water treatment 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananosilver 3areflectance 3asilver 3asurveys 0aα-Ag2WO4 0aScreening 0aAntimicrobial 0aSynthesis1 aNobre, Francisco X.1 ada Silva, Elton R.1 aOrlandi, Patrícia P.1 aLima, Diene C.1 ada Cunha Mendes, Otoniel1 aManzato, Lizandro1 aDuarte Pereira, Maria Luiza Rocco1 aLeyet, Y.1 aCouceiro, Paulo Rogério C.1 aBrito, Walter R.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 647 p.129132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245003400165520086300199592002801062650001101090650001801101650002801119650001801147650002201165653001601187653001501203700001501218773011501233856007801348852000901426655001201435IND60695846620221121232633.0200519e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069584662DNAL7 a10.3402/fnr.v54i0.50562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrølich, Wenche10aWhole grain for whom and why?  aA definition of whole grain is a critical first step in investigating health claims for whole grain and its products. Today, there is no internationally accepted definition of whole grain. Some existing definitions are broad and commodity-based, including grains with similar end uses, while others are more restricted. Scientific knowledge must be the basis for inclusion of certain grains. It is better to start with a restricted list of grains (a precautionary principle) and extend this as more knowledge becomes available. An exact definition of the raw materials (milled, cracked, crushed, rolled, or flaked) and knowledge of the components providing health effects would appear to be crucial issues for the European authorities when approving health claims. It is important that health claims are evidence-based, sustainable, and officially validated.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrains 3ahealth claims 3aprecautionary principle 3araw materials 3awhole grain foods 0awhole grain 0adefinition1 aÅman, Per0 tFood & nutrition research.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 1 p.5056-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:6165x1654-661X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3402/fnr.v54i0.50563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300002000283520111600303592002801419650002401447650001601471650003301487650002601520650001901546650001701565650001801582650002101600650002501621653001901646653001601665653001601681653001201697700001901709700001901728700002101747700001801768773012601786856007501912852000901987655001201996IND60527708620170710000000.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052770862DNAL7 a10.1021/am503744z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnaya, Susana10aγ-Alumina Modification with Long Chain Carboxylic Acid Surface Nanocrystals for Biocompatible Polysulfone Nanocomposites  ap. 14460-14468.  aHigh performance polysulfone/γ-alumina biocompatible nanocomposites are reported for the first time and the effects of γ-alumina surface modification are explored. We show that some fatty acids chemisorb over the surface of γ-alumina forming nanosized self-assembled structures. These structures present thermal transitions at high temperatures, 100 °C higher than the melting temperatures of the pure acids, and are further shifted about 50 °C in the presence of polysulfone. The chemistry involved in the chemisorption is mild and green meeting the stringent bio sanitary protocols for biocompatible devices. It has been found that the self-assembled structures increase mechanical strength by about 20% despite the foreseeable lack of strong particle–matrix interactions, which manifests as small variations in both the glass transition temperature and the Young’s modulus. Electron microscopy observation of fractured surfaces has revealed that some acids induce an extended region of influence around the nanoparticles and this fact has been used to explain the enhancement of mechanical strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3afatty acids 3aglass transition temperature 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3astrength (mechanics) 0ananocomposites 0apolysulfone 0afatty acids 0aalumina1 aSerrano, Berna1 aHerrero, Berta1 aCervera, Alberto1 aBaselga, Juan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.14460-14468dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503744z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245012100166300001400287520146400301592002801765650002501793650001401818650002401832650002201856650001201878650001501890650001401905650001701919651001001936651001201946651001801958653002901976653002402005653002502029653002902054653004102083700001502124700001302139700001302152700001302165773011702178856008802295852000902383655001202392IND60633573620221121221802.0200110e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063357362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, B.10aEnergy-induced mercury emissions in global supply chain networks: Structural characteristics and policy implications  ap. 87-97.  aMercury emission flows in the global supply chains have evolved into an ever-increasing complex network. However, the underlying structural features remain unknown. Therefore, the global embodied mercury flow network was constructed to reveal the characteristics of energy-induced mercury emissions embodied in international trade at both national and sectoral scales. The small-world nature of the global mercury flows network was identified at both scales. Results showed that the global mercury flow network can be divided into 4 national communities, within which the spillover effects of the interventions in one region spread more easily. Detecting the mercury-intensive supply-chain clusters highlights the importance of monitoring these clusters that dominate mercury emissions in global supply chains, which could offer insights on where policy can be implemented effectively. Moreover, vital regions (e.g., mainland China, the USA, and Germany) and sectors (e.g., Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Metal Products and Electrical and Machinery in mainland China) for global mercury control have been unveiled by using an integrated centrality measurement system. Our results highlight that, for the overall mercury reduction, regional and even global collaboration should be enhanced along with efforts in individual regions, and enterprises in these important sectors should invest more to green their cluster-wise supply chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aemissions 3ainternational trade 3aissues and policy 3amercury 3amonitoring 3apetroleum 3asupply chain 3aChina 3aGermany 3aUnited States 0aGlobal mercury emissions 0aInternational trade 0aGlobal supply chains 0aComplex network analysis 0aMulti-regional input-output analysis1 aWang, X.B.1 aLi, Y.L.1 aYang, Q.1 aLi, J.S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 20, v. 670 p.87-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015500154300002000309520161700329592002801946650001301974650001501987650001602002650002502018650001702043650001602060650001902076650001902095650001302114650001502127650001202142653003402154653002802188653004302216653004102259653002202300700001702322773012602339856007502465852000902540655001202549IND60527708720221123011908.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052770872DNAL7 a10.1021/am503750w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, I-Chi10aAssembly of Polyelectrolyte Multilayer Films on Supported Lipid Bilayers To Induce Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Differentiation into Functional Neurons  ap. 14439-14450.  aThe key factors affecting the success of neural engineering using neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) are the neuron quantity, the guidance of neurite outgrowth, and the induction of neurons to form functional synapses at synaptic junctions. Herein, a biomimetic material comprising a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) with adsorbed sequential polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films was fabricated to induce NSPCs to form functional neurons without the need for serum and growth factors in a short-term culture. SLBs are suitable artificial substrates for neural engineering due to their structural similarity to synaptic membranes. In addition, PEM film adsorption provides protection for the SLB as well as the ability to vary the surface properties to evaluate the effects of physical and mechanical signals on NSPC differentiation. Our results revealed that NSPCs were inducible on SLB–PEM films consisting of up to eight alternating layers. In addition, the process outgrowth length, the percentage of differentiated neurons, and the synaptic function were regulated by the number of layers and the surface charge of the outermost layer. The average process outgrowth length was greater than 500 μm on SLB-PLL/PLGA (n = 7.5) after only 3 days of culture. Moreover, the quantity and quality of the differentiated neurons were obviously enhanced on the SLB–PEM system compared with those on the PEM-only substrates. These results suggest that the PEM films can induce NSPC adhesion and differentiation and that an SLB base may enhance neuron differentiation and trigger the formation of functional synapses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3ablood serum 3acell differentiation 3aelectrolytes 3aengineering 3agrowth factors 3alipid bilayers 3aneurites 3astem cells 3asynapse 0asupported lipid bilayer (SLB) 0asynapse-triggering base 0apolyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films 0aneural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) 0afunctional neuron1 aWu, Yu-Chieh0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.14439-14450dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503750w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245013700202300001600339520125000355592002801605650002201633650002101655650001301676650002001689650001701709650000901726650002501735650001701760653000801777653001001785653000701795653000801802653000701810653002501817653001001842653001101852653000801863653002001871653002301891700001301914700001701927700001401944700001401958700001801972700001401990700001302004700001502017700001402032700001402046773010102060856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60733339520221120232428.0211106e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073333952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2021.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8261-873310aInhibition of regulator of G protein signaling 10, aggravates rheumatoid arthritis progression by promoting NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 236-246.  aRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthropathy, with evidence pointing to an immune-mediated etiology that propagates chronic inflammation. Although targeted immune therapeutics and aggressive treatment strategies have substantially improved, a complete understanding of the associated pathological mechanisms of the disease remains elusive. This study aimed at investigating whether regulator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10) could affect rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology by regulating the immune response. A DBA/J1 mouse model of RA was established and evaluated for disease severity. RGS10 expression was inhibited by adeno-associated virus in vivo. Moreover, small interfering RNA was used to downregulate RGS10 expression in raw 264.7 cells in vitro. Results showed that RGS10 inhibition augmented RA severity, and attenuated the increase in expression of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, activated NF-κB signaling pathways were detected following RGS10 inhibition. These results revealed that RGS10 inhibition directly aggravated the RA pathological process by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, RGS10 is a promising novel therapeutic target for RA treatment with a potential clinical impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDependoparvovirus 3adisease severity 3aetiology 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amice 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atherapeutics 0aCIA 0aELISA 0aRA 0aRGS 0aWB 0aRheumatoid arthritis 0aRGS10 0aNF-κB 0aAAV 0aImmune response 0aTherapeutic target1 aWei, Wei1 aTan, Liangyu1 aYang, Qin1 aLu, Qiuyu1 aDing, Handong1 aYue, Yuan1 aTian, Ye1 aHao, Liang1 aWang, Min1 aLi, Jinle0 tMolecular immunology.g2021 June, v. 134 p.236-246dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2021.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245011100160300001800271520052500289592002800814650001600842650001100858650003100869650002600900650001800926650002200944650001200966650001800978700001900996700002101015700001401036700005101050773013301101856007901234852000901313655001201322IND60639744720221117070858.0190503e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063974472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuyin10aToward the Total Synthesis of Scabrosins: Synthesis of a Desulfur-scabrosin Skeleton and Its Stereoisomers  ap. 5838-5845.  aThe enantioselective synthesis of a desulfur-scabrosin skeleton was reported.

The steric potential is modelled with a simple approximation to the Bikerman steric potential, enabling derivation of an analytical expression for the total free energy of the supercapacitor in terms of the size and valency of the electrolyte counterions and electrode potentials. The analytical expression for the total free energy of the supercapacitor matches the exact numerical Bikerman calculation at high potential with relative error close to 1%. This provides an upper bound over the more accurate Carnahan-Starling model. A maximum upper bound for the energy is also provided in the limit where bulk concentrations approach the ion concentration cap. We analyze the relative contribution of the steric interaction to the total free energy. At large voltages, the steric free energy is comparable in magnitude to that of the electrostatic free energy, and introduces ion-size effects in the energy of the supercapacitor. Consequently at high potentials the total free energy exceeds (doubles) the classical energy 12CV2, indicating that this formula does not correctly describe the available stored energy from the experimentally measured capacitance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3amodels 0aSupercapacitor 0aElectric double layer capacitor 0aModified Poisson-Boltzmann 0aSteric interaction 0aSteric layer 0aComposite diffuse layer 0aTotal Free Energy1 aParsons, Drew F.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001600250520174100266592002802007650001902035650001902054650001602073650001702089650002502106650001302131650002102144650001602165650001302181650001502194650001202209650001102221650002302232650000902255650001902264650001902283650001702302650001202319650001202331650002002343650002102363650001402384650001102398700001802409700001802427700001402445773013402459856008102593852000902674655001202683IND60603137220221122102214.0180712e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060313722DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437180401672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasrollahi, P.10aPhysiological and Biochemical Responses of Lettuce to Thymol, as Allelochemical  ap. 598-603.  aNowadays, allelopathic investigations have focused to identify action mechanisms of this compounds on target organisms in natural habitats. It may tend to introduce new natural herbicides and pesticides for replacing the synthetic ones. In the present study, the allelopathic effects of thymol on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) as a model plant were investigated in physiological and biochemical aspects. At the first stage, the effect of different concentrations of thymol on some growth parameters, including seed germination, radicle and plumule growth were evaluated to determine the optimum concentration for the continuation of our experiment. Then, the lettuce seedlings were cultured in pots containing peat and were irrigated with Hoagland nutrient solution supplemented with thymol at the concentration of 50 and 100 μg/mL. The effect of these treatments on physiological, biochemical aspects of the plant were studied following the plant growth. The results showed whereas, the shoot fresh and dry weights and photosynthetic rate in the treated group were decreased significantly compared to the control group at P ≤ 0.05, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, total protein concentration, proline content and the activity of some antioxidant enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase were increased in treated plants than control ones. However, there was no significantly change in chlorophyll content in treated group than control. It can be concluded that the thymol as an allelochemical caused some physiological and biochemical responses in the lettuce which are much similar to induced responses under abiotic stress. Indeed, it induces a kind of stress named as allelochemical stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aallelopathy 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3achlorophyll 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3alettuce 3amodels 3anutrient solutions 3apeat 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3aplumule 3aproline 3aprotein content 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3athymol1 aRazavi, S.

Statistically significant differences in the relative chromatographic peak areas of polar and nonpolar components are a criterion for insufficient inertness. The analyte amount (expressed as the mass index pm = −log m) in the sample of a mixed solution with an inert component (n-alkane) at which differences in the relative peak areas become higher than the sums of the standard deviations of the relative areas, as compared with more concentrated solutions at the same ratios between the components, can be considered the inertness limit of a chromatographic system with respect to the characterized compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3achemical analysis 3agas chromatography1 aMorozova, T.

Even in historically water abundant regions climate change together with population growth and economic development are processes that are expected to contribute to an increase in permanent and seasonal water scarcity in the coming decades. Previous studies have shown how policies to address water scarcity often fail to deliver lasting improvements because they do not account for how these processes influence, and are influenced by, human-water interactions shaping water supply and demand. Despite significant progress in recent years, place-specific understanding of the mechanisms behind human-water feedbacks remain limited, particularly in historically water abundant regions. To this end, we here present a Swedish case study where we, by use of a qualitative system dynamics approach, explore how human-water interactions have contributed to seasonal water scarcity at the local-to-regional scale. Our results suggest that the current approach to address water scarcity by inter-basin water transports contributes to increasing demand by creating a gap between the perceived and actual state of water resources among consumers. This has resulted in escalating water use and put the region in a state of systemic lock-in where demand-regulating policies are mitigated by increases in water use enabled by water transports. We discuss a combination of information and economic policy instruments to combat water scarcity, and we propose the use of quantitative simulation methods to further assess these strategies in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019/138/10.5cSveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska Institut 3aadministrative management 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic policy 3afreshwater 3apopulation growth 3asupply balance 3awater shortages1 aFornell, Rickard1 aPrade, Thomas1 aTufvesson, Linda1 aKhalil, Sammar1 aKopainsky, Birgit0 tWater resources management.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 10 p.3043-3061dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02819-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008800208300001800296500001100314500001900325520215400344592002802498650001402526650001902540650001002559650002602569650002202595650002302617650002702640700002402667773015402691856008302845852000902928655001202937IND60707194120221123031007.0220211e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070719412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-020-01768-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña, Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6774-571812aA longitudinal literature review of life cycle costing applied to urban agriculture  ap. 1418-1435.  aReview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: The aim of this research is to carry out a literature review of the use of life cycle costing (LCC) in the urban agriculture (UA) sector by analysing its evolution over a 22-year period from its beginning in 1996 to July 2018. METHODS: A total of 442 references were obtained from two principal databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). After a long refining process, 20 (4.5%) references containing the keywords LCC and UA were selected for analysis. Then, we classified and organized the selected references in 4 groups. Qualitative methods were used for analysis, and results on general characteristics of the 20 references and by each group were elaborated. Lastly, we discussed and concluded the most significant findings. Limitations and future research were also included. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our major findings were as follows: (i) urban horticulture was the most studied urban agriculture practice among studies that used LCC for UA; (ii) LCC plays a secondary role in its integration with LCA; (iii) only 4 of the10 papers in group 1 used additional financial tools; (iv) very few (3) papers appropriately applied the four main LCC stages; and on the other side, essential costs like infrastructure, labour, maintenance, and end-of-life were frequently not included. CONCLUSIONS: Since we found that life cycle assessment (LCA) was the predominant methodology, we suggest that future research apply both LCA and LCC analyses at the same level. The LCC analysis was quite incomplete in terms of the costs included in each LCC stage. We recommend that the costs at the initial or construction stage be considered a necessity in future studies in order to implement these new systems on a large scale. Due to the limited use of labour cost at the operation stage, we also suggest that labour be included as an essential part of the urban production process. Finally, for more complete LCC analysis for UA, we recommend (i) that all LCC stages be considered and (ii) that additional financial tools, such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP), be used to complement the LCC analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3ainfrastructure 3alabor 3alife cycle assessment 3aurban agriculture 3aurban horticulture 3awages and remuneration1 aRovira-Val, M.

An imidazolium-based ionic liquid, 1-dodecyl-3-methyl imidazolium hydrogen sulfate (abbreviated as DMIMHS), was used as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel in the CO₂-saturated NaCl brine at 313 K in this study. The inhibitive effects and mechanisms of the pre-corroded product on the anti-corrosion behavior of DMIMHS were investigated by electrochemical measurements, surface characterizations, quantum calculation and molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that DMIMHS had remarkable inhibition efficacy on freshly abraded steel, with a 94.46% inhibition efficiency in the presence of 30 mg/L DMIMHS, and corrosion products can slightly decelerate the corrosion behavior. More importantly, the addition of DMIMHS favored the remarkably enhanced inhibitive properties for carbon steel after pre-corroded, namely the corrosion resistance increased with the extension of corrosion time. According to the experimental results and theoretical calculations, the inhibitive mechanisms of DMIMHS toward carbon steel in the CO₂-saturated NaCl brine were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amolecular dynamics 3aoils 3asteel 3asulfates 0aCarbon steel 0aCO2 corrosion 0aElectrochemical measurements 0aQuantum chemical calculations 0aMolecular dynamics simulations1 aXue, Juanqin1 aZhang, Juantao1 aChen, Qibin1 aFan, Lei1 aTang, Changbin1 aRen, Kang1 aFu, Anqing1 aBi, Qiang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129135-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002900149245013500178300001500313520180500328592002802133650002102161650002102182650002502203650001002228650001102238650000902249650002502258650001802283650002102301650001602322650001902338650001302357651001202370700001802382700001802400773009302418856008502511852000902596655001202605IND4466884920221119195928.0141110e20120725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446688492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrera-Hernández, J.J.10aEstimating groundwater recharge through unsaturated flow modelling: Sensitivity to boundary conditions and vertical discretization  ap. 90-101.  aUnsaturated flow modelling is increasingly being used to estimate potential groundwater recharge. A review of previous studies found that unit-gradient and fixed water table lower boundary conditions have been applied to models of both constant and variable vertical grid spacing (discretization). In order to provide a general guidance, this work studies the effect of both discretization and boundary conditions on simulation times and estimated fluxes at the water table, using one-dimensional models of 2, 4, 6, and 12m comprised of sand, sandy loam, loamy sand, and loam. The study uses climatological data from the Boreal Plain of northern Alberta, Canada. Because of the long-term average water deficit and the thick unconsolidated glacial deposits, unsaturated flow is expected to be vertical, both downward and upward, and inter-annual changes in water storage will be important. Long-term simulations (1919–2007) that comprised both wet and dry cycles, reveal that when a variable vertical discretization at both the top and bottom of the columns (varying from 0.1 to 10cm) is utilized, a balance between simulation accuracy and running time can be achieved. It is also found that whenever the unsaturated flow modelling approach is used to estimate potential groundwater recharge, a fixed-head lower boundary condition should be selected because it also allows upward flux from the water table during dry periods, a situation that prevails on both sub-humid and semi-arid areas, where accurate groundwater recharge estimates are needed the most. However, it should be kept in mind that the use of a fixed water table is a simple representation of the regional water table, which in reality interacts with the regional groundwater flow and surface water bodies (e.g., lakes and wetlands).  aPublisher supplied data 3aglacial deposits 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater recharge 3alakes 3amodels 3asand 3aspatial distribution 3asurface water 3aunsaturated flow 3awater table 3awet-dry cycles 3awetlands 3aAlberta1 aSmerdon, B.D.1 aMendoza, C.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 July 25, v. 452-453 p.90-101dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013700166300001400303520157500317592002801892650001901920650001801939650002201957650001601979650001301995650002602008650002402034650001602058650002502074650001402099650002602113650002002139650001402159650001002173650002502183650001602208650001702224700001902241700002002260773010602280856008102386852000902467655001202476IND60575502620221119074510.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057550262DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-016-0279-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBankole, A.

There are currently few plants in their natural tropical habitats, as it is difficult to propagate. We have developed a simple protocol for in vitro regeneration of M. tomentosa using matured seeds and determined the secondary metabolites present in the in vitro-derived seedlings. Effects of two media types, i.e., Woody plant medium (WPM), and Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium with and without plant growth regulators, viz., 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) @ 0, 1, 2, 3 mg l⁻¹ were studied separately on in vitro germination and growth of seedlings. Seeds were surface disinfected, cultured in the above media and incubated at 27 °C and 16/8 light/dark photoperiod and a light intensity of 40 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ provided by cool white fluorescent tubes prior to seeds germination. Results showed that the WPM alone produced significantly more germinated seeds (11.7) than MS (7.7) media. Significantly more germinated seedlings were produced on WPM with a combination of 1 mg l⁻¹ BAP (10.7) or 2 mg l⁻¹ IBA (9) than the control or other treatments. Anthraquinones were absent in the wild plants but were detected in the in vitro-derived plants (7.4 mg g⁻¹ dry wt). This study provides the first report on a protocol for in vitro germination of this medicinally important species that could be applied to rescue it from extinction, as well as information on the phytochemical profile of the in vitro derived plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthraquinones 3aculture media 3afluorescent lamps 3agermination 3ahabitats 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole butyric acid 3aphotoperiod 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atraditional medicine 3awild plants 3awoody plants1 aUchendu, E.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection was employed to measure these substances. The QuEChERS method was investigated to seek out a fast, cheap and easy technique for sample preparation. The sorbent, such as primary secondary amine (PSA) or octadecylsilane (C18), was applied in the clean-up step, but it did not demonstrate any advantages to the peak shape compared with extraction without the sorbent. The sample preparation method was optimized using different extraction solvents and salts in order to reduce co-extracted matrix components and improve phase separation. The extraction results from the QuEChERS method were not the best obtained by using recovery comparison; therefore, the final sample preparation method was the use of acetonitrile with the addition of sodium chloride only. The extraction method was evaluated by using fortified samples at three concentration levels (0.10, 9.00 and 18.0 mg kg⁻¹); extraction recoveries were in the range of 95 to 99%, with good repeatability (%RSD ≤ 9). Detection limits and quantitation limits were 0.01–0.02 and 0.03–0.05 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. To compensate for the matrix effect, the matrix-matched calibrations were prepared and an excellent regression (r² ≥ 0.997) was obtained. This study demonstrated a suitable extraction method for the determination of BADGE and its derivatives, with less labor, time and solvent consumption. The final method was also applied to real samples collected from local markets and the concentrations were found in legal limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abisphenol A 3acanned fish 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarkets 3aseparation 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3asorbents1 aLeepipatpiboon, Natchanun0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 July 10, v. 6, no. 15 p.5666-5672dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00757c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009800171520033900269592002800608650001200636650001400648650001300662650001200675650001100687653000800698653000800706653002800714653002500742653002200767773009800789856008600887852000900973655001200982IND60733339720221121015045.0210904e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073333972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1098432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Kenji10aStrategic investment and industry location in a footloose capital model of economic geography  aThis paper examines how strategic investment of capitalists affects the industry location in a footloose capital model.

Its components encompass the atmosphere, land, and oceans. The cycle is composed of evaporation, evapotranspiration, sublimation, water vapor transport, condensation, precipitation, runoff, infiltration and percolation, groundwater flow, and plant uptake. For a correct closure of the global water cycle, observations are needed of all these processes with a global perspective. In particular, precipitation requires continuous monitoring, as it is the most important component of the cycle, especially under changing climatic conditions. Passive and active sensors on board meteorological and environmental satellites now make reasonably complete data available that allow better measurements of precipitation to be made from space, in order to improve our understanding of the cycle&rsquo;s acceleration/deceleration under current and projected climate conditions. The article aims to draw an up-to-date picture of the current status of observations of precipitation from space, with an outlook to the near future of the satellite constellation, modeling applications, and water resource management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoceans 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asatellites 3asublimation 3awater management 3awater vapor1 aCattani, Elsa 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111923013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001800257520101200275592002801287650000801315650001301323650001401336650001101350650001201361650002101373650001601394650003101410700003601441773010901477856008101586852000901667655001201676IND60119169420221119142500.0141205e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011916942DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348141200892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevin, M.

For aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, the retention times grow exponentially with the number of carbon atoms in the analyte. The retention times decrease exponentially with increasing separation temperature. The dependences of the reduced mobilities of two peaks in the ionograms of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols with drift in air at 330 K on the number of carbon atoms in the analyte molecules with a saturated nonbranched chain are obtained. In the range of molecular weights studied, normalized mobilities linearly decrease with increasing number of carbon atoms in the analyte, which is consistent with the published data. For substances with equal numbers of carbon atoms and a nonbranched chain, mobility decreases in the order ketone > aldehyde > alcohol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acarbon 3aketones 3amolecular weight 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLantsuzskaya (Krisilova), E.

Incomplete degradation of the HMP leads to their persistence in the environment and a plethora of deleterious effects. Conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove HMP completely, and a promising alternative is comprised by biotechnologies based on microalgae. Bioprospecting of HMP-tolerant strains is a bottleneck for such technologies. Carrying out a full-featured testing procedure for each newly isolated culture is impractical. Rapid screening can save a lot of time, money, and labor by selecting the efficient strains for further characterization or finding the concentration range where the strain exhibits the highest tolerance. The suitability of two well-plate screening techniques, one based on wet spectrophotometric assay of photosynthetic pigments together with an alternative method based on PAM imaging of chlorophyll variable fluorescence, was tested. Five pharmaceuticals (azithromycin, cephtriaxone, amoxiclav, diclofenac, ibuprofen) and five original strains (Micractinium simplicissimum NAMSU F2, Desmodesmus sp. IPPAS S-2014, Chlorella vulgaris IPPAS C-2015, Synechococcus sp. IPPAS B-2053, Lobosphaera sp. IPPAS C-2047) have been involved in the screening. Both approaches proved to be suitable for rapid screening of the tolerance of the studied microalgal strains to the toxicity of the studied pharmaceuticals. The imaging PAM–based technique better resolved the rapid changes in the microalgal cell condition. The wet pigment assay better highlighted the effects developing on the time scale of days. Interestingly, Chlorella and Desmodesmus incubated with a low concentration of the pharmaceuticals displayed some stimulatory effects. Precautions necessary for using these methods including the measurement setup, the choice of light intensity, and other possible caveats are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a21-74-20004cRussian Science Foundation  a20-64-46018cRussian Science Foundation  a075-15-2021-709/RF2296.61321X0037cRussian Ministry of Science and Higher Education 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDesmodesmus 3aLobosphaera 3aMicractinium 3aSynechococcus 3aalgology 3aazithromycin 3achlorophyll 3adiclofenac 3afluorescence 3aibuprofen 3alabor 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3axenobiotics1 aVasilieva, Svetlana G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9047-39221 aZaitsev, Petr1 aLukyanov, Alexandr A.1 aSkripnikova, Elena V.1 aAntal, Taras K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9690-80340 tJournal of applied phycology.g2022 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.353-361dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02660-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167300001600228500001100244520041500255592002800670650001100698650001300709650001300722650000900735700001900744700002000763773013400783856008100917852000900998655001201007IND60603137520221120220955.0180712e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060313752DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437180400272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzmailov, S.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as essential signal transducers in cellular differentiation, as has been shown through recent discoveries. On the other hand, the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) has long been known to play an important role in all cellular regulated processes, including differentiation.In the present review, we focus on findings that highlight the interplay between redox signaling and the UPS regarding cell differentiation. Through systems biology analyses, we highlight major routes during cardiomyocyte differentiation based on redox signaling and UPS modulation.Oxygen availability and redox signaling are fundamental regulators of cell fate upon differentiation. The UPS plays an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency and the triggering of differentiation.Cellular differentiation has been a matter of intense investigation mainly because of its potential therapeutic applications. Understanding regulatory mechanisms underlying cell differentiation is an important issue. Correspondingly, the role of UPS and regulation of redox processes have been emerged as essential factors to control the fate of cells upon differentiation.

The mercaptoglycerol-modified AgNPs and aminophenylboronic acid-functionalized CdSe QDs are assembled into AgNP-CdSe QD complexes through the formation of a boronate ester bond. As compared to that of bare CdSe QDs, up to a 9-fold fluorescence enhancement and a clear blue shift of the emission peak for AgNP-CdSe QD complexes were observed, which is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of AgNPs. In addition, the as-formed complexes are gradually disassembled in the presence of glucose molecules because they can replace the AgNPs by competitive binding with boronic acid groups, resulting in the weakening of fluorescence enhancement. The decrease in fluorescence intensity presents a linear relationship with glucose concentration in the range from 2 to 52 mM with a detection limit of 1.86 mM.

It coexists with the threatened broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides), a species adversely affected by habitat disturbance and subject to poaching. The small-eyed snake is a habitat generalist and not subject to poaching. It may prey on other snakes, including the broad-headed snake, and, like the broad-headed snake, may shelter under thermally favourable loose rocks during the cooler months of the year. This may lead to interactions between these species due to the limited availability of such rocks, and possibly exacerbate other threats to the broad-headed snake, such as poaching and the loss of thermally favourable rocks. I conducted repeat surveys for snakes at 64 rock outcrops in Royal National Park over a 16-year period. I predicted that site use by the small-eyed snake would not be influenced by a disturbance variable previously documented to influence site use by the broad-headed snake. Observations were consistent with this prediction, confirming the unique vulnerability of the broad-headed snake. I used my long-term data to analyse the co-occurrence of the two species. The broad-headed snake was detected as frequently at sites with and without the small-eyed snake, suggesting that these species occupy outcrops independently of each other. Therefore, interactions with the small-eyed snake will not reduce the effectiveness of habitat restoration for the broad-headed snake in Royal National Park.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoplocephalus bungaroides 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3anational parks 3aprediction 3arocks 3asnakes 3asurveys 3aAustralia0 tAustralian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 66, no. 4 p.279-285dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl46151x0004-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO180793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011500166300001600281520122300297592002801520650002101548650001801569650001401587650001301601650001001614650001301624650001001637650002001647650001301667650004301680650002801723650005201751650001301803653000901816653001501825653001001840653002901850653002001879653001801899700001501917700001801932700001601950700001301966700001501979773016401994856008602158852000902244655001202253IND60527925220221120163507.0190416e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052792522DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61075-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jia,10aCloning, localization and expression analysis of two fw2.2-like genes in small- and large-fruited pear species  ap. 282-294.  aFruit size is one of the most important agronomic characters, which is mainly determined by cell number and cell size. However, our current knowledge about pear is largely unknown. Through counting of pear mesocarp cells at different stages, we found that the cell number, rather than the cell size, is responsible for the differences between small- and large-fruited cultivars. Fruit weight-2.2 (fw2.2) is an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting fruit weight in tomato and functions as a negative regulator in carpel cell division. To get more insights into this QTL in pear fruit development, we isolated two putative homologous fw2.2 genes, which were designated as fw2.2-like (PbFWL) genes. PbFWLs encode Cys-rich proteins with the CCXXXXCPC motif and belong to the PLAC8 superfamily. In addition, results from the subcellular localization indicated that PbFWLs were localized in the plasma membrane. The expression profile of the PbFWL genes by qRT-PCR showed they expressed higher in small-sized fruit cultivar than that in large-sized fruit cultivar during the cell division period. In summary, our data suggest that these two PbFWLs might be negatively related to the cell division in pear fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3acell division 3acultivars 3afruiting 3agenes 3amesocarp 3apears 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atomatoes 0apear 0afruit size 0afw2.2 0asubcellular localization 0agene expression 0acell division1 aZeng, Bin,1 aLUO, Shu-ping1 aLI, Xiu-gen1 aWu, Bin,1 aLi, Jiang,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2016 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.282-294dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61075-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245017600158500001400334500002000348520110900368592002801477596003501505596007801540650001501618650001901633650002501652650002401677650001801701650001101719650001201730650001701742650002901759650004401788650001001832700002301842700002601865700006101891773013001952856007202082852000902154655001202163IND60715792720221119074414.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071579272DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.46392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Rosso, Mirko10aElucidations on the structures of some putative flavonoids identified in postharvest withered grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) by quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrape dehydration is an oenological process used for production of high‐quality reinforced and sweet wines. High‐resolution mass spectrometry (ultrahigh‐performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time‐of‐flight [UHPLC/QTOF]) was used to deepen the characterization of some flavonoids previously proposed in Corvina and Raboso Piave withered grapes. By performing a targeted data analysis workflow and orthogonal identification approaches (tandem mass spectrometry [MS/MS]), in silico fragmentation, and calculation of putative retention time), elucidation on the structures of six compounds previously proposed was achieved (taxifolin‐pentoside, two tetrahydroxyflavanone‐hexoside derivatives, a tetrahydroxy‐dimethoxyflavanone‐hexoside derivative, a pentahydroxyflavone, and peonidin‐O‐pentoside); and the structures of four putative new grape flavonoids were characterized (dihydromyricetin‐O‐hexoside, taxifolin‐di‐O‐hexoside, isorhamnetin, and a pinoquercetin isomer). Findings enlarge the panorama of flavonoids in grape and of their possible biosynthetic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data  a127cDCS of Veneto Agricoltura  a3302cProgetto della Regione Veneto “I Passiti del Veneto”‐D.G.R.V. 3aSciaenidae 3aVitis vinifera 3abiochemical pathways 3acomputer simulation 3adata analysis 3agrapes 3aisomers 3aisorhamnetin 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awines1 aPanighel, Annarita1 aDalla Vedova, Antonio1 aFlamini, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0872-96750 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.e4639-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.46393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245018100204300001800385520054200403592002800945650001600973650001200989650002201001650001401023650002701037650002301064650002301087650002201110650001501132650001001147650004301157650001201200650002201212650002201234700002001256700001501276700001601291700001301307700001801320700001801338700001601356700001701372773012101389856008301510852000901593655001201602IND60677913220221118073540.0191213e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067791322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b037962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Runlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7388-809610a(−)- and (+)-Asperginulin A, a Pair of Indole Diketopiperazine Alkaloid Dimers with a 6/5/4/5/6 Pentacyclic Skeleton from the Mangrove Endophytic Fungus Aspergillus sp.

More than 150 intact polar lipids including phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), phosphatidic acids (PAs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) were identified in negative ESI mode. PC 18:2/18:2 and 18:2/18:3 were found to be the major components of strawberry lipid extracts at concentrations of 230 ± 36 and 189 ± 32 μg/g, respectively, in seeds and at concentrations of 330 ± 50 and 140 ± 22 μg/g, respectively, in pulp. The lipidic extracts of both strawberry seeds and pulp exhibited the dominance of LPC 16:0/0:0 at a content of 132 ± 19 and 114 ± 16 μg/g, respectively, and LPC 0:0/18:2 at 236 ± 20 and 150 ± 20 μg/g, respectively. The other most abundant species of strawberry seeds and pulp were PE 18:2/18:2, 40 ± 9 and 190 ± 40 μg/g, followed by PI 16:0/18:2, 51 ± 15 and 24 ± 8 μg/g, respectively, while PG, PA, and LPE show comparable abundance below 10 μg/g. The most recurrent fatty acyl substituents of PLs were C18:3 (α‐linolenic acid), C18:2 (linoleic acid), C18:1 (oleic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), C16:0 (palmitic acid), and relatively high contents of a shorter chain such as C14:0 (myristic acid).  aPublisher supplied data  aPONa3_00395/1cMinistero per l'Istruzione, l'Università e la Ricerca (MIUR) 3aFragaria ananassa 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aextracts 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alinoleic acid 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amyristic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphatidylglycerols 3aphosphatidylinositols 3apulp 3aseeds 3astearic acid 3astrawberries 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aCalvano, Cosima D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8832-70721 aHuseynli, Lachin1 aVentura, Giovanni1 aLosito, Ilario1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0025-33501 aCataldi, Tommaso R.I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4811-89590 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.e4523-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.45233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012500213300001800338520119600356592002801552650002301580650001701603650000901620650002001629650001301649650001601662651001101678700003201689700002701721700003101748773012701779856008301906852000901989655001201998IND60746981720221120043421.0220921e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074698172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02886-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoulinas, Georgios K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0323-695410aRisks Ranking in a Desalination Plant Construction Project with a Hybrid AHP, Risk Matrix, and Simulation-Based Approach  ap. 3221-3233.  aThis paper proposes a hybrid process based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), risk matrix, and Monte Carlo Simulation for prioritizing delay risks in construction projects and estimating the probability of timely project completion. The main contribution of this study is the development of a novel framework for risk assessment that quantifies the impact of more critical risks to each activity according to its nature and benefits from the advantages of the AHP for constructing an enhanced risk matrix. In addition to the above, the proposed framework exploits the computational potential of Monte Carlo Simulation to obtain more accurate predictions of a project’s completion time. The proposed approach was used for analyzing the duration, expected delay, and the probability of completion within the deadline, of a vital seawater desalination plant construction project, on the island of Alonissos, Greece. The proposed framework predicted the project duration more accurately than the classic PERT method did, and the results of the analysis documented that it could be a simple tool providing risk managers with helpful information while making decisions under uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3adesalination 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aseawater 3auncertainty 3aGreece1 aXanthopoulos, Alexandros S.1 aSidas, Konstantinos A.1 aKoulouriotis, Dimitrios E.0 tWater resources management.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 10 p.3221-3233dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02886-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245009600175300001600271520195000287592002802237650002202265650002702287650001402314650001402328650001602342650002002358650001302378650001902391650001602410650001502426650002102441650001302462650001202475650002302487650001002510650001402520650001702534650001802551650001002569650001202579650001202591653001802603653002702621653001302648653002202661653002302683653002202706700002102728700001902749700002902768700001502797700002502812700001802837773009902855856009002954852000903044655001203053IND60593367820221122133811.0190318e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059336782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiesco, Marta F10aImprovement of the cryopreservation protocols for the dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus  ap. 207-213.  aThe dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, is a potential species for aquaculture production although the limited number of males kept in captivity has been the cause of some constraints in its production. Sperm cryopreservation emerged as a solution for this problem. However, spermatozoa can be severely affected by freezing/thawing processes and poor sperm quality is a limiting factor in reproduction success. The present study aimed at evaluating two main aspects in the design of a cryopreservation protocol-extender additives (taurine, glucose, cholesterol, BSA) and sperm containers (0.5mL straws, 2mL cryovials and 5mL macrotubes). Sperm quality was assessed through the evaluation of the percentage of motile cells, viable cells, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. Some specific techniques, such as Caspase 3/7 detection, which provides information on membrane integrity and cell death, detecting early and late apoptotic and necrotic events, were required to establish an optimized cryopreservation protocol for this species. Taurine was the most suitable cryopreservation additive in terms of viable cells and cholesterol presented the highest percentage of necrotic cells in this study. Caspase 3/7 assay enabled us to detect necrotic damage induced by cryopreservation.The development of reproductive tools in dusky grouper, a potential species for aquaculture production, emerges as important tool to decrease the number of wild males maintained in captivity. A cryopreservation protocol was previously described for this species although several constraints in terms of sperm quality were detected. Our work provided new evidences that cryopreservation protocols can be improved through the addition of certain additives and use of appropriate sperm containers. Specific sperm analysis was crucial to identify and establish the most suitable conditions for breeders management and species conservation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEpinephelus marginatus 3aadditives 3aapoptosis 3aaquaculture 3acaptive animals 3acaspases 3acell viability 3acholesterol 3acontainers 3acryopreservation 3afreezing 3aglucose 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3aprotocols 3areproduction 3asperm quality 3astraw 3ataurine 3athawing 0aDusky grouper 0aSperm cryopreservation 0aMotility 0aDNA fragmentation 0aLipid peroxidation 0aCaspase detection1 aRaposo, Cláudia1 aEngrola, Sofia1 aMartínez-Páramo, Sonia1 aMira, Sara1 aCunha, Maria Emília1 aCabrita, Elsa0 tAquaculture.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 470 p.207-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017600165300001600341520130500357592002801662650001201690650001901702650001901721650000701740650001301747650002001760650001601780653002601796653002101822653003701843653001801880653002101898700005601919700005401975700001602029700001202045700005302057773012502110856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60730643620221119230944.0210506e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073064362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Huanjie10aRandomly heterogeneous oleophobic/pH-responsive polymer coatings with reversible wettability transition for multifunctional fabrics and controllable oil–water separation  ap. 122-130.  aStimuli-responsive surfaces with wettability change between superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic are susceptible to oil contamination which often ruins the surface. Herein, a coating with pH-switchable wettability transition between superamphiphobic and superhydrophilic-superoleophobic is achieved by rationally designing oleophobic/pH-responsive polymer heterogeneous chemistry. Fabrics modified with this coating show repellency to both water and oils, while upon exposure to acidic water (pH = 1) the fabrics change to be superhydrophilic-superoleophobic within a short response time of <5 s. More importantly, the superamphiphobicity of the fabric can be restored under mild alkaline condition (pH = 10), and the transition is reversible for many cycles. The effective in situ or ex situ wettability change under acidic/alkaline water treatment makes the coated fabric capable of separating oil–water mixture or even some mixtures of immiscible organic solvents. In addition, the coated fabric is also demonstrated to be promising as a new class of functional fabrics that provide protection against water and many oils in one condition, and can change to be hygroscopic, anti-static, oil-repellent and anti-oil-fouling in the other condition for improved wear comfort and self-cleaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3apolymers 3awater treatment 3awettability 0aHeterogeneous surface 0aSuperamphiphobic 0aSuperhydrophilic-superoleophobic 0apH-responsive 0aAnti-oil-fouling1 aXu, Zhiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8160-66771 aZhang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9032-99821 aLi, Xiaomin1 aWu, Zhu1 aZhao, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2386-29010 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July 15, v. 594 p.122-130dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100002200193245009300215300001800308520171600326536021102042592002802253596012102281596011702402650002202519650002402541650001302565650001202578650001902590650002602609650002202635650001302657650001902670650001202689650001102701650001502712650004302727650001902770650001402789650001402803650001702817651001002834700001802844700002302862700002002885700001502905700001602920700002002936700001602956773014002972856008603112961001303198852000903211655001203220IND60643881520221119172533.0190514e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064388152DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.15973032doi7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.15973032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlanrewaju, Sarah10aUsing aerial imagery and digital photography to monitor growth and yield in winter wheat  ap. 6905-6929.  aMonitoring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance throughout the growing season provides information on productivity and yield potential. Remote sensing tools have provided easy and quick measurements without destructive sampling. The objective of this study was to evaluate genetic variability in growth and performance of 20 wheat genotypes under two water regimes (rainfed and irrigated), using spectral vegetation indices (SVI) estimated from aerial imagery and percentage ground cover (%GC) estimated from digital photos. Field experiments were conducted at Bushland, Texas in two growing seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016). Digital photographs were taken using a digital camera in each plot, while a manned aircraft collected images of the entire field using a 12-band multiple camera array Tetracam system at three growth stages (tillering, jointing and heading). Results showed that a significant variation exists in SVI, %GC, aboveground biomass and yield among the wheat genotypes mostly at tillering and jointing. Significant relationships for %GC from digital photo at jointing was recorded with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at tillering (coefficient of determination, R² = 0.84, p< 0.0001) and with %GC estimated from Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) at tillering (R² = 0.83, p< 0.0001). Among the indices, Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Green-Red VI, Green Leaf Index (GLI), Generalized DVI (squared), DVI, Enhanced VI, Enhanced NDVI, and NDVI explained 37–99% of the variability in aboveground biomass and yield. Results indicate that these indices could be used as an indirect selection tool for screening a large number of early-generation and advanced wheat lines.  aThis research was supported in part by Texas A&M AgriLife Research Cropping System Program, Texas Wheat Producers Board and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project, USA (TEX09438).  aPublisher supplied data  cTexas A&M AgriLife Research Cropping System Program, Texas Wheat Producers Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004913  aTEX09438cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project, USAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaboveground biomass 3aaircraft 3acameras 3adigital images 3afield experimentation 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrowing season 3aheading 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3ascreening 3atillering 3awinter wheat 3aTexas1 aRajan, Nithya1 aIbrahim, Amir M.H.1 aRudd, Jackie C.1 aLiu, Shuyu1 aSui, Ruixiu1 aJessup, Kirk E.1 aXue, Qingwu0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 40, no. 18 p.6905-6929dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.15973033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245007300168300001800241520056200259592002800821650001400849650001900863650002300882650002300905650001200928650002200940650001400962700002100976700001900997700005801016773013301074856007901207852000901286655001201295IND60639745320221117070233.0190503e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063974532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b000712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakashima, Katsuki10aFormal Syntheses of (−)-Lepadiformines A, C, and (−)-Fasicularin  ap. 5222-5229.  aMarine tricyclic alkaloids lepadiformine and fasicularin, with a unique perhydropyrrolo[2,1-j]quinoline or perhydropyrido[2,1-j]quinoline framework, were synthesized starting from the B ring of the tricyclic system.

Our studies reveal that 6,6′-substitution on the isoindigo core results in a stronger intramolecular charge transfer band due to strong electronic coupling between the 6,6′-substituent and the core, whereas 5,5′-substitution induces a weaker CT band that is more sensitive to the electronic nature of the substituents. In the solid state, 6,6′-derivatives generally form J-aggregates, whereas 5,5′-derivatives form H-aggregates. With only two branched ethylhexyl side chains, the 6,6′-derivatives form organized lamellar structures in the solid state. The incorporation of electron-rich benzothiophene, BT, substituents further enhances ordering, likely because of strong intermolecular donor–acceptor interactions between the BT substituent and the electron-poor isoindigo core on neighboring compounds. Collectively, the enhanced photophysical properties and solid-state organization of the 6,6′-benzothiophene substituted isoindigo derivative compared to the other isoindigo derivatives examined in this study resulted in solar cells with higher power conversion efficiencies when blended with a fullerene derivative.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical structure 3afullerene 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 0aIsoindigo 0aphotophysics 0aJ-aggregation 0asolid-state organization 0aorganic solar cells1 aHiszpanski, Anna M.1 aWhittaker-Brooks, Luisa1 aLoo, Yueh-Lin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.14533-14542dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503812f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245013200202300001600334520145700350592002801807650001901835650001701854650001701871650001901888650001501907650001701922650001001939650001901949650001201968650001701980650001401997650001502011650001702026650001102043650001602054650002102070653003602091653001602127653002302143653002502166653002702191700001702218700001902235700001702254700001602271700001602287700001402303700005502317773012202372856008302494852000902577655001202586IND60730643720221119230614.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073064372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7774-032010aEngineering of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles for efficient delivery of water-insoluble paclitaxel in cancer therapy  ap. 424-433.  aThe efficacy of hydrophobic chemotherapy drugs in cancer treatment is often hampered by their poor solubility in the physiological environment, which causes their low delivery efficiency in the body. This manuscript develops an intelligent nanocarrier (~100 nm) drug delivery system that can highly load a water-insoluble drug, and possesses desirable tumor-targeting properties for cancer therapy. In this system, highly porous silica nanoparticles (pore volume ~ 1.4 cm³ g⁻¹) with a dendritic pore structure (denoted as DMSN) are applied as a matrix for drug loading. A facile, vacuum rotary evaporation-mediated casting method is applied to quantitatively load a high content of a hydrophobic drug (i.e., paclitaxel) in the DMSN matrix. A thiol-modified poly(methacrylic acid) (denoted as PMAsh) shell is then assembled and crosslinked via disulfide bonds on the particle surface to improve the dispersibility of the particles in an aqueous environment. After functionalization of the PMAsh shell with the targeting ligand transferrin (Tf), the nanocarriers exhibit accumulation ability on tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Combining the fascinating properties of high drug-loading, excellent colloidal stability, low cytotoxicity, targeting ability and glutathione-responsive PMAsh shell deconstruction properties, the nanocarriers described here hold great promise for the efficient delivery of hydrophobic drugs and tumor treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adispersibility 3adisulfides 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3aporous media 3asilica 3atransferrin 3awater solubility 0aMesoporous silica nanoparticles 0aTransferrin 0aStimuli responsive 0aWater-insoluble drug 0aTargeted drug delivery1 aLiu, Yinghua1 aZhou, Fangzhou1 aWu, Mingying1 aZhang, Qian1 aYi, Deliang1 aYuan, Wei1 aWang, Yajun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7557-58830 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July, v. 593 p.424-433dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170300001600260520199600276592002802272650003802300650002202338650001602360650002102376650001902397650001902416650001102435650001302446650004302459650001402502650001102516650001402527650001802541653003802559653002202597653001802619653002002637700001502657700001902672700001702691700001802708700002102726700001802747700001302765773016402778856008602942852000903028655001203037IND60527925820221120142953.0190416e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052792582DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61085-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFAN, Guo-cheng10aEvaluation of thermotherapy against Huanglongbing (citrus greening) in the greenhouse  ap. 111-119.  aHuanglongbing (HLB, or citrus greening) is the most destructive disease of citrus, which is associated with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las). Few management options are available, aside from preventive measures such as removing infected plants, planting disease-free seedlings, and managing the insect vector. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of thermotherapy against HLB under controlled greenhouse conditions. A total of 60 two-year-old, graft-infected Citrus reticulata Blanco plants were used. The plants were randomly divided into three groups (45°C, 48°C, and untreated control), with five plants/replicate (rep) and four reps/treatment. The treated plants were placed in phytotrons for a 4-h treatment session, repeated once per week for three consecutive weeks. Disease remission was observed eight weeks post-treatment. Real-time PCR assays revealed that Las titers in HLB-affected seedlings were significantly reduced in both 45 and 48°C treatments four weeks after treatment, with the exception of eight plants. In contrast, Las titers in the untreated control plants increased significantly during the same period, with a maximum increase of 28-fold. Except for seven plants, Las titers in the new flushes of treated plants decreased more than 90% eight weeks after treatment. Las titers in mature leaves of treated plants decreased 56 and 60% in average at 45 and 48°C, respectively, eight weeks after treatment. The HLB symptoms and Las titer of seedings were markedly alleviated eight weeks after treatment in both 45 and 48°C treatments. Our results laid a good foundation for the further development of citrus free-disease seedling cultivation and Huanglongbing control in the field. The whole plants were replaced for scion or branch in previous as the research object in this study, and the expression of Huanglongbing symptoms combined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to evaluate the effect of heat treatment in the greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aCitrus reticulata 3agreenhouses 3agreening disease 3aheat treatment 3ainsect vectors 3aleaves 3aplanting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aremission 3ascions 3aseedlings 3athermotherapy 0aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 0aCitrus reticulata 0athermotherapy 0abacterial titer1 aXIA, Yu-lu1 aLIN, Xiong-jie1 aHU, Han-qing1 aWANG, Xian-da1 aRUAN, Chuan-qing1 aLU, Lian-ming1 aLiu, Bo,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2016 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.111-119dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61085-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009800156300002000254520095500274592002801229650004401257650001201301650001401313650001901327650001401346650002001360650001101380650001901391650001401410650001601424650001301440653002001453653003401473653004601507653001901553653001601572700001601588700001501604700001701619700001901636773012601655856007501781852000901856655001201865IND60527709420221122234240.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052770942DNAL7 a10.1021/am50381642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhiming10aNovel Mn–Ce–Ti Mixed-Oxide Catalyst for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3  ap. 14500-14508.  aMn–Ce–Ti mixed-oxide catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method was investigated for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOₓ with NH₃ in the presence of oxygen. It was found that the environmentally benign Mn–Ce–Ti catalyst exhibited excellent NH₃-SCR activity and strong resistance against H₂O and SO₂ with a broad operation temperature window, which is very competitive for the practical application in controlling the NOₓ emission from diesel engines. On the basis of the catalyst characterization, the dual redox cycles (Mn⁴⁺ + Ce³⁺ ↔ Mn³⁺ + Ce⁴⁺, Mn⁴⁺ + Ti³⁺ ↔ Mn³⁺ + Ti⁴⁺) and the amorphous structure play key roles for the high catalytic deNOₓ performance. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy studies showed that the synergetic effect between Mn and Ce contributes to the formation of reactive intermediate species, thus promoting the NH₃-SCR to proceed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3adiesel engines 3amanganese 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3asulfur dioxide 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atitanium 0anitrogen oxides 0aselective catalytic reduction 0amanganese−cerium−titanium mixed oxide 0ain situ drifts 0aredox cycle1 aZhu, Junzhi1 aLi, Junhua1 aMa, Lingling1 aWoo, Seong Ihl0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.14500-14508dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam50381643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008700176300001800263500001900281520106200300592002801362650001901390650001501409650002801424650002901452650001201481653001301493653001501506653002901521653001901550700003001569700002301599773011901622856008501741852000901826655001201835IND60711974120221122131527.0201009e20201025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071197412DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2019.15812632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Rizwan Ahmed10aTextural classification of remotely sensed images using multiresolution techniques  ap. 1580-1602.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultiresolution analysis (MRA) methods have been successfully used in texture analysis. Texture analysis is widely discussed in literature, but most of the methods which do not employ multiresolution strategy cannot exploit the fact that texture occurs at various spatial scales. This paper proposes a methodology to identify different classes in satellite images using texture features from newly developed multiresolution methods. The proposed method is tested on remotely sensed optical images and a Pauli RGB decomposed version of synthetic aperture radar image. The textural information is extracted at various scales and in different directions from curvelet and contourlet transforms. The results are compared with wavelet-based features. Accuracy assessment is performed and comparative analysis is carried out using minimum distance to mean, support vector machine and random forest classifiers. It is found that the proposed method shows better class discriminating power and classification capability as compared to existing wavelet-based method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asupport vector machines 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atexture 0aCurvelet 0acontourlet 0amultiresolution analysis 0aclassification1 aBuddhiraju, Krishna Mohan1 aBhattacharya, Avik0 tGeocarto international.g2020 Oct. 25, v. 35, no. 14 p.1580-1602dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2019.15812633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001900168245014400187300001600331520113300347592002801480650002201508650002201530650000801552650001501560650001501575650002001590650001401610650001301624650001001637650001501647650002601662650003701688650002401725650003601749650006201785650001501847650001801862650004301880650005801923650003801981650006402019650003802083650001102121650002102132650005202153650002402205650006102229650002102290650002702311650002402338650005902362700002102421700001502442700001502457700001902472700001602491773008102507856008302588852000902671655001202680IND60080908420221122100707.0140812e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008090842DNAL7 a225644722pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sun Young10aComparison of pathways associated with hepatitis B- and C-infected hepatocellular carcinoma using pathway-based class discrimination method  ap. 347-354.  aMolecular signatures causing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are not clearly known.

In addition to differentially involved pathways, signaling pathways such as TGF-β, MAPK, and p53 pathways were commonly significant in both HCCs, suggesting the presence of common hepatocarcinogenesis process. The pathway clustering also verified segregation of pathways into the functional subgroups in both HCCs. This study indicates the functional distinction and similarity on the pathways implicated in the development of HCV- and/or HBV-positive HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3aalgorithms 3acell cycle 3adata collection 3ahepatitis 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxgeneticsxpathologyxvirology. 2aCell Cycle 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHepacivirusxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aHepatitis Bxgeneticsxpathology. 2aHepatitis B virusxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aHepatitis Cxgeneticsxpathology. 2aHumans 2aLiverxpathology 2aLiver Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathologyxvirology. 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMultigene Family 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSignal Transduction 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSong, Kwang Hoon1 aKoo, Imhoi1 aYi, Ki-ho,1 aSuh, Kyung-Suk1 aKim, Bu-Yeo0 tGenomics.g2012 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.347-354dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245012100217300001800338506007600356520039500432592002800827506003700855650002300892650002300915650002300938650000900961650001700970650001100987700002000998700001701018700006001035773012101095856008301216852000901299655001201308IND60677913620221207143205.0191213e20191122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067791362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b038122doi7 aPMC69566082pmcid7 a317552712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYalamanchili, Subbarao10aRapid de Novo Preparation of 2,6-Dideoxy Sugar Libraries through Gold-Catalyzed Homopropargyl Orthoester Cyclization  ap. 9646-9651.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA flexible de novo route capable of producing libraries of 2,6-dideoxy sugars is described.

This study evaluated and compared changes to the productivity of several fully private water companies (FPWCs) and concessionary water companies (CWCs). Specifically, the cost Malmquist productivity index was estimated by integrating inputs, outputs and environmental variables. A non-parametric approach was used by applying data envelopment analysis. This approach allowed us to quantify the parameters driving changes to productivity as cost efficiency change (technical and allocative efficiency), cost scale efficiency and cost technical change (technical change and input price effect). Through breaking down the cost Malmquist productivity index, relevant information for supporting decision making process by water companies is possible. To further evaluate the impact of water company heterogeneity on productivity change, the changes (convergence versus divergence) to productivity between group and meta-frontiers was estimated. The approach was applied empirically on a sample of 22 water companies in Chile during 2010–2017. The results showed that the productivity of both FPWCs and CWCs improved over time, with FPWCs performing better compared to CWCs. The main drivers of productivity growth for both types of water companies were scale efficiency, technical efficiency and input price effect. Thus, water companies in Chile could improve productivity by moving to a cost-efficient allocation of their resources. The rate of productivity convergence was higher for CWCs compared to FPWCs. The approaches developed in this study provide information that could be used by water managers to better understand what drives productivity and, thus, delineate strategies to improve performance over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3ainput prices 3awater 3awater utilities 3aChile1 aSala Garrido, Ramón,1 aMocholi-Arce, Manuel1 aMolinos-Senante, Maria0 tWater resources management.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 10 p.3355-3371dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02897-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008400167300001600251520109400267592002801361650002001389650002001409650001701429650002101446650000901467650001401476650001901490650001401509650001101523650002001534650001701554650001701571650001501588653001401603653002201617653002701639653002201666700003001688700002601718773011301744856008301857852000901940655001201949IND60547081920221120153632.0161023e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054708192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDindar, Efsun10aVariations of soil enzyme activities in petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated soil  ap. 268-275.  aPetroleum hydrocarbons can affect soil ecosystems, resulting in significant losses in soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different types of hydrocarbon pollution (crude oil and waste engine oil) on soil enzyme activities and determine the fate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) during an incubation period of 3 months. The possible use of wastewater sludge as a biostimulating agent in petroleum-contaminated soils was also evaluated. Enhanced enzyme activity levels in contaminated soils indicated that crude oil and waste engine oil (0.5% w/w) appeared to stimulate microbial growth and enzyme activity in the soil environment. The results also indicated that significant TPH degradation in both crude and waste engine oil-contaminated soils (87% and 65%, respectively) occurred after an incubation period of 3 months. The degradation of crude oil in contaminated soil was significantly enhanced by the addition of wastewater sludge, whereas no apparent biostimulating effect on TPH removal was observed in the case of engine oil contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrocarbons 3amicrobial growth 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3asludge 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil enzymes 3asoil quality 3awastewater 0aCrude oil 0aEnzyme activities 0aPetroleum hydrocarbons 0aWastewater sludge1 aTopaç Şağban, F.

The three most important diterpenes are cafestol, kahweol, and 16‐O‐methylcafestol (16‐OMC), and they are produced, except for cafestol, only by plants of the Coffea genus. Recently, in addition to these three major diterpenes, another 16‐O‐methylated diterpene (16‐O‐methylkahweol: 16‐OMK) has been identified and quantified, for the first time, in Robusta coffee. For many years, 16‐OMC has been considered present exclusively in Robusta, and so it has been reputed an excellent authenticity marker for the presence of Robusta in coffee products. For its quantification, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has proved very useful when compared with other methods. Quite recently, the detection of very low levels of the two 16‐O‐methylated diterpenes (16‐OMD) 16‐OMC and 16‐OMK in roasted Arabica was reported. This finding makes the use of NMR methods in 16‐OMD quantification in Arabica coffee particularly challenging in view of both the trace amounts of 16‐OMD and the impossibility to discriminate between 16‐OMC and 16‐OMK. The ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC‐MS) method, already used to detect 16‐OMC and 16‐OMK in Arabica roasted coffee, is then more suitable for quantitative analyses. Up to now however, no quantification of coffee 16‐OMD via ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC‐MS/MS) has been carried out; this largely stimulated the present study. For the first time, a simple procedure for the quantitative detection of 16‐OMD in Arabica coffee has been developed, and as far as 16‐OMC is concerned, fully validated in terms of specificity, linearity, concentration range, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and repeatability following the criteria specified in the EU Commission Decision 2002/675/EC. This method proved to be very specific and sensitive. In order to avoid the chemical complexity generated by the roasting process, the method was optimized and validated on several green Arabica samples from different geographical origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3acoffee products 3adetection limit 3aditerpenoids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aprovenance 3aquantitative analysis 3arepeatability 3aroasting 3asampling 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aColomban, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6081-14521 aNavarini, Luciano0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.e4636-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.46363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011400163300001800277520058500295592002800880650002100908650002300929650001800952650001200970650002200982650001301004650001401017650002001031700001401051700001601065700001801081700001801099700001401117700005801131773013301189856007901322852000901401655001201410IND60639745720221117070144.0190503e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063974572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b001402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Wenqiang10aOne-Pot Synthesis of O-Heterocycles or Aryl Ketones Using an InCl₃/Et₃SiH System by Switching the Solvent  ap. 5141-5149.  aAn efficient one-pot synthesis of O-heterocycles or aryl ketones has been achieved using Et₃SiH in the presence of InCl₃ via a sequential ionic hydrogenation reaction by switching the solvent.

In this study, we have not only identified and characterized a Rel-like gene from Brachiastoma belcheri, but also extensively studied the evolution of Rel gene subfamily. We found that: 1) the amphioxus genome contains an AmphiREL gene encoding a Rel/NF-κB homolog, and AmphiREL gene was involved in the innate immune response of LPS stimulation in amphioxus. 2) Gene synteny comparison and structure comparison suggested that AmphiREL is an orthologous gene of human RELB, and is a paralogous gene of human RELA and REL. 3) Structural changes of Rel subfamily proteins are diverse during the evolution process, and imply their functional diversity. 4) The Rel subfamily genes have undergone very strong purifying selection. Together, our results provide important clues for understanding the evolution and function of Rel subfamily genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional diversity 3atranscription factors 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3aevolution 3agenes 3aimmune response 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChordataxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, rel 2aImmunity, Innate 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNF-kappa Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeawater 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aproteins1 aJin, Ping1 aHu, Jing1 aQin, Sheng1 aChen, Liming1 aLi-Ling, Jesse1 aMa, Fei0 tGenomics.g2012 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.361-369dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010100159500001400260500002000274520165900294592002801953650001301981650001501994650001602009650001902025650001402044650001202058650002202070650002802092650001402120650002602134650001302160650001502173650001302188650001002201700002102211700002502232700006102257700002002318700006102338700001902399700002102418700006202439700006402501773013002565856007202695852000902767655001202776IND60715793420221119074528.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071579342DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.46072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenicatti, Marta10aDetermination of coeluted isomers in wine samples by application of MS/MS deconvolution analysis  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTwo organic acids isomers, 3‐isopropylmalic acid (3‐IPMA) and 2‐isopropylmalic acid (2‐IPMA), were identified and quantified in wine samples by using an LC–MS/MS method without any chromatographic separation, but processing the MS/MS data with a recently developed deconvolution algorithm (LEDA: linear equations deconvolution analysis), thus decreasing the time necessary for the process. In particular, the LEDA tool processes the MS/MS signals and assigns the relative concentrations (abundances) of the isomers in the sample, at the mg L⁻¹ level. The efficiency of MS/MS signal assignment was improved by introducing five linear equations to define the LEDA matrix. Then, as a novel approach, an overdetermined system of linear equations was applied for the deconvolution of isomers. The use of LEDA to identify and quantify the isomers in wine samples, together with the choice of a short LC column and a fast elution gradient, simplifies the process and shortens the time needed. Furthermore, it was evaluated the quantitative determination of the IPMA isomers by using the calibration curve provided by the precursor ion MRM transition data. The calculated values of accuracy (recovery between 82.6% and 99.8%) and precision (RSD between 0.4% and 4.0%) confirm the validity of this quantitative approach and the ability of LEDA to establish the correct percentage of the MS/MS signal for each isomer. Finally, to compare the conventional LC–MS/MS method and our proposed method of LC–MS/MS coupled with LEDA post‐processing elaboration, a series of real wine samples were analysed by both methods, and the results were compared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aalgorithms 3acalibration 3achromatography 3aequations 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic acids and salts 3aprecision 3aquantitative analysis 3asampling 3aseparation 3avalidity 3awines1 aPallecchi, Marco1 aRicciutelli, Massimo1 aGalarini, Roberta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1575-47561 aMoretti, Simone1 aSagratini, Gianni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6231-87091 aVittori, Sauro1 aLucarini, Simone1 aCaprioli, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5530-877X1 aBartolucci, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5631-87690 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2020 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.e4607-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.46073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006400138245011500202500001900317500002000336520233800356592002802694650001202722650001202734650002202746650001302768650001202781650002602793650002202819650001702841650002402858650001402882650002302896650002402919651001302943700005802956773011803014856007203132852000903204655001203213IND60715790420221119074406.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071579042DNAL7 a10.1002/ecm.14212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugspurger, Carol K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6395-871610aConcordance of long‐term shifts with climate warming varies among phenological events and herbaceous species  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany temperate herbs now flower earlier than a few decades ago. Little is known about other phenological events, despite the importance of life history integration for plant fitness. This study addresses the hypothesis that temporal shifts of multiple phenological events in herbs are concordant with temporal changes in weather. Explicitly showing that changes in timing of annual life cycle events are correlated with changes in weather‐predicting variables provides support for the hypothesis that a phenological shift is concordant with climate change. Observations of six phenological events and five phenophases were made year‐round for 25 yr for herb species in a deciduous forest fragment, Trelease Woods in Illinois, USA. Dates for 43 species were analyzed by linear mixed‐effects models for events and phenophases and were compared to weather data from a nearby station. For early species, emergence was delayed by 1.5 d/decade, while end expansion advanced by 3.8 d/decade and begin dormancy advanced by 2.5 d/decade. For late species, end expansion advanced by 6.7 d/decade, while begin senescence delayed by 17.7 d/decade. Begin flowering and end flowering advanced similarly for both seasonal groups, at 3.8 to 4.2 d/decade. Some events showed no temporal change. Species differed greatly in the degree or direction of change, related to seasonality of event or length of phase. Overall, for a given species, most events are advancing (68.4%) and most durations are shortening (74.4%). In 12 of 13 cases, inter‐annual variation in event date was predicted by a temperature‐event–season combination variable, but in only six cases did both event date shift and weather variable warm through time. This finding supports the hypothesis that climate change is associated with changes in some, but not all, phenological events. This first long‐term, multi‐phase study of a community of temperate herb species indicates little temporal coherence of responses of multiple phases. Changes in date are event specific, phase specific, and species specific. This complexity of responses among species and uneven responses within a species’ integrated annual cycle events has implications for evolutionary responses and more immediate interactions among plant, animal, and microbe species in this community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aclimate 3adeciduous forests 3adormancy 3aflowers 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aherbaceous plants 3alife history 3ameteorological data 3aphenology 3atemporal variation 3aweather forecasting 3aIllinois1 aZaya, David N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7393-38890 tEcological monographs.g2020 Nov., v. 90, no. 4 p.e01421-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.14213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245011800199300001500317520146100332592002801793650001201821650001601833650002201849650001401871650000901885650001001894650001101904650001901915650001101934700001901945700002401964773015201988856006902140856010602209990002302315852000902338655001202347IND60643879120221120144213.0190514e20160226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064387912DNAL7 a10.3791/538292doi7 aPMC48281902pmcid7 a269669352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCulloch, Kyle J.10aDetermination of photoreceptor cell spectral sensitivity in an insect model from In Vivo intracellular recordings  ap. e53829.  aIntracellular recording is a powerful technique used to determine how a single cell may respond to a given stimulus. In vision research, intracellular recording has historically been a common technique used to study sensitivities of individual photoreceptor cells to different light stimuli that is still being used today. However, there remains a dearth of detailed methodology in the literature for researchers wishing to replicate intracellular recording experiments in the eye. Here we present the insect as a model for examining eye physiology more generally. Insect photoreceptor cells are located near the surface of the eye and are therefore easy to reach, and many of the mechanisms involved in vision are conserved across animal phyla. We describe the basic procedure for in vivo intracellular recording of photoreceptor cells in the eye of a butterfly, with the goal of making this technique more accessible to researchers with little prior experience in electrophysiology. We introduce the basic equipment needed, how to prepare a live butterfly for recording, how to insert a glass microelectrode into a single cell, and finally the recording procedure itself. We also explain the basic analysis of raw response data for determining spectral sensitivity of individual cell types. Although our protocol focuses on determining spectral sensitivity, other stimuli (e.g., polarized light) and variations of the method are applicable to this setup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abutterflies 3aelectrophysiology 3aequipment 3aeyes 3aglass 3amodels 3aphotoreceptors 3avision1 aOsorio, Daniel1 aBriscoe, Adriana D.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Feb. 26, , no. 108 p.e53829-e53829dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/538293Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53829/determination-photoreceptor-cell-spectral-sensitivity-an-insect-model  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009000163300001600253500001500269520133900284592002801623650001101651650002301662650001301685650002301698650002301721650001001744650001401754650001601768650001101784650001701795650003201812650001301844650000901857650001601866650001301882653000801895653000901903653001201912653001101924653000901935653002401944653001501968653001001983700001701993700001902010700001802029700001702047700001302064700002002077773010802097856005102205852000902256655001202265IND50075877520221120201444.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587752DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2011.5614922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ning10aIdentification of volatile components in yak butter using SAFE, SDE and HS-SPME-GC/MS  ap. 778-784.  a2019-12-05  aThe volatile components of yak butter were isolated by solvent-assisted flavour evaporation (SAFE), simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE; dichloromethane and diethyl ether as solvent, respectively) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME; CAR/PDMS, PDMS/DVB and DVB/CAR/PDMS fibre extraction, respectively) and were analysed by GC/MS. A total of 83 volatile components were identified under six different conditions, including 28 acids, 12 esters, 11 ketones, 10 lactones, 10 alcohols, 4 other compounds, 2 aldehydes, 2 unsaturated aldehydes, 1 furan, 1 sulphur-containing compound, 1 unsaturated alcohol and 1 unsatruated ketone.

The present work successfully uses zinc phthalocyanine (Zn-tri-PcNc) and naphthalocyanine (Zn-tetra-Nc) to sensitize TiO₂ for photocatalytic H₂ production, which expands the spectral response of dye-sensitized semiconductors by harvesting light from 600 to 800 nm. Zn-tri-PcNc/TiO₂ has a H₂ production amount of 567.4 μmol with a turnover number (TON) of ∼7565, which is much higher than that of Zn-tetra-Nc/TiO₂ (236.5 μmol H₂ with a TON of ∼3153). In particular, Zn-tri-PcNc-sensitized TiO₂ shows an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of up to 0.2% under 700 nm monochromatic light irradiation and ∼0.1% under monochromatic light irradiation between 500 and 800 nm, indicating its efficient visible/near-IR-light-driven photocatalytic H₂ production. Future work on the panchromatic responsive dye-sensitized semiconductor system can be carried out using phthalocyanines co-sensitized with other dyes to utilize the whole visible/near-IR light of sunlight.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc phthalocyanine1 aYu, Lijuan1 aZhuang, Chuansheng1 aPeng, Tianyou1 aLi, Renjie1 aLi, Xingguo0 tRSC advances.g2013 Aug. 5, v. 3, no. 34 p.14363-14370dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41975d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165300001600306520098200322592002801304650004401332650002201376650002101398650001201419650002201431650002501453650001601478650001501494650002301509650001201532650001601544650003301560650003301593650002101626700001301647700001901660700001801679700001301697773011501710856008101825852000901906655001201915IND60080202720221118002053.0140728e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008020272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-014-0014-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Huadong10aImproved bioethanol production from corn stover by alkali pretreatment with a novel pilot-scale continuous microwave irradiation reactor  ap. 493-502.  aA novel continuous microwave irradiation (MWI) pilot-scale reactor was designed specifically for biomass pretreatment. To test the efficiency of this reactor, MWI-assisted alkali pretreatment of corn straw (CS) was investigated using a central composite design for the response surface methodology. With a processing capacity of 0.28 kg CS (dry matter, DM)/h, the optimal conditions were as follows: 4.50 kW, 30 min, and 3.50% NaOH (w/v). The glucose and ethanol production from the pretreated CS were 63.22 and 31.29 g/100 g DM, respectively. These values were 4.42 and 3.79 times higher, respectively, than those from untreated CS. Structural changes in the untreated/pretreated CS were identified by analyzing its chemical composition using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, the solid residue recovery ratio was demonstrated to be an indicator of the biomass bioconversion potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkali treatment 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3achemical composition 3acorn stover 3acorn straw 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3airradiation 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide1 aLuo, Hao1 aJin, Shengying1 aLi, Hongqiang1 aXu, Jian0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2014 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.493-502dSpringer-Verlagx1226-83727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-014-0014-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011900160300001600279520075100295592002801046650000801074650001001082650001101092650001501103650001001118700001501128700001701143700001301160773009901173856004801272852000901320655001201329IND4483824720221120054336.0120715e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448382472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4889-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLÃ¼, Tao10aEvaluation of ablation differences in air and water for hard tissues using full-field optical coherence microscopy  ap. 833-837.  aTo clarify the role of a natural or artificial liquid environment in the free-running infrared pulsed laser ablation of hard biological tissues, two- and three-dimensional morphologies of laser-induced craters must be quantitatively measured to distinguish ablation differences in air and in water. Full-field optical coherence microscopy is introduced, which has non-contact, non-destructive, non-preprocessing and higher-resolution advantages. Experimental results indicate that the ablation performances in air and in water are comparable for few laser pulses, but the ablation difference becomes obvious for more laser pulses. Optical coherence microscopy is more feasible than conventional means for the morphological measurement of craters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abones 3alasers 3amicroscopy 3awater1 aXiao, Qing1 aLi, ZhengJia1 aFu, Ling0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Mar., v. 57, no. 8 p.833-837dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4889-x  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013800168520254800306592002802854650001202882650002202894650002102916650000902937650001102946650001102957650001302968650000902981650001702990650001403007650001403021650001003035650001803045650002403063650001103087650001403098650001603112650001603128650001103144650001203155650001103167650001403178650001203192650001103204650001503215651001503230651001403245651001603259653002003275653000803295653002203303653002203325653001803347653001403365700001503379700001803394773010103412856008503513852000903598655001203607IND60724136120221120083316.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1058512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiscott, R.N.14aThe uppermost Pleistocene–Holocene mud drape across the Marmara Sea: Quantification of detrital supply from southern Marmara rivers  aThe Marmara Sea (area 11,350 km²; volume 3378 km³; central basins >1100 m deep) straddles the North Anatolian Transform Fault separating the Eurasian and Aegean-Anatolian tectonic plates. Along with the shallow straits of Dardanelles and Bosphorus (depths ~63 m and ~40 m, respectively), the Marmara Sea forms the only marine connection between the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. During Pleistocene glacial stages, the modern straits were subaerial valleys and the modern Marmara basin was occupied by the landlocked Propontis Lake. Previous researchers attributed major portions of a widely distributed uppermost Pleistocene–Holocene mud blanket (locally >10–25 m thick; volume 43–47 km³) to transport of suspended load through one or both of the straits, as either the Aegean Sea (at ~13.8 cal ka) or the Neoeuxine Lake (today's Black Sea, at ~11.1 cal ka) began to spill into the Marmara basin. To test these suggestions, the thicknesses and volume of the mud blanket were determined from >5000 line-km of airgun, sparker and boomer profiles and > 100 cores, and compared with the contemporary supply from local rivers to decide, by difference, if the straits might have had a significant role. Volume calculations for the detrital supply from rivers rely on (1) decades of daily water- and sediment-discharge data from gauging stations, acquired before 20th century dam construction and, independently, (2) the BQART model which uses a variety of hydrological, geomorphic, geological and climate data. These calculations demonstrate that >85–90% of the detritus in the offshore mud blanket was supplied by steep rivers (Kocasu River and its tributaries) and mountainous streams draining the highlands of the southern Marmara region. Geochemistry of the <38 μm fraction supports this source. Any input through the Dardanelles has been sporadic and limited to perhaps ~5 Gt of suspended load (equivalent to ~5.2 km³ of porous mud when deposited) because of changing directions and rates of flow since the Last Glacial Maximum. Resedimentation through mass wasting and transgressive shoreface erosion appear to be minor compared with river supply. The isolated nature of the Marmara basin and its supply from mostly a single watershed afford an opportunity to verify the reliability of this type of hindcast analysis, based upon sediment-discharge data and catchment models – analysis which cannot be completed with a comparable level of certainty along open marine coastlines elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarmara 3aPleistocene epoch 3aTurkey (country) 3aarea 3abasins 3acoasts 3adetritus 3aflow 3ageochemistry 3ahighlands 3ahydrology 3alakes 3amass movement 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amountains 3areliability 3aresearchers 3arivers 3astreams 3asupply 3atectonics 3avalleys 3avolume 3awatersheds 3aAegean Sea 3aBlack Sea 3aMarmara Sea 0aMarine sediment 0aMud 0aChemical analyses 0aSea-level changes 0aTransgression 0aWaterways1 aAksu, A.E.1 aYaltırak, C.0 tSedimentary geology.g2021 Apr., v. 415 p.105851-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1058513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011500156300001800271500002000289520144200309592002801751650001501779650001501794650001201809650001101821650001201832650001501844650001301859650001801872650001201890650001301902650001501915650001601930650002401946650001101970650001401981700001201995700001902007700001802026700001902044700002102063700002002084773014902104856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60592808620221121060320.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280862DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Dawei10aEnhanced NH3 capture by imidazolium‐based protic ionic liquids with different anions and cation substituents  ap. 1228-1236.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Ionic liquids have become potential absorbents to treat exhausted gases containing NH₃, which threatens the living environment of human beings. RESULTS: In this study, 10 kinds of protic and conventional ILs were synthesized and characterized and their densities, viscosities and thermal decomposition temperatures measured. The NH₃ solubility in ILs from the vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) experiments revealed that the chain length of cations had little influence on the NH₃ solubility of the protic ILs because of the high NH₃ capacities in protic ILs resulting from protic hydrogen atom compared with conventional ILs. The 2‐H atom on the cation influenced the NH₃ solubility in both protic and conventional ILs with different trends as the pressure was increased. Considering the effect of anions with the same cation [Bim]⁺, the order of NH₃ solubility in protic ILs was [Bim][NTf₂] > [Bim][SCN] > [Bim][NO₃]. Dynamic absorption of NH₃ in [Eim][NTf₂] preliminarily revealed that the absorption was fast under ambient pressure and through 5 cycles of absorption and desorption, the NH₃ absorption ability remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the NH₃ solubility and the structures of both protic and conventional ILs was revealed, indicating the protic ILs as an alternative material for the treatment of NH₃‐containing exhaust gases. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3aanions 3acations 3adesorption 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3anitrates 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3avapors 3aviscosity1 aBai, Lu1 aZeng, Shaojuan1 aDong, Haifeng1 aGao, Hongshuai1 aZhang, Xiangping1 aZhang, Suojiang0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1228-1236dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008900165300001600254520154300270592002801813650002101841650001501862650002601877650002201903650001501925653003501940653001301975653003001988653000802018653001702026653002502043653003402068653002602102700001802128700001902146700001802165773010302183856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60526464120221120052715.0190408e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052646412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Liang10aMIKE SHE modeling of ecohydrological processes: Merits, applications, and challenges  ap. 137-149.  aMIKE SHE is one of the most extensively used physically based distributed hydrological models that are capable of credibly interpreting the response mechanism of ecohydrological processes to ecosystem components and organization. However, implementing MIKE SHE in integrated catchment modeling is a complex task requiring an experienced modeling team with skills in a variety of disciplines, making it difficult for scientists without a background in hydrology or computer science to utilize this useful model. This review, from the perspective of ecology and environmental science, illustrates the important role of a physically based distributed model as a solution to issues related to ecohydrological processes, offering a major discussion of issues that received little attention from the previous reviewers and that would interest researchers without a hydrology background. The inevitable and possible difficulties confronting these potential users at the beginning and early stages of utilizing the model are also brought to light, with suggestions for solutions. This paper offers a brief review of MIKE SHE development and elaborates its main merits, key problems, and research on the model's theories and practices implemented by scholars. Lingering problems in current solutions are analyzed, and potential approaches to solutions are proposed. We hope that this paper provides some practical advice to researchers who want to initiate study of water issues related to modeling ecohydrological processes by employing MIKE SHE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer science 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3ahydrologic models 3awatersheds 0aDistributed hydrological model 0aMIKE SHE 0aEcohydrological processes 0aPUC 0aEquifinality 0aUncertainty analysis 0aHydrological process analysis 0aCalibration framework1 aHe, Chunguang1 aBian, Hongfeng1 aSheng, Lianxi0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Nov., v. 96 p.137-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008500184300001800269520122800287592002801515650002101543650001601564650001501580650002501595650002501620650002301645650002201668650001401690650002001704650001101724650002101735650002101756650000901777650001501786650003201801650001601833700002101849700002301870773010301893856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60081851820221120180041.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008185182DNAL7 a250015902pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3537-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Meetul10aOptimization of conditions for expression of recombinant interferon-γ in E.coli  ap. 6537-6543.  aInterferon gamma (IFN-γ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine that has a central role against viral and bacterial infections. In this study, the cDNA encoding 141 amino acids of mature IFN-γ from mice splenocytes was cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector pQE 30. Optimization of expression conditions resulted in high IFN-γ protein. Western blot showed that recombinant IFN-γ was specifically recognized by its counterpart anti-mouse IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro dose-dependent studies, with A549 and HeLa cell lines, showed that cloned IFN-γ was safe and had no effect on cell proliferation. The protein prediction and analysis using SOPMA program, revealed that IFN-γ had 80 α-helices, 8 β-turns jointed by 9 extended strands and 44 random coils. A total of four major clusters were observed with murine IFN-γ sharing 39 % homology with human IFN-γ. Pair-wise alignment studies with human revealed 26 % identity and 43.3 % similarity. The recovery of bioactive proteins from inclusion bodies (IBs) is a complex process and various protocols have been developed. We report here a simple, robust and inexpensive purification approach for obtaining recombinant IFN-γ protein expressed as IBs in E.coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abacterial infections 3abioactive properties 3acell proliferation 3acomplementary DNA 3acytokines 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainclusion bodies 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3aprediction 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3asplenocytes1 aSingh, Mrinalini1 aSingh, Shashi Bala0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Oct., v. 41, no. 10 p.6537-6543dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3537-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03964naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245013800201300001100339500001500350506007600365520235100441592002802792506003702820650001502857650002102872650001502893650001302908650001002921650001602931650002902947650002002976650001002996650001703006650001503023650002203038650001703060650001403077650001203091650001703103650002103120651001503141653001803156700002303174700002503197700002303222773008903245856007903334852000903413655001203422IND60555753020221207065820.0161029e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055575302DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-13-282doi7 aPMC35997072pmcid7 a234190682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, Quy A14aThe differentially regulated genes TvQR1 and TvPirin of the parasitic plant Triphysaria exhibit distinctive natural allelic diversity  ap. 28.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Plant parasitism represents an extraordinary interaction among flowering plants: parasitic plants use a specialized organ, the haustorium, to invade the host vascular system to deprive host plants of water and nutrients. Various compounds present in exudates of host plants trigger haustorium development. The two most effective haustorium inducing factors (HIFs) known for the parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor (T. versicolor) are peonidin, an antioxidant flavonoid, and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ), an oxidative stress agent. To date, two genes involved in haustorium initiation in T. versicolor have been identified: TvQR1, a quinone oxidoreductase that generates the active HIF from DMBQ, and TvPirin, a transcription co-factor that regulates several other DMBQ- responsive and –non-responsive genes. While the expression of these genes in response to DMBQ is well characterized, their expression in response to peonidin is not. In addition, the pattern of polymorphisms in these genes is unknown, even though nucleotide changes in TvQR1 and TvPirin may have contributed to the ability of T. versicolor to develop haustoria. To gain insights into these aspects, we investigated their transcriptional responses to HIFs and non-HIF and their natural nucleotide diversity. RESULTS: Here we show that TvQR1 and TvPirin are transcriptionally upregulated by both DMBQ and peonidin in T. versicolor roots. Yet, while TvQR1 also responded to juglone, a non-HIF quinone with toxicity comparable to that of DMBQ, TvPirin did not. We further demonstrate that TvPirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported. In the T. versicolor natural population of Northern California, TvQR1 exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TvQR1 and TvPirin have most likely evolved highly distinct roles for haustorium formation. Unlike TvPirin, TvQR1 might have been under diversifying selection to maintain a diverse collection of polymorphisms, which might be related to the recognition of an assortment of HIF and non-HIF quinones as substrates for successful haustorial establishment in a wide range of host plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahost range 3aparasitic plants 3aparasitism 3atoxicity 3aroots 3ahost plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3agenes 3aactive sites 3aflavonoids 3agenetic variation 3aAngiospermae 3anutrients 3ajuglone 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aCalifornia 0aMagnoliophyta1 aAlbrecht, Huguette1 aTsuchimatsu, Takashi1 aGrossniklaus, Ueli0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.28-28dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013600182300001600318520109200334592002801426650002401454650001201478650000901490650001801499650001101517650001601528650002401544650001301568650001601581651001501597653002501612653003001637653001501667653001601682653002201698653002601720700003001746700002101776773010401797856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60565748820221117065855.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen Akselrud, Caitlin I.10aExploring model structure uncertainty using a general stock assessment framework: The case of Pacific cod in the Eastern Bering Sea  ap. 104-120.  aAn assessment framework is developed that allows analysts to conduct stock assessments for fish and invertebrate stocks based on age-, size- and age-size-structured population dynamics models. The size-structured model is nested within the age-size-structured model. The framework can use catch, discard, index of abundance, size- and age-composition, conditional age-at-length, mean length-at-age, and tagging data to estimate model parameters. It is used to explore the sensitivity of key model outputs for Pacific cod in the Eastern Bering Sea by applying model configurations that use the same data, same likelihood functions, and same data weighting schemes. Base model configurations using the three model types all fit the available data adequately, but the age-structured model fits the data better than the size-structured model. Variation in estimates of spawning biomass and the overfishing level was higher among model-types than within model-types. This result highlights the need for assessment analysts to focus more on applying and presenting results for multiple models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus macrocephalus 3abiomass 3afish 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3aspawning 3auncertainty 3aBering Sea 0aAge-structured model 0aAge-size-structured model 0aAssessment 0aPacific cod 0aPlatoon-structure 0aSize-structured model1 aPunt, A.

Plants have developed highly flexible mechanisms to deal with drought, including organ‐ and developmental stage‐specific responses. In young leaves, growth is repressed as an active mechanism to save water and energy, increasing the chances of survival but decreasing yield. Despite its importance, the molecular basis for this growth inhibition is largely unknown. Here, we present a novel approach to explore early molecular mechanisms controlling Arabidopsis leaf growth inhibition following mild drought. We found that growth and transcriptome responses to drought are highly dynamic. Growth was only repressed by drought during the day, and our evidence suggests that this may be due to gating by the circadian clock. Similarly, time of day strongly affected the extent, specificity, and in certain cases even direction of drought‐induced changes in gene expression. These findings underscore the importance of taking into account diurnal patterns to understand stress responses, as only a small core of drought‐responsive genes are affected by drought at all times of the day. Finally, we leveraged our high‐resolution data to demonstrate that phenotypic and transcriptome responses can be matched to identify putative novel regulators of growth under mild drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acircadian rhythm 3adiurnal variation 3adrought 3aenergy 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3astress response 3atranscriptome 3awater stress1 aClaeys, Hannes1 aVan den Broeck, Lisa1 aInzé, D.q(Dirk),0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2017 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.180-189dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011400168300001600282520190000298592002802198650001902226650001902245650002002264650001502284650001302299650002502312650002002337650002702357650001402384650001202398650001802410650001402428650002102442650001502463650003702478650001302515650002502528650001002553650002102563650001302584653002902597653001902626653002202645653001602667700001502683700001702698700001602715700001902731700002102750700001602771700001802787700002002805700001802825773010202843856008702945852000903032655001203041IND60545684820221121122619.0160902e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054568482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, J.14aThe impact of TiO2 nanoparticles on uptake and toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis)  ap. 469-476.  aNanoparticles are emerging contaminants of concern. Knowledge on their environmental impacts is scarce, especially on their interactive effects with other contaminants. In this study we investigated effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NP) on the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and determined their influence on the bioavailability and toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), a carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Blue mussels were exposed to either TiO2NP (0.2 and 2.0mgL−1) or B(a)P (20μgL−1) and to the respective combinations of these two compounds. Aqueous contaminant concentrations, the uptake of Ti and B(a)P into mussel soft tissue, effects on oxidative stress and chromosomal damage were analyzed. The uncoated TiO2NP agglomerated rapidly in the seawater. The presence of TiO2NP significantly reduced the bioavailability of B(a)P, shown by lowered B(a)P concentrations in exposure tanks and in mussel tissue. The activities of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were impacted by the various exposure regimes, indicating oxidative stress in the contaminant exposure groups. While SOD activity was increased only in the 0.2TiO2NP exposure group, CAT activity was enhanced in both combined exposure groups. The GPx activity was increased only in the groups exposed to the two single compounds. In hemocytes, increased chromosomal damage was detected in mussels exposed to the single compounds, which was further increased after exposure to the combination of compounds. In this study we show that the presence of TiO2NP in the exposure system reduced B(a)P uptake in blue mussels. However, since most biomarker responses did not decrease despite of the lower B(a)P uptake in combined exposures, the results suggest that TiO2NP can act as additional stressor, or potentially alters B(a)P toxicity by activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemocytes 3amussels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorus 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aseawater 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atanks 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0aEngineered nanoparticles 0aBenzo(a)pyrene 0aCombined exposure 0aBlue mussel1 aBergum, S.1 aNilsen, E.W.1 aOlsen, A.J.1 aSalaberria, I.1 aCiesielski, T.M.1 aBączek, T.1 aKonieczna, L.1 aSalvenmoser, W.1 aJenssen, B.M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 511 p.469-476dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520090500288592002801193650003401221650002501255650002501280650001701305650001801322650001401340650002901354650002501383650001901408650001101427650002301438650003201461650001801493650002201511650000901533650001401542653002501556653001801581653002501599653002501624700001601649700001701665700001401682773010701696856005101803852000901854655001201863IND50075878120221120104014.0140410e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587812DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2011.5580162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoqiang10aChemical composition and antioxidant activity of the essential oil of Schisandra chinensis fruits  ap. 842-849.  aThis study was designed to examine the composition and in vitro antioxidant activity of the essential oil of Schisandra chinensis fruits.

The mixture of legume seeds and extracted rapeseed meal used in the studies can partially replace fish meal in complete diets for carp, while the effective level of fish meal replacement was varied and depended on the carp age/size group. Introducing mixtures of plant components up to 26 and 22%, respectively, to the diets of carp early juveniles and juveniles did not adversely affect rearing results. The best results in rearing two-year old and market carp were obtained using diets that contained mixtures of plant components of 32 and 27%, respectively. Analyses were performed on the dependence between the share of plant protein in the dietary protein of the individual diets and the mean individual weight of carp and the values of the feed conversion ratio. This provided the basis for the conclusion that plant protein can comprise from 30-35% of the total protein pool in the diets of carp early juveniles and juveniles, while the maximum allowable share in the diets of two-year old and market carp is 45%. The experimental diet used in the feeding of market carp did not have an impact on the sensory properties of the fish meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acarp 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3afish meat 3agroup size 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3alegumes 3amarkets 3anutritive value 3aplant source protein 3aprotein content 3arapeseed meal 3arearing 3aseeds 3asensory properties 0acommon carp 0afish nutrition 0adiets 0aplant protein components 0afish meal replacement0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2009 June 11, v. 17, no. 1 p.5-39dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10086-009-0001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245005900169300001800228520102400246592002801270650000901298650001101307650001501318773012601333856007901459852000901538655001201547IND60312851920221123042259.0150714e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031285192DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12549062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaychunas, Glenn A.10aDisrupting dissolving ions at surfaces with fluid flow  ap. 1094-1095.  aAqueous dissolution processes are not well understood on the molecular scale (1), and this has led to controversy, notably in geochemical systems (2 , 3). Charging of a solid surface, either by substitution of ions with a different valence (e.g., Ca2 ⁺ for Na ⁺) or by chemical binding of charged species from solution, orients the dipole moments of nearby water molecules. On the solution side of these dipoles, oppositely charged ions collect (4) and an electrical double layer (EDL) of different charges forms. Two prevailing assumptions about the EDL have been that water molecules and ions near the surface are not substantially perturbed by solution flow and that surfaces with low solubility have negligible effects on chemistry within the EDL. These notions are upset by the results reported on page 1138 of this issue by Lis et al. (5), who show both EDL sensitivity to flow-induced interface shear and substantial changes in surface charges as a result of dissolution processes on low-solubility surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3asodium 3asolubility0 tScience.g2014 June 6, v. 344, no. 6188 p.1094-1095dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12549063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012200186300001800308500001500326520209300341592002802434650001402462650001002476650001002486650001502496650001402511650001802525650001702543650003602560650001502596650001402611650001102625650001002636650002002646650002102666650001202687650003302699650002902732650001502761650004702776650001002823650002702833650002602860650004902886650002402935650002102959650001502980650001002995650004803005650001803053651001203071651002703083653002203110700002503132700003003157700002503187700002803212700002403240700002503264773011403289856004803403852000903451655001203460IND4471072420221120050639.0120626e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447107242DNAL7 a222465402pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-011-0067-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgundiyi, Alex I.10aPrevalence of mange among West African Dwarf sheep and goats and associated haematological and biochemical parameters  ap. 1263-1269.  a2019-12-06  aThis study was carried out to assess the prevalence of mange in sheep and goats in five local government areas (LGAs) of Ogun State in South Western Nigeria. A total of 4,973 sheep and 7,902 goats of West African Dwarf breeds were sampled of which only 4 (0.08%) of sheep and 42 (0.53%) of goats were confirmed positive for mange infestation. In all the LGAs sampled, Odeda LGA had the highest concentration of sheep (39%) and goats (51%) while Abeokuta South had the least percentage of sheep (1%) and goats (1%). All the mange-infested cases in sheep were recorded in just one LGA (Ewekoro) which constituted 0.24% of the population within the location. For goats, three out of five LGAs namely: Obafemi Owode, Ewekoro and Abeokuta North had prevalence of 1.46%, 0.53% and 0.72% respectively. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference between non-infested and infested animals in terms of packed cell volume (31.79 ± 0.87% vs. 31.41 ± 1.13%), haemoglobin (10.51 ± 0.21 g/100 ml vs. 10.28 ± 0.37 g/100 ml) and red blood cells (8.71 ± 0.29 × 1012/l vs. 9.40 ± 0.37 × 1012/l). The infested group however showed significantly (P < 0.01) higher white blood cells count (7.60 ± 0.22 × 109/l) than the non-infested animals (6.81 ± 0.17 × 109/l). Neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte as well as chloride were not significantly affected by the health status of the animals. There existed significant (P < 0.01) difference between non-infested and infested animals in terms of total protein (5.42 ± 0.16 vs. 4.75 ± 0.20 g/dl), sodium (137.98 ± 1.53 vs. 128.92 ± 1.92 mEq/l) and potassium (4.04 ± 0.14 vs. 3.46 ± 0.18 mEq/l). It can be concluded from this study that the prevalence of mange mite infestation varied with location and was generally low or absent in some of the LGAs considered. Goats were particularly more susceptible to mange infestation than sheep. More concerted effort is needed to control mange in order to avoid spread since it is a contagious disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasophils 3asheep 3agoats 3ahematocrit 3achlorides 3aanimal health 3aerythrocytes 3aWest African Dwarf (goat breed) 3ahemoglobin 3apotassium 3asodium 3amange 3aleukocyte count 3alocal government 2aAnimals 2aBlood Cell Countxveterinary 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aDemography 2aGoat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aGoats 2aHematocritxveterinary 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aMite Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aModels, Statistical 2aPotassiumxblood 2aPrevalence 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aSodiumxblood 3aNigeria 0aNigeriaxepidemiology. 0amite infestations1 aBemji, Martha Nchang1 aAdebambo, Olufunmilayo A.1 aDipeolu, Morenike A.1 aOnagbesan, Okanlawon M.1 aJames, Ikechwuku J.1 aOsinowo, Olusegun A.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 6 p.1263-1269dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-011-0067-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169520113800291592002801429650000801457650001301465650001601478650001101494650002101505650001401526650002101540650001601561650001801577650003301595650002101628650001301649653001001662653001701672653002001689653001201709700001701721700003201738700001801770700001801788700001701806700005601823773009101879856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60724136720221120102041.0220124e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Xianjiu10aProximity hybridization triggered hybridization chain reaction for label-free electrochemical homogeneous aptasensors  aA label-free homogeneous electrochemical aptasensor was developed for detection of thrombin based on proximity hybridization triggered hybridization chain reaction induced G-quadruplex formation. Thrombin promoted the formation of a complex via the proximity hybridization of the aptamer DNA strands, which unfolded the molecular beacon, the stem part of molecular beacon as a primer to initiate the hybridization chain reaction process. Thus, with the electrochemical indicator hemin selectively intercalated into the multiple G-quadruplexes, a significant electrochemical signal drop is observed, which is dependent on the concentration of the target thrombin. Thus, using this“signal-off” mode, label-free homogeneous electrochemical strategy for sensitive thrombin assay with a detection limit of 44 fM is realized. Furthermore, this method also exhibits additional advantages of simplicity and low cost, since both expensive labeling and sophisticated probe immobilization processes are avoided. Its high sensitivity, acceptable accuracy, and satisfactory versatility of analytes led to various applications in bioanalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaccuracy 3aaptasensors 3aassays 3achemical species 3adetection 3aelectrochemistry 3aexhibitions 3ahybridization 3ahybridization chain reaction 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin 0aHemin 0aG-quadruplex 0aElectrochemical 0aSensors1 aZhang, Caiyi1 aMachuki, Jeremiah Ong'achwa1 aWen, Xiaoqing1 aChen, Duankai1 aTang, Qianli1 aGao, Fenglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9367-83680 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
