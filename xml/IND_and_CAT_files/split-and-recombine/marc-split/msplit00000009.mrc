The size of the territory occupied by an arbor and the density of the arbor branches within that territory are important for computation because these factors determine what fraction of a neural map is sampled by a single cell and at what resolution [1]. Arbor territory size and branch density can vary by many orders of magnitude; however, we have identified a universal relationship between these two physical properties revealing a general neural architectural design principle. All of the arbors (axons and dendrites) we have studied (including fish retinal ganglion cells, rodent Purkinje cells, and the cortical arbors of various neural classes from rat, cat, monkey, and human) are found to be systematically less dense when they cover larger territories. This relationship can be described as a power law. Of several simple biological explanations explored, we find that this relationship is most consistent with a design principle that conserves the average number of connections between pairs of arbors of different sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaxons 3abrain 3adendrites 3afish 3aganglia 3ahumans 3amonkeys 3aphysical properties 3arats 3aterritoriality 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxphysiology 2aDendritesxphysiology 2aFishesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMammalsxphysiology 2aModels, Neurological 2aNeural Pathwaysxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity1 aStevens, Charles F.0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 21, no. 24 p.2105-2108dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245015100174300001400325520149300339592002801832650001101860650002601871650001601897650002601913650002201939650001701961650002201978650002202000650002202022650001302044650002702057650002302084650002402107650001202131650002302143651001502166653002402181653001902205653002002224653001302244700001702257700001502274700001602289700002002305773010002325856008702425852000902512655001202521IND60545761620221119121111.0170719e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054576162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuqaddas, Bushra10aLong-term frequent prescribed fire decreases surface soil carbon and nitrogen pools in a wet sclerophyll forest of Southeast Queensland, Australia  ap. 39-47.  aPrescribed fire is one of the most widely-used management tools for reducing fuel loads in managed forests. However the long-term effects of repeated prescribed fires on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how different fire frequency regimes influence C and N pools in the surface soils (0–10cm). A prescribed fire field experiment in a wet sclerophyll forest established in 1972 in southeast Queensland was used in this study. The fire frequency regimes included long unburnt (NB), burnt every 2years (2yrB) and burnt every 4years (4yrB), with four replications. Compared with the NB treatment, the 2yrB treatment lowered soil total C by 44%, total N by 54%, HCl hydrolysable C and N by 48% and 59%, KMnO4 oxidizable C by 81%, microbial biomass C and N by 42% and 33%, cumulative CO2–C by 28%, NaOCl-non-oxidizable C and N by 41% and 51%, and charcoal-C by 17%, respectively. The 4yrB and NB treatments showed no significant differences for these soil C and N pools. All soil labile, biologically active and recalcitrant and total C and N pools were correlated positively with each other and with soil moisture content, but negatively correlated with soil pH. The C:N ratios of different C and N pools were greater in the burned treatments than in the NB treatments. This study has highlighted that the prescribed burning at four year interval is a more sustainable management practice for this subtropical forest ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorrelation 3afield experimentation 3aforest ecosystems 3afuel loading 3ahydrochloric acid 3along term effects 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3apotassium permanganate 3aprescribed burning 3asclerophyll forests 3asoil pH 3asoil water content 3aQueensland 0aBurning frequencies 0aHCl hydrolysis 0aKMnO4 oxidation 0aCharcoal1 aZhou, Xiaoqi1 aLewis, Tom1 aWild, Clyde1 aChen, Chengrong0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.39-47dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009500204300001100299520238200310592002802692650002302720650001202743650001002755650002402765650001802789650002002807650002002827650003502847650001302882650001702895650003002912650001202942650001402954650001802968650002302986650002203009650001703031700002403048700002303072700002303095700002203118700002103140700002203161700002003183700002403203700002003227700002003247773010303267856008303370961001303453852000903466655001203475IND60724703420221116202242.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072470342DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-02837-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoltani, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0951-561X14aThe genetics and physiology of seed dormancy, a crucial trait in common bean domestication  ap. 58.  aBACKGROUND: Physical seed dormancy is an important trait in legume domestication. Although seed dormancy is beneficial in wild ecosystems, it is generally considered to be an undesirable trait in crops due to reduction in yield and / or quality. The physiological mechanism and underlying genetic factor(s) of seed dormancy is largely unknown in several legume species. Here we employed an integrative approach to understand the mechanisms controlling physical seed dormancy in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). RESULTS: Using an innovative CT scan imaging system, we were able to track water movements inside the seed coat. We found that water uptake initiates from the bean seed lens. Using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) we further identified several micro-cracks on the lens surface of non-dormant bean genotypes. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was conducted on a bi-parental RIL (recombinant inbred line) population, segregating for seed dormancy. This analysis revealed that the seed water uptake is associated with a single major QTL on Pv03. The QTL region was fine-mapped to a 118 Kb interval possessing 11 genes. Coding sequence analysis of candidate genes revealed a 5-bp insertion in an ortholog of pectin acetylesterase 8 that causes a frame shift, loss-of-function mutation in non-dormant genotype. Gene expression analysis of the candidate genes in the seed coat of contrasting genotypes indicated 21-fold lower expression of pectin acetylesterase 8 in non-dormant genotype. An analysis of mutational polymorphism was conducted among wild and domesticated beans. Although all the wild beans possessed the functional allele of pectin acetylesterase 8, the majority (77%) of domesticated beans had the non-functional allele suggesting that this variant was under strong selection pressure through domestication. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified the physiological mechanism of physical seed dormancy and have identified a candidate allele causing variation in this trait. Our findings suggest that a 5-bp insertion in an ortholog of pectin acetylesterase 8 is likely a major causative mutation underlying the loss of seed dormancy during domestication. Although the results of current study provide strong evidences for the role of pectin acetylesterase 8 in seed dormancy, further confirmations seem necessary by employing transgenic approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aalleles 3abeans 3acomputed tomography 3adomestication 3agene expression 3agenetic factors 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3aloss-of-function mutation 3apectins 3aseed coat 3aseed dormancy 3aselection pressure 3asequence analysis 3awater uptake1 aWalter, Katelynn A.1 aWiersma, Andrew T.1 aSantiago, James P.1 aQuiqley, Michelle1 aChitwood, Daniel1 aPorch, Timothy G.1 aMiklas, Phillip1 aMcClean, Phillip E.1 aOsorno, Juan M.1 aLowry, David B.0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.58-58dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-02837-63Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245005900177300001800236520077900254592002801033650001201061650001201073650002401085650002301109650002301132650001801155653001101173653001101184653001101195653001901206653001801225700002201243700002001265773008101285856008101366852000901447655001201456IND60529249320221119221506.0161019e20160721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajbongshi, Kamal Krishna10aTsNBr2 mediated oxidative functionalization of alkynes  ap. 4151-4158.  aA new approach has been developed for oxidative transformation of alkynes by controlled manipulation of TsNBr2 mediated process.

When alkynes are treated successively with TsNBr2, KI and Na2SO3 in a mixture of acetone and water at room temperature, corresponding ketones were obtained. On the other hand, treatment of alkynes with TsNBr2 and Na2SO3 in a mixture of ethyl acetate, acetone and water at room temperature could produce corresponding α-bromoketones. 1-Bromoalkynes could also be synthesized from corresponding alkynes within a very short time using TsNBr2 at room temperature.

This study extends our investigation of the role of ARF in the regeneration of other solid tissues, including the zebrafish heart and the mammalian digit. Heart regeneration after cryoinjury was used to mimic massive myocardial infarction. ARF gene expression was upregulated during the cardiac regenerative process and slowed the rate of morphological recovery. ARF specifically impacts cardiomyocytes, neovascularization, and the endothelial-mesenchymal transition, while not affecting epicardial proliferation. This suggests that in the context of regeneration, ARF is specifically expressed in cells undergoing dedifferentiation. To investigate ARF as a suppressor of epimorphic regeneration in mammalian systems, we also tested whether the absence of ARF was permissive for murine digit regeneration, but found that ARF absence alone was insufficient to significantly alter digit restoration. These findings provide additional evidence that ARF suppresses epimorphic regeneration, but suggests that modulation of ARF alone is insufficient to permit regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aangiogenesis 3acardiomyocytes 3acyclins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aneoplasms 3anucleotide sequences 3askeletal muscle1 aHesse, Robert 1 aTamaki, Stanley 1 aGarland, Catharine 1 aPomerantz, Jason  H.0 tGenes.g2020 June 18, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011800166300001600284520173600300592002802036650001302064650001502077650002002092650000902112650001702121650001002138650001002148650001002158650002302168650001402191650001502205650002402220650001702244650002402261650001002285653002502295653002202320653001302342653001702355653001502372700001902387700001902406773012502425856008502550852000902635655001202644IND60636642720221117173632.0190624e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063664272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2019.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Heejin10aReal-time temperature monitoring for the early detection of mastitis in dairy cattle: Methods and case researches  ap. 119-125.  aMastitis commonly occurs in dairy cattle during lactation. This disease has huge effects on the productivity of dairy cattle and the profits of stock farms. Enhancing the efficiency of mastitis treatment begins with the early detection of the disease. The purpose of this research is early detection of mastitis by monitoring the pathogenesis of mastitis through real-time measurements of the rumen temperature by utilizing an ingestible bio-sensor. The ingestible bio-sensor used for this research is orally administered and settles in the rumen. This bio-sensor can measure the cattle's body temperature accurately without any interference from the ambient environment. Also, this method requires less labor and the cattle experience less stress. The measured body temperature data is collected and transmitted to a server for analysis to detect any abnormalities. We administered bio-sensors to 50 Holstein dairy cattle and monitored their rumen temperatures for six months by measuring the temperatures in 10-min intervals. The farm manager could receive mastitis alert messages through a mobile application when a rise in a cow’s body temperature was detected. In addition, the manager conducted daily CMT to diagnose any mastitis incidence. The study results showed 15 subclinical mastitis incidences including recurrences from 9 cows, with 14 alert messages sent from the body temperature monitoring system. The average temperature of high fever cases was 41.10 °C.

Thus, understanding how telomere length is monitored has significant medical implications, especially in the fields of aging and cancer. In yeast, telomerase is constitutively active. A large network of genes participates in controlling telomere length [4–8]. Tor1 and Tor2 (targets of rapamycin [9]) are two similar kinases that regulate cell growth [10]. Both can be found as part of the TOR complex 1 (TORC1 [11]), which coordinates the response to nutrient starvation and is sensitive to rapamycin [12]. The rapamycin-insensitive TOR complex 2 (TORC2) contains only Tor2 and regulates actin cytoskeleton polarization [13]. Here we provide evidence for a role of TORC1 in telomere shortening upon starvation in yeast cells. The TORC1 signal is transduced by the Gln3/Gat1/Ure2 pathway, which controls the levels of the Ku heterodimer, a telomere regulator. We discuss the potential implications for the usage of rapamycin as a therapeutic agent against cancer and the effect that calorie restriction may have on telomere length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell growth 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3amicrofilaments 3astarvation 3atelomerase 3atelomeres 3ayeasts 2aCaloric Restriction 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGATA Transcription Factorsxmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aNeoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aPrionsxmetabolism 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSirolimusxpharmacology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTelomerexmetabolism 2aTelomere Shortening 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHarari, Yaniv1 aToren, Amos1 aKupiec, Martin0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 21, no. 24 p.2115-2120dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006100168300001800229520090200247592002801149650002201177650002301199650002301222650001501245653001201260653001801272653003701290653001701327653001601344700002201360700002001382700001901402700002001421700002101441773008101462856008101543852000901624655001201633IND60529249420221119221414.0161019e20160707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuirado, Antonio12aA new convenient synthetic approach to diarylpyrimidines  ap. 3922-3929.  aA new synthetic method in pyrimidine chemistry has been developed. 2,2,2-Trichloroethylideneacetophenones, easily available from chloral and acetophenones, reacted with benzamidines to provide novel 2,6-diaryl-6-hydroxy-4-trichloromethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidines in near quantitative yields. Efficient dehydration of these compounds gave previously unknown 2,4-diaryl-6-trichloromethyl-1,6-dihydropyrimidines, which were found able to undergo base-induced chloroform elimination to give 2,4-diarylpyrimidines in high yields. Molecular structures for final and intermediate compounds were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. A main improvement of this procedure lies in circumventing the oxidative aromatization of dihydropyrimidine intermediates through a chloroform elimination process. The diarylpyrimidines were also found directly accessible by a fair yield one-pot procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achloroform 0aChloral 0aAcetophenones 0aTrichloroethylideneacetophenones 0aBenzamidines 0aPyrimidines1 aAlarcón, Enrique1 aVicente, Yesica1 aAndreu, Raquel1 aBautista, Delia1 aGálvez, Jesús,0 tTetrahedron.g2016 July 07, v. 72 p.3922-3929dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008400164300001600248520162400264592002801888650001501916650001201931650002501943650001501968650001701983650001002000650002802010650001202038650001302050650001302063650001602076650001402092650001602106650003702122650000902159650001102168650001902179650001302198650001202211650001002223650002702233650001402260650001802274650001202292650002202304650001102326650002002337650001002357650001402367650001802381650001402399700001702413700001702430700001502447700001702462700001502479773008702494856008102581852000902662655001202671IND60120572420221123010756.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012057242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-013-1493-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aGlycine metabolism in animals and humans: implications for nutrition and health  ap. 463-477.  aGlycine is a major amino acid in mammals and other animals. It is synthesized from serine, threonine, choline, and hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism involving primarily the liver and kidneys. Under normal feeding conditions, glycine is not adequately synthesized in birds or in other animals, particularly in a diseased state. Glycine degradation occurs through three pathways: the glycine cleavage system (GCS), serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and conversion to glyoxylate by peroxisomal D-amino acid oxidase. Among these pathways, GCS is the major enzyme to initiate glycine degradation to form ammonia and CO₂in animals. In addition, glycine is utilized for the biosynthesis of glutathione, heme, creatine, nucleic acids, and uric acid. Furthermore, glycine is a significant component of bile acids secreted into the lumen of the small intestine that is necessary for the digestion of dietary fat and the absorption of long-chain fatty acids. Glycine plays an important role in metabolic regulation, anti-oxidative reactions, and neurological function. Thus, this nutrient has been used to: (1) prevent tissue injury; (2) enhance anti-oxidative capacity; (3) promote protein synthesis and wound healing; (4) improve immunity; and (5) treat metabolic disorders in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, ischemia-reperfusion injuries, cancers, and various inflammatory diseases. These multiple beneficial effects of glycine, coupled with its insufficient de novo synthesis, support the notion that it is a conditionally essential and also a functional amino acid for mammals (including pigs and humans).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3aantioxidant activity 3abile acids 3abiosynthesis 3abirds 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholine 3acreatine 3adiabetes 3adietary fat 3adigestion 3aglutathione 3aglycine hydroxymethyltransferase 3aheme 3ahumans 3ahydroxyproline 3aimmunity 3akidneys 3aliver 3along chain fatty acids 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acids 3aobesity 3aprotein synthesis 3aserine 3asmall intestine 3aswine 3athreonine 3atissue repair 3auric acid1 aWu, Zhenlong1 aDai, Zhaolai1 aYang, Ying1 aWang, Junjun1 aWu, Guoyao0 tAmino acids.g2013 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.463-477dSpringer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-013-1493-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013400209300001800343520150500361592002801866650002501894650001601919650001501935650002101950650001401971650001901985650001702004650001602021700002102037700001702058773012802075856008502203852000902288655001202297IND60767354920221117213006.0220215e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076735492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c043392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakata, Toshiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1246-500010aHydrogel-Coated Gate Field-Effect Transistor for Real-Time and Label-Free Monitoring of β-Amyloid Aggregation and Its Inhibition  ap. 2820-2826.  aIn this paper, we propose a hydrogel-coated gate field-effect transistor (FET) for the real-time and label-free monitoring of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and its inhibition. The hydrogel used in this study is composed of poly tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), in which Aβ monomers are entrapped and then aggregate, and coated on the gate insulator; that is, Aβ aggregation is induced in the vicinity of the sensing surface. With the Aβ hydrogel-coated gate FET, the steplike decrease in the surface potential of the Aβ hydrogel-coated gate electrode is electrically monitored in real time, according to the stepwise aggregation of Aβ monomers to form into fibrils through oligomers and so forth in stages. This is because the capacitance of the Aβ-hydrogel membrane decreases depending on the stage of aggregation; that is, the hydrophobicity of the Aβ-hydrogel membrane increases stepwise depending on the amount of Aβ aggregates. The formation of Aβ fibrils is also confirmed in the measurement solution using a fluorescent dye, thioflavin T, which selectively binds to the Aβ fibrils. Moreover, the addition of daunomycin, an inhibitor of Aβ aggregation, to the measurement solution suppresses the stepwise electrical response of the Aβ hydrogel-coated gate FET. Thus, a platform based on the Aβ hydrogel-coated gate FET is suitable for a simple screening system for inhibitors of Aβ aggregation, which may lead the identification of potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acapacitance 3aelectrodes 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3atherapeutics 3atransistors1 aShiratori, Reiko1 aKato, Masaru0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 94, no. 6 p.2820-2826dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c043393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245008300163520109800246592002801344650001101372650000901383650002001392650001001412650001001422650000901432650000901441650001301450650001401463700002001477700002201497700002201519700002301541773011801564856007701682852000901759655001201768IND60703065820221117194935.0200719e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070306582DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110605962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripon, Florin 10aPitt-Hopkins Syndrome: Clinical and Molecular Findings of a 5-Year-Old Patient  aPitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a very rare condition and until now, approximately 500 patients were reported worldwide, of which not all are genetically confirmed.

Of 53 elements analysed in both materials, Cd concentrations are, on average, 17 times higher in the O horizon than in the C horizon and other PTEs such as Ag (11-fold), Hg (10-fold), Sb (8-fold), Pb (4-fold) and Sn (2-fold) are all strongly enriched relative to the C horizon. Geochemical maps of the survey area do not reflect an impact from local or distant anthropogenic contamination sources in the data for O horizon soil samples. The higher concentrations of PTEs in the O horizon are the result of the interaction of the underlying geology, the vegetation zone and type, and climatic effects. Based on the general accordance with existing data from earlier surveys in other parts of northern Europe, the presence of a location-independent, superordinate natural trend towards enrichment of these elements in the O horizon relative to the C horizon soil is indicated. The results imply that the O and C horizons of soils are different geochemical entities and that their respective compositions are controlled by different processes. Local mineral soil analyses (or published data for the chemical composition of the average continental crust) cannot be used to provide a geochemical background for surface soil. At the regional scale used here surface soil chemistry is still dominated by natural sources and processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC horizons 3aantimony 3acadmium 3achemical composition 3aforest soils 3ageology 3alead 3amercury 3amineral soils 3aorganic horizons 3asoil chemistry 3asoil sampling 3asurveys 3atin 3atoxic substances 3avegetation 3aNorthern European region 3aNorway 0aVegetation 0aSoil horizons 0aEnrichment factor 0aTop/Bot ratio1 aFabian, K.1 aSchilling, J.1 aRoberts, D.1 aEnglmaier, P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.130-141dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245015300157300001400310520215400324592002802478650003102506650002502537650001302562650002402575650001002599650001502609650002402624650002002648650002002668650002302688650001002711650002002721650001702741650001902758650001902777650001802796650001002814650002402824650001502848650001102863650001502874650001602889650001202905650001402917653001202931653001302943653001502956653001202971700002202983700002003005700001403025700001503039773013903054856007703193852000903270655001203279IND60747545320221120083935.0210814e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074754532DNAL7 a10.3920/JAAN2021.00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbs, K.12aA probiotic and mixed-enzymes combination reduces the inflammatory response, faecal shedding and systemic spread of Campylobacter jejuni in broilers  ap. 65-75.  aRecent research has questioned the notion that Campylobacter jejuni is a harmless resident of the avian gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The following trial examined the effect of dietary supplementation with a mixture of enzymes and Bacillus-based probiotics on growth performance, C. jejuni colonisation, GIT immune responses, faecal shedding and extra-intestinal spread in broilers. Fifty-eight, Ross 308 d-old broilers were randomly assigned to one of four treatments, giving 14 or 15 birds/pen. Birds were given nutritionally complete, complex, phased diets unsupplemented (two treatments) or supplemented (two treatments) with a multi-enzyme containing 2,000 U/kg xylanase, 200 U/kg amylase and 4,000 U/kg protease, and 75,000 cfu/g of a combination of three strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. One control and one supplemented diet group contained birds orally challenged with 10⁵ cfu C. jejuni strain M1 on d 21 of age. Among challenged birds, the mixed-enzymes and probiotic combination numerically reduced faecal C. jejuni shedding (-98% vs challenged control) three days-post-infection (d.p.i.), and at 7 d.p.i. numerically reduced C. jejuni colonisation of the ileal mucosa (-1000-fold vs control) and totally inhibited systemic spread of C. jejuni to the liver, compared to the control (P<0.05). It suppressed early pro-inflammatory chemokine response seen in the ileum, caecum and caecal tonsil tissues (at 3 d.p.i.) in challenged control birds (-18 to -46-fold; P<0.05) and altered expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-17F) and regulatory (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines. The data demonstrated inhibition of a sustained pro-inflammatory response to C. jejuni infection and improved intestinal barrier integrity in supplemented birds. This highlighted the importance of looking beyond simple measurements of feed conversion and body weight gain when seeking to understand the effects and mode of action of poultry dietary interventions. Achieving a favourable balance between the gut, immune function, microbiome and nutrition should be the goal for achieving good gastrointestinal health and optimal performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aamylases 3abody weight changes 3acecum 3achemokines 3adietary supplements 3adigestive tract 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3amicrobiome 3amucosa 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3atonsils 3axylanases 0aenzymes 0aimmunity 0agut health 0apoultry1 aLacharme-Lora, L.1 aDersjant-Li, Y.1 aEvans, C.1 aWigley, P.0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 9, no. 2 p.65-75dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:2269x2049-257X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JAAN2021.00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245020200173300001100375520201000386592002802396596006002424596005102484650001502535650001502550650001402565650001502579650001402594650001202608650001402620650001402634650001202648650001302660650002302673650000902696650001202705650002002717650001702737650000902754650001902763650002402782700001902806700002002825700005302845773011502898856008303013852000903096655001203105IND60724703920221116202342.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072470392DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02714-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAilia, Muhammad Joan10aDevelopment of in-vitro maturation protocol for rat oocytes; under simple culture vs co-culture with cumulus cell monolayer and its developmental potential via Parthenogenetic/artificial activation  ap. 44.  aBACKGROUND: Murine is the most abundantly used as laboratory animal models. There has been a tremendous amount of research including; their evolution, growth, physiology, disease modeling as well as genomic mapping. Rats and mice are the most widely used among them. Although both rats and mice fall under the same category still both are different a lot too. As regarding in vitro maturation and development mouse studies are well established as compared to rats which still lies in the early phase of development. So, we tried to figure out rat oocytes in vitro maturation and their developmental potential by performing 3 experiments i.e. superovulation, in vitro Maturation as simple culture (COC’s only), and COC’s & cumulus cells co-culture, which later further developed using parthenogenetic activation after IVM. Female Sprague Dawley rat 3–4 week used for these studies, we hyper-stimulated their ovaries using PMSG and hCG 150 IU/kg each. After that, we collected ovaries via dissection and retrieved oocytes. We matured them in TCM 199 supplemented with FSH, Estrogen, EGF, and Pyruvate. After maturation, we activated them using two types of activators i.e. Ethanol 7%, Ionomycin. After that, we saw and compared their developmental potential in vitro. RESULTS: Oocytes matured in COC’s and Cumulus cell monolayer co-culture (59% ± 4*) showed significantly more even growth and extrusion of the first polar body as compared to the COC’s only culture (53.8 ± 7%*). While oocytes activated using Ionomycin showed more promising development until 8 cells/blastocyst level compared to ethanol 7%. CONCLUSION: we concluded that COC’s and cumulus monolayer co-culture is better than COC’s only culture. Cumulus monolayer provides extra aid in the absorption of nutrients and supplements thus providing a better environment for oocytes growth. Also, we concluded that matured oocytes showed more developmental capacity after activation via ionomycin compared to ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017R1A2B3004972cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aS2566872cMSS (Technology Development Program) 3aabsorption 3ablastocyst 3acoculture 3adissection 3aestrogens 3aethanol 3aevolution 3aextrusion 3afemales 3agenomics 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3aoocytes 3aparthenogenesis 3apyruvic acid 3arats 3asuperovulation 3aveterinary medicine1 aJin, Yun-Kyong1 aKim, Hee-Kyoung1 aJang, Goo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3804-18710 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02714-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009400163520158400257592002801841650002801869650001201897650001901909650002001928650001001948650001101958650001701969650001201986650001201998650001302010650001402023650002002037650002302057650001602080650001202096650002602108650001102134700002202145773011902167856007702286852000902363655001202372IND60703066120221120194546.0200719e20200619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070306612DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110606692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guanghong,10aSexual Differentiation Is Coordinately Regulated by Cryptococcus neoformans CRK1 and GAT1  aThe heterothallic basidiomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has two mating types, MATa and MATα. Morphological progression of bisexual reproduction in C. neoformans is as follows: yeast to hyphal transition, filament extension, basidium formation, meiosis, and sporulation. C. neoformans Cdk-related kinase 1 (CRK1) is a negative regulator of bisexual mating. In this study, we characterized the morphological features of mating structures in the crk1 mutant and determined the genetic interaction of CRK1 in the regulatory networks of sexual differentiation. In the bilateral crk1 mutant cross, despite shorter length of filaments than in the wild-type cross, dikaryotic filaments and other structures still remained intact during bisexual mating, but the timing of basidium formation was approximately 18 h earlier than in the cross between wild type strains. Furthermore, gene expression analyses revealed that CRK1 modulated the expression of genes involved in the progression of hyphal elongation, basidium formation, karyogamy and meiosis. Phenotypic results showed that, although deletion of C. neoformans CRK1 gene increased the efficiency of bisexual mating, filamentation in the crk1 mutant was blocked by MAT2 or ZNF2 mutation. A bioinformatics survey predicted the C. neoformans GATA transcriptional factor Gat1 as a potential substrate of Crk1 kinase. Our genetic and phenotypic findings revealed that C. neoformansGAT1 and CRK1 formed a regulatory circuit to negatively regulate MAT2 to control filamentation progression and transition during bisexual mating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3abasidia 3abioinformatics 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahyphae 3amating types 3ameiosis 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinases 3asexual development 3asporulation 3asurveys 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aShen, Wei-Chiang 0 tGenes.g2020 June 19, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245021600164300001600380520177900396592002802175650002002203650001902223650001502242650002002257650001902277650002802296650002902324650002102353650001302374653000802387653001802395653003302413653000902446653000802455700002202463700001602485700002302501773011902524856008502643852000902728655001202737IND60595669220221116172941.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059566922DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2018.14260912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tao10aComparing fully convolutional networks, random forest, support vector machine, and patch-based deep convolutional neural networks for object-based wetland mapping using images from small unmanned aircraft system  ap. 243-264.  aDeep learning networks have shown great success in several computer vision applications, but its implementation in natural land cover mapping in the context of object-based image analysis (OBIA) is rarely explored area especially in terms of the impact of training sample size on the performance comparison. In this study, two representatives of deep learning networks including fully convolutional networks (FCN) and patch-based deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), and two conventional classifiers including random forest and support vector machine were implemented within the framework of OBIA to classify seven natural land cover types. We assessed the deep learning classifiers using different training sample sizes and compared their performance with traditional classifiers. FCN was implemented using two types of training samples to investigate its ability to utilize object surrounding information. Our results indicate that DCNN may produce inferior performance compared to conventional classifiers when the training sample size is small, but it tends to show substantially higher accuracy than the conventional classifiers when the training sample size becomes large. The results also imply that FCN is more efficient in utilizing the information in the training sample than DCNN and conventional classifiers, with higher if not similar achieved accuracy regardless of sample size. DCNN and FCN tend to show similar performance for the large sample size when the training samples used for training the FCN do not contain object surrounding label information. However, with the ability of utilizing surrounding label information, FCN always achieved much higher accuracy than all the other classification methods regardless of the number of training samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation types 3awetlands 0aFCN 0adeep learning 0aconvolutional neural network 0aOBIA 0aUAS1 aAbd-Elrahman, Amr1 aMorton, Jon1 aWilhelm, Victor L.0 tGIScience & remote sensing.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 55, no. 2 p.243-264dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19689x1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2018.14260913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245004800190300001800238520049600256592002800752650001000780650001600790650001800806650001100824650001000835650002100845650002000866650001100886650001000897650002300907650002300930650001900953773009400972856008101066990002301147852000901170655001201179IND60093875820221118225204.0141104e20111220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009387582DNAL7 a221928262pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Barton L.10aVisual perception of materials and surfaces  ap.

In 2017 and 2018, corn following corn and corn following soybeans were subjected to irrigation × nitrogen fertilizer treatments in west central Nebraska, USA, to induce variable water sufficiency and variable nitrogen sufficiency. The vegetation index-sensor combinations investigated were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), and the reflectance ratio of near infrared minus red edge over near infrared minus red (DATT) using ACS-430 active optical sensors; NDVI using SRS-NDVI passive optical sensors; and red brightness and a proprietary index using commercial aerial visible imagery. Among these combinations, NDRE and DATT were found to be the most suitable for assessing nitrogen sufficiency within irrigation levels. While DATT was the least sensitive to variable water sufficiency, DATT still tended to decrease with decreasing water sufficiency in high nitrogen treatments, whereas the effect of water sufficiency on DATT was inconsistent in low nitrogen treatments. A new method of quantifying nitrogen sufficiency while accounting for water sufficiency was proposed and generally provided more consistent improvement over the mere averaging of water effects as compared with the canopy chlorophyll content index method. Further elucidation and better handling of water-nitrogen interactions and confounding are expected to become increasingly important as the complexity, automation, and adoption of sensor-based irrigation and nitrogen management increase.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitute of Agriculture and Natural Resourcesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011140  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cWater for Food Daugherty Global Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000117730 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aautomation 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3airrigation rates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apigmentation 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asoybeans 3avegetation 3aNebraska1 aRudnick, Daran R.1 aKrienke, Brian T.1 aHeeren, Derek M.1 aGe, Yufeng1 aShaver, Tim M.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 July, v. 162 p.154-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2019.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245015300172500001400325520243600339592002802775650001602803650001302819650002102832650001702853650001202870650001302882650000902895650001302904650001902917650001902936650002302955650001102978700002502989700002003014773013203034856007703166852000903243655001203252IND60724598220221120074451.0210122e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459822DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci80100102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrachumchai, Rittikeard 10aScreening of Cyanide-Utilizing Bacteria from Rumen and In Vitro Evaluation of Fresh Cassava Root Utilization with Pellet Containing High Sulfur Diet  aNAL-light  aTwo experiments were undertaken to screen for ruminal cyanide-utilizing bacteria (Experiment 1), and to evaluate the influence of fresh cassava root (FCR) and pellets containing high sulfur (PELFUR) on cyanide content, gas production parameters, in vitro degradability, and ruminal fermentation (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 was conducted in a completely randomized design (CRD) for the screening of cyanide-utilizing bacteria and the dietary treatments consisted of cyanide at 0, 150, 300, and 450 ppm. In Experiment 2, a 5 × 3 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design was used for the in vitro study. Factor A was the level of FCR at 0, 260, 350, 440, and 530 g/kg of dry matter (DM) substrate, and factor B was the level of PELFUR at 0, 15, and 30 g/kg DM substrate. In Experiment 1, adding different doses of cyanide significantly affected cyanide-utilizing rumen bacterial growth (p < 0.05). Increasing the concentration of cyanide from 0 to 150 and 150 to 300 ppm resulted in increases in cyanide-utilizing rumen bacteria of 38.2% and 15.0%, respectively. In Experiment 2, no interaction effects were found between FCR and PELFUR doses on gas production parameters (p > 0.05). Increasing the FCR level to more than 260 g/kg of DM substrate could increase cumulative gas production (p < 0.05). Increasing doses of PELFUR from 15 to 30 g/kg increased the cumulative gas production when compared with that of 0 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate (p < 0.05). The cyanide concentration in rumen fluid decreased with PELFUR (p < 0.05) supplementation. Degradability of in vitro DM and organic matter following incubation increased at 12 and 24 h due to PELFUR supplementation with FCR and increased additionally with 15 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate (p < 0.05) in 440 g FCR/kg of DM substrate. Proportions of the total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), and butyric acid among supplementations with FCR (p < 0.05) were significantly different. In conclusion, the present results represent the first finding of bacteria in the rumen that are capable of utilizing cyanide, and suggests that cyanide might function as a nitrogen source for bacterial cell synthesis. The inclusion of FCR of 530 g/kg with 30 g PELFUR/kg of DM substrate could increase the cumulative gas production, the bacterial population, the in vitro degradability, the proportion of C3, and the rate of the disappearance of cyanide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abutyric acid 3acassava 3acyanides 3adiet 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3asulfur1 aCherdthong, Anusorn 1 aWanapat, Metha 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci80100103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245007000185300001600255520147900271592002801750650001601778650002501794650001401819650001701833650001001850650001101860650000901871650001201880650001301892650001301905650001501918650001201933650002601945650003501971650002302006650004102029650005502070650006602125650004602191650001102237650004702248650000902295650001902304650002302323650006402346700002102410700001702431700002202448700001702470700002302487700001902510700002102529700002202550700001602572773010002588856004802688852000902736655001202745IND4484458620221122183643.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448445862DNAL7 a224270632pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-012-1372-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichikami, Ikumi10aTrps1 is necessary for normal temporomandibular joint development  ap. 131-140.  aMutation of the human TRPS1 gene leads to trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS), which is characterized by an abnormal development of various organs including the craniofacial skeleton. Trps1 has recently been shown to be expressed in the jaw joints of zebrafish; however, whether Trps1 is expressed in the mammalian temporomandibular joint (TMJ), or whether it is necessary for TMJ development is unknown. We have analyzed (1) the expression pattern of Trps1 during TMJ development in mice and (2) TMJ development in Trps1 knockout animals. Trps1 is expressed in the maxillo-mandibular junction at embryonic day (E) 11.5. At E15.5, expression is restricted to the developing condylar cartilage and to the surrounding joint disc progenitor cells. In Trps1 knockout mice, the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone forms relatively normally but the condylar process is extremely small and the joint disc and cavities do not develop. The initiation of condyle formation is slightly delayed in the mutants at E14.5; however, at E18.5, the flattened chondrocyte layer is narrowed and most of the condylar chondrocytes exhibit precocious chondrocyte maturation. Expression of Runx2 and its target genes is expanded toward the condylar apex in the mutants. These observations underscore the indispensable role played by Trps1 in normal TMJ development in supporting the differentiation of disc and synoviocyte progenitor cells and in coordinating condylar chondrocyte differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3askeleton 3astem cells 2aAnimals 2aCartilagexmetabolism 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aCell Proliferation 2aChondrocytesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCraniofacial Abnormalitiesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGATA Transcription Factorsxdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHumans 2aMandibular Condylexmetabolismxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aMutationxgenetics 2aTemporomandibular Jointxembryologyxmetabolismxpathology.1 aFukushi, Toshiya1 aHonma, Shiho1 aYoshioka, Seisuke1 aItoh, Shunji1 aMuragaki, Yasuteru1 aKurisu, Kojiro1 aOoshima, Takashi1 aWakisaka, Satoshi1 aAbe, Makoto0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 Apr., v. 348, no. 1 p.131-140dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1372-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010400178300001600282520116400298592002801462650001601490650001201506650001101518650001301529650001701542650001301559650001801572650001201590650000901602650002001611653003001631653002201661653003901683700003501722773009601757856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60688560620200616000000.0200429e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068856062DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2015.114354012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByström, Kristina M.14aThe Meaning of Companion Animals for Children and Adolescents with Autism: The Parents' Perspective  ap. 263-275.  aThe aim of this study was to understand parents' perspectives on how children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) benefit from a relationship with companion animals. Parents were invited to participate in focus-group discussions. One open-ended question with follow-up questions was asked and the parents' responses were subsequently categorized. Three main themes emerged: the quality of the relationship with the companion animal; increased interaction with people; and optimization of the child's function and development. The results show that companion animals can contribute to social and behavioral development support, and improved mental health and quality of life. The children's and adolescents' interests and activities with companion animals were more social than nonsocial and of different quality than the restricted and repetitive activities in which children with ASD are normally engaged. Our findings describe a complementary developmental support for this vulnerable group of children and adolescents, which give them possibilities for expanded social contacts, diminished anxiety and depression, and facilitated learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aanxiety 3aautism 3achildren 3afocus groups 3alearning 3amental health 3aparents 3apets 3aquality of life 0aautism spectrum disorders 0achild development 0ahuman-companion animal interaction1 aPersson, Cristina A.

When the flies were exposed to paraquat as an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, their survival rapidly decreased,, Although the SOS antioxidants did not have a preventive effect against paraquat toxicity, a supplement of such SOS antioxidants as glutathione, (+)-catechin and/or (−)-epicatechin to the diet had a reparative effect on flies damaged by the superoxide anion. The survival ratio of flies fed on a diet enriched with SOS antioxidants ranged from 77% to 87%, while that of the control group was 56%. When flies were exposed to paraquat in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or iron, each combination was more toxic than paraquat alone, since the two compounds could accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species in vivo. Title SOS antioxidants, however, allowed the flies to resist the combined toxicity of paraquat and ferrous iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abiotechnology 3acatechin 3adiet 3aepicatechin 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aparaquat 3asuperoxide anion 3atoxicity 0asuperoxide-scavenging activity 0aantioxidant 0asuperoxide dismutase1 aHan, Daeseok1 aAhn, Byung-Hak1 aRhee, Joon Shick0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 2 p.225-229dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100002300193245015800216300001600374506007600390520128600466592002801752506003701780650002001817650001401837650002001851650002801871650004301899650002601942650001101968650001501979650001101994650001402005650001302019650001402032650004802046650002802094650003402122650001402156650004002170650001402210650002202224650003902246650001102285650002602296650002302322650004502345653000702390653000802397653000802405653001002413653001402423653001702437653002002454653002102474653002702495653001002522653001802532653001402550700002402564700001702588700001602605700002202621700001902643700002102662700001702683773010002700856008702800852000902887655001202896IND50069076320221207064644.0190402e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006907632DNAL7 a240018522pmid7 aPMC40723172pmcid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibnicky, David M.10aEffects of a high fat meal matrix and protein complexation on the bioaccessibility of blueberry anthocyanins using the TNO gastrointestinal model (TIM-1)  ap. 349-357.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe TNO intestinal model (TIM-1) of the human upper gastrointestinal tract was used to compare intestinal absorption/bioaccessibility of blueberry anthocyanins under different digestive conditions. Blueberry polyphenol-rich extract was delivered to TIM-1 in the absence or presence of a high-fat meal. HPLC analysis of seventeen anthocyanins showed that delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-galactoside, delphinidin-3-arabinoside and petunidin-3-arabinoside were twice as bioaccessible in fed state, whilst delphinidin-3-(6″-acetoyl)-glucoside and malvidin-3-arabinoside were twice as bioaccessible under fasted conditions, suggesting lipid-rich matrices selectively effect anthocyanin bioaccessibility. TIM-1 was fed blueberry juice (BBJ) or blueberry polyphenol-enriched defatted soybean flour (BB-DSF) containing equivalent amounts of free or DSF-sorbed anthocyanins, respectively. Anthocyanin bioaccessibility from BB-DSF (36.0±10.4) was numerically, but not significantly, greater than that from BBJ (26.3±10.3). Ileal efflux samples collected after digestion of BB-DSF contained 2.8-fold more anthocyanins than same from BBJ, suggesting that protein-rich DSF protects anthocyanins during transit through upper digestive tract for subsequent colonic delivery/metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioavailability 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3agastrointestinal system 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintestinal absorption 3ajuices 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amyrtillin 3asampling 3asoy flour 2aAnthocyaninsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aBiological Availability 2aBlueberry Plantsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line 2aDietary Fatsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aFruitxmetabolism 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aModels, Biological 2aSoybean Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aBA 0aACN 0aDSF 0aTIM-1 0aBlueberry 0aAnthocyanins 0aBioavailability 0aBioaccessibility 0aGastrointestinal model 0aTIM-1 0aSoybean flour 0aNutrition1 aRoopchand, Diana E.1 aOren, Andrew1 aGrace, Mary1 aPoulev, Alexander1 aLila, Mary Ann1 aHavenaar, Robert1 aRaskin, Ilya0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 142 p.349-357dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010900165500001900274520141300293592002801706650002401734650002101758650001901779650001601798650002701814650001701841650001701858650002201875650001901897650001601916650001301932700001501945700001401960700001701974700001801991700001602009773013302025856008302158852000902241655001202250IND60731946720221119104217.0210326e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073194672DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110302052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuxia 10aGrowth Responses and Accumulation Characteristics of Three Ornamental Plants to Sn Contamination in Soil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDecorative ornamental plants have been applied as hyperaccumulators/phytoremediators to a wide spectrum of heavy metal contaminants. In this study, pot culture experiments were conducted to investigate the Sn tolerance and accumulation in Impatiens balsamina L., Mirabilis jalapa L. and Tagetes erecta L., in order to assess the possibility of these three ornamental plants to be used as phytoremediators of Sn-contaminated soil. Results show that all three plants exhibited strong tolerance to Sn contamination, and no significant visual toxicity was observed for all three plants grown under most of the Sn treatments. The amount of Sn accumulated in the three plants was positively correlated with the Sn concentration in the soil. The order of the Sn accumulative capacity was Impatiens balsamina > Mirabilis jalapa > Tagetes erecta. Impatiens balsamina and Tagetes erecta showed a low translocation ability (TF) (<1), and the roots accumulated the highest Sn concentration, but Impatiens balsamina showed a relatively high bioconcentration factor (BCF, Sn concentration in each part > 100 mg/kg after Sn treatment of 500 mg/kg). Meanwhile, the TF of Mirabilis jalapa was >1, and the fluorescence accumulated the most Sn. In combination with the adaptation to high concentrations of various heavy metals, these three ornamental plants are potential candidates for Sn mining tailings or contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aImpatiens balsamina 3aMirabilis jalapa 3aTagetes erecta 3aagriculture 3abioaccumulation factor 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3apolluted soils 3apot culture 3atoxicity1 aXu, Weili 1 aWang, Yi 1 aHao, Weiduo 1 aZhou, Qixing 1 aLiu, Jianv 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Mar. 03, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110302053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245012100156300002000277520049200297592002800789650001200817650001100829650002400840650001000864650001400874700001900888700002000907773013400927856007801061852000901139655001201148IND60556056420221117202044.0161031e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055605642DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b088182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhen10aPalladium(II)-Catalyzed Regioselective syn-Hydroarylation of Disubstituted Alkynes Using a Removable Directing Group  ap. 13076-13081.  aA palladium(II)-catalyzed regioselective syn-hydroarylation reaction of homopropargyl amines has been developed, wherein selectivity is controlled by a cleavable bidentate directing group.

The stabilizing effect of TM on actin without ATP at 0°C was associated with the extent of binding of TM to the actin filaments that was dependent on the KC1 concentrations: i.e., TM effectively depressed the denaturation of actin at a KC1 concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 m whereby TM can be bound to F-actin. Stabilization by TM could reduce the probability of the destabilization of actin due to a small amount of HMM. A combination of TM and a large amount of HMM strongly stabilized actin, even in a high salt concentration such as 0.6 m KCL These results indicate that tropomyosin played an important role in stabilizing actin in an actomyosin complex (natural actomyosin) during treatment with salt at a low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3abiotechnology 3acold storage 3adenaturation 3aheavy meromyosin 3aprobability 3asalt concentration 3atropomyosins 0aF-actin 0atropomyosin 0aHMM 0aDNase I inhibition assay1 aIkeuchi, Yoshihide1 aShimizu, Ryosuke1 aSuzuki, Atsushi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 2 p.233-237dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.2333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245011800189300001600307520084600323592002801169650001601197650002001213650004301233650000901276650000701285650001301292650001601305650002401321650001201345650001101357650003601368650004101404650003301445650005201478650002001530650005101550653001401601653001201615653002701627653000901654700001401663700001701677700001701694700001901711700001801730700001501748700001401763773010001777856008701877852000901964655001201973IND50069076420221119030705.0190402e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006907642DNAL7 a240018532pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tiantian10aDetermination of triazine herbicides in milk by cloud point extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 358-364.  aHigh-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection was used to detect four triazines in milk. An efficient pretreatment method known as cloud point extraction (CPE) was proposed for extracting and preconcentrating analytes. The parameters of CPE including surfactant type and concentration, electrolyte, sample pH, incubation temperature and duration were investigated. Under optimal conditions, satisfying recoveries in the range of 70.5–96.9% were achieved for four triazines. The limits of detection ranged from 6.79 to 11.19μg L−1. The linear range of quantitation for the four triazines was 50–2000μg L−1, and the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were all 0.9999. The results demonstrated that the proposed method was efficient and reliable for the determination of triazine herbicides in milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amilk 3apH 3asampling 3atemperature 3atriazine herbicides 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aTriazinesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 0aTriazines 0aHPLC-UV 0aCloud point extraction 0aMilk1 aCao, Peng1 aGeng, Jinpei1 aLi, Jinqiang1 aWang, Mingzhen1 aWang, Minglin1 aLi, Xiaoyu1 aYin, Dalu0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 142 p.358-364dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009400162300001600256520109000272592002801362650001901390650002401409650001801433650001601451650002301467650001001490650001101500650001001511650000801521651001001529700001401539700001401553700001601567700001801583773009401601856008101695852000901776655001201785IND60569576220221117192405.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056957622DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0230-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting10aResearch on Aging Effect of Unfermented Pu’er Tea by High-Voltage Pulsed Electric Field  ap. 384-390.  aThis essay provides a physical method to improve the “aging” process of Yunnan Pu’er tea, which is pollution-free, energy saving and having no negative effect on the taste or nutrition facts of Pu’er tea. “Aging” is a special storage method in the culture of Yunnan Pu’er tea. After stored for a certain period of time, the aroma and taste of Pu’er unfermented tea would become favorable for drinkers. In addition, as the elevation of people’s living standard and the gradual acknowledgment of Pu’er tea’s salutary effect, the demand of Pu’er tea increases drastically in recent years. Its characteristic that “getting better” becomes the factor attracting consumer and guiding market price. This essay utilized high-intensity pulsed electric field (HPEF) to process tea samples under different conditions. The results of experiments show that both the taste and aroma of tea samples have improved after the process. This result provides a new method to elevate the quality of Pu’er tea and a theoretical basis for artificial aging of Pu’er tea by HPEF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aenergy conservation 3amarket prices 3amethodology 3anutrition labeling 3aodors 3apeople 3ataste 3atea 3aChina1 aPeng, Wen1 aZhao, Yan1 aLiu, Yijia,1 aWang, BaiJuan0 tAgricultural research.g2016 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.384-390dSpringer Indiax2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-016-0230-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014300159500001900302520147900321592002801800650002201828650001801850650001401868650001301882650001301895700002401908700001801932700001901950700001501969700002501984700002002009700002002029700002102049773013302070856007702203852000902280655001202289IND60711875120221121152701.0200928e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071187512DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci70301272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunde, Eva 10aLongitudinal Volumetric Assessment of Ventricular Enlargement in Pet Dogs Trained for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Recent studies suggest that clinically sound ventriculomegaly in dogs could be a preliminary form of the clinically significant hydrocephalus. We evaluated changes of ventricular volumes in awake functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) trained dogs with indirectly assessed cognitive abilities over time (thus avoiding the use of anaesthetics, which can alter the pressure). Our research question was whether ventricular enlargement developing over time would have any detrimental effect on staying still while being scanned; which can be extrapolated to the ability to pay attention and to exert inhibition. Methods: Seven healthy dogs, 2–8 years old at the baseline scan and 4 years older at rescan, participated in a rigorous and gradual training for staying motionless (<2 mm) in the magnetic resonance (MR) scanner without any sedation during 6 minute-long structural MR sequences. On T1 structural images, volumetric analyses of the lateral ventricles were completed by software guided semi-automated tissue-type segmentations performed with FMRIB Software Library (FSL, Analysis Group, Oxford, UK). Results and conclusion: We report significant enlargement for both ventricles (left: 47.46 %, right: 46.07 %) over time while dogs retained high levels of attention and inhibition. The results suggest that even considerable ventricular enlargement arising during normal aging does not necessarily reflect observable pathological changes in behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3ahydrocephalus 3amagnetism 3ascanners 3asedation1 aCzeibert, Kálmán 1 aGábor, Anna,1 aSzabó, Dóra 1 aKis, Anna 1 aArany-Tóth, Attila 1 aAndics, Attila 1 aGácsi, Márta 1 aKubinyi, Enikő,0 tVeterinary sciences.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci70301273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006800166500001900234520046700253592002800720650001600748650001900764650001200783650002500795650001800820650001000838650001100848650001500859700001800874700001600892700002000908700001600928700001700944700001300961773013300974856008301107852000901190655001201199IND60731946920221119104230.0210326e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073194692DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110302072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kaili 10aBy-Product Feeds: Current Understanding and Future Perspectives  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, industrial and agricultural by-products, resulting from crops, fruit and vegetable processing which can be used in animal diets have become a hot topic in the animal feed industry.

To test this, mice were given opioid anaesthesia by intraperitoneal injections or sham treated and the hearts were harvested and subjected to global ischaemia and reperfusion 24 h later in series 1. In series 2, mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of Ringer, sham needle prick procedure, or no intervention 24 h before heart isolation. In series 3, intraperitoneal Ringer injection 24 h earlier was compared with the effects of classic preconditioning or no pretreatment of the isolated heart or no treatment. Heart function was measured in all series. At the end of reperfusion, hearts in series 1 and 2 were frozen and infarct size was estimated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution. In series 3, separate hearts were frozen for immunoblotting to detect phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Cardiac activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) was measured using a NFκB luciferase firefly reporter mouse. The ischaemia-induced impairment of left ventricular function was attenuated by opioid anaesthesia injected 24 h earlier, which also reduced infarct size. Injection of fluid, but not the sham needle prick procedure, reduced infarct size. The functional protection afforded by classic preconditioning and Ringer pretreatment was comparable. Neither cardiac MAP kinases nor NFκB were influenced by the interventions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a delayed preconditioning-like effect of the heart caused by intraperitoneal administration of opioid anaesthetics and of fluid only in the mouse. The mechanism of protection remains to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaboratory animals 3anarcotics 3aheart 3amyocardial infarction 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnestheticsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressure 2aHeartxdrug effects 2aImmunoblotting 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aIschemic Preconditioning, Myocardialxmethods 2aLuciferases 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMyocardial Infarctionxpathology 2aMyocardial Ischemia 2aMyocardial Reperfusion 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aTetrazolium Salts 0amyocardial ischemia 0aOPIOIDS 0aREPERFUSION 0aISCHAEMIA 0aINTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION1 aVaage, Jarle1 aLi, Guohu1 aValen, Guro0 tLaboratory animals.g2005 July 01, v. 39, no. 3 p.298-307dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/00236770543069713Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02606naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012900162300001600291520130500307592002801612650001401640650002501654650001601679650001301695650001501708650002401723650001501747650002401762650001301786651001001799700001601809700002201825700001701847700001601864700002101880700001601901700002101917700001801938700002001956773009401976856008102070852000902151655001202160IND60569576320221117192329.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056957632DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0223-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwa, V.10aLong-term Conservation Tillage Effect on Soil Organic Carbon and Available Phosphorous Content in Vertisols of Central India  ap. 353-361.  aEfficient nutrient management in conservation tillage is one of the major concerns in vertisols as residue retention on soil surface and reduction in tillage operation can have a major impact on nutrient dynamics and stratification. The present study examined profile distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorous under long-term (12 years) imposition of four different tillage systems, namely conventional tillage (CT), mouldboard tillage (MB), reduced tillage (RT), no tillage (NT) and three nitrogen levels, viz. N₅₀%, N₁₀₀% and N₁₅₀%. In 0- to 5-cm soil layer, highest and lowest SOC was observed in NT (8.8 g kg⁻¹) and CT (5.9 g kg⁻¹), whereas in 5- to 15-cm soil layer, higher SOC was observed in MB. The stratification ratio of SOC was higher in NT (2.20) followed by RT (1.93), MB (1.68) and CT (1.51). Higher available phosphorous concentration (12.8 g kg⁻¹) was recorded in NT with N₅₀% followed by NT with N₁₀₀%. Over the year, no significant effect of tillage on soybean and wheat yield was observed. However, effect of N level on yield was significant. Overall, conservation tillage practice imposed no penalty on yield of soybean–wheat system, while it saved energy and time by reducing the number of tillage operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVertisols 3aconventional tillage 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3asoil organic carbon 3asoybeans 3aIndia1 aHati, K.

However, industrial applications of chitinolytic enzymes have been limited by their poor thermostability. Therefore, it is necessary to discover thermostable chitinolytic enzymes for GlcNAc production from chitin. In this study, two chitinolytic enzyme-encoding genes CaChiT and CaHex from Caldicellulosiruptor acetigenus were identified and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant CaChiT and CaHex showed optimal activities at 70 °C and 90 °C respectively, and exhibited good thermostability over a range of temperature below 70 °C and broad pH stability at pH range of 3.0-8.0. CaChiT and CaHex were active on colloidal chitin, pNP-(GlcNAc)₂, pNP-(GlcNAc)₃, and pNP-GlcNAc, pNP-(GlcNAc)₂, pNP-(GlcNAc)₃, pNP-Glc respectively. Besides, the chitin oligosaccharides and colloidal chitin hydrolysis profiles revealed that CaChiT degraded chitin chains through exo-mode of action. Furthermore, CaChiT and CaHex exhibited a synergistic effect in the degradation of colloidal chitin, reaching 0.60 mg/mL of GlcNAc production after 1 h incubation. These results suggested that a combination of CaChiT and CaHex have great potential for industrial applications in the enzymatic production of GlcNAc from chitin-containing biowastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaldicellulosiruptor 3aEscherichia coli 3abiotransformation 3achitin 3achitinase 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrolysis 3aoligosaccharides 3apH stability 3asynergism 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awastes 0aβ-N-acetylhexosaminidase 0aN-acetyl-d-glucosamine1 aXin, YanZhe1 aSu, Xiaoyun1 aWang, Xiaolu1 aZhang, Jie1 aTu, Tao1 aWang, Yaru1 aYao, Bin1 aHuang, Huoqing1 aLuo, Huiying0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 192 p.250-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.2043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014800173300001800321520110100339592002801440650003301468650001501501650002301516650001601539650002101555650002001576650001201596700001701608700002101625700002501646700002001671773011101691856008601802852000901888655001201897IND60529993320221121021137.0160720e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052999332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b017592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaitouna, Anita
J.10aComparison of Mannose, Ethylene Glycol, and Methoxy-Terminated Diluents on Specificity and Selectivity of Electrochemical Peptide-Based Sensors  ap. 6966-6973.  aWe report the synthesis and application of three new antifouling diluents for the fabrication of an E-PB HIV sensor. Among the three thiolated antifouling diluents used in this study, the methoxy-terminated diluent (C6-MEG) is the most effective in alleviating both nonspecific binding and adsorption of matrix contaminants onto the sensor surface, especially when compared to the mannose- (C6-MAN) and ethylene-glycol-terminated (C6-EG) diluents. The sensor fabricated with C6-MEG has a specificity factor (∼13.5) substantially higher than the sensor passivated with only 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (∼1.5). It is functional even when employed directly in 25% serum, an achievement that has not been observed with this class of E-PB sensors. More importantly, incorporation of these antifouling diluents has negligible impact on other important sensor properties such as sensitivity and binding kinetics. This sensor passivation strategy is versatile and can potentially be used with other E-PB sensors, as well as surface-based sensors that utilize thiol–gold self-assembled monolayer chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadsorption 3aantifouling agents 3ablood serum 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene glycol 3amannose1 aJoyce, Jesse1 aCerny, Ronald L.1 aDussault, Patrick H.1 aLai, Rebecca Y.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 July 07, v. 87, no. 13 p.6966-6973dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b017593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245012200180500001900302520158400321592002801905650001601933650001101949650001701960650002201977650001501999650002002014650002302034650001202057650001002069650001302079650001902092650002002111650002602131650001902157651001002176700002602186700003002212700002602242700002002268700002402288700002402312700002202336773013302358856008302491852000902574655001202583IND60731947020221119104415.0210326e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073194702DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110302082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Daniel  Queirós10aMeasuring Canopy Geometric Structure Using Optical Sensors Mounted on Terrestrial Vehicles: A Case Study in Vineyards  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSmart and precision agriculture concepts require that the farmer measures all relevant variables in a continuous way and processes this information in order to build better prescription maps and to predict crop yield. These maps feed machinery with variable rate technology to apply the correct amount of products in the right time and place, to improve farm profitability. One of the most relevant information to estimate the farm yield is the Leaf Area Index. Traditionally, this index can be obtained from manual measurements or from aerial imagery: the former is time consuming and the latter requires the use of drones or aerial services. This work presents an optical sensing-based hardware module that can be attached to existing autonomous or guided terrestrial vehicles. During the normal operation, the module collects periodic geo-referenced monocular images and laser data. With that data a suggested processing pipeline, based on open-source software and composed by Structure from Motion, Multi-View Stereo and point cloud registration stages, can extract Leaf Area Index and other crop-related features. Additionally, in this work, a benchmark of software tools is made. The hardware module and pipeline were validated considering real data acquired in two vineyards—Portugal and Italy. A dataset with sensory data collected by the module was made publicly available. Results demonstrated that: the system provides reliable and precise data on the surrounding environment and the pipeline is capable of computing volume and occupancy area from the acquired data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acanopy 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3afarm profitability 3afarmers 3afarms 3ageometry 3ageoreferencing 3aleaf area index 3aprecision agriculture 3aremote sensing 3aItaly1 aAguiar, André  Silva1 ados Santos, Filipe  Neves1 aSousa, Armando  Jorge1 aRabino, Danilo 1 aBiddoccu, Marcella 1 aBagagiolo, Giorgia 1 aDelmastro, Marco 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Mar. 04, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110302083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245015600183520200300339592002802342650002302370650002002393650000902413650002302422650002602445650001502471650001402486650003502500650001302535650001002548650001802558650002402576650001802600650001602618650001002634653002002644653001502664653001002679653001502689653002102704653001402725700002702739700002702766700002902793700003702822700003502859700001902894773009902913856009003012852000903102655001203111IND60717282420221119120041.0210212e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071728242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7361402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldas, Jôsie Schwartz10aEffects of hormonal treatment on induced spermiation and semen quality in the endangered Amazonian fish Hypancistrus zebra (Siluriformes, Loricariidae)  aReproduction in fish is influenced by several environmental factors. In many cases, failure in reproduction is common once fish are no longer in their natural habitat. Thus, the use of exogenous hormones has been crucial to control the reproductive cycle of many fish species under ex situ conditions. These hormonal stimulations became yet more important for those species facing extinction, as the case of Hypancistrus zebra. Since its habitat has been destroyed, successful reproduction in captivity is a way to ensure species survival. The first phase of this study aimed to test the possibility of getting semen from Hypancistrus zebra without hormonal induction. Two groups of fish (24 each) were subjected to two treatments: hormonal induction with 3 mg kg⁻¹ CPH (carp pituitary homogenate) and spermiation without hormonal induction. In the second phase, was evaluated the effect of hormonal induction on semen quality using gonadorelin (a GnRH synthetic analogue) at doses of 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 μg kg⁻¹. CPH treatment was used as a positive control and one group of fish was not induced (negative control). Collected semen was assessed for volume, sperm concentration, motility rate, sperm vigor, duration of motility, membrane integrity and spermatozoa morphology. We were able to successfully collect semen from the endangered Hypancistrus zebra without hormonal induction, however when subjected to the hormonal treatment males released a higher volume of semen, with higher quality in some parameters. CPH treatment was more efficient in improving sperm quality in H. zebra, favoring normal sperm morphology, although gonadorelin did not harm it. The minimum effective dose of gonadorelin to increase seminal volume is 100 μg kg⁻¹, which can be applied in a single injection. Information gained from this study will assist semen collection procedures for a germplasm bank formation and other initiatives for conservation of this Amazonian endangered fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypancistrus zebra 3acaptive animals 3acarp 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3agermplasm 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahabitats 3amales 3asemen quality 3asperm concentration 3asperm quality 3aspermiation 3avigor 0aOrnamental fish 0aEndangered 0aPleco 0aFish sperm 0aSperm morphology 0aGermplasm1 ada Silva, Adriele Lima1 ade Sousa, Leandro Melo1 ade Sousa, Erilda Barbosa1 aMonteiro, Iann Leonardo Pinheiro1 ade Barros, Fábio José Torres1 aGodoy, Leandro0 tAquaculture.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 533 p.736140-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7361403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010500164520188700269592002802156650001602184650001302200650001902213650001602232650001502248650002402263650002502287650002502312700001602337700001402353700001802367773012602385856008502511852000902596655001202605IND60780948320221121230054.0220623e20220616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078094832DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80605382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Lin 10aEffects of Different Nozzle Orifice Shapes on Water Droplet Characteristics for Sprinkler Irrigation  aIn common irrigation systems, sprinklers are mounted with circular nozzles, but innovative noncircular nozzles can save water and energy by improving fragmentation in a low–intermediate pressure irrigation system. In order to investigate the effects of nozzle orifice shapes (circular, square, and equilateral triangular) on droplet characteristics, experiments using high-speed photography and water droplet spectrum measurement were performed. Using ImageJ to observe with the overlapped droplets and using the self-compiled programs of MATLAB to observe the morphology of droplets, we extracted the outlines of droplets. In addition, several empirical formulas for the prediction of droplets were obtained by way of a regression analysis of the experimental data. In particular, the shape coefficient of the nozzle orifice and the operating pressure of the nozzle were added to these formulas as variable factors to make them applicable to a variety of nozzles and working conditions. The results show that with the increase in shape coefficient, the jet atomization intensifies, and the droplets breaking from the jet will be dense and uniform. The velocity distribution of the droplets conforms to exponential functions (R² > 0.7). The prediction formulas of diameter and kinetic energy were established with coefficients of determination exceeding 0.95. In low pressure conditions, the specific power multiplies at the end of spraying, and the maximum is proportional to the nozzle orifice coefficient. The impact-driven arm compensates for the disadvantage of the noncircular nozzles with the high irrigation-specific power, by producing a wider diameter gradient of droplets. Therefore, innovative sprinklers based on noncircular nozzles can be applied in a low–intermediate pressure system to increase water use efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and reduce costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3adroplets 3akinetic energy 3aphotography 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater use efficiency1 aJiang, Yue 1 aLi, Hong 1 aQin, Longtan 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 June 16, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80605383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001800279520160300297592002801900650000901928650001601937650002701953650002401980650000902004650001302013650001002026650001202036650001502048650001002063650002202073650001402095650001402109650001302123650002202136650001102158651001602169700002002185700002702205773009802232856008102330852000902411655001202420IND60516713420221120095840.0160326e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051671342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3515-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlagel, D.

If natural predators can reduce herbivore numbers and/or alter herbivore foraging behavior, then predators may reduce herbivory on sensitive plants, and a trophic cascade will emerge. We have investigated whether gray wolves (Canis lupus) generate such trophic cascades by reducing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory on saplings and rare forbs in a northern mesic forest (Land O’ Lakes, WI). Our investigation used an experimental system of deer exclosures in areas of high and low wolf use that allowed us to examine the role that wolf predation may play in reducing deer herbivory through direct reduction in deer numbers or indirectly through changing deer behavior. We found that in areas of high wolf use, deer were 62 % less dense, visit duration was reduced by 82 %, and percentage of time spent foraging was reduced by 43 %; in addition, the proportion of saplings browsed was nearly sevenfold less. Average maple (Acer spp.) sapling height and forb species richness increased 137 and 117 % in areas of high versus low wolf use, respectively. The results of the exclosure experiments revealed that the negative impacts of deer on sapling growth and forb species richness became negligible in high wolf use areas. We conclude that wolves are likely generating trophic cascades which benefit maples and rare forbs through trait-mediated effects on deer herbivory, not through direct predation kills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aCanis lupus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3acommunity structure 3adeer 3aforaging 3aforbs 3aforests 3aherbivores 3alakes 3aplant communities 3apredation 3apredators 3asaplings 3aspecies diversity 3awolves 3aGreat Lakes1 aBelovsky, G.

Twelve processing conditions using two heating technologies (microwave and conventional) were carried out in a pilot-scale unit and an evaluation of flavour (sugar, acid and volatile) and nutritional (phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity) attributes was performed in cloudy apple juice samples with similar holding conditions. Volatile profiles of the microwave-pasteurized juice were more similar to the non-pasteurized juice compared with conventionally pasteurized juices using multivariate analysis. Sugar-acid ratios were not different between fresh and pasteurized juices. In general, changes in the phenolic contents of pasteurized samples were independent of the processing technology, but increased during thermal treatment due to the extraction from the juice material in suspension. Outcomes of this study suggested the potential of microwave processing technology to retain the fresh-like qualities after thermal processing because of the shorter heating time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapple juice 3aflavor 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3amultivariate analysis 3anutritive value 3apasteurization 3aphenolic compounds 3asugars 3avolatile compounds 0aMicrowave 0aPasteurization 0aAntioxidant 0aPhenolic 0aVolatile1 aPurgatto, Eduardo1 aHassimotto, Neuza M.A.1 aGut, Jorge A.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6447-84900 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.853-860dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04673naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012700173300001600300520259800316592002802914650004402942650001902986650002003005650001403025650001503039650003103054650001203085650001003097650002903107650001703136650002003153650000903173650001603182653000903198653000803207653000803215653000703223653000703230653000803237653000803245653000903253653000803262653000803270653000803278653000703286653000703293653000903300653000703309653000803316653000803324653000903332653000803341653000803349653000803357653000803365653000803373653000803381653000903389653000803398653000903406653000803415653000803423653000803431653002503439653001903464653001403483653001303497653001503510653002303525700002903548700002003577700002203597773011603619856008703735852000903822655001203831IND60629519120221122050816.0190326e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062951912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Antonio,10aPerformance of a conventional diesel aftertreatment system used in a medium-duty multi-cylinder dual-mode dual-fuel engine  ap. 327-337.  aDual-mode dual-fuel combustion stands as one of the promising techniques to allow the dual-fuel operation along the whole engine map. This concept relies on using different combustion strategies as reactivity controlled compression ignition up to medium load, then migrating to diffusive dual-fuel combustion to reach full load. With this strategy, it is possible to obtain sensible reductions in NOx and soot while providing improvements in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the excessive quantities of HC and CO together with the low exhaust temperature can compromise the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) efficiency. In addition, the diffusive dual-fuel combustion applied at high engine load produces considerable soot amounts that should be reduced within the diesel particulate filter (DPF).Based on these facts, this work intends to evaluate the efficiency of a commercial aftertreatment system (DOC + DPF) while operating in dual-mode dual-fuel combustion. Additionally, fundamental studies where developed to understand the impact of the combination of fuels on the exhaust hydrocarbon species. First, the DOC performance was evaluated at steady-state and transient conditions under different operating conditions fulfilling the EUVI NOx and soot limits. In parallel, the different engine-out hydrocarbon species were measured by means of a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) gas analyzer. Finally, the passive and active regeneration processes were assessed by means of different methodologies aiming to evaluate the low NOx-low soot interaction and the capability of the active regeneration in dual-fuel dual-mode (DMDF) operating conditions. The DOC results showed an improper conversion efficiency at low load operating condition, where the exhaust temperature is low. By contrast, the thermal inertia at transient conditions allowed to improve the DOC behavior at low load, reaching DOC-out emissions one order of magnitude lower than those from the steady-state tests. Concerning the DPF, it was demonstrated that the low concentration of NOx and soot produced during the combustion does not lead to sensible changes in the NO2/NOx ratio before and after the DPF, indicating a low level/absence of passive regeneration. In the case of the active regeneration, both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DMDF operating conditions can obtain satisfactory reduction in the total soot trapped, being the increase in the exhaust temperature consequence of the HC and CO conversion the supporting mechanism for the active regeneration in the DMDF concept.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aenergy use and consumption 3afilters 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen oxides 3asoot 3atemperature 0aATDC 0aATS 0aCAD 0aCO 0aDI 0aDOC 0aDPF 0aDMDF 0aEGR 0aFSN 0aGCI 0aGF 0aHC 0aHCCI 0aHR 0aHRF 0aICE 0aIMEP 0aLRF 0aLTC 0aMCE 0aNOx 0aOEM 0aPFI 0aPPCI 0aPRR 0aRCCI 0aRON 0aMON 0aSCR 0aDual fuel combustion 0aAftertreatment 0aEmissions 0aCatalyst 0aSpeciation 0aParticulate filter1 aMonsalve-Serrano, Javier1 aVillalta, David1 aLago Sari, Rafael0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 184 p.327-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024003600145040001800181100001600199245010700215300001600322520082400338592002801162650002301190650001601213650001501229650002201244650002301266650001601289650001701305650001201322650002601334650002801360650003201388650001101420650002301431650002001454650000901474650002401483650002801507650002401535650003001559650001601589653001601605653002001621653001401641653002401655700001901679700001601698700001601714700001201730700001201742773011601754852000901870856008101879655001201960IND4373387820221120174515.0181204e20050701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437338782DNAL7 a160046922pmid7 a10.1258/00236770543070422doi4 a0023-6772(20050701)39:3L.321;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitagaki, M10aAge-related changes in haematology and serum chemistry of Weiser–Maples guineapigs (Cavia porcellus)  ap. 321-330.  aAge-related changes in haematology and serum chemistry values were examined in male and female Weiser–Maples guineapigs (Cavia porcellus).

Elevational changes in plant water relations have also been demonstrated, but comparable information on root hydraulics is generally lacking. We analyzed the hydraulic efficiency (specific hydraulic conductivity k ₛ, entire root system conductance K R) and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism (water potential at 50 % loss of conductivity Ψ ₅₀) of the roots of Pinus cembra trees growing along an elevational transect of 600 m. Hydraulic parameters of the roots were compared with those of the stem and related to anatomical traits {mean conduit diameter (d), wall reinforcement [(t/b)²]}. We hypothesized that temperature-related restrictions in root function would cause a progressive limitation of hydraulic efficiency and safety with increasing elevation. We found that both root k ₛ and K R decreased from low (1600 m a.s.l.: k ₛ 5.6 ± 0.7 kg m⁻¹ s⁻¹ MPa⁻¹, K R 0.049 ± 0.005 kg m⁻² s ⁻¹ MPa⁻¹) to high elevation (2100 m a.s.l.: k ₛ 4.2 ± 0.6 kg m⁻¹ s⁻¹ MPa⁻¹, K R 0.035 ± 0.006 kg m⁻² s⁻¹ MPa⁻¹), with small trees showing higher K R than large trees. k ₛ was higher in roots than in stems (0.5 ± 0.05 kg m⁻¹s⁻¹MPa⁻¹). Ψ ₅₀ values were similar across elevations and overall less negative in roots (Ψ ₅₀ −3.6 ± 0.1 MPa) than in stems (Ψ ₅₀ −3.9 ± 0.1 MPa). In roots, large-diameter tracheids were lacking at high elevation and (t/b)² increased, while d did not change. The elevational decrease in root hydraulic efficiency reflects a limitation in timberline tree hydraulics. In contrast, hydraulic safety was similar across elevations, indicating that avoidance of hydraulic failure is important for timberline trees. As hydraulic patterns can only partly be explained by the anatomical parameters studied, limitations and/or adaptations at the pit level are likely.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus cembra 3aaltitude 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aplant-water relations 3aroot systems 3aroots 3astems 3astrength (mechanics) 3atracheids 3atreeline 3atrees 3awater potential1 aNardini, Andrea1 aNolf, Markus1 aMayr, Stefan0 tOecologia.g2016 Apr., v. 180, no. 4 p.1091-1102dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3513-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013400168520119600302592002801498650002201526650001301548650001901561650001301580650001201593650001101605650001001616650001501626650001601641650003301657650002801690650001001718650003101728651001001759700001801769700001701787700001701804700002101821700001801842700001401860700001801874700001701892700001801909773012601927856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60780948420221121225918.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078094842DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80605392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Peifen 10aQuantitatively Unravelling the Impact of High Altitude on Oolong Tea Flavor from Camellia sinensis Grown on the Plateaus of Tibet  aThe plateaus of Tibet have a unique climate that poses a great challenge for local agriculture.

The volatile components in TOT and OOT showed a slight difference, and principal component analysis revealed that the characteristic aroma compounds distinguishing tea grown in Tibet from tea grown in Guangdong were hotrienol and benzyl alcohol. In terms of taste substances, TOT exhibited higher levels of water extractable compounds, including polyphenols and amino acids, but lower levels of caffeine than OOT, which implies that TOT may taste better than OOT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the changes in aroma and flavor profiles of tea induced by high altitude systematically, which will provide a basis for reference during the introduction and cultivation of tea crops to the plateaus of Tibet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aaltitude 3abenzyl alcohol 3acaffeine 3aclimate 3aflavor 3aodors 3aoolong tea 3apolyphenols 3aprincipal component analysis 3asustainable development 3ataste 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina1 aCai, Jiarong 1 aZheng, Peng 1 aYuan, Yugui 1 aTsewang, Wugyan 1 aChen, Yuchun 1 aXiao, Xi 1 aLiao, Jinmei 1 aSun, Binmei 1 aLiu, Shaoqun 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 June 17, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80605393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006900171300001600240520157900256592002801835650001201863650002401875650001101899650000901910650001901919650001801938650001701956650001601973650001901989653004302008653000902051653001702060653002602077700005502103700001402158700001802172700001702190700002002207773011602227856008702343852000902430655001202439IND60629519220221122055319.0200601e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062951922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Yongning10aPerformance analysis of a combined power and refrigeration cycle  ap. 259-270.  aIn this paper a novel combined power and refrigeration cycle is proposed based on the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system, i.e. the Kalina cycle. In this combined cycle, solar energy is employed to raise the heat source temperature. Cooling capacity is generated concurrently by the ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) which works on the exhaust heat extracted from the turbine in the Kalina cycle. Ammonia-water and isobutane are selected as the working fluid of Kalina cycle and ERC respectively. To evaluate the performance of the proposed cycle, the process is simulated in the commercial package ASPEN PLUS. It is found that, compared with the Kalina cycle, the proposed cycle has a higher primary energy ratio (PER) of 29.2% though it has a lower power output. Besides, the exergy efficiency and the primary energy saving ratio (PESR) in the proposed cycle reach as high as 41.88% and 8.3% respectively. It is also demonstrated that when the inlet pressure of the turbine exceeds 2.9 MPa and the outlet pressure of the turbine is between 1.3 and 1.6 MPa in the test range, the proposed cycle is better than the stand-alone systems from the energy saving perspective. Furthermore, parametric analysis shows that the inlet and outlet pressure of the turbine, the inlet temperature of the turbine, the basic concentration of ammonia-water, the generation pressure, ejector entrainment ratio and the outlet temperature of the condenser II have significant effects on the output of the turbine, refrigeration output, exergy efficiency, COP, PER as well as PESR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanes 3aenergy conservation 3aexergy 3aheat 3aprimary energy 3arefrigeration 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aCombined power and refrigeration cycle 0aOTEC 0aKalina cycle 0aEjector refrigeration1 aPan, Junxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4409-39691 aLiu, Yang1 aZhang, Fengge1 aYang, Yunjie1 aArima, Hirofumi0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 185 p.259-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007400162300001600236500001900252520069000271592002800961650002400989650003001013650001801043650002001061650002101081650000801102650001201110653002201122653001301144653002101157700001801178700002101196700002201217773013601239856007401375852000901449655001201458IND60691723020221120180038.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069172302DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.2672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakano, Masatoshi10aPolysaccharide from Aspalathus linearis with Strong Anti-HIV Activity  ap. 267-271.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolysaccharide that had been extracted with 1% sodium carbonate from Rooibos leaves (Aspalathus linearis) showed strong anti-HIV activity.

The anti-HIV activity of the alkaline extract from Aspalathus linearis was recovered mainly in the 25–75% ethanol-precipitated fraction. The polysaccharide almost completely inhibited the binding of HIV-1 to MT-4 cells. It is inferred from these results that the polysaccharide from Aspalathus linearis is involved in the mechanism for virus binding to T cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aantiretroviral properties 3abiotechnology 3apolysaccharides 3asodium carbonate 3atea 3aviruses 0aanti-HIV activity 0ain vitro 0aalkaline extract1 aItoh, Yoshiko1 aMizuno, Toshiaki1 aNakashima, Hideki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 2 p.267-271dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.2673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015400165520164400319592002801963650001601991650001702007650001602024650001002040650002202050650001102072650001902083650001102102650001202113650003102125650001302156650003302169650001702202653004302219653001002262653001702272653004202289700006302331700002202394700003002416700002202446700005502468700006302523773012302586856008102709852000902790655001202799IND60645415020221116155235.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064541502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Weiwei12aA comparative study of mango solar drying methods by visible and near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA)  aThe effect of mango solar drying methods (traditional and tunnel dryers) on the quality of dried mango slices was investigated by visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with the chemometric analysis methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA). Five batches of mango were investigated, each subjected to two/three different positions of three different types of dryers: electrical (reference), traditional, and tunnel dryers. The results of the visible and near-infrared spectra showed that the quality of the mango samples obtained from the electrical dryer (reference method) was the most uniform and conserved the highest content of carotenoids and chlorophyll pigments. The samples from the traditional dryer had the highest variation and content of residual water. ASCA analysis of visible and shortwave near-infrared (VIS-NIR) (including color information) showed that the batch effect was most dominant with a significance effect of 47.5%, whereas longwave near-infrared (NIR) spectra (chemistry) showed that the dryer effect was the most dominant with a significance effect of 38.3%. The factor of the fruit positions in the dryers proved not to be significant. The VIS-NIR spectrum is thus well adapted to measure the fruit maturity and the NIR spectrum has great potential to investigate and control the dryer performance. The latter clearly demonstrated that the tunnel dryer provides much more gentle and consistent drying process compared to the traditional dryer. In contrast, the samples from the traditional dryer showed chemical changes/decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarotenoids 3achemometrics 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3acomparative study 3adryers 3afruit maturity 3afruits 3amangoes 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apigments 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolar drying 0aVisible and near-infrared spectroscopy 0aMango 0aSolar drying 0aANOVA-Simultaneous component analysis1 aSørensen, Klavs M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5117-13151 aMongi, Richard J.1 aNdabikunze, Bernadette K.1 aChove, Bernard E.1 aSun, Da-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3634-99631 aEngelsen, Søren B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4124-43380 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept., v. 112 p.108214-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01175naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015200156300001800308520017200326592002800498650002700526650002300553650002600576650002600602700002200628700001800650773013400668856007400802852000900876655001200885IND60659884120221119071537.0190823e20130716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065988412DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc43017k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yan-Yan10aIncorporation of metal–organic framework UiO-66 into porous polymer monoliths to enhance the liquid chromatographic separation of small molecules  ap. 7162-7164.  aUiO-66 incorporated monoliths were fabricated to enhance the liquid chromatographic separation of small molecules with high column efficiency and good reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3aliquid chromatography1 aYang, Cheng-Xiong1 aYan, Xiu-Ping0 tChemical communications.g2013 July 16, v. 49, no. 64 p.7162-7164dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc43017k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012000175300001600295520130400311592002801615650002101643650002501664650001301689650002101702650001601723650002301739650001601762650001001778650000901788650001101797650001101808650001701819653001601836653001501852653002501867653002401892653001301916653001801929700003701947700002301984700003002007700003202037700002802069700004002097700003002137700003602167700002902203773013502232856008702367852000902454655001202463IND60747950920221122054746.0210926e20211031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074795092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Jean Lucas10aNatural rubber dressing loaded with silver sulfadiazine for the treatment of burn wounds infected with Candida spp.  ap. 597-606.  aMillions of people are burned worldwide every year and 265,000 of the cases are fatal. The development of burn treatment cannot consist only of the administration of a single drug. Due to the infection risk, antibiotics are used in conjunction with gels and damp bandages. In this work, an inexpensive curative based on silver sulfadiazine (SS) and natural rubber latex (NRL) was developed to treat burn wounds. It was produced by the casting method. The infrared spectrum presented no interaction between drug and biopolymer. At the same time, electronic micrographs showed that the SS crystals are inserted on the polymeric dressing surface. Mechanical properties after the drug incorporation were considered suitable for dermal application. About 32.4% of loaded SS was released in 192 h by the dressings that also inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis at 75.0 and 37.5 μg·mL⁻¹, respectively. The curative proved to be biocompatible when applied to fibroblast cells, in addition to enhancing cellular proliferation and, in the hemocompatibility test, no hemolytic effects were observed. The good results in mechanical, antifungal and biological assays, combined with the average bandage cost of $0.10, represent an exciting alternative for treating burn wounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida parapsilosis 3abandages 3abiocompatibility 3abiopolymers 3acell proliferation 3afibroblasts 3alatex 3arisk 3arubber 3asilver 3asulfadiazine 0aBiomaterial 0aBiopolymer 0aNatural rubber latex 0aSilver sulfadiazine 0aDressing 0aAntimicrobial1 aCosta-Orlandi, Caroline Barcelos1 aBurd, Betina Sayeg1 aPegorin, Giovana Sant'Ana1 ada Silva, Thainá Venâncio1 aGuerra, Nayrim Brizuela1 aMendes-Giannini, Maria José Soares1 aFusco-Almeida, Ana Marisa1 aHerculano, Rondinelli Donizetti1 ade Barros, Natan Roberto0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 31, v. 189 p.597-606dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300001300260520144500273592002801718650001201746650001201758650001301770650001101783650001501794650000901809650000901818650001401827650001501841650001501856650000901871650001001880650001901890650001801909650001201927650000901939651000901948700001801957700001801975773011701993856008102110852000902191655001202200IND60569577020221117192321.0170724e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056957702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-6244-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarbassi, S.10aMetallic pollution of soil in the vicinity of National Iranian Lead and Zinc (NILZ) Company  ap. 1433.  aEvaluating the metallic risky pollution of soil in the vicinity of National Iranian Lead and Zinc Company in Zanjan Province, Iran is considered in this study. Twenty-six composite samples were collected from the surface soil of the study area including two lead and zinc depots. Total concentration of elements lead, zinc, chromium, cadmium, cobalt, arsenic, iron and manganese were analyzed. To envisage a more realistic view of the environmental risks, anthropogenic and bioavailable fraction of total concentration values were also detected. Total concentration values of arsenic, cadmium, lead and zinc were higher than that of shale and mean earth crust. Bioavailable and anthropogenic fractions analysis showed that Cd may be considered as the most threatening bioavailable pollutant. Lead and arsenic were also introduced as elements of concern. Enrichment factor assessed As and Cd to be significantly and Pb to be moderately enriched in topsoil samples while pollution index categorized Pb in moderately polluted status. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicates a probable kind of analogy in origin, behavior and destiny of mentioned elements. Because of their remarkable biological and anthropogenic fractions in soil samples, current abandoned open-dumped depots are potential pollution sources within the area. Strict monitoring procedure should be performed to prevent further mobility of metallic pollutants toward food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3afood chain 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3arisk 3ashale 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3atopsoil 3azinc 3aIran1 aNasrabadi, T.1 aShahriari, T.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Nov., v. 75, no. 22 p.1433-1433dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6244-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007900170520102100249592002801270650001901298650002701317650001601344650001701360650001201377650002001389650001001409650001301419700002401432700002101456700002301477773012601500856008501626852000901711655001201720IND60780948820221122013212.0220623e20220618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078094882DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80605432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakutani, Koji 13aAn Electrostatic Pest Exclusion Strategy for Greenhouse Tomato Cultivation  aElectrostatic devices generating an electric field (EF) are promising tools for greenhouse tomato cultivation. In these devices, an EF is generated in the space surrounding an insulated conductor (IC) that is charged by a voltage generator. Thus, a physical force is exerted on any insect that enters the EF, as a negatively charged IC (NC-IC) pushes a negative charge (free electrons) out of the insect body. The insect is polarized positively to be attracted to the NC-IC, and a grounded metal net (G-MN) repels the insect. This dual function of the apparatus (insect capture and repulsion) is the core of the electrostatic pest-exclusion strategy. In this study, we applied various innovative EF-based devices to evaluate their efficacy in greenhouse tomato cultivation. Our objective was to determine the optimal apparatus for simple, inexpensive construction by greenhouse workers.

While electrophysiology-based insights into functions of Neto proteins are known, biophysical and biochemical studies into Neto proteins have been largely missing till-date. Our biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of the purified extracellular domain (ECD) of Neto1 shows that Neto1-ECD exists as monomers in solution and has a micromolar affinity for GluK2 receptors in apo state or closed state. Remarkably, the affinity was ~2.8 fold lower for receptors trapped in the desensitized state, highlighting the conformation-dependent interaction of Neto proteins with kainate receptors. SAXS analysis of Neto1-ECD reveals that their dimensions are long enough to span the entire extracellular domain of kainate receptors. The shape and conformation of Neto1-ECD seems to be altered by calcium ions pointing towards its possible role in modulating Neto1 functions. Functional assays using GluK2 receptors and GluK2/GluA2 chimeric receptors reveal a differential role of Neto1 domains in modulating receptor functions. Although the desensitization rate was not affected by the Neto1-ECD, the recovery rates from the desensitized state are altered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acentral nervous system 3aplasticity 3asynaptic transmission 0aKainate 0aIon channel 0aMembrane protein 0aIonotropic glutamate receptor 0aAuxiliary subunit 0aNeto1 0aSynaptic plasticity 0aNeurotransmitter receptor1 aDhingra, Surbhi1 aKumari, Jyoti1 aAnsari, Mohammed Yousuf1 aShukla, Ekta1 aNerkar, Mayuri Dattatray1 aKumar, Janesh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 192 p.525-536dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016600175300001600341520219600357592002802553650001402581650001302595650001002608650001802618650001402636650001902650650003702669650001902706650001202725653001402737653001602751653001802767653002002785653000802805653000802813700003002821700002502851773010202876856008202978852000903060655001203069IND60583746420221119183520.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058374642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2017.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiseo, Gisele Rodrigues10aUltrastructure of spermatophores and spermatozoa of intertidal crabs Pachygrapsus transversus, Pachygrapsus gracilis and Geograpsus lividus (Decapoda: Grapsidae)  ap. 166-176.  aPachygrapsus transversus, P. gracilis, and Geograpsus lividus are intertidal crabs, whose ultrastructure of spermatophores and spermatozoa are unknown. In this work, we characterized the ultrastructure of the spermatophores and spermatozoa of these three species comparing them to the results of previous research on molecular phylogeny of Grapsidae. Fragments of the posterior vas deferens were processed for routine in transmission electron microscopy. Pachygrapsus transversus and G. lividus exhibit coenospermic spermatophores, while Pachygrapsus gracilis presents cleistospermic spermatophores. The spermatozoa of all three species present the typical pattern seen in Thoracotremata. The acrosome is wider than long, with an acrosome length to width ratio of 0.82±0.022 in P. transversus, 0.75±0.008 in P. gracilis, and 0.82±0.024 in G. lividus. The main specific sperm differences were observed in the perforatorial chamber, the operculum and the concentric acrosomal layers. Pachygrapsus transversus has a flask-shaped perforatorial chamber with a prominent narrowing under the apex, while Pachygrapsus gracilis exhibits a flask-shaped perforatorial chamber with a slight narrowing under the apex, thus wider than that of P. transversus. Geograpsus lividus presents a club-shaped perforatorial chamber with a conical apex. The acrosome of P. transversus has a narrow inner layer while the outer layer presents peripheral concentric lamellae near the opercular pole. In P. gracilis, the inner acrosomal layer of the acrosome is shifted toward the apical portion of the spermatozoon and the outer layer exhibits peripheral concentric lamellae throughout its extension. Geograpsus lividus shows a narrow and electron-dense inner layer shifted toward the opercular pole and curved operculum, unlike the pattern found for the Pachygrapsus species. The differences in the morphology of spermatophores suggest different strategies of transfer and/or storage of spermatozoa between the studied species. The spermatozoal ultrastructure supports the phylogenetic proximity of Pachygrapsus species and also demonstrate that spermiotaxonomy is a useful tool to be associated to molecular data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapsidae 3aacrosome 3acrabs 3alittoral zone 3aphylogeny 3aspermatophores 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3azoology 0aBrachyura 0aCoenospermy 0aCleistospermy 0aSpermiotaxonomy 0aTEM 0aDIC1 aMantelatto, Fernando Luis1 aZara, Fernando José0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2017 July, v. 269 p.166-176dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2017.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01269naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016600157300001800323520019500341592002800536650002300564650002700587650001100614650002800625650001100653700003800664700001500702700002100717773013400738856007400872852000900946655001200955IND60659884420221119071606.0190823e20130618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065988442DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc43025a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qing-Hua10aAsymmetric construction of fluorinated imidazolidines via Cu(i)-catalyzed exo′-selective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides with fluorinated imines  ap. 6277-6279.  aExpedient access to optically active fluorinated 2,4-trans-imidazolidines was successfully developed via Cu(i)-catalyzed exo′-selective 1,3-DC of azomethine ylides with fluorinated imines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3aimines1 aLiang, Weic(University lecturer)1 aChen, Xuan1 aWang, Chun-Jiang0 tChemical communications.g2013 June 18, v. 49, no. 56 p.6277-6279dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc43025a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245017600175300001200351520192800363592002802291650001502319650001702334650001802351650001102369650003102380650001302411650001302424650001502437650001102452650001602463650001402479650002502493700001702518700002202535700001902557700001702576773012402593856008102717852000902798655001202807IND60516714020221120052716.0160414e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051671402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2820-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeneneh, Anteneh Mesfin10aEffects of Temperature, Polymer Dose, and Solid Concentration on the Rheological Characteristics and Dewaterability of Digested Sludge of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)  ap. 119.  aThe rheology of digested sludge affects the flow hydrodynamics, dewaterability, and the polymer consumption in wastewater treatment plants. The rheological characteristics of digested sludge are highly dependent on changes in total solid concentration, temperature, and polymer dose. Hence, this study aims at investigating the impacts of total solid concentration, temperature, and polymer dose on the rheological characteristics and the dewaterability of digested sludge. Investigating the relationship between rheological and physicochemical characteristics of sludge can also serve as a tool to optimize essential process parameters. Different homogenized digested sludge samples were subjected to rheological measurement on rotational stress-controlled rheometer equipped with Peltier concentric cylinder system. The shear stress–shear rate and viscosity–shear rate curves were then developed before and after polymer conditioning at various temperatures and solid concentrations. Different rheological model were fitted to the shear stress–shear rate and viscosity–shear rate rheograms, and the model with the best fitting and more practical significance was selected to determine key rheological parameters. The relationship between dewaterability and digested sludge rheology was also developed. The rheological characteristics of digested sludge during polymer conditioning and flocculation process was significantly affected by temperature and solid concentration; hence, polymer dose can be reduced by operating the dewatering process at optimum temperature condition and varying the polydose as a function of the total solid concentration and viscosity of the digested sludge. The dewaterability as measured in capillary suction time (CST) improved with increasing polymer dose up to 12 kg/t DS but further increase in polymer dose resulted in the deterioration of the dewaterability due to overdosing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adewatering 3aflocculation 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3arheology 3arheometers 3asludge 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awastewater treatment1 aHong, Eugene1 aSen, Tushar Kanti1 aKayaalp, Ahmet1 aAng, Ha Ming0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 Apr., v. 227, no. 4 p.119-119dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2820-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011100171520144400282592002801726650001101754650001401765650001701779650001301796650001101809650001401820650001201834650001301846650002001859650001601879700002201895700002101917700002001938773012601958856008502084852000902169655001202178IND60780949020221122013200.0220623e20220618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078094902DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80605452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthoo, Thomas O.10aSurface Moisture Induces Microcracks and Increases Water Vapor Permeance of Fruit Skins of Mango cv. Apple  aExposure to surface moisture triggers cuticular microcracking of the fruit skin. In mango fruit cv. apple, microcracking compromises postharvest performance by increasing moisture loss and infections with pathogens. This study reports the effects of exposing the fruit’s skin to surface moisture on the incidence of microcracking and on water vapor permeance. Microcracking was quantified microscopically following infiltration with a fluorescent tracer. Water mass loss was determined gravimetrically. Moisture exposure increased cuticular microcracking and permeance. During moisture exposure, permeance increased over the first 4 d, remained constant up to approximately 8 d, then decreased for longer exposure times. Fruit development followed a sigmoid growth pattern. The growth rate peaked approximately 103 days after full bloom. This coincided with the peak in moisture-induced microcracking. There were no increases in water vapor permeance or in microcracking in control fruit that remained dry. When experimental moisture exposure was terminated, microcracking and water vapor permeance decreased. This suggests a repair process restoring the barrier properties of the fruit skin. Histological analyses reveal a periderm forms in the hypodermis beneath a microcrack. Our study demonstrates that surface moisture induces microcracking in mango cv. apple that increases the skin’s water vapor permeance and induces russeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3aflowering 3afluorescence 3afruiting 3afruits 3ahistology 3amangoes 3aperiderm 3astorage quality 3awater vapor1 aWinkler, Andreas 1 aOwino, Willis O.1 aKnoche, Moritz 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 June 18, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80605453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011000154300001600264520223300280592002802513650001502541650001202556650002002568650001902588650002602607650001202633650001002645650001802655650001802673650001902691650001302710650001602723650000902739651001002748653001802758653001102776653001702787653002302804653000802827653002502835700001602860773009002876856007502966852000903041655001203050IND60126746820160818000000.0151107e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012674682DNAL7 a10.2980/17-2-33192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xinwei14aThe Roles of Beetles and Flies in Yak Dung Removal in an Alpine Meadow of Eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau  ap. 146-155.  aFlies and beetles are 2 major functional invertebrate groups responsible for dung removal and nutrient cycling in many alpine pastures. In order to determine the effect of the 2 groups on dung removal rate, as well as the associated mechanisms, we conducted a two-factor, two-level factorial-designed experiment in an alpine meadow of eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Four treatments were included: (A) flies excluded, beetles included; (B) beetles excluded, flies included; (C) both flies and beetles excluded; and (D) both flies and beetles included, each having 45 replicates of artificial dung pats (17 cm in diameter; ca. 248 g in dry weight). We examined dung quality, removal rates, and abundance and biomass of macro-soil faunas within the dung 9 times (5 replicates sampled each time) during the experimental period of 32 d. Both beetles and flies (maggots), as well as the interaction between the 2 groups, markedly affected the dung removal rates. The total dry weight loss of the dung during the experiment was 167.6 g and 127.5 g on average for the beetle and fly groups, respectively. The removal rate in terms of both dung weight and organic matter loss was significantly greater for the beetles than the flies, which was principally because the consumption rate was lower and the resident time was shorter for fly maggots than for the beetles. The coexistence of the 2 species increased dung removal synergistically on the first sampling day and additively between the 2ⁿᵈ and the 5ᵗʰ day. However, after the 8ᵗʰ day of the experiment, the coexistence effect was negative, such that the dung loss of treatment D was comparable to treatment A but significantly greater than treatment B. The synergistic control might be due to the mediating effect of predator beetles on the relative abundance of coprophagous beetles and maggots, and the negative effect of the functional group diversity was because of the overwhelming competitive advantage of the beetles over fly maggots. In conclusion, although both fly and beetle species may significantly contribute to dung removal, the effect of the interaction between flies and beetles appears to depend on dung age (the sampling timing) in the alpine meadow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aadverse effects 3aalpine meadows 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3afeces 3ainsect larvae 3ainvertebrates 3aorganic matter 3apastures 3aweight loss 3ayaks 3aChina 0aalpine meadow 0abeetle 0adung removal 0aecosystem function 0afly 0afunctional diversity1 aSun, Shucun0 tÉcoscience.g2010 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.146-155dUniversitéé Lavalx1195-68607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2980%2F17-2-33193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245011300152300001800265500001900283500002000302520164700322592002801969596005401997650001002051650001502061650002302076650001302099650001302112650001902125650001302144650001102157650002302168650001102191650002102202650002202223650001102245700005902256700005802315700002102373773013702394856007202531852000902603655001202612IND60709604220221117221357.0200908e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070960422DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.36402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanda10aEffects of dams and reservoirs on organic matter decomposition in forested mountain streams in western Japan  ap. 1257-1266.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDamming of streams and rivers alters downstream ecosystem processes, and understanding its effects is essential in managing forested mountain streams. This study examined the effects of dams with a reservoir on organic matter decomposition and its seasonality in two neighbouring mountain streams over five seasons. The cotton‐strip assay and measurement of tensile strength loss were used to evaluate decomposition rates. In addition, the environmental factors, such as water level, water temperature, inorganic nitrogen concentrations and contribution of macro invertebrates were measured. The dams with a reservoir lowered decomposition rates downstream compared to upstream and unregulated sites, in all seasons. The decomposition rates also varied by season at all sites, with higher rates in summer and lowest in winter, and the seasonal variation was larger than the effects by the reservoirs in both streams. Seasonal variation in decomposition rates coincided with water temperature variation, suggesting strong influence of water temperature. However, the temperature differences did not explain the effects of reservoirs because water temperature was always higher at downstream sites. The downstream sites had lower nitrate concentrations and contribution of macroinvertebrates, and these factors may have greater effects than water temperature. Thus, damming of streams may lower the decomposition rates at downstream sites due to altered nutrient and biological effects. However, seasonal variation in water temperature may have more pronounced effects, resulting in greater seasonal variation than the difference among sites.  aPublisher supplied data  cWater Resources Environment Center (WEC) in Japan 3aJapan 3aecosystems 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aresearch 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atensile strength 3awater temperature 3awinter1 aKasahara, Tamao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-64731 aChiwa, Masaaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4016-39231 aFujimoto, Noboru0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 7 p.1257-1266dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.36403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245017000168520211600338592002802454650001602482650001402498650001202512650003002524650001802554650001802572650001702590650002002607650001102627653001402638653001502652653001802667653002702685653002202712700001602734700001302750700001602763700001502779700001702794700001402811773011902825856008802944852000903032655001203041IND60788822220221122231113.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078882222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1579982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yang10aMechanism comparisons of transport-deposition-reentrainment between microplastics and natural mineral particles in porous media: A theoretical and experimental study  aThe migration and distribution of microplastic particles (MPs) in the natural environment has attracted global attention in recent years. However, little is known about the transport-deposition-reentrainment differences between MPs and natural mineral particles in porous media. In this study, polystyrene (PS) and silica (SiO₂) particles, representing model MPs and natural mineral particles, respectively, were selected to study the responses of different particle types to changes in specific particle size and flow velocity. Three typical particle sizes and various flow velocities were chosen to compare and delineate the transport-deposition-reentrainment characteristics of PS and SiO₂ in a packed-bed laboratory column. Collector efficiency was calculated using Tufenkji and Elimelech (TE) equation. The particle fractions released from the collector surfaces were predicted using DLVO theory and force analysis. Two types of particles were attached in the secondary minimum, which were either retained on the collector surface or reentrained to the fluid. The staged elution experiment wherein the flow velocity was increased experienced a period of flow shock, thus breaking the force balance of the particle. An increase in the flow velocity resulted in various degrees of particle elution. The breakthrough experiment at a specific flow velocity showed that the corresponding velocity alteration in staged elution experiment contributed to reentrainment to varying extents. When the effect of gravity on particle deposition was negligible, the particle size was larger, and the lower the velocity for releasing the particles. However, the opposite tendency was observed when considering the effect of gravity on particle deposition. Moreover, the deposition, mainly due to gravity, easily causes particle reentrainment as the flow velocity increases. This study further predicts and reveals the nature of transport and deposition differences between MPs and natural mineral particles, which helps to further assess the risk and potential of groundwater contamination with MPs of different sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aequations 3agravity 3agroundwater contamination 3amicroplastics 3aparticle size 3apolystyrenes 3arisk assessment 3asilica 0aTransport 0aDeposition 0aReentrainment 0aMicroplastic particles 0aMineral particles1 aXie, Yuxuan1 aFan, Wei1 aYang, Zihao1 aTan, Wenda1 aHuo, Mingxin1 aHuo, Yang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 850 p.157998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1579983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245014200202300001800344520112800362592002801490650002101518650002201539650002001561650001501581650001501596650002601611650001401637650002101651650002001672650001301692650001901705653002201724653001601746653002601762653002201788653002501810700001701835700001901852700001901871700001801890700001201908700001401920773012501934856008002059852000902139655001202148IND60664354620221121021404.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066435462DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175198269262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Feichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1145-820410aInfluence of halloysite nanotubes on poly(lactic acid) melt-blown nonwovens compatibilized by dual-monomer melt-grafted poly(lactic acid)  ap. 4173-4185.  aTo develop fully biodegradable and reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) melt-blown nonwovens (MBs) for separation and filtration, PLA/aminated halloysite nanotubes (PLA/A-HNTs) MBs were prepared using PLA/A-HNTs master-batches, compatibilized by dual-monomer glycidyl methacrylate-styrene (St-co-GMA) melt-grafted PLA (PLA-g-(St-co-GMA)). The morphology, crystallization, pore size distribution, filtration performance, and mechanical properties of PLA/PLA-g-(St-co-GMA)/A-HNTs MBs were characterized. The results indicated that PLA/PLA-g-(St-co-GMA)/A-HNT MBs could be successfully manufactured, with well dispersed A-HNTs in PLA MB fibers due to improved compatibility by PLA-g-(St-co-GMA). Incorporation of A-HNTs and PLA-g-(St-co-GMA) slightly increased the average diameter and pore size of PLA MBs. A-HNTs increased the crystallinity degree of PLA MBs, while the crystal forms remained unchanged. In comparison with PLA MBs, the tensile strengths of PLA/PLA-g-(St-co-GMA)/A-HNTs MBs were enhanced but the elongation decreased. PLA/PLA-g-(St-co-GMA)/A-HNT MBs could obtain higher filtration efficiency than neat PLA MBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3afiltration 3ahalloysite 3amechanical properties 3ananotubes 3anonwoven fabrics 3apolylactic acid 3aporosity 3atextile fibers 0apoly(lactic acid) 0ahalloysites 0adual-monomer grafting 0acompatibilization 0amelt-blown nonwovens1 aSu, Juanjuan1 aZhao, Yonghuan1 aHussain, Munir1 aYasin, Sohail1 aYu, Bin1 aHan, Jian0 tTextile research journal.g2019 Oct., v. 89, no. 19-20 p.4173-4185dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175198269263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008300162300001600245520192700261592002802188650002102216650002402237650001402261650001802275650002102293650001702314650002302331650001702354650001502371650001302386653002302399653001702422653002102439700002202460700002002482700002302502773012102525856008202646852000902728655001202737IND60524749720221118003346.0161102e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052474972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Cathy10aNovel glyceryl glucoside is a low toxic alternative for cryopreservation agent  ap. 359-364.  aGlyceryl glucoside (GG, α-d-glucosyglycerol) is a natural glycerol derivative found in alcoholic drinks. Recently GG has been used as an alternative for glycerol in cosmetic products. However, the safety of using GG is still unclear. Currently, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol are wildly used in cryopreservation. Despite GG being a derivative of glycerol, the ability of GG in cryopreservation is still unknown. By using a system of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO), A549 cells and AG1522 cells, the study examined the cryoprotective effects of DMSO, glycerol and GG. Cytotoxic and genotoxic responses induced by the three chemicals were also investigated with CHO to determine the safety of GG for cosmetic products. Our data suggests that GG has great cryopresearvation ability in the concentration of 30%–40% (v/v).For cytotoxic studies, DMSO showed the highest cytotoxicity above 3% (v/v) in cell doubling time delay among three chemicals. For the acute cytotoxicity with trypan blue dye exclusion assay, GG showed stronger cell killing effect within 24 h above 4% (v/v). For the continuous cytotoxicity with colony formation assay for 7 days, DMSO showed significantly reduced clonogenic ability above 2%.In genotoxicity studies, CHO treated with glycerol at 2% concentration induced three times higher frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) than background levels. GG did not induce significant amounts of SCE compared to background. Micronuclei formation was equally observed in the 2% and above concentrations of glycerol and GG.Our data showed that GG has significant effects on cryopreservation compared to DMSO. Glycerol and GG have similar cytotoxicity effects to CHO, but glycerol induced genotoxic responses in the same concentration. Therefore, we conclude that GG may be a safer alternative compound to glycerol in cosmetic products and safer alternative to DMSO in cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aalcoholic beverages 3acosmetics 3acrossing over 3acryopreservation 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3agenotoxicity 3aglucosides 3aglycerol 0aGlyceryl glucoside 0aGenotoxicity 0aCryopreservation1 aAllum, Allison J.1 aAizawa, Yasushi1 aKato, Takamitsu A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Aug. 05, v. 476 p.359-364dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006000172300001400232520141500246592002801661650002501689650001501714650001101729650001101740650002701751650001301778653002601791653002701817653002701844653002401871653001601895653001301911773010001924856008702024852000902111655001202120IND60559840820221116153739.0190405e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055984082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirgmaier, Elke14aThe Neoclassical Trojan Horse of Steady-State Economics  ap. 52-61.  aThe vision of a steady-state economy elaborated by Herman Daly describes an economy that uses materials and energy within the regenerative and assimilative limits of the planet's ecosystems. Sustainable scale, just distribution, and efficient allocation are its constitutive theoretical goals. This paper is a critique of the theoretical foundations of steady-state economics. It argues that steady-state economics consists in an attempt to squeeze neoclassical economics into a biophysical and ethical corset. As a result, many fundamental flaws and criticisms of neoclassical economics remain. As a consequence, steady-state economics does not lead to a radical departure from, or improvement upon, neoclassical theory but rather to fundamental internal inconsistencies between the ‘old’ economics paradigm and ‘new’ progressive ecological economic thinking. Contradictions appear at various levels ranging from ontology and methodology to theory and values. As Daly has pioneered the foundations of ecological economics with his thinking, these ambiguities are not only problematic for steady-state economics but ecological economics as a field more generally. The paper concludes that ecological economics has to let go of neoclassical foundations as they contradict its core values and ambitions. A new and consistent theory of political economy of the environment along heterodox lines is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological economics 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aethics 3aneoclassical economics 3apolitics 0aAllocative efficiency 0aSteady-state economics 0aNeoclassical economics 0aPre-analytic vision 0aMethodology 0aOntology0 tEcological economics.g2017 Mar., v. 133 p.52-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002400190245010900214300001400323506007600337520081600413592002801229506003701257650001701294650000801311650002501319650001701344650002101361650002201382650002301404650002201427653001701449653003001466653003201496700003001528700002501558773007101583856008301654852000901737655001201746IND60553837020221207103146.0161023e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055383702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.08.0082doi7 aPMC46848242pmcid7 a262763142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Stacia L.10aAntisense-mediated affinity purification of dengue virus ribonucleoprotein complexes from infected cells  ap. 13-19.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of RNA-binding proteins that physically associate with viral RNA molecules during infection can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of RNA virus replication.

Here we describe a method for the specific affinity purification of dengue virus RNA and associated proteins using in vivo cross-linking followed by antisense-mediated affinity purification. RNA-binding proteins that specifically co-purify with viral RNA using this method can be identified en masse by mass spectrometry.

The optimized MoO₃–g-C₃N₄ photocatalyst shows a good activity with a kinetic constant of 0.0177 min⁻¹, 10.4 times higher than that of g-C₃N₄. Controlling various factors (MoO₃–g-C₃N₄ amount, initial MO concentration, and pH value of MO solution) can lead to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the composite. Only MoO₃ and g-C₃N₄ are detected with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra. N₂ adsorption and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) results suggest that the addition of MoO₃ slightly affects the specific surface area and the photoabsorption performance. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of MoO₃–g-C₃N₄ indicates a close contact between MoO₃ and g-C₃N₄, which is beneficial to interparticle electron transfer. The high photocatalytic activity of MoO₃–g-C₃N₄ is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of MoO₃ and g-C₃N₄ in electron–hole pair separation via the charge migration between the two semiconductors. The charge transfer follows direct Z-scheme mechanism, which is proven by the reactive species trapping experiment and the ˙OH-trapping photoluminescence spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acarbon nitride 3aelectron transfer 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotolysis 3asemiconductors 3asynergism1 aZhang, Lihong1 aWang, Xiaoxing1 aWu, Ying1 aLin, Hongjun1 aZhao, Leihong1 aWeng, Weizheng1 aWan, Huilin1 aFan, Maohong0 tRSC advances.g2014 Mar. 12, v. 4, no. 26 p.13610-13619dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra00693c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009700207300001400304520134600318592002801664596005701692596005701749650001801806650001001824650002001834650001701854650002901871650001501900650001701915700001801932700001701950700002101967773012801988856008302116852000902199655001202208IND60762013720221123042114.0220106e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076201372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11355-021-00479-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikami, Katsura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3779-553510aVertical space utilization by urban birds and their relationship to electric poles and wires  ap. 19-30.  aBirds living in urban areas use various human-made structures.

A decision tree was constructed to analyze how differences in species (Tree Sparrow, Rock Dove, Carrion Crow, Large-billed Crow, and Slaty-backed Gull.), seasons, and in the numbers of high-rise buildings explained the observed heights of birds in the following three categories; L-zone (0–4.8 m), E-zone (4.8–14.5 m), and H-zone (all ranges higher than 14.5 m). The combination of explanatory variables that were strongly related to height differed among species. Although Carrion Crows and Tree Sparrows most frequently used heights with electric poles and wires, their usage patterns were different. For both species, the E-zone was used not only as merely a perching place but also as an important place where behaviors related to reproduction were exhibited. Knowing the vertical space utilization of birds in urban areas may help avoid future accidents involving unmanned aerial vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H03957cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a21K05647cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aCorvus corone 3aJapan 3aPasser montanus 3adead animals 3adecision support systems 3alandscapes 3areproduction1 aMorimoto, Gen1 aUeno, Yusuke1 aMikami, Osamu K.0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2022 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.19-30dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4237780x1860-18717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-021-00479-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245012700214300001400341520216400355592002802519650003302547650001202580650001102592650001402603650001402617650002202631651002202653651001002675653002602685653000802711653000802719653001902727653001102746653001802757653001102775700002402786700002502810700001402835700001302849700001402862773010702876856008802983852000903071655001203080IND60559841020221116153807.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055984102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Gómez, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7288-307110aWestern Tethys continental-marine responses to the Carnian Humid Episode: Palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic implications  ap. 79-95.  aThis case-study examines correlations in the continental-marine sedimentary record for the Late Triassic Carnian Humid Episode in the western Tethys domain of present-day E Spain and islands of Majorca and Minorca.The study area was divided into five sectors from west to east. Sectors 1 to 3 comprise the continental sedimentary record of this humid episode in eastern Iberia, which is represented by the three subunits (K-2.1, K-2.2 and K-2.3) of the K-2 Fm or Manuel Fm; each subunit records a fluvial episode with marine intercalations in distal areas. Sector 4 corresponds to Majorca Island and represents volcaniclastic input into a marginal continental-marine transitional environment. Finally, sector 5 on Minorca Island comprises a karst surface developed on middle ramp deposits of the Arenal d'en Castell Fm, and separating this formation from the overlying Fontanelles Fm. Based on the ages of the units, estimated through palynomorph assemblages and ammonites, the Carnian Humid Episode was located in both the continental and marine sedimentary records.A detailed sedimentary study focused on facies analysis identified allogenic controls on both continental and marine records. Hence, in continental areas influenced by sea-level fluctuations, fluvial deposits appear integrated within standard lowstand, transgressive and highstand system tracts. This connection based on sedimentary sequences and unit ages indicates that subunits K-2.1 and K-2.2 are represented by a karst surface on the subaerially exposed shallow marine deposits, while subunit K-2.3 already reflects a return to the normal Late Triassic semi-arid to arid conditions that laterally correspond to the transgressive stage represented by the Fontanelles Fm in sector 5.Late Triassic tectonics activated previously developed N·NE-S·SW and NW-SE conjugate fault lineaments in eastern Iberia. This rifting episode controlled sedimentation in sectors 1 to 3, allowing volcanic activity at the fault lineaments junction in sector 4, and configuring a palaeogeography of elevated and subsiding blocks, which controlled both continental and marine sedimentation in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry environmental conditions 3aislands 3akarsts 3asea level 3atectonics 3avolcanic activity 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aCarnian Humid Episode 0aCHE 0aCPE 0aWestern Tethys 0aJulian 0aLate Triassic 0aKeuper1 aEscudero-Mozo, M.J.1 aMartín-Chivelet, J.1 aArche, A.1 aLago, M.1 aGalé, C.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2017 Jan., v. 148 p.79-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245014300176300001400319520113500333592002801468650001101496650001001507650001201517650001601529650002001545650001701565650001701582650003101599650001101630650000701641650001301648650002301661650001701684700002201701773007901723856008301802990002301885852000901908655001201917IND60094648220221118183131.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009464822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamboh, Muhammad Afzal10aSynthesis of N-methylglucamine functionalized calix[4]arene based magnetic sporopollenin for the removal of boron from aqueous environment  ap. 67-74.  aThe present study deals with the synthesis of new N-methylglucamine functionalized calix[4]arene based magnetic sporopollenin (4) and its application for the removal of boron from aqueous environment. The newly prepared calix[4]arene immobilized material 4 is characterized by SEM, EDS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The sorption efficiency of newly calix[4]arene-based magnetic material 4 for boron from aqueous media was evaluated through the solid–liquid sorption experiments. During the sorption process, various kinds of interactions such as electrostatic repulsion, deprotonation of the hydroxyl groups of sorbent 4, and dissociation of H₃BO₃ into anions/cations were monitored. The sorption of boron on material 4 is highly pH dependent and significant percent sorption (84%) was achieved at pH=7.5. The sorption behavior was analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The values of correlation coefficients (R²) showed that the Langmuir isotherm model found to be best fit. Experimental data revealed that material 4 is an efficient sorbent which can be effectively used for the boron decontamination of aqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aboron 3acations 3acorrelation 3adecontamination 3adesalination 3adissociation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amodels 3apH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy1 aYılmaz, Mustafa,0 tDesalination.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 310 p.67-74dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.10.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113024002900139040001800168100001900186245012700205300001800332520155100350592002801901650001601929650001601945650002301961650002601984650001102010650001902021650002702040650000902067650002802076650001802104650002002122650001902142650001902161650002202180650003202202650003402234650003702268650004202305650005602347650002002403650002202423650001502445650003602460700002102496773010902517856007202626852000902698655001202707IND60081187420221118111144.0140822e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008118742DNAL7 a248634562pmid7 a10.1002/etc.26452doi7 a10.1002/etc.26452chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenny, Adam J.10aActivity and ecological implications of maize‐expressed transgenic endo‐1,4‐β‐D‐glucanase in agricultural soils  ap. 1996-2003.  aPlant expression of thermostable endoglucanase (E1) has been proposed for improved conversion of lignocellulose to ethanol for fuel production. Residues of E1‐expressing maize may affect ecological services (e.g., C mineralization and biogeochemical cycling) on soils where they occur. Therefore, the activity of residual E1 was investigated using soils amended with bacterial and plant‐solubilized E1 compared with soil endogenous activity and residual activity from a mesostable cellulase (Aspergillus and Trichoderma spp.). An optimized analytical method involving a carboxymethyl cellulose substrate and dinitrosalicylic acid detection effectively assayed endoglucanase activity in amended and unamended soils and was used for determining E1 activity in 3 representative soils. The effect of E1 on soil carbon mineralization was determined by comparing CO₂ evolution from soils amended with transgenic E1‐expressing and wild‐type maize tissue. Extraction and recovery of the mesostable comparator, bacterial E1, and plant‐soluble E1 showed nearly complete loss of exogenous endoglucanase activity within a 24‐h period. Carbon mineralization indicated no significant difference between soils amended with either the transgenic E1 or wild‐type maize tissue. These results indicate that maize residues expressing up to 30 µg E1/g tissue negligibly affect soil endoglucanase activity and CO₂ respiration for representative soils where transgenic E1 maize may be grown.

(known as Jamun) are consumed in various parts of the world. Our previous studies revealed that a triterpenoid-enriched Jamun fruit extract (TJFE) showed beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis in non-diabetic mice. Herein, the anti-diabetic effects of TJFE (100 mg kg⁻¹ by oral gavage for ten days) were evaluated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice. TJFE significantly attenuated STZ-induced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, suppressed the abnormal elevation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and improved dyslipidemia in the mice. Histopathology and mechanism-based studies revealed that TJFE preserved the architecture and function of pancreatic islets, attenuated insulin secretion deficiency, enhanced insulin/Akt signaling transduction, reduced lipogenic gene expression, and prevented the abnormal activation of Erk MAPK in the liver tissues of the STZ-induced diabetic mice. The current study adds to previously published data supporting the potential beneficial effects of this edible fruit on diabetes management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyzygium cumini 3aanimal disease models 3adiabetes 3adisease control 3aedible fruits 3afruit extracts 3agene expression 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahistopathology 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3alipemic effect 3aliver 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asmall fruits 3astreptozotocin 3atissues1 aLiu, Tingting1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aYuan, Chunhui1 aMa, Hang1 aSeeram, Navindra P.1 aLiu, Feifei1 aMu, Yu1 aHuang, Xueshi1 aLi, Liya0 tFood & function.g2018 June 20, v. 9, no. 6 p.3330-3337dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo00095f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008800171300001400259520080600273592002801079650001501107650001001122650001701132650002401149650000701173700002801180700001601208700001801224773007901242856008301321990002301404852000901427655001201436IND60094648320221118183115.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009464832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKijański, Maciej14aThe concept of a system for electrodialytic boron removal into alkaline concentrate  ap. 75-80.  aThe objective of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of boron transport into the alkaline concentrate during the course of ED and propose a technical solution for it.

However, in vivo delivery to specific tissue reservoirs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is problematic due to the large coding requirement for the principal effector commonly used in these applications, Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) Cas9. Here we describe design of a minimal CRISPR/Cas system that is capable of multiplexing and can be packaged into a single AAV vector. This system consists of the small Type II Cas9 protein from Staphylococcus aureus (Sau) driven by a truncated CMV promoter/enhancer, and flanked 3′ by a poly(A) addition signal, as well as two sgRNA expression cassettes driven by either U6 or ∼70-bp tRNA-derived Pol III promoters. Specific protocols for construction of these AAV vector scaffolds, shuttle cloning of their contents into AAV and lentiviral backbones, and a quantitative luciferase assay capable of screening for optimal sgRNAs, are detailed. These protocols can facilitate construction of AAV vectors that have optimal multiplexed sgRNA expression and function. These will have potential utility in multiplex applications, including in antiviral therapy in tissues chronically infected with a pathogenic DNA virus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aDependoparvovirus 3aDNA 3adsDNA viruses 3aluciferase 3atherapeutics 3agenetic engineering 3ascreening 0aViral therapeutic 0aDependovirus 0asgRNA 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aCRISPR 0aAAV multiplex genome editing 0aITRs 0aSau Cas9 0atRNA promoters 0aStaphylococcus aureus Cas9 0aAAV 0aPAM 0aQuantitative sgRNA screening method1 aKornepati, Anand V.R.1 aMefferd, Adam L.1 aMarshall, Joy B.1 aTsai, Kevin1 aBogerd, Hal P.1 aCullen, Bryan R.0 tMethods.g2015 Dec., v. 91 p.82-86dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245011200196300001800308500001900326500002000345520180200365592002802167650001202195650001102207650002102218650001602239650001802255650001302273650000902286650001102295650001602306650001502322651001902337651001802356773013702374856007202511852000902583655001202592IND60709604920221117221018.0200908e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070960492DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.36192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenk, Xizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9929-211910aImpacts of climatic variability on northward flowing rivers in North America, using a paired basin approach  ap. 1296-1306.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNorthward flowing rivers are the most vulnerable system to a general early warming trend in terms of flood risk. In a changing climate, how well we understand the variability of precipitation and streamflow and the correspondence between them determines the appropriateness and efficiency of river engineering activities, flood control structures, and water resource management policies. Using both time and frequency domain approaches, this study investigated variations and periodicities in precipitation and discharge of two neighboring northward flowing river basins, the Red River of the North (referred to hereafter as the Red River) basin and the Little Missouri River basin in North America. Additionally, this study also characterized whether the most dominant quasiperiodic climate variation El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affected regional precipitation and streamflow. Results indicated that the southern and central Red River basin experienced significant increases in precipitation and discharge, particularly in cold season, while the Little Missouri River basin had no statistically significant change in precipitation or discharge. The global atmospheric oscillation ENSO had little effects on the regional precipitation and streamflow increases in the Red River basin. Furthermore, strong spectral coherences and prominent annual/semi‐annual periodicities in precipitation and discharge were revealed, confirming how precipitation determines frequency peaks and primary oscillation cycles of discharges in both basins. By removing broad‐scale climatic driver, this study indicated that some local forcing is most likely responsible for the excessive water abundances in the Red River basin, among which agriculture land usages stand out to be the most promising driver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3acold season 3aflood control 3aresearch 3arisk 3arivers 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aMissouri River 3aNorth America0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 7 p.1296-1306dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.36193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245018300170300001400353520155000367592002801917596006501945650002302010650001202033650001402045650002402059650002402083650001202107650001202119650001002131650001502141650001502156650001902171650002002190650002302210700002002233700001802253700001602271700001702287700001902304773012802323856008302451852000902534655001202543IND60762014020221120060005.0220106e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076201402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11355-021-00480-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Chung-Heng14aThe effects of immersive garden experience on the health care to elderly residents with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment living in nursing homes after the COVID-19 pandemic  ap. 45-56.  aElderly patients living in long-term care facilities have been restricted from leaving to comply with social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to a worsening of disorders, such as anxiety and depression. This study aims to understand the health benefits of an immersive garden experience to elderly nursing home residents with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments. Virtual reality devices were used to provide immersive garden experiences for the residents who were unable to go outside. The heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) data of the participants of the participants were collected using biofeedback instruments, and changes in the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) and the standard deviation of the NN interval (SDNN) values caused by immersive garden experiences were discussed. The results show that the immersive garden experiences were beneficial to these elderly residents. Within 6 min of completing the experiment, we found that the heart rates of participants had dropped slightly, while SDNN and HF values continued to rise. SDNN values before and after the experiment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement. Furthermore, participants expressed their satisfaction with the video intervention program. The results indicated that nursing homes can provide immersive landscape experiences to help increase HRV and SDNN of their elderly residents. This will not only help these residents recall beautiful memories of their past, but will also improve their quality of life.  aPublisher supplied data  a108-2410-H-030 -068 -SSScministry of science and technology 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanxiety 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acomputer simulation 3aelderly 3agardens 3aheart 3aheart rate 3alandscapes 3along term care 3aquality of life 3astandard deviation1 aChen, Cheng-Min1 aYang, Ju-Yuan1 aLin, Yen-Ju1 aLiao, Man-Li1 aChueh, Ke-Hsin0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2022 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.45-56dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4237780x1860-18717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-021-00480-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245006500172300001400237520104900251592002801300650001501328650001501343650001001358650001901368650001701387650001001404650000701414650002301421700002001444700001801464700002401482773007901506856008301585990002301668852000901691655001201700IND60094648420221118183137.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009464842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishihama, Syouhei10aAdsorption of boron using glucamine-based chelate adsorbents  ap. 81-86.  aAdsorption of boron was investigated using glucamine-based chelate adsorbents, including resin type (Diaion® CRB 03 and Diaion® CRB 05) and a fiber type (Chelest Fiber® GRY-HW) adsorbents. The adsorption rate of boron was pseudo-second-order in all cases, with the Chelest Fiber having the highest adsorption rate. The adsorption of boron increased with pH in the acidic region but decreased with pH in the alkaline region. The adsorption isotherms obtained were of the Langmuir type and the order of the maximum adsorption was CRB 05≈Chelest Fiber>CRB 03. The Chelest Fiber therefore has both a high adsorption rate and a high adsorption capacity for boron. Chromatographic recovery of boron can be achieved with CRB 05 and Chelest Fiber. The Chelest Fiber can adsorb boron at a high flow rate, with a space velocity of 25h⁻¹. The effective adsorption–elution processing of boron from salt lake brine was achieved, although the adsorption rate and elution yield of boron were slightly decreased by components coexisting in the brine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aboron 3achromatography 3adesalination 3alakes 3apH 3asorption isotherms1 aSumiyoshi, Yuki1 aOokubo, Tokie1 aYoshizuka, Kazuharu0 tDesalination.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 310 p.81-86dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.06.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245009400203300001600297500001900313520139300332592002801725596004101753650002101794650002001815650001401835650002201849650001701871650001301888650001401901650000901915651001301924700002901937700002001966700001901986773011502005856008202120852000902202655001202211IND60695129220221122224410.0200516e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069512922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00572-020-00941-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDownie, Jim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7175-053310aHeritable genetic variation but no local adaptation in a pine-ectomycorrhizal interaction  ap. 185-195.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLocal adaptation of plants to mycorrhizal fungi helps determine the outcome of mycorrhizal interactions. However, there is comparatively little work exploring the potential for evolution in interactions with ectomycorrhizal fungi, and fewer studies have explored the heritability of mycorrhizal responsiveness, which is required for local adaptation to occur. We set up a reciprocal inoculation experiment using seedlings and soil from four populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) from Scotland, measuring seedling response to mycorrhizal inoculation after 4 months. We estimated heritability for the response traits and tested for genotype × environment interactions. While we found that ectomycorrhizal responsiveness was highly heritable, we found no evidence that pine populations were locally adapted to fungal communities. Instead, we found a complex suite of interactions between pine population and soil inoculum. Our results suggest that, while Scots pine has the potential to evolve in response to mycorrhizal fungi, evolution in Scotland has not resulted in local adaptation. Long generation times and potential for rapid shifts in fungal communities in response to environmental change may preclude the opportunity for such adaptation in this species, and selection for other factors such as resistance to fungal pathogens may explain the pattern of interactions found.  aPublisher supplied data  aStudentshipcUniversity of Edinburgh 3aPinus sylvestris 3aectomycorrhizae 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3ainoculum 3aseedlings 3asoil 3aScotland1 aSilvertown, Jonathan W.,1 aCavers, Stephen1 aEnnos, Richard0 tMycorrhiza.g2020 May, v. 30, no. 2-3 p.185-195dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-020-00941-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013500164300001400299520137400313592002801687650002101715650004401736650000901780650002201789650001401811650001801825650001201843650002301855650001401878650001901892650004401911650002101955650003401976650003302010650002202043650002102065650001402086653002902100653001802129653002702147653001202174700001502186700001702201773010702218856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60569071620221123005958.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056907162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Nan10aSelf-assembled supermolecular hydrogel based on hydroxyethyl cellulose: Formation, in vitro release and bacteriostasis application  ap. 49-59.  aSelf-assembly of cellulose-based hydrogel is a new supermolecular architecture with potential for biomedical applications. In this study, a novel cellulose-based, supermolecular self-assembled hydrogel (gel-(β)CDP-HEC) was studied, which was based on the host-guest interaction between hydrophobic lauryl side chains grafting on hydroxyethyl cellulose (HECC12) and the cavities in poly(β-cyclodextrin) (β-CDP). The critical concentrations of HECC12 and β-CDP should be both fixed at 30mgmL−1 by the results of dynamic viscosity, rheological property and swelling ratio. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), 1HNuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) studies were used to characterize the synthesized samples. Furthermore, the encapsulation capacity of gel-(β)CDP-HEC was determined as 21.89wt% by phenolphthalein probe method. The loading and in vitro release of Eugenol (EG) were investigated. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to characterize the thermal stability of the EG-loaded gel-(β)CDP-HEC (gel-(β)CDP-HEC/EG). The bacteriostasis characteristics against Escherichia coli had been proved by agar cup-plate diffusion method. The results demonstrated that gel-(β)CDP-HEC had a potential advantage as efficient bacteriostasis materials for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagar 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acellulose 3aencapsulation 3aeugenol 3agel chromatography 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolphthaleins 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity 0aSelf-assembled hydrogels 0aCyclodextrins 0aHydroxyethyl cellulose 0aEugenol1 aWang, Ting1 aYan, Xiufeng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 172 p.49-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014300165300001800308500001900326500002000345520139500365592002801760596009501788596008901883650001401972650001601986650002002002650001702022650001202039650002602051650001402077650002302091650002902114700001902143700001602162700002402178700002102202700001802223700002102241700002402262700006302286773011902349856007402468852000902542655001202551IND60709605020221117220929.0200908e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070960502DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.153622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Anindhya Sundar10aPost‐transcriptional regulation of C‐C motif chemokine ligand 2 expression by ribosomal protein L22 during LPS‐mediated inflammation  ap. 3794-3813.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonocyte infiltration to the site of pathogenic invasion is critical for inflammatory response and host defence. However, this process demands precise regulation as uncontrolled migration of monocytes to the site delays resolution of inflammation and ultimately promotes chronic inflammation. C‐C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) plays a key role in monocyte migration, and hence, its expression should be tightly regulated. Here, we report a post‐transcriptional regulation of CCL2 involving the large ribosomal subunit protein L22 (RPL22) in LPS‐activated, differentiated THP‐1 cells. Early events following LPS treatment include transcriptional upregulation of RPL22 and its nuclear accumulation. The protein binds to the first 20 nt sequence of the 5′UTR of ccl2 mRNA. Simultaneous nuclear translocation of up‐frameshift‐1 protein and its interaction with RPL22 results in cytoplasmic degradation of the ccl2 mRNA at a later stage. Removal of RPL22 from cells results in increased expression of CCL2 in response to LPS causing disproportionate migration of monocytes. We propose that post‐transcriptional regulation of CCL2 by RPL22 fine‐tunes monocyte infiltration during a pathogenic insult and maintains homeostasis of the immune response critical to resolution of inflammation.

We investigated correlations between alder radial growth and inter-annual variation in monthly meteorology and hydrology, spatial patterns of alder climate sensitivity in relationship to depth of subsurface water, and long-term climatic trends. Annual radial growth of alder was positively correlated with June precipitation, river discharge, and Palmer Drought Severity Index values and was negatively correlated with June temperature, suggesting a susceptibility of growth to early-season moisture limitation, due to the co-occurrence of dry meteorological conditions and low levels of hyporheic flow. Alder radial growth was positively correlated with August discharge and July temperature, suggesting that moisture may also be limiting in August, but not in July. The sensitivity of alder growth to variation in temperature and precipitation was greater on higher terraces where depth to water table was greater, while the sensitivity to variation in river level was greater on lower terraces, suggesting that subsurface water more strongly influences moisture availability at these sites. Long-term climatic trends in this region suggest increasing drought conditions; however, the overall influence on alder growth and associated rates of nitrogen fixation are uncertain due to the contrasting relationship of growth with climate in June/August versus July.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus incana subsp. tenuifolia 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3adrought 3afloodplains 3ameteorology 3anitrogen fixation 3arivers 3atemperature 3aterraces 3awater table 3aAlaska 0aAlnus 0aclimate change 0adendroecology 0adrought stress 0anitrogen fixation1 aRuess, Roger W.1 aHollingsworth, Teresa N.0 tÉcoscience.g2010 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.312-320dUniversitéé Lavalx1195-68607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2980%2F17-3-33263Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015200160300001800312520163900330592002801969650001601997650003102013650001502044650001302059650001302072650001002085650001602095650002802111650001402139650001602153650002102169650001702190650002202207650001002229650002002239650002002259650000902279650002602288650001302314650001302327650003602340650003802376650003202414700002002446700001902466700001502485700001802500700001602518700001602534700001702550700001802567700001602585773012302601856007402724852000902798655001202807IND60617816320221121233601.0181026e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061781632DNAL7 a10.1039/c8fo00107c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaoguang,10aHepatoprotection of auraptene from peels of citrus fruits against thioacetamide-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice by activating farnesoid X receptor  ap. 2684-2694.  aHepatic fibrosis is a pathological process that eventually leads to the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer by various types of chronic liver disease. To date, there is no standard treatment for the progression of liver fibrosis. This study aims to investigate the hepatoprotection of auraptene (AUR), a simple coumarin contained in the peels of citrus fruits such as grapefruit, against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. The involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anti-fibrotic effect of AUR was further elucidated using in vivo and in vitro experiments. AUR was found to remarkably protect against liver injury induced by TAA in mice and maintain the homeostasis of bile acids via the regulation of FXR-target genes including Bsep, Mrp2, Ntcp, Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Masson and Sirius red staining indicated a reduction of the collagen content in the liver of AUR treated mice. Furthermore, AUR inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA and expressed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. However, the changes in these genes and protein as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro. Overall, AUR protects against TAA-induced hepatic fibrosis due to the reduction of toxic bile acids and inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and inflammation, which were all in association with FXR activation. AUR might be efficacious for the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abile acids 3acollagen 3acoumarin 3agenes 3agrapefruits 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver neoplasms 3amice 3asmall interfering RNA 3astaining 3atoxicity 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aWang, Changyuan1 aNing, Chenqing1 aLiu, Kexin1 aWang, Xinyuan1 aLiu, Zhihao1 aSun, Huijun1 aMa, Xiaodong1 aSun, Pengyuan1 aMeng, Qiang0 tFood & function.g2018 May 23, v. 9, no. 5 p.2684-2694dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo00107c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016900155300002000324520088800344592002801232650002201260650001301282650003701295650001101332650001701343700001401360700001601374700001501390700001401405700003501419773012301454856007401577852000901651655001201660IND60664902020221119033903.0190912e20140502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066490202DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00704b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Dezhi13aLa₀.₆Sr₀.₄Co₀.₂Fe₀.₈O₃₋δ hollow fibre membrane performance improvement by coating of Ba₀.₅Sr₀.₅Co₀.₉Nb₀.₁O₃₋δ porous layer  ap. 19999-20004.  aThe oxygen permeation performance of perovskite La₀.₆Sr₀.₄Co₀.₂Fe₀.₈O₃₋δ (LSCF) hollow fibre membranes was enhanced by surface modification via coating of a Ba₀.₅Sr₀.₅Co₀.₉Nb₀.₁O₃₋δ (BSCN) porous layer.

While some orchid species may interact with a variety of fungal associates, others are more specific in their choice of mycorrhizal partners. Moreover, orchids that co-occur at a given site, often associate with different partners, possibly to avoid competition and to allow stable coexistence. However, whether differences in mycorrhizal partners directly affect seed germination and subsequent protocorm formation remains largely unknown. In this research, we used in vitro germination experiments to investigate to what extent seed germination and protocorm formation of Gymnadenia conopsea was affected by the origin and identity of fungal associates. Fungi were isolated from G. conopsea and three other co-occurring orchid species (Dactylorhiza viridis (Coeloglossum viride), Herminium monorchis, and Platanthera chlorantha). In total, eight fungal associates, belonging to Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, and Serendipitaceae, were successfully isolated and cultured. While all eight fungal strains were able to promote early germination of G. conopsea seeds, only fungal strain GS2, a member of the Ceratobasidiaceae isolated from G. conopsea itself, was able to promote protocorm formation and subsequent growth to a seedling. Two other fungal strains isolated from G. conopsea only supported seed germination until the protocorm formation stage. The other five fungal strains isolated from the co-occurring orchid species did not support seed germination beyond the protocorm stage. We conclude that, although G. conopsea is considered a mycorrhizal generalist that associates with a wide range of fungi during its adult life, it requires specific fungi to promote protocorm formation and growth to a seedling.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016‐I2M‐2‐002cCAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine 3aCeratobasidiaceae 3aDactylorhiza viridis 3aGymnadenia conopsea 3aPlatanthera 3aTulasnellaceae 3aadults 3amycorrhizae 3aseed germination 3aseedlings1 aZhao, Zeyu1 aLi, Jiayao1 aLiu, Na1 aJacquemyn, Hans1 aGuo, Shunxing1 aXing, Xiaoke0 tMycorrhiza.g2020 May, v. 30, no. 2-3 p.221-228dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-020-00943-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014400159300001600303520154700319592002801866650001801894650001201912650001901924650002101943650001201964650001501976650001501991650002402006650001102030650001202041650001502053650001102068650001202079650002202091653001902113653002702132653002102159653002302180653002102203700002102224700002202245700002002267700001802287773009102305856007502396852000902471655001202480IND60126748020160818000000.0151107e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012674802DNAL7 a10.2980/17-3-33532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlack, Bryan A.10aSpatial Variability in Growth-Increment Chronologies of Long-Lived Freshwater Mussels: Implications for Climate Impacts and Reconstructions  ap. 240-250.  aEstimates of historical variability in river ecosystems are often lacking, but long-lived freshwater mussels could provide unique opportunities to understand past conditions in these environments. We applied dendrochronology techniques to quantify historical variability in growth-increment widths in valves (shells) of western pearlshell freshwater mussels (Margaritifera falcata). A total of 3 growth-increment chronologies, spanning 19 to 26 y in length, were developed. Growth was highly synchronous among individuals within each site, and to a lesser extent, chronologies were synchronous among sites. All 3 chronologies negatively related to instrumental records of stream discharge, while correlations with measures of water temperature were consistently positive but weaker. A reconstruction of stream discharge was performed using linear regressions based on a mussel growth chronology and the regional Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Models based on mussel growth and PDSI yielded similar coefficients of prediction (R2Pred) of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively, for predicting out-ofsample observations. From an ecological perspective, we found that mussel chronologies provided a rich source of information for understanding climate impacts. Responses of mussels to changes in climate and stream ecosystems can be very site- and process-specific, underscoring the complex nature of biotic responses to climate change and the need to understand both regional and local processes in projecting climate impacts on freshwater species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMargaritifera 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adendrochronology 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ainformation sources 3amodels 3amussels 3aprediction 3arivers 3astreams 3awater temperature 0aclimate change 0aclimate reconstruction 0adendrochronology 0afreshwater mussels 0asclerochronology1 aDunham, Jason B.1 aBlundon, Brett W.1 aRaggon, Mark F.1 aZima, Daniela0 tÉcoscience.g2010 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.240-250dUniversitéé Lavalx1195-68607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2980%2F17-3-33533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016800157300002000325520058400345592002800929650001600957650000900973650001700982650001300999650001701012650001701029650002401046700001901070700002101089700002201110700002301132700003101155700002001186773012401206856007401330852000901404655001201413IND60664902220221119033927.0190912e20140328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066490222DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00710g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGotor, Raúl10aBODIPY dyes functionalized with 2-(2-dimethylaminophenyl)ethanol moieties as selective OFF–ON fluorescent chemodosimeters for the nerve agent mimics DCNP and DFP  ap. 15975-15982.  aTwo OFF–ON fluorescent chemodosimeters based on a BODIPY core for the detection of nerve agent mimics have been synthesized.

As the eco-friendly awareness is increasing significantly, poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA), as a typical biomass polymer, has gradually attracted widespread attention. However, the slow crystallization and poor melt strength of PLLA lead to low foaming ability and thus limiting its industrial applications. Herein, a novel and scalable strategy by coupling in-situ fibrillation and mold-opening microcellular injection molding (MOMIM) was developed to fabricate lightweight and tough PLLA/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) foams. Thanks to the reticulated in-situ PTFE nanofibrils with a diameter of 100–200 nm, the crystallization and viscoelasticity of PLLA were dramatically promoted, and further contributing to its foaming ability. The expansion ratio of the MOMIM PLLA/PTFE foam was increased by 86 % compared with the regular microcellular injection molded (RMIM) PLLA foam. Moreover, the lower foam density and the toughening effect of PTFE nanofibrils resulted in the outstanding ductility of the PLLA/PTFE foams, whose tensile elongation, flexural strength, and impact strength were maximally increased by 52 %, 28 %, and 48 %, compared with PLLA foams. More importantly, the thermally-insulating performance and surface quality of PLLA/PTFE foams were also greatly improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acrystallization 3afoams 3aimpact strength 3ainjection molding 3amodulus of rupture 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3apetroleum 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asurface quality 3aviscoelasticity 0aPoly (L-lactic acid) 0aPTFE nanofibril 0aMicrocellular injection foaming 0aMechanical properties 0aThermal insulation1 aWang, Guilong1 aZhang, Aimin1 aDong, Guiwei1 aLi, Shuai1 aZhao, Jinchuan1 aZhao, Guoqun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 215 p.57-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001900157245011200176300001800288520057600306592002800882650001500910650001500925650001700940650000900957650001300966650003100979650004601010650003401056650002001090650004101110700002401151700001901175700001901194773010901213856007201322852000901394655001201403IND60081187920221118110605.0140822e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008118792DNAL7 a248898152pmid7 a10.1002/etc.26512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarman, Chris,10aMeasurement of naphthenic acids in the receiving waters around an offshore oil platform by passive sampling  ap. 1946-1949.  aPolar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were deployed in the vicinity of an offshore oil installation and analyzed for naphthenic acids (NAs).

At each site, we estimated the total, grass, and shrub cover and randomly selected 10 plant patches of modal size (height and crown diameter) and species composition. We extracted an upper soil core (0––10 cm depth) and collected the aboveground litter underneath each plant patch canopy and at the contiguous bare soil. We separated the fine roots (< 2 mm in diameter) from the soil and assessed the biomass and the concentrations of organic C and N in soil and the lignin, soluble phenolic, and N in shrub and grass components of aboveground litter and in fine roots. Total plant and grass cover decreased with increasing aridity. Total litter mass did not vary across the aridity gradient, but the proportion of shrub components in litter increased and litter quality decreased with increasing aridity. The mass of fine roots was positively correlated to soil organic C and N and decreased with increasing aridity. All these trends were consistent at plant patch and bare soil microsites. We conclude that the decrease in soil organic C and N across the aridity gradient was the outcome of different above- and belowground controls resulting from the replacement of grasses by shrubs. Accordingly, the main controls of soil organic C and N could be the quality of aboveground litter and the quantity of the organic matter input to soil through fine-root turnover from belowground.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3agrasses 3acanopy 3asoil organic carbon 3ashrubs 3aplant litter 3adry environmental conditions 3afine roots 3aspecies diversity 3abiomass 3alignin 3aArgentina 0aorganic matter 0aleaf litter 0alitter recalcitrance 0awoody litter 0aplant patch1 aBertiller, Móónica B.0 tÉcoscience.g2010 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.276-286dUniversitéé Lavalx1195-68607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2980%2F17-3-33593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008200163300001800245500001900263500001100282520103500293592002801328650002301356650001001379650002201389650001301411650001001424650001701434650001201451650001801463650001201481650001001493650001001503650001501513650001401528650001401542650001201556650002001568650002701588650003101615700005401646700001901700700002801719700001801747700001801765700002101783700002201804773011901826856007401945852000902019655001202028IND60709605420221117220957.0200908e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070960542DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.154812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorzionato, Andrea10aSympathetic activation: a potential link between comorbidities and COVID‐19  ap. 3681-3688.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aIn coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), higher morbidity and mortality are associated with age, male gender, and comorbidities, such as chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular pathologies, hypertension, kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. All of the above conditions are characterized by increased sympathetic discharge, which may exert significant detrimental effects on COVID‐19 patients, through actions on the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, metabolism, and/or immune system. Furthermore, COVID‐19 may also increase sympathetic discharge, through changes in blood gases (chronic intermittent hypoxia, hyperpnea), angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE)1/ACE2 imbalance, immune/inflammatory factors, or emotional distress. Nevertheless, the potential role of the sympathetic nervous system has not yet been considered in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19. In our opinion, sympathetic overactivation could represent a so‐far undervalued mechanism for a vicious circle between COVID‐19 and comorbidities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3ablood 3adiabetes mellitus 3adistress 3aheart 3ahypertension 3ahypoxia 3aimmune system 3akidneys 3alungs 3amales 3ametabolism 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aobesity 3apathophysiology 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3asympathetic nervous system1 aEmmi, Aron1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2796-56761 aBarbon, Silvia1 aBoscolo‐Berto, Rafael1 aStecco, Carla1 aStocco, Elena1 aMacchi, Veronica1 aDe Caro, Raffaele0 tFEBS journal.g2020 Sept., v. 287, no. 17 p.3681-3688dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.154813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007200173520195600245592002802201650002002229650001902249650002502268650001602293650001802309650001002327650002602337650002302363650003502386650002802421650002202449653002302471653002802494653003002522653002402552653003402576653002202610700002102632700002002653700001602673700001902689773011902708856008802827852000902915655001202924IND60788823220221120100526.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078882322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1580122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegieter, Margo10aLife cycle cost analysis of agri-food products: A systematic review  aBecause of the increasing challenges the global food system is facing on a social, economic and environmental level, and the need to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, agri-food systems are increasingly required to become more sustainable. Life cycle tools, such as a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCC) to evaluate the environmental and economic performance respectively, play an important role in sustainability research. Contrary to LCA, the LCC methodology is not standardized for agri-food products. This study aims to obtain insights into the use of LCC in the agri-food sector using a systematic review approach. Data related to the methodology and findings of life cycle cost analyses of agri-food products were extracted from 92 articles, covering a wide range of products (crops: 59, food/drinks: 22, other: 11) and purposes. Currently, there is no consensus about LCC type definitions and the definition of different types of system boundaries amongst researchers. Furthermore, these and other methodological choices are often not reported in the analyzed studies. The data collection itself can also differ across studies, especially with regards to the inclusion of different cost categories. It is important to include each cost category since all categories have been identified as a costs hotspot in our list of studies (inputs: 84 %, labor: 62 %, machinery: 27 %, other: 39 %). Standardizing the LCC methodology is recommended to ensure comparability and enhance the scientific impact of studies. Integrating LCC results with findings from other life cycle tools, as done in 29 studies, can further support decision-making. The most common methods for integrating results are eco-efficiency analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis methods. In conclusion, it is clear that LCC is a very valuable tool, as a method on its own or complemented by other life cycle tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic performance 3aenvironment 3afood industry 3alabor 3alife cycle assessment 3alife cycle costing 3amulti-criteria decision making 3asustainable development 3asystematic review 0aLife cycle costing 0aEconomic sustainability 0aSustainability assessment 0aLife cycle thinking 0aSustainable agri-food systems 0aSystematic review1 aGellynck, Xavier1 aGoyal, Shashank1 aOtt, Denise1 aDe Steur, Hans0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 850 p.158012-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1580123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245008800175300001600263500000900279520133800288592002801626650001501654650001501669650002001684650001401704650001501718650001401733650001901747650002301766650001401789650002601803650001101829650001901840650000701859650001801866650001201884650002001896700001901916700001701935773020601952856009402158852000902252655001202261IND60665874620221119151119.0191028e198010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066587462DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1980.00472425000900040008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, K.

Chloride Systems  ap. 579-582.  aepub  aThe movement of synthetic chloride solutions, simulating a treated sanitary landfill leachate, through columns filled with the subsoil of a xanthic ferralsol were studied in the laboratory. The chloride movement did not follow the miscible displacement equation or more sophisticated models, because the amount of positive charge carried by the soil depended on both pH and the ionic strength of the solution moving through it. During movement of the alkaline synthetic leachate into the column, the amount of positive charge increased due to the higher ionic strength of the leachate relative to the soil solution. A further temporary increase in positive charge also took place due to the decrease in pH induced by cation exchange caused by the leachate front. Later, the desorption of Cl took place as the alkaline leachate titrated the soil to pH > 9.0 and the positive charge was neutralized by OH adsorption. These results show that variation in the positive charge of the soil, induced by the solution moving through it, causes the Cl outflow curve to deviate from theory. Before more advanced theories of miscible displacement can be applied to this type of situation, it will be necessary to develop adequate kinetic theories to describe the changes in the soil's charge properties induced by the solution moving through it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFerralsols 3aadsorption 3acation exchange 3achlorides 3adesorption 3aequations 3aionic strength 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amiscible displacement 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apH 3asoil solution 3asubsoil 3avariable charge1 aGeering, H.

In the presence of polyols, significant boron rejection improvement was obtained and the extent of the impact was directly related to the stability constant of the boron–polyol complex. Polyols could complex with boron in either the boric acid or borate anion forms; however the complexation between polyol and boric acid appeared to be incomplete. With and without the presence of polyols, boron rejection was strongly pH dependent. The increase in boron rejection due to polyol addition was higher for the NF membrane compared to the RO membrane. A boron:polyol molar ratio of 1:1 appeared to be adequate. The presence of polyols did not cause any observable membrane fouling. Results reported here suggest that the addition of polyols could allow NF membranes to be effectively used for boron removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboric acid 3aboron 3adesalination 3afouling 3aglycerol 3amannitol 3apH 3areverse osmosis 3asorbitol1 aChivas, A.

Here, we assessed whether nitrogen-fixing rhizobia can be transferred to the host legume Glycine max by ERM produced by Glomus formosanum isolate CNPAB020 colonizing the grass Urochloa decumbens. An H-bridge experimental system was developed to evaluate the migration of ERM and of the GFP-tagged Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110 strain across an air gap compartment. Mycorrhizal colonization, nodule formation in legumes, and occurrence of the GFP-tagged strain in root nodules were assessed by optical and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In the presence of non-mycorrhizal U. decumbens, legume roots were neither AMF-colonized nor nodulated. In contrast, G. formosanum ERM crossing the discontinuous compartment connected mycorrhizal U. decumbens and G. max roots, which showed 30–42% mycorrhizal colonization and 7–11 nodules per plant. Fluorescent B. diazoefficiens cells were detected in 94% of G. max root nodules. Our findings reveal that, besides its main activity in nutrient transfer, ERM produced by AMF may facilitate bacterial translocation and the simultaneous associations of plants with beneficial fungi and bacteria, representing an important structure, functional to the establishment of symbiotic relationships.  aPublisher supplied data  anonecCAPES  a311436/2017-0, 307872/2016-5 and E-26/010.001869/2017cNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development 3aBradyrhizobium diazoefficiens 3aGlomus 3aGlycine max 3aUrochloa decumbens 3aair 3afluorescence 3agrasses 3alegumes 3amycelium 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3asoil 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aSbrana, Cristiana1 ada Conceição Jesus, Ederson1 aRouws, Luc Felicianus Marie1 aGiovannetti, Manuela1 aAvio, Luciano1 aSiqueira, J.

The hybrid materials were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope coupled with X–ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, wide angle X–ray scattering, Zeta potential, and magnetization hysteresis measurements. Curcumin (CUR) was loaded into the microgels, and release assays were carried out in simulated environments (SGF and SIF) at different conditions of temperature (25 or 37°C). A slow and sustainability CUR release was achieved under external magnetic field influence. Loaded CUR displayed stability, bioavailability and greater solubility regarding free CUR. Besides, the cytotoxicity assays showed that magnetic microgels without CUR could suppress the Caco-2 cells growth. So, the pectin maleate, N-isopropyl acrylamide, and Fe3O4 could be tailored to elicit hybrid-based materials with satisfactory application in the medical arena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacrylamides 3abioavailability 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahuman cell lines 3ahysteresis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amaleates 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apectins 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asolubility 3atemperature 3azeta potential 0aPectin 0aMagnetite 0aPoly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) 0aCurcumin 0aRelease1 aBellettini, Ismael C.1 aGarcia, Francielle P.1 aFarinácio, Maroanne T.1 aNakamura, Celso V.1 aRubira, Adley F.1 aMartins, Alessandro F.1 aMuniz, Edvani C.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 171 p.259-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100003200167245003700199300001600236520134700252592002801599650001701627650001901644650001801663650002401681650001701705650000901722650002201731650001901753650001501772650002101787650002201808650001501830653001401845653001901859653001601878653002601894653001001920700002101930700002201951700002001973700002101993773010802014856010102122852000902223655001202232IND60126516520221119033852.0150428e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012651652DNAL7 a10.1663/0013-0001(2006)60[159:PITWOC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo de Santayana, Manuel,10aPlants in the Works of Cervantes  ap. 159-181.  aEl Ingenioso Hidalgo, Don Quijote de la Mancha, by Miguel de Cervantes (1547–1616), is the best-known work of Spanish literature. We searched this and the other works of Cervantes for references to plants, plant communities, and products. These texts capture the customs, thoughts, beliefs, and traditions of Spanish culture in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. They also repeat literary themes of ancient Greek and Roman literature. Plant citations were grouped in three categories: plants as part of the environment, useful plants, and plants in symbolic expressions. A total of 150 species were registered, 102 of which appear in Don Quijote. The taxa with the highest frequency of occurrence are Vitis vinifera, Phoenix dactylifera, Triticum aestivum, Laurus nobilis, Rosa spp., Olea europaea, Quercus ilex, and Arundo donax. The number of references to plants and the variety of species seem to attest to a sound and intimate knowledge of plants, their relevance as a landscape feature, and their utility. Many edible, ornamental, technological, and medicinal plants are referred to either explicitly or implicitly. Several species are mentioned in a figurative sense through references to their symbolic meaning, in proverbs, idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or by mentioning them in comparisons and literary figures of speech.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3aLaurus nobilis 3aOlea europaea 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aQuercus ilex 3aRosa 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVitis vinifera 3alandscapes 3amedicinal plants 3aplant communities 3atraditions 0aCervantes 0aliterary texts 0aethnobotany 0ahistory of plant uses 0aSpain1 aTardío, Javier,1 aHeinrich, Michael1 aTouwaide, Alain1 aMorales, Ramón,0 tEconomic botany.g2006 June, v. 60, no. 2 p.159-181d[New York Botanical Garden, etc.]x0013-00017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1663/0013-0001(2006)60[159:PITWOC]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008300158520166800241592002801909650001101937650001401948650001401962650001801976650001901994650002302013650002002036650001102056650001602067651001802083651001002101700001402111700001302125700001902138773011902157856007302276852000902349655001202358IND60653581320221116164437.0190714e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065358132DNAL7 a10.3390/w110612392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Yanlong 10aStable Isotopes of Precipitation in China: A Consideration of Moisture Sources  aAn accurate representation of the spatial distribution of stable isotopes in modern precipitation is vital for interpreting hydrological and climatic processes. Considering the dominant impact of moisture sources in controlling water isotopes and deuterium excess, we conducted a meta-analysis of precipitation isotopes using instrumental data from 68 stations around China. The entire country is divided into five regions according to the major moisture sources: Region I (the westerlies domain), Region II (the arctic domain), Region III (the northeast domain), Region IV (the Pacific domain), and Region V (the Tibetan Plateau). Each region has unique features of spatial distribution and seasonal variation for stable precipitation isotopes and deuterium excess. In particular, seasonal variation in Region IV tracks the onset of Asian summer monsoons well. The regional meteoric water lines are presented for each region. A significant temperature effect is found in Regions I and III, with &delta;18O-temperature gradients of 0.13&ndash;0.68&permil;/&deg;C and 0.13&ndash;0.4&permil;/&deg;C, respectively. However, the reasons for the temperature effects are quite different. In Region I, this effect is caused by the seasonal shift of the westerlies, whereas in Region III, it is caused by the seasonal difference in moisture sources. The precipitation amount effect is most significant in the region along the southeast coast in China, where the &delta;18O-precipitation amount the gradient is &minus;0.24 to &minus;0.13&permil;/mm. The findings in our paper could serve as a reference for isotopic application in hydrological and paleo-climatic research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adeuterium 3ahydrology 3ameta-analysis 3amonsoon season 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3atemperature 3aArctic region 3aChina1 aWang, Ke 1 aLi, Jie 1 aPang, Zhonghe 0 tWater.g2019 June 13, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110612393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014700158300001800305500001500323520183100338592002802169650003902197650001502236650001502251650001902266650002402285650002102309650003802330650001402368650001202382650001402394650001402408650001702422650001602439650001702455650002502472650001202497650000902509650002002518650002502538650001902563650002002582650003402602650001902636653001702655700002102672700002502693773012302718856007402841852000902915655001202924IND60617816720221121233522.0181026e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061781672DNAL7 a10.1039/c8fo00131f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArab, Hany H.10aCamel milk attenuates methotrexate-induced kidney injury via activation of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling and intervention with oxidative aberrations  ap. 2661-2672.  a2019-12-06  aMethotrexate (MTX) is a classical chemotherapeutic agent with nephrotoxicity as the most disturbing adverse effect. So far, its underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly PI3K/Akt/eNOS transduction, are inadequately explored. Several antioxidant modalities have been characterized to ameliorate MTX-induced renal injury. In this regard, Camel milk (CM) is a natural product with recognized antioxidant and anti-inflammatory features. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the potential ameliorating effects of CM in MTX-induced kidney injury in rats. Renal tissues were studied in terms of renal injury markers, histopathology, oxidative stress, apoptosis and PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling. CM was orally administered (10 ml kg⁻¹) and the renal injury was induced by a single i.p. injection of MTX (20 mg kg⁻¹). Interestingly, CM dose-dependently attenuated MTX-triggered increase of BUN and serum creatinine and renal Kim-1 expression and mitigated the renal histopathological changes. CM counteracted renal oxidative stress as manifested by lowering of lipid peroxides, restoration of NOX-1 levels and augmentation of the antioxidant defenses e.g., GSH, SOD, GPx and total antioxidant capacity. With respect to apoptosis, CM curbed the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, downregulated p53, Bax and Cyt C proapoptotic signals and enhanced Bcl-2 and PCNA levels. In the same context, CM activated the prosurvival PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway via enhancing PI3K p110, phospho-Akt and phospho-eNOS levels. Equally important, CM preconditioning did not interfere with MTX cytotoxicity in TK-10 or PC-3 cancer cells. Together, the current findings demonstrate, for the first time, the renoprotective effects of CM in MTX-induced kidney injury via activation of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling and combating oxidative stress and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3acamel milk 3acreatinine 3aneoplasm cells 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aneoplasms 3atissues 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3amethotrexate 3ablood serum 3acytotoxicity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3akidneys 3arats 3alipid peroxides 3aantioxidant activity 3ahistopathology 3aadverse effects 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3anephrotoxicity 0adrug therapy1 aSalama, Samir A.1 aMaghrabi, Ibrahim A.0 tFood & function.g2018 May 23, v. 9, no. 5 p.2661-2672dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo00131f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015200167520183700319592002802156650001802184650001602202650002202218650001302240650001902253650001502272650002302287650001802310650001002328651001002338653001702348653002602365653001602391653001902407700001602426700002402442700001902466700001802485700001802503700001902521700001902540700001702559700001802576700001502594700001402609773011902623856008802742852000902830655001202839IND60788823420221120085422.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078882342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1580142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lan10aDeciphering the impact of urban built environment density on respiratory health using a quasi-cohort analysis of 5495 non-smoking lung cancer cases  aLung cancer is a major health concern and is influenced by air pollution, which can be affected by the density of urban built environment. The spatiotemporal impact of urban density on lung cancer incidence remains unclear, especially at the sub-city level. We aimed to determine cumulative effect of community-level density attributes of the built environment on lung cancer incidence in high-density urban areas. We selected 78 communities in the central city of Shanghai, China as the study site; communities included in the analysis had an averaged population density of 313 residents per hectare. Using data from the city cancer surveillance system, an age-period-cohort analysis of lung cancer incidence was performed over a five-year period (2009–2013), with a total of 5495 non-smoking/non-secondhand smoking exposure lung cancer cases. Community-level density measures included the density of road network, facilities, buildings, green spaces, and land use mixture. In multivariate models, built environment density and the exposure time duration had an interactive effect on lung cancer incidence. Lung cancer incidence of birth cohorts was associated with road density and building coverage across communities, with a relative risk of 1·142 (95 % CI: 1·056–1·234, P = 0·001) and 1·090 (95 % CI: 1·053–1·128, P < 0·001) at the baseline year (2009), respectively. The relative risk increased exponentially with the exposure time duration. As for the change in lung cancer incidence over the five-year period, lung cancer incidence of birth cohorts tended to increase faster in communities with a higher road density and building coverage. Urban planning policies that improve road network design and building layout could be important strategies to reduce lung cancer incidence in high-density urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aenvironment 3aexposure duration 3aland use 3alung neoplasms 3amonitoring 3apopulation density 3arelative risk 3aroads 3aChina 0aCompact city 0aLongitudinal analysis 0aLung cancer 0aUrban planning1 aSun, Wenyao1 aMoudon, Anne Vernez1 aZhu, Yong-Guan1 aWang, Jinfeng1 aBao, Pingping1 aZhao, Xiaojing1 aYang, Xiaoming1 aJia, Yinghui1 aZhang, Surong1 aWu, Shuang1 aCai, Yuxi0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 850 p.158014-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1580143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011400165300001600279520116800295592002801463650001001491650001901501650001701520650002001537700001801557700001801575700001801593700002001611700002001631700001901651700001701670773008101687856008301768990002301851852000901874655001201883IND60094649120221118182615.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009464912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYavuz, Emre10aRemoval of boron from geothermal water by RO system-I—Effect of membrane configuration and applied pressure  ap. 130-134.  aIn this study, a mini pilot scale reverse osmosis (RO) system containing two spiral wound FilmTech BW30-2540 membranes was installed at a geothermal area in Izmir, Turkey. The desalination and boron removal performances of this system were investigated. The effect of such parameters as operating pressure and the number of membranes employed during the operation on desalination performance of the system was investigated. The system performance was evaluated at 12 and 15bar of operating pressures as a function of the number of membranes used. Desalination performance of brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) system was determined by the quality and quantity analyses of the product water. When the operating pressure was increased, a high permeate recovery, permeate flux and salt rejection were obtained with both single and double membrane configurations. The maximum boron rejection was 47% at 12bar of applied pressure while it increased to 49% at 15bar of applied pressure using a single membrane mode of operation. The lowest average boron concentration in the product water was 4.7mg/L at 15bar of applied pressure for a single membrane configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3abrackish water 3adesalination 3areverse osmosis1 aGüler, Enver1 aSert, Gökhan1 aArar, Özgür1 aYüksel, Mithat1 aYüksel, Ümran1 aKitiş, Mehmet1 aKabay, Nalan0 tDesalination.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 310 p.130-134dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007000167300001600237520139400253592002801647650001201675650001201687650001901699650001101718650001901729650002401748653002501772653002301797653000801820653000801828700001601836773020701852856008802059852000902147655001202156IND60559842020221116153410.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055984202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehak, M.10aTime synchronization of consumer cameras on Micro Aerial Vehicles  ap. 114-123.  aThis article discusses the problem of time registration between navigation and imaging components on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Accurate mapping with MAVs is gaining importance in applications such as corridor mapping, road and pipeline inspections or mapping of large areas with homogeneous surface structure, e.g. forests or agricultural fields. Therefore, accurate aerial control plays a major role in efficient reconstruction of the terrain and artifact-free ortophoto generation. A key prerequisite is correct time stamping of images in global time frame as the sensor exterior orientation changes rapidly and its determination by navigation sensors influence the mapping accuracy on the ground. A majority of MAVs is equipped with consumer-grade, non-metric cameras for which the precise time registration with navigation components is not trivial to realize and its performance not easy to assess. In this paper, we study the problematic of synchronization by implementing and evaluating spatio-temporal observation models of aerial control to estimate residual delay of the imaging sensor. Such modeling is possible through inclusion of additional velocity and angular rate observations into the adjustment. This moves the optimization problem from 3D to 4D. The benefit of this approach is verified on real mapping projects using a custom build MAV and an off-the-shelf camera.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asystem optimization 0aTime synchronization 0aSensor orientation 0aMAV 0aBBA1 aSkaloud, J.0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.114-123dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

It was found that phytoglycogen was precipitated in the presence of these surfactants. Phytoglycogen in the SDS system was dispersed more homogeneously than in the C₁₂EO₂₀ system, and a liquid-liquid phase separation region appeared in the SDS system. In the C₁₂EO₂₀ system, the transmittance of a stirred solution in the single-phase region was slightly lower than that of the phytoglycogen controls, whereas the transmittance of the stirred solution was higher than that of the controls in the SDS system. It thus seems that phytoglycogen formed a complex with SDS and that this complex affected the transmittance in the single-phase region. Viscosity measurements of the aqueous solution supported the existence of such a phytoglycogen–SDS complex. These results enabled us to propose a schematic representation of the complex structure. It was clarified that phytoglycogen forms a complex with SDS, and that the structure of the complex modifies the dispersion stability of phytoglycogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3aseparation 3atransmittance 3aviscosity 0aglycogen-surfactant complex 0astarch-surfactant complex 0aphytoglycogen 0aionic surfactant 0aphase behavior1 aTrie, Ryozo1 aTateishi, Koichi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 12 p.2063-2068dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.20633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168300001600288520171300304592002802017650002102045650001002066650002402076650001302100650002002113650003002133650002202163650001602185650001902201650001302220650001402233650001202247650001802259651001002277653001302287653000902300653001602309653001002325653001302335653002002348700002002368700003002388700001702418700001702435700001702452773009702469856008502566961001302651852000902664655001202673IND60583743620221119183244.0190606e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058374362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregory, L.F.10aNutrient loading impacts on culturable E. coli and other heterotrophic bacteria fate in simulated stream mesocosms  ap. 442-449.  aUnderstanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalgae 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3adecision making 3afate and transport models 3aindicator species 3aplate count 3apollution load 3araceways 3asediments 3astreams 3awater quality 3aTexas 0aE. coli 0aFate 0aPersistence 0aWater 0aSediment 0aDecay constants1 aKarthikeyan, R.1 aAitkenhead-Peterson, J.A.1 aGentry, T.J.1 aWagner, K.L.1 aHarmel, R.D.0 tWater research.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 126 p.442-449dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.09.0433Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009800173300001600271520171800287592002802005650002202033650001602055650001302071650002302084650001302107650001602120650002402136650002902160650001402189650001502203650002602218650001602244650002102260650001502281650001902296650001202315651001902327700002102346700002602367700002202393773009502415856008102510852000902591655001202600IND60569573720221117192128.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056957372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-016-9587-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutinová, Petra Thea10aHost specificity of epiphytic diatom (Bacillariophyceae) and desmid (Desmidiales) communities  ap. 697-709.  aThe nature of the relationships between host plants and associated microalgal epiphyton in freshwater ecosystems is largely undetermined. Many studies assume that the host plant, as a biologically active substrate, must have a direct influence on associated epiphytic communities, whereas other studies favor the view that host plants are a neutral substrate with only indirect effects on epiphytic communities. Here, we addressed the question of whether host plant taxonomic identity influences epiphyton community structure in comparison with other factors (which also provided further insight into the general ecology of freshwater microphytobenthos) by examining four types of natural plant substrates at five freshwater sites in the Czech Republic. The results demonstrated that host plant type significantly affected epiphytic community structure; most notably, the genus Sphagnum was found to support remarkably different epiphytic communities, probably including several microalgal substrate specialists. Other host plants we examined included Utricularia spp., Nymphaea spp., and Potamogeton natans L., all of which were presumably neutral substrates. The differences among the host plants varied among sites, however, suggesting the presence of an interaction between these two factors. Thus, we concluded that host plants may not always provide a neutral substrate for microalgal epiphyton and, consequently, biomonitoring surveys should account for variation relating to this factor. Finally, our work showed that epiphytic diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) and desmids (Desmidiales) adopted similar group strategies, thus allowing for generalizations of patterns across entire microphytobentic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDesmidiales 3aNymphaea 3aPotamogeton natans 3aSphagnum 3aUtricularia 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aepiphytes 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahost plants 3ahost specificity 3amicroalgae 3aplant taxonomy 3asurveys 3aCzech Republic1 aNeustupa, Jiří1 aBevilacqua, Stanislao1 aTerlizzi, Antonio0 tAquatic ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 50, no. 4 p.697-709dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-016-9587-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245007500208300001800283506007600301520109300377592002801470506003701498650002301535650001401558650001701572650002101589650001901610650001901629650002101648650001401669650001601683650001501699650001301714700001801727700001901745773011101764856008601875852000901961655001201970IND60529991120221207083206.0160720e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052999112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b013812doi7 aPMC44972962pmcid7 a260682792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLeod, Euan10aDemocratization of Nanoscale Imaging and Sensing Tools Using Photonics  ap. 6434-6445.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProviding means for researchers and citizen scientists in the developing world to perform advanced measurements with nanoscale precision can help to accelerate the rate of discovery and invention as well as improve higher education and the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers worldwide.

We divide our review into two main sections: label-based nanoscale imaging and sensing tools, which primarily involve fluorescent approaches, and label-free nanoscale measurement tools, which include light scattering sensors, interferometric methods, photonic crystal sensors, and plasmonic sensors. For each of these areas, we have primarily focused on approaches that have either demonstrated operation outside of a traditional laboratory setting, including for example integration with mobile phones, or exhibited the potential for such operation in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acost effectiveness 3aengineers 3afluorescence 3ahigher education 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3alight scattering 3aphotonics 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3ateachers1 aWei, Qingshan1 aOzcan, Aydogan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 July 07, v. 87, no. 13 p.6434-6445dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b013813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013100162300001800293520097600311592002801287650003201315650002101347650001601368650002301384650001001407650001101417650001001428650002201438650002401460650001301484650001701497650001901514650001701533653002801550653001101578653001301589653003701602700002001639700001801659773013901677856007501816852000901891655001201900IND60691719320221120114230.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069171932DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.20762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Katsuichi10aMolecular Cloning of Levan Fructotransferase Gene from Arthrobactev nicotinovorans GS-9 and Its Expression in Escherichia coli  ap. 2076-2079.  aThe gene encoding an extracellular levan fructotransferase, designated the lft gene, was cloned from the genomic DNA of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans GS-9, and expressed in Escherichia coli. It was found that a single open reading frame consisted of 1554 base pairs that encoded a polypeptide composed of a signal peptide of 33 amino acids and a mature protein of 484 amino acids (Mᵣ 53,152), and it was also found that a putative ribosome-binding site was present in the upstream from the ORF. The primary structure had no significant similarity with those of inulin fructotransferases, but had low similarity to the catalytic regions of other fructosylhydrolases. The expression of the lft gene was increased on a plasmid, pLFT-BBl, in which the lft gene was fused with α-peptide of the lacZ gene of pUC18. An E. coli transformant carrying pLFT-BB1 expressed six times as much activity of levan fructotransferase as that of the original strain, A. nicotinovorans GS-9.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter nicotinovorans 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3agenes 3ainulin 3alevan 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3apolypeptides 3asignal peptide 3atransferases 0alevan fructotransferase 0aDFA IV 0alft gene 0aArthrobacter nicotinovorans GS-91 aYokota, Atsushi1 aTomita, Fusao0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 12 p.2076-2079dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.20763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245007400184300001800258500001900276520156000295592002801855650002101883650001201904650002001916650001301936650002901949650001101978650002101989650000702010650002202017650001802039650001502057650001302072653002202085653002802107653002002135653003002155653002702185700003302212700003102245700003502276700002802311773012102339856008502460852000902545655001202554IND60734628020221120040356.0210421e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073462802DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2019.16743862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Cristiane Aparecida10aProposal of a controlled release of citrate by solubility equilibrium  ap. 1582-1590.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSome substances at high concentrations in both the body and the environment can be toxic. The remediation of contaminated environments, for example by metals in toxic concentrations is a fairly current problem. In this way, organic acids of low molecular weight, because they are biodegradable, constitute an alternative potentially for their use in phytoremediation processes. Among these acids, citric acid was chosen to be used in this work due to its suitable binder behaviour, with high stability constants. The purpose of this work was to develop a controlled release of citrate that allows its release to the soil solution to pre-defined concentrations by the system and that this concentration is maintained even if the binder is consumed in the complexation of metals, diluted or percolated. In this way, the system has an additional feature, compared to the conventional controlled release system. The presence of calcium citrate allowed for a slower release of citrate compared to citrate soluble salts or even with calcium citrate directly in solution. The Noyes-Whitney model allowed to explain the effects of pellet sizes and percentages of agar-agar. The pH of the receptor solution and the calcium concentrations used in the preparation of the gels influenced the equilibrium concentration of the citrate, demonstrating the independence of the controlled release process in relation to other variables in the solution. The controlled release system proposed in this work is a promising and very useful system for phytoextraction processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acalcium 3acalcium citrate 3acitrates 3aenvironmental technology 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aphytoaccumulation 3asoil solution 3asolubility 3atoxicity 0aModulated release 0aenvironmental pollution 0aphytoextraction 0acontaminated environments 0asolubility equilibrium1 ade Oliveira, André Fernando1 aAndrade, Carlos Eduardo O.1 ade Queiroz, Maria Eliana L.

However, the quantification of multiple elements in whole blood is not easy partly because of the wide variation in element concentrations (from ng L⁻¹ to g L⁻¹) and the complex matrix. The aim of this work was to develop a fast, sustainable, and reliable analytical method, in combination with low-power TXRF, for multielemental analysis of blood samples. Firstly, a set of experiments were carried out to select the best diluent type and dilution factor using the control material SeronormTM Trace Elements Whole Blood L-1. A critical evaluation of the parameters affecting the sample deposition on the reflector was also carried out including a study of the shape and element distribution of the deposited residue on the reflector by micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Using the best analytical conditions, limits of detection estimated were in the low milligrams per kilogram range and similar to those obtained using more complex sample treatments such as digestion. Accuracy and precision of the results were in most cases acceptable (recoveries 89–102%, RSD 6–8%, n = 5). Only underestimated values were obtained for light elements such as potassium. To prove the applicability of the method, several blood samples from control and thyroid disease patients were analyzed. Despite the fact that more samples need to be analyzed, it seems that Zn and Br contents in some of the patients are significantly higher compared to control samples.

In most situations, the comparison between two random vectors focuses on univariate comparisons of conditional random variables truncated in quantiles; this kind of comparison is of particular interest in the environmental sciences. In this work, we describe a new approach to comparing skewness in terms of the univariate convex transform ordering proposed by van Zwet (Convex transformations of random variables. Mathematical Centre Tracts, Amsterdam, 1964), associated with skewness as well as concentration. The key to these comparisons is the underlying dependence structure of the random vectors. Below we describe graphical tools and use several examples to illustrate these comparisons.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenvironmental science 3astatistical analysis1 aMulero, J.1 aRuíz, J.

Heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens spores, somatic coliphages and eukaryotes (amoebae, flagellates, ciliates and metazoa) were tested as indicator microorganisms. EC with an Fe/Fe cell at 200 A m−2 and natural pH allowed >5 log unit removal of E. coli and final concentration below 1 bacteria mL−1 of coliphages and eukaryotes from both effluents in ca. 60 min, whereas heterotrophic bacteria, enterococci and spores were more resistant. A larger removal was obtained for the primary effluent, probably because the flocs remove higher amount of total organic carbon (TOC), entrapping more easily the microbiota. EF with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air-diffusion cathode that produces H2O2 on site was first performed at pH 3.0, with large or even total inactivation of microorganisms within 30 min. A more effective microorganism removal was attained as compared to EC thanks to •OH formed from Fenton's reaction. A quicker disinfection was observed for the secondary effluent owing to its lower TOC content, allowing the attack of greater quantities of electrogenerated oxidants on microorganisms. Wastewater disinfection by EF was also feasible at natural pH (∼7), showing similar abatement of active microorganisms as a result of the synergistic action of generated oxidants like active chlorine and coagulation with iron hydroxides. A sequential EC/EF treatment (30 min each) was more effective for a combined decontamination and disinfection of urban wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aCiliophora 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aanodes 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3acathodes 3achlorine 3acoliphages 3adecontamination 3adisinfection 3aeffluents 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrocoagulation 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3airon hydroxides 3amunicipal wastewater 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidants 3apH 3aspores 3asynergism 3awastewater treatment 0aIndicator bacteria 0aElectrochemical disinfection 0aElectrocoagulation 0aElectro-Fenton 0aSequential water treatment 0aUrban wastewater1 aBruguera-Casamada, Carmina1 aSalvadó, Humbert1 aBrillas, Enric1 aSirés, Ignasi,1 aAraujo, Rosa M.0 tWater research.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 126 p.450-459dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024003500145040001800180100002700198245012300225300001400348520144800362592002801810650002301838650002301861650001501884650001901899650001901918650001201937650003601949650002101985650001602006650001102022650003102033650000902064650000902073650002402082650002102106650002302127650002102150653000902171653001502180653001202195653002902207653001302236653002102249700002102270700002202291700001802313773011402331852000902445856008102454655001202535IND4370458420221121130236.0181204e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437045842DNAL7 a157031252pmid7 a10.1258/00236770528865012doi4 a0023-6772(20050101)39:1L.58;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Loo, Pascalle L.P.10aAssessment of the use of two commercially available environmental enrichments by laboratory mice by preference testing  ap. 58-67.  aIn the field of biomedical research, the demand for standardization of environmental enrichment for laboratory animals is growing. For laboratory mice, a wide variety of environmental enrichment items are commercially available. Most of these comply with the demands for standardization, hygiene and ergonomics. Whether these items also comply with their actual purpose, to enhance the well-being of the mice, is often not assessed scientifically. In this study, we tested the preference of mice for two commercially available nest boxes differing in shape and material: the Shepherd Shack/DesRes (SS/DR) and the Tecniplast Mouse House (TMH), in a simple preference test. To indicate strength of preference, both nest boxes were also tested against a highly preferred nesting material. Preference for the most preferred nest box was investigated further. Our results indicated a strong preference by mice for the SS/DR, but not for the TMH. Furthermore, nesting material was almost always combined with the SS/DR, but not with the TMH. More elaborate testing of the SS/DR in an automated preference test system confirmed that mice spent significantly more time in a cage in which an SS/DR is provided. Differences between both nest boxes are discussed with regard to their attractiveness to mice. It is also argued that enrichment should primarily be developed in concordance with the animals' needs prior to the marketing of enrichment tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaboratory animals 3aanimal preferences 3anest boxes 3aanimal welfare 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratoryxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animalxstandards 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNesting Behavior 0aMICE 0aPREFERENCE 0aWELFARE 0aENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT 0aNEST BOX 0aNESTING MATERIAL1 aBlom, Harry J.M.1 aMeijer, Margot K.1 aBaumans, Vera0 tLaboratory animals.g2005 Jan. 01, v. 39, no. 1 p.58-67dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/00236770528865013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02988naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245020700165300001600372520166100388592002802049650002902077650003002106650001602136650001002152650001102162650001402173650002402187650001002211650003302221653001302254653000902267653001002276653003002286653001002316700002302326700001902349773011802368856008302486852000902569655001202578IND60645413220221116155116.0200819e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064541322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVendl, Tomas10aComparative tarsal morphology of two secondary stored product beetle pests, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), that vary in their climbing ability on smooth surfaces  ap. 116-122.  aOryzaephilus surinamensis and Cryptolestes ferrugineus are serious secondary pests that infest commodities and packaged food. Both species differ in their climbing ability on smooth surfaces, such as the surfaces of packages or grains. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that tarsal and inter-claw adhesive structures of the species differ significantly. To test this hypothesis, we morphologically described and compared (quantitatively and qualitatively) the claws and setal structures on the tarsi and claws of O. surinamensis and C. ferrugineus using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The main difference found was in the presence and/or quantity of tarsal and inter-claw adhesive structures between O. surinamensis and C. ferrugineus. The profound morphological differences regarding the presence and higher quantity of adhesive structures can explain why O. surinamensis is a better climber than C. ferrugineus on inclined smooth surfaces. The shape of the claws was similar in both species, but those of C. ferrugineus were slightly shorter and sharper (i.e., claw tip radius = 1.17 μm) than those of O. surinamensis (tip radius = 1.63 μm), indicating that C. ferrugineus is better morphologically adapted to move over rough material with smaller asperities. The obtained results suggest that the presence or absence of adhesive tarsal structures can be used for assessment of the ability of various pests to move on smooth surfaces of packaging or grains. The outcomes of the work may also provide inspiration to material and biomimetic scientists to improve pest-proof packaging material with anti-adhesive properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptolestes ferrugineus 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3abiomimetics 3aclaws 3agrains 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apests 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aClimbing 0aLegs 0aTarsi 0aSetal adhesive structures 0aClaws1 aStejskal, Václav,1 aAulicky, Radek0 tJournal of stored products research.g2019 June, v. 82 p.116-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245019000165300001600355500001900371520192700390592002802317650001802345650002202363650001802385650001602403650001602419650001802435650001602453650001302469650000902482650001802491650001102509650002002520650002302540650001602563650001002579650002502589650002102614653001302635653001202648653001302660653002402673653000702697653002202704653003402726653003202760700003502792700002902827700004102856700002602897700002202923700002002945773011402965856007103079852000903150655001203159IND60731945020221119104426.0210326s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073194502DNAL7 a10.1071/AN201402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos Dalólio, Felipe10aDietary chromium-methionine supplementation and broiler (22–43 days) responses during heat stress. 1. Growth performance and carcass yield, metabolisable energy and serum biochemistry  ap. 586-595.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContext Chromium (Cr) is considered a beneficial trace element. It has been reported that supplementation with Cr in the diet promotes improvements in the productive variables of broilers reared under heat stress (HS). Aim The study aimed to evaluate dose response of Cr as chromium-methionine (CrMet) supplementation on metabolisable energy, serum biochemistry, growth performance and carcass yield of broilers. Methods Three hundred and thirty-six 22-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly assigned to four blocks, six treatments (0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.80 and 1.20 mg/kg dry matter (DM) Cr as CrMet), eight repetitions with seven birds per experimental unit, subjected to HS (33°C for 12h/day) from 22 to 43 days. The supplemented CrMet level for each variable studied was estimated using linear and quadratic regressions. Key results The bodyweight was quadratically affected at 35 and 43 days (P < 0.01), as well as bodyweight gain (P = 0.02) and feed conversion ratio (P = 0.01) from 22 to 43 days. A linear improvement (P = 0.03) was observed in the feed conversion ratio from 22 to 28 days and bodyweight gain for 22 to 35 days (P = 0.02). The nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy and the coefficient of metabolisation of energy were quadratically affected (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) by CrMet levels in the diet. A quadratic response was observed on total serum cholesterol (P < 0.01), serum glucose (P = 0.07) and triacylglycerol (P < 0.01). The abdominal fat deposition was quadratically affected (P < 0.01) by CrMet levels in the diet. Conclusions The supplementation of 0.77 mg/kg DM Cr as CrMet improves performance, carcass characteristics and serum biochemistry parameters of broiler chickens reared under heat stress. Implications The results indicate that CrMet can be supplemented in the diet for broilers reared under heat stress to improve productivity of broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aanimal production 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acarcass yield 3acholesterol 3achromium 3adiet 3adose response 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aheat stress 3amales 3ametabolizable energy 3atriacylglycerols 0abroilers 0acarcass 0achickens 0achromium methionine 0aCr 0apoultry nutrition 0atrace mineral supplementation 0atropical poultry production1 aTeixeira Albino, Luiz Fernando1 aNogueira da Silva, Jadir1 aKyonara Alves Tenório Fireman, Alba1 aBurin, Álvaro Mário1 aBusanello, Marcos1 aRibeiro, Valdir0 tAnimal production science.g2021, v. 61, no. 6 p.586-595dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN201403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011300165300001600278520147000294592002801764650001301792650003101805650001101836650001801847650001201865650001801877650001401895650001101909650002101920650002201941653003101963653002601994653001902020653002302039653002702062700001602089700001602105700001602121700001402137700005802151700001702209700001902226773011602245856008702361852000902448655001202457IND60629516820221117180811.0190326e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062951682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Man12aA comparative study on the performance of liquid flat-plate solar collector with a new V-corrugated absorber  ap. 235-248.  aIn this study, a new V-corrugated absorber with multi-channels is presented and applied in the liquid flat-plate solar collector. The absorber is extruded with aluminium and specific triangular channels are directly formed to improve the solar absorptance, reduce the heat conduction thermal resistance and decrease the pressure drop. Optical and heat transfer models for the new collector and a conventional sheet-and-tube collector are developed and experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy. Performance of the new and conventional collector are compared under different operational conditions and the results indicate that: (i) The daily average optical/thermal efficiency of the new and conventional collector are about 84.9%/69.4% and 69.1%/58.6%, respectively. (ii) The average exergy efficiency of the new and conventional collector are about 3.8% and 3.3% respectively under the mass flow rate of 10–90 g/s. (iii) The pressure drop and pump power consumption of the conventional collector are about 4.1 times higher than those of the new collector. The designing of V-corrugated absorber can improve the collector optical and thermal efficiency, and reduce the pressure drop and pump power consumption significantly, but exerts little effect on the exergy efficiency. Notwithstanding so, the performance improvement potential of the V-corrugated absorber is huge and the designing and manufacturing of the collector can be further developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aenergy use and consumption 3aexergy 3aheat transfer 3aliquids 3amanufacturing 3amass flow 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3athermal stability 0aFlat plate solar collector 0aV-corrugated absorber 0aMulti-channels 0aOverall efficiency 0aPump power consumption1 aYou, Shijun1 aGao, Xinlei1 aZhang, Huan1 aLi, Bojia1 aZheng, Wandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3747-32021 aSun, Leizhai1 aZhou, Tingting0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 184 p.235-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100003000171245012800201300001400329520094100343592002801284650004401312650001501356650002501371650001801396650004301414650000701457650001401464650003301478650002501511650002701536650004401563650003101607650001701638650003101655650003101686650003501717650002501752653001301777653001501790653003101805653001401836700001401850700002901864773009801893856008701991852000902078655001202087IND50069075220221119030916.0190402e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006907522DNAL7 a240018092pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterhouse, Geoffrey I.N.10aStability of canola oil encapsulated by co-extrusion technology: Effect of quercetin addition to alginate shell or oil core  ap. 27-38.  aThis study examines the co-extrusion encapsulation of canola oil by alginate, with an antioxidant (quercetin) incorporated either in the oil core or alginate shell. Optical and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed spherical beads of diameter ∼350μm and wall thickness ∼65μm. Bead appearance, size, wall thickness and surface characteristics did not change appreciably after treatments at pH 3 for 2h, pH 6.5 for 2h or pH 6.5 for 1min then pH 3 for 2h, although the amounts of phenolics released from beads differed depending on the conditions. The quercetin addition approach strongly influenced the stability of canola oil during storage at 20 and 38°C. Quercetin in the core more effectively suppressed oil deterioration. Quercetin in shell caused a higher phenolic content after storage. FTIR and HPLC analyses were used to track changes in the chemical composition of the encapsulated oil beads during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acanola oil 3achemical composition 3aencapsulation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apH 3aquercetin 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxchemistry 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Storage 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistry 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aQuercetinxchemistry 0aAlginate 0aCanola oil 0aCo-extrusion encapsulation 0aQuercetin1 aWang, Wei1 aSun-Waterhouse, Dongxiao0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 142 p.27-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245018200155300001600337500001900353520192100372592002802293650001302321650002502334650002202359650002402381650001002405650001202415650002502427650001402452650002302466650002102489650001302510650001502523650001302538650001602551650001202567653002902579653001102608653002502619653001202644700001902656700002002675700002502695700002002720773011402740856007102854852000902925655001202934IND60731945120221119104405.0210326s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073194512DNAL7 a10.1071/AN202652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Mingyan10aEffects of phytase supplementation on growth performance, plasma biochemistry, bone mineralisation and phosphorus utilisation in pre-lay pullets fed various levels of phosphorus  ap. 568-576.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContext Reducing the environmental impact of animal production is becoming a really hot topic, especially with raised concerns over excessive flows of nitrogen and phosphorus (P) to the environment. Aims The present study was conducted to determine the effects of phytase supplementation on growth, plasma biochemistry, bone mineralisation and P utilisation of pre-lay pullets fed varying levels of non-phytate P. Methods A total of 240 Lohmann pullet chicks were randomly allocated to one of six dietary treatments with eight replicate cages (5 birds per cage) per treatment. Six treatments included three phytase-free diets and three diets supplemented with 1000 U/kg phytase; the non-phytate P levels were 2.75–2.50–2.25, 3.75–3.50–3.25 and 4.75–4.50–4.25 g/kg in the former, and 1.75–1.50–1.25, 2.75–2.50–2.25 and 3.75–3.50–3.25 g/kg in the latter, for the age of 0–4, 4–8 and 8–16 weeks respectively. Key results No significant differences were found for growth performance, plasma biochemistry (calcium, P, alkaline phosphatase and albumin) and bone mineralisation among dietary treatments, but P retention (%) was different (P < 0.001). Analysis of planned contrasts showed that phytase supplementation increased phytate P retention (P < 0.001), and improving the utilisation of phytate P tended most efficiently under low P conditions. Total P retention rate was reduced slightly by phytase supplementation (P < 0.05). Conclusions The results indicated that dietary non-phytate P level could possibly be reduced to 1.75, 1.50 and 1.25 g/kg for 0–4, 4–8 and 8–16 weeks of age respectively after phytase supplementation, without compromising pullet growth and performance during the pre-laying period. Implications The results of this study will contribute to decreasing P excretion by poultry and reducing the potential environmental impact with land application of manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal production 3abone mineralization 3acages 3acalcium 3aenvironmental impact 3aexcretion 3agrowth performance 3aland application 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3apullets 0acharacteristics of bones 0agrowth 0aphosphorus retention 0aphytase1 aZhao, Shusheng1 aRogiewicz, Anna1 aSlominski, Bogdan A.1 aHouse, James D.0 tAnimal production science.g2021, v. 61, no. 6 p.568-576dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN202653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011300162500001900275520128300294592002801577650001901605650002801624650001601652650001901668650001701687650002201704650002201726650001001748650001501758650001001773651001001783700002501793700002401818700002101842773013201863856007701995852000902072655001202081IND60711873720221121181018.0200928e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071187372DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci70301132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibani, Anisa 10aHoney as a Source of Environmental DNA for the Detection and Monitoring of Honey Bee Pathogens and Parasites  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) has been proposed as a powerful tool to detect and monitor cryptic, elusive, or invasive organisms. We recently demonstrated that honey constitutes an easily accessible source of eDNA. In this study, we extracted DNA from 102 honey samples (74 from Italy and 28 from 17 other countries of all continents) and tested the presence of DNA of nine honey bee pathogens and parasites (Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Ascosphaera apis,Lotmaria passim, Acarapis woodi, Varroa destructor, and Tropilaelaps spp.) using qualitative PCR assays. All honey samples contained DNA from V. destructor, confirming the widespread diffusion of this mite. None of the samples gave positive amplifications for N. apis, A. woodi, and Tropilaelaps spp. M. plutonius was detected in 87% of the samples, whereas the other pathogens were detected in 43% to 57% of all samples. The frequency of Italian samples positive for P. larvae was significantly lower (49%) than in all other countries (79%). The co-occurrence of positive samples for L. passim and A. apis with N. ceranae was significant. This study demonstrated that honey eDNA can be useful to establish monitoring tools to evaluate the sanitary status of honey bee populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcarapis woodi 3aMelissococcus plutonius 3aNosema apis 3aNosema ceranae 3aTropilaelaps 3aVarroa destructor 3aenvironmental DNA 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3amites 3aItaly1 aUtzeri, Valerio  Joe1 aTaurisano, Valeria 1 aFontanesi, Luca 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci70301133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01457naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011500155300001800270520032000288592002800608650002700636650002300663650001000686650001400696650001500710700002100725700002200746700002400768700002000792700001800812700002600830700002200856773013400878856007401012852000901086655001201095IND60659881920221119071142.0190823e20130725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065988192DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc42954g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei12aA facile “bottom-up” approach to prepare free-standing nano-films based on manganese coordination clusters  ap. 7400-7402.  aWe present herein a novel method to prepare free-standing Dried Foam Films (DFFs) whereby individual polynuclear manganese complexes cover quantitatively the holes of micro-grids; the fabricated, homogeneous films have a cross-sectional thickness of only ca. 5 nm and are characterised by high mechanical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3afoams 3amanganese 3ananosheets1 aOnet, Camelia I.1 aClérac, Rodolphe1 aRouzières, Mathieu1 aMarzec, Bartosz1 aBoese, Markus1 aVenkatesan, Munuswamy1 aSchmitt, Wolfgang0 tChemical communications.g2013 July 25, v. 49, no. 67 p.7400-7402dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc42954g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015300167520145600320592002801776650002201804650001201826650002101838650001501859650001701874650001301891650001201904650001801916650001401934650002101948700001901969773012601988856008502114852000902199655001202208IND60780946620221121215505.0220623e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078094662DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80605232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jiwon 10aPreharvest Spraying of CaCl2 Alleviates the Scape Bending of Gerbera ‘Harmony’ Flowers by Strengthening the Pectin Crosslinks through Ca2+ Bonds  aScape bending is the primary cause shortening the vase life of cut gerbera flowers (Gerbera jamesonii ‘Harmony’). A previous study showed that this bending is closely related to the scape hardness, which is attributed to cell wall rigidity maintained by calcium ion bonds. In this experiment, the developing gerbera scape was sprayed with 0.5 and 1% calcium chloride to determine whether exogenous calcium directly influences scape hardness and whether it is related to pectin crosslinks. The calcium spray hardened the scape by 12% and efficiently reduced bending, thereby prolonging the vase life of the cut gerbera flowers. A 9% increase in calcium ions (Ca²⁺) was detected in the CaCl₂-treated flowers compared to the control flowers. Additionally, the pectin content increased by up to 14% in the CaCl₂-treated flowers as compared to that in the control. Pectins are the main polysaccharides of cell walls that impact plant tissue integrity and rigidity, with calcium ions acting as bonds for pectin crosslinking. Calcium treatment efficiently increased the content of total pectin in the cell walls and slowed the conversion of insoluble pectin (IP) to water-soluble pectin (WSP) during vase life. The results suggest that exogenously applied calcium increases the Ca²⁺ in cellular tissue and affects the pectin levels, which may aid in increasing the scape hardness by strengthening the calcium–pectin combination in cell walls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGerbera jamesonii 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acell walls 3acrosslinking 3ahardness 3apectins 3aplant tissues 3avase life 3awater solubility1 aKim, Wan-Soon,0 tHorticulturae.g2022 June 15, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80605233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014100166300001600307520088700323592002801210650000901238650001801247650001601265650001501281651001001296700002001306773011001326856008101436852000901517655001201526IND60569574820221117192046.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056957482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-016-0356-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErto, Pasquale10aBest unbiased graphical estimators of location-scale distribution parameters: application to the Pozzuoli’s bradyseism earthquake data  ap. 605-621.  aGraphical techniques are recommended for critical applications because they allow for visual analysis and helpful understanding of the results, also for non-statisticians. However, “graphical” estimation methods are often criticized because they are less efficient with respect to “analytical” methods. This paper proposes a new general graphical method that leads to the best linear unbiased estimators of location-scale distribution parameters. Therefore, the reputation of graphical methods is raised and their strategic use is encouraged. An applicative example analyzes the earthquake magnitudes registered during the serious 1983–1984 bradyseismic crisis in Campi Flegrei, Italy. This graphical analysis will certainly work as a strategic reference picture to which the data, arising from the further bradyseismic crises expected in the next future, can be compared.  aPublisher supplied data 3abias 3adata analysis 3aearthquakes 3astatistics 3aItaly1 aLepore, Antonio0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2016 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.605-621dSpringer USx1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-016-0356-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245016900166300002000335520104800355592002801403650002101431650001501452650000901467650001401476650001301490650001801503650001401521650001101535650003701546700001901583700002201602773013401624856007801758852000901836655001201845IND60556055220221117201555.0161031e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055605522DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b081242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBentley, Cameron
L.10aTime-Resolved Detection of Surface Oxide Formation at Individual Gold Nanoparticles: Role in Electrocatalysis and New Approach for Sizing by Electrochemical Impacts  ap. 12755-12758.  aNanoparticle (NP) impacts on electrode surfaces has become an important method for analyzing the properties and activity of individual NPs, by either (i) electrocatalytic reactions or (ii) volumetric (dissolution) analyses. Using Au NPs as an exemplar system, this contribution shows that it is possible to detect surface oxide formation at individual NPs, which can occur on a rapid time scale (few μs). The charge associated with this “surface oxidation method” can be used for sizing (with results that are comparable to TEM) despite charges of only fC being measured. This platform further allows the role of surface oxides in electrocatalysis to be elucidated, with the time scale of oxide formation being controllable (i.e., “tunable”) via the applied potential, as illustrated through studies of borohydride and hydrazine electro-oxidation. Finally, all of these studies are carried out on an oxide-covered Au substrate, which can be prepared and regenerated straightforwardly on an Au electrode, through the applied potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrazine 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKang, Minkyung1 aUnwin, Patrick R.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Oct. 05, v. 138, no. 39 p.12755-12758dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b081243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024003500145040001800180100001500198245011500213300001400328520175400342592002802096650002102124650001502145650001202160650001102172650001202183650001502195650001402210650001402224650001702238650001902255650001202274650002402286650002402310650002002334650001302354650001002367650002402377650002102401650001302422650000902435650001302444653001202457653001202469653001202481653001202493700001602505773011402521852000902635856008102644655001202725IND4370458520221121130227.0181204e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437045852DNAL7 a157031262pmid7 a10.1258/00236770528865922doi4 a0023-6772(20050101)39:1L.68;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurn, C.C.10aAbsorbencies of six different rodent beddings: commercially advertised absorbencies are potentially misleading  ap. 68-74.  aMoisture absorbency is one of the most important characteristics of rodent beddings for controlling bacterial growth and ammonia production. However, bedding manufacturers rarely provide information on the absorbencies of available materials, and even when they do, absorption values are usually expressed per unit mass of bedding. Since beddings are usually placed into cages to reach a required depth rather than a particular mass, their volumetric absorbencies are far more relevant. This study therefore compared the saline absorbencies of sawdust, aspen woodchips, two virgin loose pulp beddings (Alpha-Dri™ and Omega-Dri™), reclaimed wood pulp (Tek-Fresh™), and corncob, calculated both by volume and by mass. Absorbency per unit volume correlated positively with bedding density, while absorbency per unit mass correlated negatively. Therefore, the relative absorbencies of the beddings were almost completely reversed depending on how absorbency was calculated. By volume, corncob was the most absorbent bedding, absorbing about twice as much saline as Tek-Fresh, the least absorbent bedding. Conversely, when calculated by mass, Tek-Fresh appeared to absorb almost three times as much saline as the corncob. Thus, in practical terms the most absorbent bedding here was corncob, followed by the loose pulp beddings; and this is generally supported by their relatively low ammonia production as seen in previous studies. Many factors other than absorbency determine whether a material is suitable as a rodent bedding, and they are briefly mentioned here. However, manufacturers should provide details of bedding absorbencies in terms of volume, in order to help predict the relative absorbencies of the beddings in practical situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3alitter (bedding) 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3avolume 3asawdust 3awood chips 3awood pulp 3acorn cobs 2aAdvertising. 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aChemistry, Physical 2aHousing, Animal 2aIndustry 2aPaper 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aProduct Labeling 2aRodentia 2aWood 2aZea mays 0aBEDDING 0aAMMONIA 0aRODENTS 0aHYGIENE1 aMason, G.J.0 tLaboratory animals.g2005 Jan. 01, v. 39, no. 1 p.68-74dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/00236770528865923Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03017naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010500165300001800270500001900288520143300307536012401740592002801864596001701892650001501909650001501924650002001939650001501959650002901974650001702003650001402020650001102034650002002045650001502065650001602080650002302096650001802119650001502137653001402152653002502166653001202191700001302203700001902216700001902235700001402254700001702268773012002285856008502405852000902490655001202499IND60734628720221120024611.0210421e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073462872DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2019.16757752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Meng10aSynthesis and phosphate adsorption behaviour of Mg/Al-pillared montmorillonite loaded with La(OH)₃  ap. 1652-1668.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMagnesium/aluminum-pillared montmorillonite loaded with lanthanum hydroxide (Mg/Al-MMT-La(OH)₃) was synthesized using non-toxic raw materials by ion-exchange and co-precipitation for phosphate removal from wastewater. Some adsorbents were fabricated in different molar ratios of Mg to Al, analyzed using various characterizations, and investigated in batch adsorption experiments. The determined adsorption kinetics of the 1:4 Mg/Al-MMT-La(OH)₃ composite fitted well with the Elovich model. In addition, the Langmuir model revealed the high adsorption efficiency of phosphate by the adsorbent with a maximum adsorption capacity of 79.33 mg/g. The negative value of ΔG° and positive value of ΔH° (64.25 kJ/mol) demonstrated that phosphate adsorption onto 1:4 Mg/Al-MMT-La(OH)₃ was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Moreover, when the molar ratio of to was 1:5, the phosphate adsorption capacity reduced by 53.5%, far exceeding the effect of , , Cl⁻, and . The addition of Al³⁺ caused a sharp decline in phosphate removal property by 81.9% when /Al³⁺ molar ratio was 1:5, however, the presence of other cations showed the negligible impact on it. The adsorption mechanism primarily involved ion exchange with intercalated anions and surface coordination with loaded hydroxides. Results proved that 1:4 Mg/Al-MMT-La(OH)₃ material has a favourable application potential in the surface water remediation.  aThe authors acknowledge the financial support by the National Nature Science Foundation, China [grant number 51878051].  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 51878051 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoprecipitation 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental technology 3aion exchange 3alanthanum 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3aphosphates 3aremediation 3asorption isotherms 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aPhosphate 0aMg/Al mixed solution 0aLa(OH)31 aGao, Ran1 aWang, Yingying1 aWang, Shengrui1 aYun, Ying1 aDou, Junfeng0 tEnvironmental technology.g2021 May 12, v. 42, no. 11 p.1652-1668dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2019.16757753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003000171245011400201300001600315520084700331592002801178650001901206650001601225650002001241650001801261650002101279650002001300650001101320650001501331650002301346650002701369650001501396650001301411650004301424650003101467650001701498650003401515650001101549650004301560650005001603650004001653650004201693700001801735700001801753700002201771773009901793856005501892852000901947655001201956IND4488250320221120042700.0120718e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448825032DNAL7 a224985772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.00997.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoraes‐Vieira, P.

Leptin, an adipose tissue‐derived adipokine, displays a variety of immune and physiological functions, and participates in several immune responses. Here, we review the current literature on the role of leptin in kidney diseases, linking adipose tissue and the immune system with kidney‐related disorders.

In the company, both in the supply of goods in the form of raw materials, as well as in the supply of goods in the form of the final product to the consumer. PT XYZ obtain supplies of dried tobacco (chopped Madura) of the local name tobacco collectors as known as bandol. The queues were quite long and bandol experiencing frequent obscurity of time to be served during the waiting time shortage and obscurity. This has an impact on the cost and time to bandol. Therefore, this research aims are (1) to obtain a supply of tobacco queuing system (2) to obtain a proper queuing system in the supply of tobacco (3) to obtain a minimal cost to the queuing system in the supply of tobacco. Data analysis was performed according to the queuing models in the PT XYZ. The results of the study are (1) queuing systems in the form PT XYZ path queuing system with a multiple channel, the waiting time to be served short enough that 0.003minutes, the average time of 2.877minutes in the system, the queue length 0.0006 unit of transportation service is equivalent to one unit of transportation, long queues in the system are 0.605 units of transportation that equal to 21units of transportation (2) the actual occurrence of a long queue outside the queuing system, because the transportation carrying tobacco wants to earn their turn to enter the warehouse and immediately served (3) minimal costs for bandol incurred amounted to Rp 450,000.00 for one unit of transportation (pick up) that it brought 2 workers. Minimal costs incurred amounted to Rp 700,000.00 for other unit of transportation (truck) that it brought two workers to the difference in labour and rental costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3alabor 3amodels 3araw materials 3atobacco 3atransportation 0aqueuing system 0asupply 0atobacco1 aProbowati, Banun Diyah1 aSri Hastuti,0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 3 p.255-261dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245021500173300001600388520106300404592002801467650001001495650002401505650001101529650001201540650002601552650001401578650001901592650002201611650001501633650001301648650001201661650002301673650001101696650001501707650001401722650001501736653005301751653002901804653004901833653002801882653002101910700001401931700002901945700001701974700002201991700002702013773012002040856008702160852000902247655001202256IND60613577920221123043651.0200621e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061357792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohutskyi, Pavlo10aSynergistic co-digestion of wastewater grown algae-bacteria polyculture biomass and cellulose to optimize carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and application of kinetic models to predict anaerobic digestion energy balance  ap. 210-220.  aThis study investigated enhancing methane production from algal-bacteria biomass by adjusting the C/N ratio through co-digestion with a nitrogen-poor co-substrate – cellulose. A biomethane potential test was used to determine cumulative biogas and methane production for pure and co-digested substrates. Four kinetic models were evaluated for their accuracy describing experimental data. These models were used to estimate the total energy output and net energy ratio (NER) for a scaled AD system. Increasing the algal C/N ratio from 5.7 to 20–30 (optimal algae:cellulose feedstock ratios of 35%:65% and 20%:80%) improved the ultimate methane yield by >10% and the first ten days production by >100%. The modified Gompertz kinetic model demonstrated highest accuracy, predicting that co-digestion improved methane production by reducing the time-lag by ∼50% and increasing rate by ∼35%. The synergistic effects increase the AD system energy efficiency and NER by 30–45%, suggesting potential for substantial enhancements from co-digestion at scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acellulose 3aenergy balance 3aenergy efficiency 3afeedstocks 3akinetics 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3aprediction 3asynergism 3awastewater 0aSynergistic co-digestion of algae with cellulose 0aCarbon to nitrogen ratio 0aBiogas and methane production kinetic models 0aDigester energy balance 0aNet energy ratio1 aPhan, Duc1 aKopachevsky, Anatoliy M.1 aChow, Steven1 aBouwer, Edward J.1 aBetenbaugh, Michael J.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Dec., v. 269 p.210-220dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245005600167500001500223520112900238592002801367650001101395650001201406650002101418650002601439650002401465650001701489650002701506650001901533650001901552650001001571700002101581700002201602700002301624700002001647700001901667700002101686773012501707856008301832852000901915655001201924IND60721604220221118201029.0201224e20201126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072160422DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation60401172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeylon, Emma 10aRootlets, a Malting By-Product with Great Potential  agolden set  aBarley rootlets are the most abundant by-product from the malting industry. Due to the inherent association of the malting industry with brewing and distilling industries, it is also considered a by-product of these industries. Barley rootlets are produced during the germination step of malting. These rootlets are a valuable source of nutrition, with protein and fibre holding a large proportion of their composition. Barley rootlets are generally pelletised and used as animal fodder; however, their usage may not be limited to this. Efforts have been made to utilise barley rootlets as food ingredients, sources of enzymes, antioxidants, raw materials in fermentations, and in biochar production. Conversion of this by-product into other/new applications would reduce waste production from their industry origin and reduce some of the impending environmental concerns associated with by-product production. The current review focuses on providing information on the formation, production, and processing of barley rootlets, while also highlighting the composition, quality, and potential applications of barley rootlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abiochar 3abrewing industry 3abyproduct utilization 3adistilling industry 3afermentation 3afood processing wastes 3amalting barley 3apelleted feeds 3aroots1 aArendt, Elke  K.1 aLynch, Kieran  M.1 aZannini, Emanuele 1 aBazzoli, Paolo 1 aMonin, Thomas 1 aSahin, Aylin  W.0 tFermentation.g2020 Nov. 26, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation60401173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006300168520128900231592002801520650001101548650001201559650001901571650002201590650002001612650001401632650001101646650002201657650001401679650002501693650001201718650001601730653002301746653002601769653002301795653002401818700001601842700001601858700002001874773011301894856008602007852000902093655001202102IND60687401220221116181140.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068740122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1212122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Junming10aFuture orientation promotes climate concern and mitigation  aClimate change entails uncertainties in the timing and scale of future impacts, imposing challenges to decision-making with intertemporal trade-offs. When making intertemporal trade-offs, future impacts are often considered distant and discounted in present decision-making and policy design. The future, however, is not only temporally distant but also perceived in culturally and psychologically different ways. Based on national statistics and individual-level survey data, statistical analyses show that both national and individual differences in future orientation affect climate perception and mitigation. At the national level, countries with languages that grammatically highlight the future are associated with higher climate concern, lower carbon emissions and energy use, and more progress in climate mitigation. Individual-level evidence suggests that future orientation helps the public understand complicated climate issues, make more personal mitigation but not necessarily collective action or policy support. The findings indicate the important role that subjective future orientation plays in climate perception and decision-making. Both behavioral intervention and climate communication can be designed based on future orientation to better address climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acollective action 3adecision making 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3alanguages 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3auncertainty 0aFuture orientation 0aFuture time reference 0aClimate perception 0aPersonal mitigation1 aHu, Saiquan1 aWang, Jiali1 aZheng, Xiaoying0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121212-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1212123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245014300158300002000301520123100321592002801552596009801580596008401678596009501762650002101857650002101878650001701899650002001916650001501936650001601951653003701967653001602004653001702020653004002037653002302077700001902100700005602119700005402175700005802229700005602287773014202343856007902485852000902564655001202573IND60789002220221121051839.0220818e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078900222DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c052682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin10aDynamic Compartmentalization of Peptide–Oligonucleotide Conjugates with Reversible Nanovesicle–Microdroplet Phase Transition Behaviors  ap. 36998-37008.  aDeveloping artificial microsystems based on liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to mimic cellular dynamic compartmentalization has gained increasing attention. However, limitations including complicated components and laborious fabrication techniques have hindered their development. Herein, we describe a new single-component dynamic compartmentalization system using peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) produced from short elastin-like polypeptides (sELPs) and oligonucleotides (ONs), which can perform thermoreversible phase transition between a nanovesicle and a microdroplet. The phase transition of sELP–ONs is thoroughly investigated, of which the transition temperature can be controlled by concentration, length of sELPs and ONs, base sequences, and salt. Moreover, the sELP–ON microcompartment can enrich a variety of functional molecules including small molecules, polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Two sELP–ON compartments are used as nano- and microreactors for enzymatic reactions, separately, in which chemical activities are successfully regulated under different-scaled confinement effects, demonstrating their broad potential application in matter exchange and artificial cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a31600802cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020JK2103cEast China Normal Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004106  aNAcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594 3aoligonucleotides 3aphase transition 3apolypeptides 3apolysaccharides 3aseparation 3atemperature 0aliquid−liquid phase separation 0ananovesicle 0amicrodroplet 0apeptide−oligonucleotide conjugate 0aconfinement effect1 aFang, Honglong1 aZhu, Weiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5201-04681 aXu, Yufang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4946-47221 aYang, Yangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9595-02061 aQian, Xuhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6777-06730 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 14, no. 32 p.36998-37008dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c052683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006700170300001600237520064600253592002800899650001500927650001700942650002500959650002500984650001201009650003201021650001701053650001701070653002301087653002201110653001201132653002301144653002101167700001801188700001501206700002901221700003101250700002401281700002901305773012201334856008501456852000901541655001201550IND60638860820221117232234.0190430e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063886082DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.14080952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Phi Hung10aAnti-inflammatory constituents from Psychotria prainii H.

Don) compression woods  ap. 187-198.  aTilted stems of softwoods form compression wood (CW) and opposite wood (OW) on their lower and upper sides, respectively. More is known about the most severe form of CW, severe CW (SCW), but mild CWs (MCWs) also occur widely. Two grades of MCWs, MCW1 and MCW2, as well as SCW and OW were identified in the stems of radiata pine (Pinus radiata) that had been slightly tilted. The four wood types were identified by the distribution of lignin in the tracheid walls determined by fluorescence microscopy. A solution of the fluorescent dye acridine orange (AO) (0.02% at pH 6 or 7) was shown to metachromatically stain the tracheid walls and can also be used to determine lignin distribution. The lignified walls fluoresced orange to yellow depending on the lignin concentration. Microscopically well-characterized discs (0.5 mm diameter) of the wood types were used to determine lignin concentrations and lignin monomer compositions using the acetyl bromide method and thioacidolysis, respectively. Lignin concentration and the proportion of p-hydroxyphenyl units (H-units) relative to guaiacyl (G-units) increased with CW severity, with <1% H-units in OW and up to 14% in SCW. Lignin H-units can be used as a marker for CW and CW severity. Similar discs were also examined by Raman and FTIR micro-spectroscopies coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) to determine if these techniques can be used to differentiate the four different wood types. Both techniques were able to do this, particularly Raman micro-spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPinus radiata 3aacridine orange 3acell walls 3acompression wood 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3alignin 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoftwood 3astems 3athioacidolysis 3atracheids 0aAcridine orange 0aCompression wood 0aFTIR micro-spectroscopy 0aLignin 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) 0aRaman micro-spectroscopy 0aThioacidolysis1 aLapierre, Catherine1 aNouxman, Noor Liyana1 aNieuwoudt, Michel K.1 aSmith, Bronwen G.1 aChavan, Ramesh R.1 aMcArdle, Brian H.1 aHarris, Philip J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1807-80790 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 118 p.187-198dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245007600169500001900245520126100264592002801525650001601553650002401569650001101593650002801604650001001632651001001642700002801652700002501680700003201705700002201737773011901759856007301878852000901951655001201960IND60738958820221120192611.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073895882DNAL7 a10.3390/w131013592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Sánchez, Modesto 10aPATs Behavior in Pressurized Irrigation Hydrants towards Sustainability  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSustainability and efficiency in irrigation are essential in the management of the water–energy–food nexus to reach the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030. In irrigation systems, the reduction of energy consumption is required to improve the system efficiency and consequently the sustainability indicators of the water network. The use of pumps working as turbines (PATs) has been a feasible solution to recover the excess of energy where pressure reduction valves are installed. This research demonstrates the use of PATs under steady and unsteady conditions by analyzing the application in a real irrigation networks located in Vallada (Valencia, Spain). The study shows the possibility of recovering 44 MWh/year using PATs installed upstream of the irrigation hydrants. The real behavior of the PAT operation in a stand-alone recovery energy solution allowed analysis of the flow, head and efficiency variation as a function of the rotational speed, as well as the minimum capacitance to self-excite the generator and the resistive load of the electrical circuit. The PAT limit is examined in terms of the overpressure induced by a fast closure manoeuvre of hydrants, and the runaway conditions due to the disconnection from the electrical load.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectronic circuits 3aenergy 3asustainable development 3awater 3aSpain1 aFernandes, João  F.

One step in the conventional series of treatments—i.e., the removal of proteins—was omitted to bring down the production cost of the nanofibers. The obtained protein–chitin nanofibers had uniform width of approximately 20 nm and a high aspect ratio. These characteristics were similar to conventional chitin nanofibers. The optically transparent protein–chitin nanofiber composite was fabricated with acrylic resin. The nanofibers reinforced the acrylic resin film and thereby increased its mechanical properties. Proteins on the chitin nanofiber surface affected the biomineralization of CaCO₃ in the crab shell. Mineralization of CaCO₃ on the protein–chitin nanofiber was carried out by the gas-diffusion method. Protein molecules on the chitin NFs increased the chances for biomineralization to occur. The protein molecules stabilized the formation of vaterite and inhibited the transformation of vaterite to calcite.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomineralization 3acalcite 3acalcium carbonate 3achitin 3acrab shells 3acrabs 3amechanical methods 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3aproteins 3avaterite1 aUrakami, Takeshi1 aIzawa, Hironori1 aMorimoto, Minoru1 aSaimoto, Hiroyuki0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 27, v. 5, no. 79 p.64196-64201dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12761k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013100167300001300298520153400311592002801845650002501873650002101898650002101919650001001940650001001950650001201960650001101972651001101983651001401994651001802008700002102026700001902047773012602066856007702192852000902269655001202278IND60721608720221120121055.0201224e20201017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072160872DNAL7 a10.3390/fishes50400332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewman, Raymond  M.10aCompetition between Invasive Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) and Native Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) in Experimental Mesocosms  ap. 33-0.  aRuffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) were introduced to North America from Europe in the mid-1980s and based on similar diets and habit use may compete with yellow perch (Perca flavescens). To examine competitive interactions between invasive ruffe and native yellow perch, individually marked perch and ruffe were placed in mesocosms in a small lake. Mesocosms allowed fish to interact and feed on the natural prey populations enclosed. In the first experiment, four treatments were assessed: 28 perch, 14 perch + 14 ruffe, 14 perch, and 7 perch + 7 ruffe. Yellow perch growth was significantly lower in the presence of ruffe (ANOVA, p = 0.005) than in treatments containing only perch. In a second experiment, an increasing density of one species was superimposed upon a constant density of the other in parallel treatment series. Growth rates of both ruffe and perch declined when ruffe density was increased (t test, p = 0.006). However, neither ruffe nor perch growth was affected by increasing perch density. Total stomach content mass of perch was significantly decreased by ruffe in both years (p < 0.02), but no effects of ruffe on the composition of perch diets were observed. Ruffe growth and food consumption was greater than that of perch for both experiments. Ruffe can outcompete yellow perch when both species depend on a limited benthic food resource. Thus there is reason for concern for the ecological effects of ruffe if they expand their range into Lake Erie or North American inland lakes that contain yellow perch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnocephalus cernua 3aPerca flavescens 3afood consumption 3alakes 3aperch 3astomach 3at-test 3aEurope 3aLake Erie 3aNorth America1 aHenson, Fred  G.1 aRichards, Carl0 tFishes.g2020 Oct. 17, v. 5, no. 4 p.33-0dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27137x2410-38887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes50400333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245020200165300001600367520160400383592002801987650001602015650001102031650002202042650001102064650002702075650001902102650001302121650001502134653002302149653001802172653002202190653002002212653001702232700002602249700002002275700002002295773015002315856007702465852000902542655001202551IND60522033420221122003925.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052203342DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-06202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenge, Mathias O.10aStructure and Conformation of Photosynthetic Pigments and Related Compounds 9 On the Structure and Macrocycle Conformation of Two Copper(II) Rhodochlorin Derivatives and Two Related Rhodoporphyrins  ap. 969-981.  aCrystal structure analyses of (rhodochlorinato-15-acetic trimethyl ester)copper(II) 3 and (3¹, 3²-didehydro-rhodochlorinato-15-formic acid trimethyl ester)copper(II) 4 reveal intriguing multiple macrocycle conformations of the metallochlorins in the crystal. The observed conformations range from almost planar macrocycles to distorted macrocycles with individual atoms being displaced up to 0.72 Å from the mean plane. The nonplanar macrocycles show a S₄-ruffled macrocycie distortion with significant distortions for the meso-carbons and tilting of the Cb- Cb axes. A comparison with the related free base porphyrins rhodoporphyrin-15- acetic acid trimethyl ester 5 and rhodoporphyrin dimethyl ester 6 shows that the conformational distortion is due to the mixing of metal and substituent effects, hydroporphyrin character, and packing forces.

Despite numerous recent advances with more reactive diorganozinc and mixed diorganozinc reagents, the generation of all-carbon quaternary centers via the conjugate addition of functionalized monoorganozinc reagents remains a challenge. This protocol details a convenient and mild “one-pot” preparation and copper mediated conjugate addition of functionalized monoorganozinc bromides to cyclic α,β-unsaturated carbonyls to afford a broad scope of all-carbon quaternary centers in generally excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. Key to the development of this technology is the utilization of DMA as a reaction solvent with TMSCl as a Lewis acid. Notable advantages to this methodology include the operational simplicity of the organozinc reagent preparation afforded by the utilization of DMA as a solvent, as well as an efficient conjugate addition mediated by various Cu(I) and Cu(II) salts. Moreover, an intermediate silyl enol ether can be isolated utilizing a modified workup procedure. The substrate scope is limited to cyclic unsaturated ketones, and the conjugate addition is impeded by stabilized (e.g., allyl, enolate, homoenolate) and sterically encumbered (e.g., neopentyl, o-aryl) monoorganozinc reagents. Conjugate additions to five- and seven-membered rings were effective, albeit in lower yields compared with six-membered ring substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrignard reagents 3aLewis acids 3abromides 3achemical bonding 3achemoselectivity 3acopper 3adiastereoselectivity 3aketones 3asilyl enol ethers 3asolvents1 aTownsend, Katherine M.1 aKrout, Michael R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 May 26, , no. 147 p.e59775-e59775dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/597753Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59775/efficient-synthesis-all-carbon-quaternary-centers-via-conjugate  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001600260520071800276592002800994650002601022650001401048650002001062650000901082650002101091650001601112650002501128653002201153653001401175653001201189653002101201653002501222700002001247773012001267856008501387852000901472655001201481IND60535473820221119203605.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.01.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutra, P.

Soilless cultivation is intensively used in protected agriculture to improve control over the growing environment and to avoid uncertainties in the water and nutrient status of the soil. Recently the type of soilless culture transformed from open to close-loop system. This system is known for better result in water use efficiency, while maintaining the quality of the yield. This study aims to describe the specific purpose of soilless culture specifically in close-loop system and how substrate nutrition produces the better quality of the yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3anutrition 3aproduct quality 3asoil 3asoilless culture 3auncertainty 3awater use efficiency 0aclose-loop system 0anutrition 0aquality 0asoilless culture 0awater use efficiency1 aYuliando, Henry0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 3 p.283-288dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.01.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012700153300002000280520097800300592002801278650002301306650001601329650003701345650001301382650001301395650001201408653001801420653000801438653001701446653002701463653001801490700001401508700001701522700001701539700001901556700002201575773012601597856007501723852000901798655001201807IND60527759020221117222412.0160715e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052775902DNAL7 a10.1021/am50511082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Lei10aLithium Hydride Doped Intermediate Connector for High-Efficiency and Long-Term Stable Tandem Organic Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 18228-18232.  aLithium hydride (LiH) is employed as a novel n-dopant in the intermediate connector for tandem organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of its easy coevaporation with other electron transporting materials. The tandem OLEDs with two and three electroluminescent (EL) units connected by a combination of LiH doped 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq₃) and 1,4,5,8,9,11–hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) demonstrate approximately 2-fold and 3-fold enhancement in current efficiency, respectively. In addition, no extra voltage drop across the intermediate connector is observed. Particularly, the lifetime (T₇₅%) in the tandem OLED with two and three EL units is substantially improved by 3.8 times and 7.4 times, respectively. The doping effect of LiH into Alq₃, the charge injection, and transport characteristics of LiH-doped Alq₃ are further investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3ahydrides 3alithium 0an-type dopant 0aLiH 0atandem OLEDs 0aintermediate connector 0along lifetime1 aTang, Xun1 aXu, Mei-Feng1 aShi, Xiao-Bo1 aWang, Zhao-Kui1 aLiao, Liang-Sheng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.18228-18232dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam50511083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01363naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017400163300002200337520025700359592002800616650001900644650002300663650001400686700002100700700002700721700002100748700001700769700002100786700002000807773012700827856007400954852000901028655001201037IND60669496420221118003316.0190920e20151126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949642DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21825j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, Nabyendu10aSynthesis and diverse general oxidative cyclization catalysis of high-valent MoⱽᴵO₂(HL) to ubiquitous heterocycles and their chiral analogues with high selectivity  ap. 101959-101964.  aThe first synthesis and diverse oxidative cyclization catalysis properties of high-valent Moⱽᴵ–triazole are demonstrated towards highly selective construction of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, isoxazolines, isoxazoles and their chiral analogues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazoles 3acatalytic activity 3atriazoles1 aSarkar, Satinath1 aRāẏa, Dīpānvitā,1 aDebnath, Sudipto1 aGhosh, Sukla1 aKhamarui, Saikat1 aMaiti, Dilip K.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 26, v. 5, no. 123 p.101959-101964dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21825j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001600282520132500298592002801623650001001651650002001661650001601681650001301697650001001710650001201720650001001732650001301742651001001755653001801765653001801783653001601801653001301817653001201830700002001842700002001862700002501882773011501907856008502022852000902107655001202116IND60595769020221118003302.0180607e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059576902DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2017.13176712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeschin, Simona10aEcological comparison between duckweeds in central Italy: The invasive Lemna minuta vs the native L. minor  ap. 674-683.  aThe American duckweed Lemna minuta shows an invasive behaviour in Europe, causing weed problems in aquatic habitats there. Few studies addressed this species’ ecological requirements for a suitable establishment in a site. In this paper, L. minuta populations were analysed through field surveys so as (1) to define the autoecology of this duckweed as regards the main environmental factors characterizing invaded habitats, and (2) to identify possible overlaps/differences in ecological requirements between the alien L. minuta and the common native L. minor, with which it is often associated and in direct competition. The occurrence/abundance of the two species and environmental data were collected from 41 wetlands in central Italy. Currently, L. minuta is more common and abundant than L. minor in the study-area, despite its recent arrival there (2007). The two species have a partially overlapped autoecology. However, L. minuta differs from L. minor since it occurs in waters which are less alkaline, slightly less warm, and richer in nitrates. It shows tolerance for environmental conditions which are limiting for most of macrophytes, including L. minor, such as high shading and low water oxygenation. This enables L. minuta to increase its invasion potentiality and thus to enlarge its distribution area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna 3aaquatic habitat 3amacrophytes 3anitrates 3ashade 3asurveys 3aweeds 3awetlands 3aItaly 0aAlien species 0aaquatic plant 0aautoecology 0aduckweed 0awetland1 aAbati, Silverio1 aLeacche, Ilaria1 aZuccarello, Vincenzo0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 July 4, v. 152, no. 4 p.674-683dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2017.13176713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245012600184300001600310500001500326520078300341592002801124650001601152650003001168650001901198650001401217650001001231650002801241650001401269650004301283650003601326650001201362650003301374650001301407650001401420650005901434650004001493650003201533650002301565650004201588650002901630650001001659650003101669650002401700653001301724653000801737653001201745653001801757653001901775700001701794700001701811700001301828700001801841700001601859700001801875700002501893700001801918773011901936856008502055852000902140655001202149IND50067145220221119080002.0190403e20130830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006714522DNAL7 a236930292pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aF18ab Escherichia coli flagella expression is regulated by acyl-homoserine lactone and contributes to bacterial virulence  ap. 378-383.  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate the effect of the Quorum Sensing (QS)–I system on the expression of virulence factors in Shiga toxin producing and verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC and VTEC), the yenI gene from Yersinia enterocolitica was cloned into E. coli F18ab 107/86.

The endangered timber tree species Cedrela fissilis is associated with seasonal forests and occurs throughout South America. We sampled C. fissilis from 56 sites across the species’ range in Brazil and Bolivia and obtained sequence data for nuclear and chloroplast DNA. Most specimens (149 out of 169) exhibited intraindividual polymorphism for the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Cloning and an array of complementary sequence analyses indicated that the multiple copies of ITS were functional paralogs – concerted evolution in C. fissilis appeared to be incomplete. Independent Bayesian analyses using either ITS or cpDNA data revealed two separate phylogenetic lineages within C. fissilis that corresponded to populations located in separate geographic regions. The divergence occurred in the Early Pliocene and Late Miocene. We argue that climate-mediated events triggered dispersal events and split ancestral populations into at least two large refugial areas of seasonal forest that were located to the east and west of the present day Cerrado. Upon recent climate amelioration, formerly isolated lineages reconnected and intraspecific hybridization gave rise to intraindividual polymorphism and incomplete concerted evolution in C. fissilis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrela 3abiological speciation 3acerrado 3achloroplast DNA 3aconcerted evolution 3adeciduous forests 3adivergent evolution 3aforest trees 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahybridization 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asequence analysis 3atropics 2aBayes Theorem 2aCedrelaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aDNA, Concatenatedxgenetics 2aDNA, Intergenicxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxgenetics 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPhylogeny 2aSeasons 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxgenetics 2aTropical Climate 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 0aSouth America1 aSilva, Roberta Santos1 aCarniello, Maria Antonia1 aVeldman, Joseph William1 aRossi, Ana Aparecida Bandini1 aOliveira, Luiz Orlando de,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 61, no. 3 p.639-649dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245007800178300001600256520198700272592002802259650001802287650001502305650001002320650001202330650000902342650001702351650001202368650001702380650002602397650002302423650001502446650001502461650001602476653002602492653001802518653002302536653002302559653001702582700004402599700002902643700002902672700003202701700003202733700003002765700002002795773010402815856008402919852000903003655001203012IND60545844820221118222233.0170606e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054584482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaesse, Camilla Queiroz10aMicronucleus as biomarker of genotoxicity in birds from Brazilian Cerrado  ap. 223-228.  aBirds are considered efficient bioindicators, by their behavioral characteristics, diversified diet, and use of several vegetation layers, including in contaminated environments. The accumulation of contaminants can harm the reproductive process and survival of species, in addition to causing severe metabolic disorders. Air pollution can also affect the birds' health. Micronucleus analysis, a technique able to evaluate the organisms' sensitivity to contaminant agents, has been regarded as a practical tool for evaluating and monitoring the clastogenic and aneugenic effects caused by pollutants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of micronuclei in bird species that use forest environments and their surroundings; and to verify if the frequency and amount of micronuclei varies between species, areas and populations. Birds transiting between the Brazilian Cerrado forest and open formations were analyzed, coming from four forest fragments of Triângulo Mineiro, two close to urban areas and two more distant. Birds were captured with mist-nets for collecting blood extensions, which were used for counting micronuclei. In total, 103 individuals of 21 species were captured, and the micronucleus rate for every 5000 erythrocytes analyzed was 1.30. Only six populations had sampling sufficiency. There was no difference between the number of individuals with and without micronuclei (χ²=3.18, df=1, p=0.08). In areas closer to the urban perimeter, the micronuclei averages in birds were greater compared to the most isolated areas (H=27.534, df=3, p<0,001). In São José, the individuals of Myiothlypis flaveola presented a number of micronuclei significantly greater than the Galheiro and Água Fria (H=9.601, df=2, p=0.008). M. flaveola clearly reflected the area quality. The micronuclei analysis in birds was effective for evaluating the area quality as well as the intensity with which the birds respond to impacts caused by the surrounding matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3abiomarkers 3abirds 3acerrado 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3aforests 3agenotoxicity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ametabolic diseases 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3aurban areas 0aAnthropogenic actions 0aBiomonitoring 0aFarming activities 0aSurrounding matrix 0aErythrocytes1 aTolentino, Vitor Carneiro de Magalhães1 aSilva, Adriano Marcos da1 aSilva, Arthur de Andrade1 aFerreira, Giancarlo Ângelo1 aPaniago, Luís Pedro Mendes1 aNepomuceno, Júlio César1 aMelo, Celine de0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 May, v. 115 p.223-228dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100001300179245009700192300002000289520155500309592002801864596008301892650002601975650002902001650001302030650001702043650001302060650001902073650001102092650003202103650002802135650001802163650001502181650002402196650003102220650001102251650001902262650000902281653002402290653000902314653002402323653002102347653001902368700001302387700001602400700001602416700001602432700001902448700001302467700002002480700001702500700001902517700001402536773014102550856007902691961001302770852000902783655001202792IND60583312020221120204425.0171011e20171011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058331202DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b081522doi7 a10.1021/acsami.7b081522chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Lei10aSilver Nanocluster-Embedded Zein Films as Antimicrobial Coating Materials for Food Packaging  ap. 35297-35304.  aHighly efficient antimicrobial agents with low toxicity and resistance have been enthusiastically pursued to address public concerns on microbial contamination in food. Silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) are known for their ultrasmall sizes and unique optical and chemical properties. Despite extensive studies of AgNCs for biomedical applications, previous research on their application as antimicrobials for food applications is very limited. Here, for the first time, by incorporating AgNCs (∼2 nm in diameter) into zein films that are widely used as food packaging materials, we developed a novel coating material with potent antimicrobial activity, low toxicity to human cells, and low potential to harm the environment. In addition, we systematically evaluated the antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicity of AgNCs-embedded zein films and compared them to zein films embedded with AgNO₃ or Ag nanoparticles with diameters of 10 and 60 nm (AgNP10 and AgNP60, respectively). At equivalent silver concentrations, AgNCs and AgNO₃ solutions exhibited considerably higher antimicrobial activities than those of AgNP10 and AgNP60 solutions. Moreover, AgNCs exhibited less cytotoxicity to human cells than AgNO₃, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 34.68 μg/mL for AgNCs, compared to 9.14 μg/mL for AgNO₃. Overall, the novel AgNCs coating developed in this research has great potential for antimicrobial applications in food packaging materials due to its high antimicrobial efficacy, ultrasmall size, and low cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3acoatings 3acytotoxicity 3adiameter 3afood packaging 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amicrobial contamination 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apackaging materials 3aphysicochemical properties 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3azein 0aSilver nanoclusters 0azein 0aantimicrobial agent 0acoating material 0afood packaging1 aTeng, Zi1 aZhu, Guizhi1 aLiu, Yijing1 aZhang, Fuwu1 aZhang, Jinglin1 aLi, Ying1 aGuan, Yongguang1 aLuo, Yaguang1 aChen, Xianggui1 aWang, Qin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 40 p.35297-35304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:27428x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b081523Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014100165300001200306520237100318592002802689650002502717650002902742650001502771650002202786650001102808650001102819650001602830650001702846650000902863650002102872650001602893650001402909650001102923650002402934650001702958650002202975650001002997700001803007700002203025700002003047700001803067700001803085700002103103700001703124700001903141773011303160856008303273852000903356655001203365IND60712797220221120040051.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071279722DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04179-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Kelly10aEvaluation of oral fluralaner (Bravecto®) for efficacy against nymphs of Amblyomma americanum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato)  ap. 315.  aBACKGROUND: Amblyomma americanum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) nymphs commonly feed on and transmit pathogens to dogs (Canis familiaris). Control of immature and adult tick life stages is necessary to fully protect animals. We evaluated efficacy of oral fluralaner (Bravecto®) against induced infestations with A. americanum and R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs on dogs in two experiments. METHODS: In each experiment, 10 dogs were administered oral fluralaner chewable tablets one time on Day 0 at a targeted minimum dose of 25 mg/kg body weight and 10 dogs remained non-treated controls. Dogs were infested with two groups of 50 A. americanum nymphs and two groups of 50 R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs on Days -1, 6, 28, 56 and 84. At 48 h and 72 h post-infestation, nymphs were collected from dogs, assessed as live or dead, and enumerated into categories defining attachment and engorgement status. Fluralaner efficacy was determined in separate analyses against all live nymphs and against live-fed nymphs, i.e. live nymphs that were attached to dogs at the time of collection and/or were engorged. Fluralaner was considered effective when mean numbers of live ticks were reduced in fluralaner-treated dogs by ≥ 90%. RESULTS: Fluralaner efficacy against all live and live-fed A. americanum nymphs in the first experiment was > 94% on all collection days. Efficacy against all live R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs in the first experiment was > 96% on all collection days excluding the 48 h counts for infestations on Days 28 (83.7%), 56 (82.9%) and 84 (86.7%); efficacy against live-fed R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs was > 95% on all 48 h/72 h count days. Fluralaner efficacy against all live A. americanum nymphs in the second experiment was > 93% on all collection days for 8 weeks excluding the 48 h count for infestation on Day 56 (87.8%); efficacy against live-fed A. americanum nymphs was > 91% on all count days for 8 weeks. Efficacy against all live R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs in the second experiment was > 91% on all 72 h collection days except for infestations on Days 28 (76.8%) and 56 (86.3%); efficacy against live-fed R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs was 100% on all 72 h count days. CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of oral fluralaner to dogs is effective against A. americanum and R. sanguineus (s.l.) nymphs for up to 12 weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aacaricides 3aadministered dose 3aadults 3aazoles 3abody weight 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aefficacy testing 3aengorgement 3aimmatures 3anymphs 3aoral administration 3atick control 3atick infestations 3aticks1 aLittle, Susan1 aPetersen, Melissa1 aGruntmeir, Jeff1 aBarrett, Anne1 aHerrin, Brian1 aStarkey, Lindsay1 aSun, Fangshi1 aGuerino, Frank0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.315-315dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04179-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014400173300001400317520196600331592002802297650002202325650002002347650001202367650001302379650001902392650001902411650000902430650001702439650001402456650001502470650001702485650001402502650001702516650000902533650000902542650001202551650001102563650001402574650001202588650001502600650002502615650001502640650001502655650001302670653003502683653002602718653001302744653002702757653002802784700002102812700002102833700002602854773011802880856008502998852000903083655001203092IND60535474020221122033629.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlámová, Martina10aRelevance of the Historical Catchwork System for Sustainability of the Traditional Agricultural Landscape in the Southern Podpolanie Region  ap. 10-19.  aThe studied agricultural landscape is situated to the south and southeast from the volcanic mass of Polana. Terrain of the sub-mountain area is smoothly denudated because it had been eroded for a long time before the volcanic period. Valleys of the Bystry potok and Riecka streams correspond with tectonic faults. The region was colonized during the 17th century by pastorals and later by peasants. Traditional forms of agriculture have persisted in the landscape till today. Soils are slightly fertile. The area lies on the boundary between slightly warm and cold, very humid climatic zone. Annual rainfall is within the range 700-900mm. But based on a long-term microclimatic measuring, it is shown that the lack of precipitation is in the period of the vegetation growth. Bedrock consists mainly of granodiorite rocks which have low water permeability and weak springs (yield ranging between 0.1– 0.4 l.s-1). Water absorbs rapidly and flows over the surface of granodiorite rocks to the lower horizons. A similar process appears in the sandy-loam weathering mantle, which has locally a depth about 2 m. Therefore, local inhabitants had to build a system of catchworks which can distribute water from alluvial plains to uplands’ slopes. We identified about 3700 m of catchworks in the Riecka water catchment area. A prevailing part of catchworks distributes water from streams and less flows from springs. During the fieldwork we identified wetlands and waterlogged areas which represent potential sites for spreading of valuable biotopes. Further, we evaluated the degree of the catchwork utilization and succession processes on slopes. Catchworks are only partly functional, and the investigated area suffers from a lack of water mostly during summer seasons. We propose revitalization of the catchwork system in the landscape. Integrated management of the catchment also should take into account effects of current climate change on the studied region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalluvial plains 3abedrock 3abiotopes 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acold 3agranodiorite 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3apeasantry 3apermeability 3arain 3asoil 3astreams 3asummer 3atectonics 3avalleys 3avegetation 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3awetlands 0ainsufficiency of precipitation 0ahistorical catchworks 0abiotopes 0asuccessional processes 0asustainable agriculture1 aBeláček, Boris1 aJančura, Peter,1 aPrídavková, Zlatica0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.10-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245004800198300002000246520095100266592002801217596009801245596012101343596008401464596007001548596008501618596006901703650001101772650001401783650001601797650001701813650000901830650001301839650002201852650001801874700002301892700001801915700001801933700002601951700006001977700006202037700006202099700002002161700001902181700006702200773014902267856007702416852000902493655001202502IND60789010920221119004923.0220818e20220802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078901092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c031582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Aoxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2507-019810aDirect H₂O₂ Synthesis, without H₂ Gas  ap. 14548-14554.  aWe report here the direct hydrogenation of O₂ gas to form hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) using a membrane reactor without H₂ gas. Hydrogen is sourced from water, and the reactor is driven by electricity. Hydrogenation chemistry is achieved using a hydrogen-permeable Pd foil that separates an electrolysis chamber that generates reactive H atoms, from a hydrogenation chamber where H atoms react with O₂ to form H₂O₂. Our results show that the concentration of H₂O₂ can be increased ∼8 times (from 56.5 to 443 mg/L) by optimizing the ratio of methanol-to-water in the chemical chamber, and through catalyst design. We demonstrate that the concentration of H₂O₂ is acutely sensitive to the H₂O₂ decomposition rate. This decomposition rate can be minimized by using AuPd alloy catalysts instead of pure Pd. This study presents a new pathway to directly synthesize H₂O₂ using water electrolysis without ever using H₂ gas.  aPublisher supplied data  aBSE-BERL-162173cCanadian Institute for Advanced Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007631  aRGPIN-2018-06748cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  a229288cCanada Foundation for Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000196  aNAcCanada Research Chairsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001804  aNAcCanada First Research Excellence Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010785  aNAcStewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institutedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3afoil 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrogenation1 aDelima, Roxanna S.1 aKim, Yongwook1 aLees, Eric W.1 aParlane, Fraser G.

Hydrogels self-assembled by biologically-based building blocks can be used as promising platforms for incorporation of one or more therapeutic drugs to gain additive or synergistic therapeutic functions. Herein, antitumor combination therapy based on injectable collagen/alginate hydrogels is achieved by simultaneous encapsulation of the photothermal drug methylene blue (MB) and immunological agent imiquimod (R837). The resulting hybrid hydrogel (Gel-MB-R837) with shear-thinning and self-healing properties is applicable for localized delivery and prolonged release of therapeutic drugs. The antitumor efficacy can be significantly enhanced by combinatorial photothermal therapy (PTT) and immunotherapy treatments through the synergy of MB and R837. Moreover, the initial PTT not only eradicates primary tumors, but also generates tumor-associated antigens (TAA), which combines with R837 to trigger immune response for further inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, the biocompatible hybrid hydrogels starting from naturally-occurring biomacromolecules offer promising prospects for combinatorial photothermal and immuno tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aantigens 3acollagen 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ahydrogels 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3ametastasis 3amethylene blue 3aneoplasms 3aphotothermotherapy 0aSelf-assembly 0aCollagen 0aAlginate 0aInjectable hydrogel 0aTumor therapy1 aLi, Shukun1 aSong, Jingwen1 aXing, Ruirui1 aLi, Zhiming1 aYan, Xuehai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0890-03400 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 577 p.570-575dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001900168245010100187300001400288520184100302592002802143650001202171650001102183650001802194650000902212650001402221650002502235650001402260650002502274650001202299650001302311650001202324650001602336650001202352650001802364650007002382650003302452650002502485650002702510650002802537650001402565650002702579650002502606700002102631773010802652856008302760852000902843655001202852IND60082769220221120215200.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008276922DNAL7 a215961452pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenz, Brett W.10aMolecular phylogenetics, vocalizations, and species limits in Celeus woodpeckers (Aves: Picidae)  ap. 29-44.  aSpecies limits and the evolutionary mechanisms that have shaped diversification of woodpeckers and allies (Picidae) remain obscure, as inter and intraspecific phylogenetic relationships have yet to be comprehensively resolved for most genera. Herein, we analyzed 5020 base pairs of nucleotide sequence data from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Celeus woodpeckers. Broad geographic sampling was employed to assess species limits in phenotypically variable lineages and provide a first look at the evolution of song and plumage traits in this poorly known Neotropical genus. Our results strongly support the monophyly of Celeus and reveal several novel relationships across a shallow phylogenetic topology. We confirm the close sister relationship between Celeus spectabilis and the enigmatic Celeus obrieni, both of which form a clade with Celeus flavus. The Mesoamerican Celeus castaneus was placed as sister to a Celeus undatus–grammicus lineage, with the species status of the latter drawn into question given the lack of substantial genetic, morphological, and vocal variation in these taxa. We recovered paraphyly in Celeus elegans; however, this result appears to be the consequence of mitochondrial introgression from Celeus lugubris considering the monophyly of elegans at the ß-FIBI7 locus. A second instance of paraphyly was observed in Celeus flavescens with deep genetic splits and substantial phenotypic variation indicating the presence of two distinct species in this broadly distributed lineage. As such, we advocate elevation of Celeus flavescens ochraceus to species status. Our analysis of Celeus vocalizations and plumage characters demonstrates a pattern of lability consistent with a relatively recent origin of the genus and potentially rapid speciation history.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicidae 3agenome 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 3aparaphyly 3aphenotypic variation 3aplumage 3atopology 3atropics 3awoodpeckers 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBirdsxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aVocalization, Animal1 aRobbins, Mark B.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Oct., v. 61, no. 1 p.29-44dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245013300213300001200346520095200358592002801310650001501338650001501353650002201368650001801390650001601408650001601424653003001440653002201470653002701492653003401519653002601553773008601579856008501665852000901750655001201759IND60584805320221120192235.0180830e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058480532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzad-Farsani, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3804-046510aLoss minimization in distribution systems based on LMP calculation using honey bee mating optimization and point estimate method  ap. 1-9.  aLocational marginal price (LMP) calculation at distributed generation (DG) busses is an effective way for optimal operation of DG units. The aim of this study is presenting a new LMP formulation which includes distribution loss minimization. A Meta-heuristic modified honey bee mating optimization (MHBMO) algorithm is used to obtain optimal values of LMP and power factor of DG units so that the loss of network is minimized, and the benefit of DG units is maximized. Furthermore, a stochastic power flow based on the point estimate method (PEM) is located in MHBMO algorithm to capture uncertainty in the market price and load demand. The proposed policy is applied to a realistic distribution system for the various market prices at substation buses. The results of this study prove the accuracy and efficiency of the new method over the previous methods in terms of the DG units' benefit, loss minimization, and state estimation of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahoney bees 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3amethodology 3auncertainty 0aLocational marginal price 0aLoss minimization 0aDistributed generation 0aHoney bee mating optimization 0aPoint estimate method0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 140 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003100141245008300172520080500255592002801060650003501088650001301123650001301136650002501149650001701174651001301191700002401204700002201228700002201250773011601272856007501388852000901463655001201472IND60649758820221119210102.0190706e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064975882DNAL7 a10.3390/land70200672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurevtseren, Myagmartseren14aThe Fractal Geometry of Urban Land Use: The Case of Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia  aThis research summarizes land use and city expansion, as well as the dynamics of urbanization, over recent years in Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of these beach closures on the incidence of abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) along four beaches located on the northern coast of Pernambuco, Brazil. The absolute and relative frequency of occurrence and the number of observations per unit of effort (OPUE) between the periods before and after the prohibition period were analyzed. A total of 1935 fishing gear residues were found (63% before and 37% after prohibition). There was also a significant reduction in OPUE and in absolute frequency (p < 0.05) between these two periods. Although beach closures appear to have contributed to a reduction in the amount of ALDFG in the region, it does not indicate a complete pause in fishing activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acoasts 3amarine pollution 3apandemic 3atraditional technology 3aBrazil 0aCOVID-19 0aArtisanal fishery 0aGhost fishing 0aFishing debris1 aGomes, Gabriella1 aFreitas, Sindy1 aDias, Victor1 aSilva, Bruno1 aViana, Danielle1 aWinger, Paul D.1 aHazin, Fábio1 aOliveira, Paulo0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Apr., v. 177 p.113470-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1134703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100001900190245008800209300001600297506007600313520156000389592002801949506003701977650001002014650002002024650001002044650001002054650001302064650002602077650001402103650001402117650001402131650001802145650001202163650002002175650001802195650002702213650003302240650002502273650002502298650001402323650001502337650002502352650001402377650002902391650003402420650002402454650002702478651001102505651001102516651001002527700001902537700002302556773011002579856008302689852000902772655001202781IND60082776520221207062108.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008277652DNAL7 a217983572pmid7 aPMC31753092pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenbaum, Eli10aMolecular systematics of the Middle American genus Hypopachus (Anura: Microhylidae)  ap. 265-277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present the first phylogenetic study on the widespread Middle American microhylid frog genus Hypopachus. Partial sequences of mitochondrial (12S and 16S ribosomal RNA) and nuclear (rhodopsin) genes (1275bp total) were analyzed from 43 samples of Hypopachus, three currently recognized species of Gastrophryne, and seven arthroleptid, brevicipitid and microhylid outgroup taxa. Maximum parsimony (PAUP), maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes) optimality criteria were used for phylogenetic analyses, and BEAST was used to estimate divergence dates of major clades. Population-level analyses were conducted with the programs NETWORK and Arlequin. Results confirm the placement of Hypopachus and Gastrophryne as sister taxa, but the latter genus was strongly supported as paraphyletic. The African phrynomerine genus Phrynomantis was recovered as the sister taxon to a monophyletic Chiasmocleis, rendering our well-supported clade of gastrophrynines paraphyletic. Hypopachus barberi was supported as a disjunctly distributed highland species, and we recovered a basal split in lowland populations of Hypopachus variolosus from the Pacific versant of Mexico and elsewhere in the Mesoamerican lowlands. Dating analyses from BEAST estimate speciation within the genus Hypopachus occurred in the late Miocene/early Pliocene for most clades. Previous studies have not found bioacoustic or morphological differences among these lowland clades, and our molecular data support the continued recognition of two species in the genus Hypopachus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnura 3aBayesian theory 3afrogs 3agenes 3alowlands 3amolecular systematics 3amonophyly 3aparaphyly 3arhodopsin 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aAnuraxgenetics 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aHaplotypes 2aLikelihood Functions 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRhodopsinxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aTexas1 aSmith, Eric N.1 aDe Sá, Rafael O.,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Nov., v. 61, no. 2 p.265-277dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008500168300001400253520132500267592002801592650002501620650001701645650001501662650001301677650001701690650001701707650002201724650002201746650001701768650001301785650001201798651001101810653003501821653002701856653003601883700002001919773011801939856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60535474220221120225208.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAspe, Chantal10aAgricultural Irrigation Canals in Southern France and New Urban Territorial Uses  ap. 29-39.  aAgricultural irrigation canals are widespread across southern France, where they cover a large portion of the Provençal region. While they are still extensively used in productive farming, part of the irrigated area is gradually being taken over by peri-urban habitat and business and industrial parks. As a result, some parts of the canal network have now been abandoned, either built over or turned into dumping grounds for refuse and waste. Ignorance about the usefulness of these canals and the role they play in draining has led to frequent flooding after severe Mediterranean storms.But these canals are also the backdrop for rapidly developing urban uses and practices. For one, the water is increasingly used to irrigate private gardens, municipal green spaces and golf courses. On a recreational level, the canals have become a site for numerous practices in recent years: walking, jogging, cycling, horseback riding, fishing, as well as swimming and kayaking.Our paper is based on findings from sociological research into the new urban uses of agricultural canals in southern France. First we will point up the diverse nature and complexity of their management. Then we will address their long-term and sustainable maintenance by examining the different options that exist for their governance into the future  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3agolf courses 3agovernance 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3ahorse riding 3airrigated farming 3airrigation canals 3asolid wastes 3aswimming 3awalking 3aFrance 0aAgricultural irrigation canals 0anew urban leisure uses 0aculture and nature interactions1 aJacqué, Marie,0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.29-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011300165500001900278520160100297592002801898650001101926650001801937650003001955650001301985650001401998650001902012650001102031650001102042651001002053653002002063653001802083653001002101653002802111653003102139700001402170700001802184700002302202700001202225773011002237856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60716116020221122030505.0210212e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071611602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Shuai10aSpatiotemporal variation and distribution characteristics of crop residue burning in China from 2001 to 2018  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we integrated a remote-sensing fire product (MOD14A1) and land-use product (MCD12Q1) to extract the number of crop-residue burning (CRB) spots and the fire radiative power (FRP) in China from 2001 to 2018. Moreover, we conducted three trend analyses and two geographic distribution analyses to quantify the interannual variations and summarize the spatial characteristics of CRB on grid (0.25° × 0.25°) and regional scales. The results indicated that CRB presents distinctive seasonal patterns with each sub-region. All trend analyses suggested that the annual number of CRB spots in China increased significantly from 2001 to 2018; the linear trend reached 2615 spots/year, the Theil-Sen slope was slightly lower at 2557 spots/year, and the Mann-Kendal τ was 0.75. By dividing the study period into two sub-periods, we found that the five sub-regions presented different trends in the first and second sub-periods; e.g., the Theil-Sen slope of eastern China in the first sub-period (2001–2009) was 1021 spots/year but was −1599 spots/year in the second period (2010–2018). This suggests that summer CRB has been effectively mitigated in eastern China since 2010. Further, the average FRP of CRB spots presented a decreasing trend from 27.5 MW/spot in 2001 to only 15.8 MW/spot in 2018; this may be attributable to more scattered CRB rather than aggregated CRB. Collectively, the fire spots, FRP, and average FRP indicated that spring, summer, and autumn CRB had dropped dramatically over previous levels by 2018 due to strict mitigation measures by local governments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acrop residues 3ageographical distribution 3aland use 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3asummer 3aChina 0aBiomass burning 0aMedian center 0aMODIS 0aPrecipitation anomalies 0aStandard deviation ellipse1 aGuo, Meng1 aWang, Xiufeng1 aYamamoto, Haruhiko1 aOu, Wei0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115849-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015800169300001600327520215800343592002802501650001402529650002402543650001402567650002302581650002402604650002002628650001402648650001902662650001602681653002802697653003002725653003702755653003002792653001602822653002202838700003102860773010102891856008502992852000903077655001203086IND60549700820221120112301.0190412e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054970082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadhu, Susmita10aUncertainty and predictability in population dynamics of a bitrophic ecological model: Mixed-mode oscillations, bistability and sensitivity to parameters  ap. 196-208.  aWe consider a two-trophic ecological model comprising of two predators competing for their common prey. We cast the model into the framework of a singular perturbed system of equations in one fast variable (prey population density) and two slow variables (predator population densities), mimicking the common observation that the per-capita productivity rate decreases from bottom to top along the trophic levels in Nature. We assume that both predators exhibit Holling II functional response with one of the predators (territorial) having a density dependent mortality rate. Depending on the system parameters, the model exhibits small, intermediate and/or large fluctuations in the population densities. The large fluctuations correspond to periodic population outbreaks followed by collapses (commonly known as cycles of “boom and bust”). The small fluctuations arise due to a singular Hopf bifurcation in the system, and are ecologically more desirable. However, more interestingly, the system exhibits mixed-mode oscillations (which are concatenations of the large amplitude oscillations and the small amplitude oscillations) that indicate the adaptability of the species to prolong the time gap between successive cycles of boom and bust. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the system to initial conditions (chaos and bistability of limit cycles are observed) as well as to the system parameters (here we only show the sensitivity to the density dependent mortality rate of the territorial predator). This model throws light at the uncertainties in long term behaviors that are associated with a real ecological system. We show that even very small changes in the system parameters due to natural or human-induced causes can lead to a complete different ecological phenomenon, thus affecting the predictability of the density of the prey population. In this paper, we explain the mechanisms behind the irregular fluctuations in the population sizes in an attempt to understand the dynamics occurring in a natural population and also comment on the inherent uncertainties associated with the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3amortality 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apredators 3atrophic levels 3auncertainty 0aMixed-mode oscillations 0aSingular Hopf bifurcation 0aPopulation outbreaks and crashes 0aSensitivity to parameters 0aBistability 0aHysteresis effect1 aChakraborty Thakur, Saikat0 tEcological complexity.g2017 Dec., v. 32 p.196-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002300168245022000191300001600411520172800427592002802155650000802183650001702191650001002208650001002218650001202228650001602240650001902256650002502275650001302300650004202313650001802355650002502373650002602398650001402424650003602438700002902474700002102503700002202524700002202546700002402568773011002592856008302702961000902785852000902794655001202803IND60082763820221123021537.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008276382DNAL7 a214439562pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeavitt, Steven D.10aComplex patterns of speciation in cosmopolitan “rock posy” lichens – Discovering and delimiting cryptic fungal species in the lichen-forming Rhizoplaca melanophthalma species-complex (Lecanoraceae, Ascomycota)  ap. 587-602.  aA growing body of evidence indicates that in some cases morphology-based species circumscription of lichenized fungi misrepresents the number of existing species. The cosmopolitan “rock posy” lichen (Rhizoplaca melanophthalma) species-complex includes a number of morphologically distinct species that are both geographically and ecologically widespread, providing a model system to evaluate speciation in lichen-forming ascomycetes. In this study, we assembled multiple lines of evidence from nuclear DNA sequence data, morphology, and biochemistry for species delimitation in the R. melanophthalma species-complex. We identify a total of ten candidate species in this study, four of which were previously recognized as distinct taxa and six previously unrecognized lineages found within what has been thus far considered a single species. Candidate species are supported using inferences from multiple empirical operational criteria. Multiple instances of sympatry support the view that these lineages merit recognition as distinct taxa. Generally, we found little corroboration between morphological and chemical characters, and previously unidentified lineages were morphologically polymorphic. However, secondary metabolite data supported one cryptic saxicolous lineage, characterized by orsellinic-derived gyrophoric and lecanoric acids, which we consider to be taxonomically significant. Our study of the R. melanophthalma species-complex indicates that the genus Rhizoplaca, as presently circumscribed, is more diverse in western North American than originally perceived, and we present our analyses as a working example of species delimitation in morphologically cryptic and recently diverged lichenized fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLecanoraceae 3aacids 3afungi 3alichens 3ametabolites 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3asympatry 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBayes Theorem 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aLichensxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics1 aFankhauser, Johnathon D.1 aLeavitt, Dean H.1 aPorter, Lyndon D.1 aJohnson, Leigh A.1 aSt. Clair, Larry L.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.587-602dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245010300212300001600315520154400331592002801875650001501903650002201918650001601940650001301956650002901969650001901998650002202017650001902039650001802058650001102076650002502087650001802112653002002130653001602150653002102166653000802187653002802195700002302223700001902246773010702265856008702372852000902459655001202468IND60647528120221117163213.0200210e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064752812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhaduri, Bhaskar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2266-453210aInteractions of organic dye with Ag- and Ce-nano-assemblies: Influence of dissolved organic matter  ap. 683-694.  aRapid industrialization leads to the introduction of dyes and nanoparticles (NPs) into the environment posing threats to water quality and aquatic organisms. The highly reactive NPs are known to interact with dyes to form stable NPs-dye complexes. Herein, we report the adsorptive interactions of two inorganic NPs, Ag-Ag₂S and CeO₂ with cationic methylene blue. Experiments were also performed with NPs coated with 2 types of dissolved organic matter. The maximal adsorption capacities for methylene blue with Ag-Ag₂S and CeO₂ were calculated to be 16.64 and 5.35 mg g⁻¹, respectively. The obtained adsorption capacities are attributed to electrostatic interactions (attractive/repulsive) between the NPs and the dyes and also the van der Waals force of interaction between the dye molecules. DOM coatings on the NPs significantly reduced the adsorption of dyes (maximum adsorption capacities for methylene blue with DOM coated Ag-Ag₂S and CeO₂ were reduced by ˜40% and ˜61%, respectively; the more hydrophobic DOM coating on the NPs resulted in reduction of adsorption capacity by ˜54 and ˜70%, respectively). Our results suggest that the DOM coatings alter the arrangements of the NPs in the dye solution, creating the active surface sites less accessible for adsorption. Furthermore, the reduction of the adsorption efficiency for the NPs toward dyes with simultaneously addition of DOM is probably due to blockage of the active surface sites by the DOM molecules and the competition between the dye and the DOM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic organisms 3aceric oxide 3acoatings 3adissolved organic matter 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrialization 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3asilver 3avan der Waals forces 3awater quality 0aNano adsorbents 0aDOM coating 0aCharacterization 0aDye 0aAdsorptive interactions1 aPolubesova, Tamara1 aChefetz, Benny0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 577 p.683-694dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002300191245007000214500001900284506007600303506003100379520164000410592002802050596002402078506003702102650001502139650001502154650001602169650003002185650001202215650001902227650002202246650001202268650001202280650001002292650001602302650001402318651001302332651002602345653000902371653001302380653000902393700002002402773011602422856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60734571720221207084016.0210518e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073457172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1191622chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1191622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTormanen, Aaron P.10aResponses of bat-prey to prescribed burns and mechanical thinning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aInsects are an important aspect of forest and woodland ecosystems due to their role as prey for vertebrate species. Our research investigated the relationship between insects and forest management practices in the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas. We looked at the differences in biomass, abundance, and diversity of insects in 30 treatment stands with varying burn frequencies. Twelve of these stands were burned and mechanically thinned, 12 were only burned, and 6 were untreated. The burn frequencies of these stands range from being burned 0–4 times from 2007 to 2018. We deployed blacklight traps in each of the stands every month from mid-March to mid-November in 2019 to assess nocturnal bat prey. Over 30,070 insects were collected, with Lepidoptera being the most abundant order. Insects were dried, weighed, and identified for diversity metrics. We used multi-model selection and AICc to find the top models from a series of linear mixed effects models to determine the best forest management strategies for bat prey. Total nocturnal, aerial insect biomass, Lepidoptera biomass, and Macroheterocera abundance was lower in thinned stands. However, it is unclear if it is the removal of Lepidoptera tree hosts or changes to bat foraging activity that drove this relationship. Stands burned at high frequencies had a higher abundance of Coleoptera. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis was not supported with regards to Lepidoptera diversity and burn frequency. Burning at high frequencies (4 times per 12 years) and not thinning may be the best strategy for maximizing nocturnal Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Forest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChiroptera 3aColeoptera 3aLepidoptera 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3aforest ecology 3aforest management 3aforests 3ainsects 3atrees 3avertebrates 3awoodlands 3aArkansas 3aOzark National Forest 0aFire 0aThinning 0aBats1 aGarrie, Jorista0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 01, v. 491 p.119162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1191623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245004400199300002000243520103000263592002801293650001201321650001101333650001101344650001401355650002301369700001901392700001301411700001901424700001401443700005301457700001201510700001701522700001401539700001601553700001601569700002101585700001701606773013801623856008001761852000901841655001201850IND60649681920221123000637.0190705e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064968192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b039032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Keliu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0021-500710aNanoconfinement Effect on n-Alkane Flow  ap. 16456-16461.  aNanoconfinement induces change of microscopic structures of n-alkanes, which, in turn, alters their dynamics. We study a fundamental question of nanoscale n-alkane flow through in-depth theoretical analysis of relating microscopic structures to macroscopic dynamic properties. We show that the velocity profile and corresponding flux are governed by the interfacial resistance from first-layer n-alkanes near a nanopore wall and the viscous resistance from other n-alkanes in nanopores. We find that n-alkane flow through nanopores is a function of nanopore wall energy, nanopore diameter, and n-alkane properties, which allows a wide range of enhancement factors, spanning over 4 orders of magnitude reported in the literature, to be quantitatively rationalized. Most importantly, we demonstrate that there is huge potential in manipulating n-alkane flow by tuning nanopore wall composition and nanopore size. We propose a theoretical framework of modeling the flow of macromolecule fluids beyond n-alkanes at the nanoscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aenergy 3amodels 3ananopores 3aphysical chemistry1 aChen, Zhangxin1 aLi, Jing1 aLei, Zhengdong1 aXu, Jinze1 aWang, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9442-53491 aLi, Ran1 aDong, Xiaohu1 aPeng, Yan1 aYang, Sheng1 aZhang, Feng1 aChen, Zhongliang1 aGao, Yanling0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 11, v. 123, no. 26 p.16456-16461dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b039033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009400157300001600251500002000267520156000287592002801847650002001875650001801895650001601913650002301929650002501952650001701977650001001994650001802004650001302022650002902035650002602064650001402090700001902104700001502123700001102138700001602149700001802165700001602183700001602199700001402215700001802229700001602247700001202263700001702275700001802292700001602310700001302326700001702339773009802356856007302454852000902527655001202536IND60571449120221117231050.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057144912DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.143732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Minghui10aGLANDULAR TRICHOME‐SPECIFIC WRKY 1 promotes artemisinin biosynthesis in Artemisia annua  ap. 304-316.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArtemisinin is a type of sesquiterpene lactone well known as an antimalarial drug, and is specifically produced in glandular trichomes of Artemisia annua. However, the regulatory network for the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway remains poorly understood. Exploration of trichome‐specific transcription factors would facilitate the elucidation of regulatory mechanism of artemisinin biosynthesis. The WRKY transcription factor GLANDULAR TRICHOME‐SPECIFIC WRKY 1 (AaGSW1) was cloned and analysed in A. annua. AaGSW1 exhibited similar expression patterns to the trichome‐specific genes of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway and AP2/ERF transcription factor AaORA. A β‐glucuronidase (GUS) staining assay further demonstrated that AaGSW1 is a glandular trichome‐specific transcription factor. AaGSW1 positively regulates CYP71AV1 and AaORA expression by directly binding to the W‐box motifs in their promoters. Overexpression of AaGSW1 in A. annua significantly improves artemisinin and dihydroartemisinic acid contents; moreover, AaGSW1 can be directly regulated by AaMYC2 and AabZIP1, which are positive regulators of jasmonate (JA)‐ and abscisic acid (ABA)‐mediated artemisinin biosynthetic pathways, respectively. These results demonstrate that AaGSW1 is a glandular trichome‐specific WRKY transcription factor and a positive regulator in the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, we propose that two trifurcate feed‐forward pathways involving AaGSW1, CYP71AV1 and AaMYC2/AabZIP1 function in the JA/ABA response in A. annua.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aabscisic acid 3aartemisinin 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3ajasmonic acid 3astaining 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atrichomes1 aYan, Tingxiang1 aShen, Qian1 aLu, Xu1 aPan, Qifang1 aHuang, Youran1 aTang, Yueli1 aFu, Xueqing1 aLiu, Meng1 aJiang, Weimin1 aLv, Zongyou1 aShi, Pu1 aMa, Ya‐nan1 aHao, Xiaolong1 aZhang, Lida1 aLi, Ling1 aTang, Kexuan0 tnew phytologist.g2017 Apr., v. 214, no. 1 p.304-316dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.143733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245013000203300001200333506007600345520158500421592002802006596007502034506003702109650001602146650002302162650001602185650001402201650001102215650001002226650002102236650001702257650002402274650002402298650001002322650001102332650001502343650002102358650002602379650003302405650001102438700001802449700001602467700001702483700001402500700001902514700001402533700001802547700001502565773010502580856008202685852000902767655001202776IND60635335420221207092853.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063533542DNAL7 a309222322pmid7 aPMC64400192pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-1688-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Lijiao14aThe WRKY transcription factor GhWRKY27 coordinates the senescence regulatory pathway in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  ap. 116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Premature senescence can reduce the yield and quality of crops. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play important roles during leaf senescence, but little is known about their ageing mechanisms in cotton. RESULTS: In this study, a group III WRKY TF, GhWRKY27, was isolated and characterized. The expression of GhWRKY27 was induced by leaf senescence and was higher in an early-ageing cotton variety than in a non-early-ageing cotton variety. Overexpression of GhWRKY27 in Arabidopsis promoted leaf senescence, as determined by reduced chlorophyll content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that GhWRKY27 interacted with an MYB TF, GhTT2. Putative target genes of GhWRKY27 were identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that GhWRKY27 binds directly to the promoters of cytochrome P450 94C1 (GhCYP94C1) and ripening-related protein 2 (GhRipen2–2). In addition, the expression patterns of GhTT2, GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2–2 were identified during leaf senescence. Transient dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that GhWRKY27 could activate the expression of GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2–2. CONCLUSIONS: Our work lays the foundation for further study of the functional roles of WRKY genes during leaf senescence in cotton. In addition, our data provide new insights into the senescence-associated mechanisms of WRKY genes in cotton.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YED0101006cNational Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3achlorophyll 3achromatin 3acotton 3acrops 3acytochrome P-450 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aluciferase 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription factors 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3ayeasts1 aDou, Lingling1 aGuo, Yaning1 aWang, Hantao1 aLi, Libei1 aWang, Congcong1 aMa, Liang1 aWei, Hengling1 aYu, Shuxun0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.116-116dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1688-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245016100164300001400325520177900339592002802118650001602146650001802162650001202180650001102192650002302203650002602226650002502252650001102277650001302288650000702301650000802308650001502316650002302331650002302354650002502377650002202402650001002424700002002434700001702454773010402471856007302575852000902648655001202657IND60478957320221122064931.0160116e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047895732DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.123462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyle, Richard K.

Understanding the physiological mechanisms regulating these responses is important in sustainable irrigation scheduling. Glasshouse‐grown, containerized Pelargonium × hortorum BullsEye plants were irrigated either daily at various fractions of plant evapotranspiration (100, 75 and 50% ET) for 20 days or irrigation was withheld for 4 days. Xylem sap was collected and gₛ and Ψₗₑₐf were measured on days 15 and 20, and on days 16–19 for the respective treatments. Xylem sap pH and NO₃ ⁻ and Ca²⁺ concentrations did not differ between irrigation treatments. Xylem abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations ([ABA]ₓyₗ) increased within 24 h of irrigation being withheld whilst gₛ and Ψₗₑₐf decreased. Supplying irrigation at a fraction of daily ET produced a similar relationship between [ABA]ₓyₗ and gₛ, but did not change Ψₗₑₐf. Treatment differences occurred independently of whether Ψₗₑₐf was measured in whole leaves with a pressure chamber, or in the lamina with a thermocouple psychrometer. Plants that were irrigated daily showed lower [ABA]ₓyₗ than plants from which irrigation was withheld, even at comparable soil moisture content. This implies that regular re‐watering attenuates ABA signaling due to maintenance of soil moisture in the upper soil levels. Crucially, detached leaves supplied with synthetic ABA showed a similar relationship between [ABA]ₓyₗ and gₛ as intact plants, suggesting that stomatal closure of P. hortorum in response to soil water deficit is primarily an ABA‐induced response, independent of changes in Ψₗₑₐf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelargonium 3aabscisic acid 3acalcium 3adrying 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3anitrates 3apH 3asap 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water deficit 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3axylem1 aMcAinsh, Martin1 aDodd, Ian C.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2016 Jan., v. 156, no. 1 p.84-96dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.123463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245009300198506007600291520122600367592002801593506003701621650002001658650002101678650001701699650001101716650002601727650001501753650001101768650001901779650003301798650001301831650001901844700002601863700002101889773012201910856007402032852000902106655001202115IND60650740320221207095514.0190710e20190325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065074032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110306972doi7 aPMC64705262pmcid7 a309345442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepa, Julia 10aAre the Motives for Food Choices Different in Orthorexia Nervosa and Healthy Orthorexia?  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent research points to the bidimensional nature of orthorexia, with one dimension related to interest in healthy eating (healthy orthorexia) and another dimension related to a pathological preoccupation with eating healthily (orthorexia nervosa). Research was needed to provide further support for this differentiation. We examined the food-choice motives related to both aspects of orthorexia. Participants were 460 students from a Spanish university who completed the Teruel Orthorexia Scale and the Food Choice Questionnaire. By means of structural equation modeling, we analyzed the relationship between orthorexia, food-choice motives, gender, body mass index, and age. The motives predicting food choices in orthorexia nervosa and healthy orthorexia were quite different. In the case of orthorexia nervosa, the main motive was weight control, with sensorial appeal and affect regulation also showing significant associations. For healthy orthorexia, the main motive was health content, with sensorial appeal and price also showing significant associations. This supports the hypothesis that orthorexia nervosa is associated with maladaptive eating behavior motived more by weight control than by health concerns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aeating disorders 3afood choices 3agender 3ahealthy eating habits 3aprediction 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3astructural equation modeling 3astudents 3aweight control1 aBarrada, Juan  Ramón1 aRoncero, María,0 tNutrients.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110306973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011400166300001400280520096000294592002801254650002101282650001501303650001901318650002501337650001401362650001501376650001501391653000801406653001701414653000901431653000901440653000701449653000801456653000801464653000801472653000801480653000701488653000901495653000801504653000801512653001501520653000801535653002501543653001501568653001901583653003001602653001701632700002801649700002401677773010301701856008401804852000901888655001201897IND60545851520221122212959.0160903e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054585152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeerts, Roy10aAccurate assessment of the biodegradation of cationic surfactants in activated sludge reactors (OECD TG 303A)  ap. 83-89.  aThe continuous-fed activated sludge test (OECD TG 303A) was used to predict the removal of cationic surfactants from wastewater in activated sludge plants. However, a method to differentiate between adsorption and biodegradation is not provided in these guidelines. Assessment of removal by biodegradation was possible with analysis of the surfactant present in mixed liquid suspended solids in combination with a simple equation. This equation was derived from the mass balance of the activated sludge unit in steady state. The removal by biodegradation of decylamine, tetradecylamine, octadecylamine, dioctadecylmethylamine and dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride that have different capacities to adsorb was >99.9%, >99.9%, 98.2%, 94.2%, and 69.0%, respectively.

MP recovered were analysed for size, morphology, colour, and polymer type. The study results indicated that the GI tract and gills of individual fishes had 6.6 ± 1.7 and 6.2 ± 1.7 items, respectively. The microplastics having a size of <100 μm consisting of beads were found to be most predominant. Black and blue were the most present colours of microplastic in the tissues. Among the different studied months, a higher number of MP incidence was observed in the post monsoon period. There is no significant correlation observed between the microplastic numbers in gills and guts tissue. The present study shows that there is a potential risk of microplastic bioaccumulation in the fish body and subsequent risk to the consumers and organisms sharing the food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJohnius 3abioaccumulation 3acolor 3ademersal fish 3adigestive tract 3afood chain 3agastrointestinal system 3amarine pollution 3amicroplastics 3amonsoon season 3arisk 3aArabian Sea 3aIndia 0aGastrointestinal tract 0aGills1 aGurjar, Udai Ram1 aRamteke, Karan Kumar1 aShenoy, Latha1 aNayak, Binaya Bhusan1 aBhushan, Shasi1 aGeethalakshmi, Vaidhyanathan1 aXavier, Martin0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Mar., v. 176 p.113473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1134733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010700167300001600274520097500290592002801265650004401293650002201337650001301359650003701372650001201409650004401421650001901465650001501484650003301499650002301532650002101555650002201576650002101598650001401619650002601633650003701659650001201696653000801708653000901716653001801725653001701743653001201760700001701772700001701789773010701806856008701913852000902000655001202009IND60647528520221120022236.0200210e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064752852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunli10aPreparation and characterization of polyester fabrics coated with TiO2/Benzotriazole for UV protection  ap. 695-701.  aIn this paper, organic ultraviolet absorber 2-hydroxy-4-(3-methacrylate-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzotriazole (BTMA) was synthesized, and characterized by ¹H NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet spectroscopy.

The synthesized BTMA and TiO₂ nanosol were mixed to form an organic/inorganic hybrid and coated onto polyester (PET) fabrics. The coated PET fabrics were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis. Thermal stability, UV protective property, washing stability, and tensile strength of the coated PET fabrics were measured. The coated PET fabrics showed excellent UV protection properties and stability toward washing.

On the other hand, it was recently demonstrated that IR radiation promotes formation of the so-called exclusion zones (EZ) at the interfaces between hydrophilic surfaces and water. EZ-water properties differ significantly from that of bulk water. It was studied for the first time whether treatment of water with humid air irradiated with IR-C band could change its physical-chemical properties, making it EZ-water-like. Humid air irradiated with IR was called coherent humidity (CoHu). Redox potential and surface tension decreased in deionized water and mineral water samples that were treated with CoHu, while dielectric constant increased in such water samples. After such treatment of carbonate or phosphate buffers, their buffer capacity against acidification and leaching significantly increased. No such changes were observed in water samples treated with non-irradiated humid air. Thus, after treatment of tested aqueous systems with humid air exposed to IR radiation, their properties change, making them more like EZ-water. The results suggest that IR irradiation of humid air converts it into a carrier of a certain physical signal that affects water properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aair 3abuffering capacity 3acarbonates 3adielectric properties 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3ainfrared radiation 3airradiation 3amineral water 3aphosphates 3aredox potential 3asurface tension 3awater vapor1 aVoeikov, Vladimir 1 aBuravleva, Ekaterina 1 aTrofimov, Aleksei 1 aNovikov, Kirill 0 tWater.g2021 May 14, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131013703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010200161300001800263500002000281520158900301592002801890650001101918650002101929650001801950650001901968650002401987650002102011650003402032650001102066650002002077650001502097650001202112700005702124773012502181856007902306852000902385655001202394IND60596402420221119185635.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059640242DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.141392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoz, Ziynet10aPermeable Gas Cavity at Elevated Pressure Enhances Modified Atmosphere Packaging of Fresh Produce  ap. 1639-1649.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aModified atmosphere packaging (MAP) of fresh produce involves exploiting package properties to satisfy respiration activity of produce. While effective, package material properties are not infinitely adjustable to match needs of all products. Additional ways of providing favorable in‐package gaseous environments are needed. This work explores the use of permeable inserts filled with gas at elevated pressures as a means to achieve in‐package gaseous atmospheres that may not be possible by the package alone. Mathematical models were developed to predict transient package atmospheres for packages containing respiring produce and pressurized permeable inserts. The model was validated for semirigid tray packages containing grape tomatoes and Granny Smith apples. With inserts initially pressurized with oxygen at approximately 200 to 300 kPa (about 30 to 45 psi), about 2 weeks additional shelf life was observed relative to controls for both tomatoes and apples in test packages. Additionally, simulations provide design guidance for pressurized inserts for the case of very high respiration rate produce such as spinach. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This work promises to expand application of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Currently, applications are limited by gas transfer material properties of existing packaging films. However, packaging offers other important functions that may not be well served by materials that satisfy critical gas permeation requirements. This work demonstrates an approach that disconnects packaging material specifications from MAP design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acell respiration 3afresh produce 3agrape tomatoes 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxygen 3apackaging films 3ashelf life 3aspinach1 aWelt, Bruce A.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0248-88340 tJournal of food science.g2018 June, v. 83, no. 6 p.1639-1649dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.141393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014300172300001600315520137500331592002801706650000801734650001401742650002001756650001701776650001101793650002101804650001501825653003301840653003201873653001401905653000801919700002001927700005601947773010702003856008702110852000902197655001202206IND60647528720221122010129.0200210e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064752872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, J.P.10aApplication of population balance equations and interaction models in CFD simulation of the bubble distribution in dissolved air flotation  ap. 723-732.  aThis study concerns the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and population balance equations (PBEs) in biphasic (water-air) simulations of the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process. The incorporation of population balance equations for simulation of the microbubble diameter distribution was based on the literature. The gas phase was simulated as being composed of two different phases: air₁ (d < 50 μm) and air₂ (d ≥ 50 μm). A non-homogeneous discrete model was applied and specific models enabled the prediction of phase change by breakage or coalescence. The models Turbulent and Luo were used to represent coalescence. The grid convergence index (GCI) method was applied for quantification of the discretization error of the tested computational grids. The grid selected for the simulations showed a discretization error of 5.17%. The results indicated that the velocity vectors of the aqueous phase presented stratified horizontal flow characteristics close to the surface and vertical plug flow inside the tank. The PBE results for the air volumetric fraction demonstrated that the coalescence model had a major impact in terms of the behavior of the gas phase in the white zone. Simulations indicated that the Luo model reduced in about 60% the air₁ concentration in the positions evaluated when compared with Turbulent model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aequations 3afluid mechanics 3amicrobubbles 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aprediction 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aPopulation balance equation 0aFlotation 0aDAF1 aBatista, J.N.M.1 aBéttega, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5647-53850 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 577 p.723-732dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245008200153300002000235520132800255592002801583650001601611650002801627650002301655650001701678650002201695650001401717650001801731650001801749650003301767653002701800653001501827653002001842653001401862653001801876700002301894700002701917700001101944700001901955700003601974773012602010856007502136852000902211655001202220IND60527759120170710000000.0160715e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052775912DNAL7 a10.1021/am505143h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yuan10aSelf-Assembly of Diblock Copolymer–Maghemite Nanoparticle Hybrid Thin Films  ap. 18152-18162.  aThe arrangement of maghemite (γ-Fe₂O₃) nanoparticles (NPs) in poly(styrene-d8-block-n-butyl methacrylate) P(Sd-b-BMA) diblock copolymer (DBC) films via a self-assembly process was investigated toward the fabrication of highly ordered maghemite–polymer hybrid thin films. The resulting thin films exhibited a perforated lamella with an enrichment layer containing NPs as investigated with X-ray reflectometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and time-of-flight grazing incidence small angle neutron scattering as a function of the NP concentrations. The NPs were selectively deposited in the PSd domains of the DBC during the microphase separation process. At low NP concentrations, the incorporation of the NPs within the DBC thin films resulted in an enhanced microphase separation process and formation of highly oriented and ordered nanostructured hybrid films. At higher NP concentrations, the aggregation of the NPs was dominating and large sized metal oxide clusters were observed. The superparamagnetic properties of the metal oxide–polymer hybrid films at various NP concentrations were probed by a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, which shows that the hybrid films are highly attractive for optical devices, magnetic sensors, and magnetic recording devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomposite polymers 3aferric oxide 3afilms (materials) 3amaghemite 3ananoparticles 3areflectometry 3ascanning electron microscopy 0amaghemite nanoparticle 0aTOF-GISANS 0ablock copolymer 0athin film 0aself-assembly1 aMetwalli, Ezzeldin1 aMoulin, Jean-François1 aSu, Bo1 aOpel, Matthias1 aMüller-Buschbaum, P.q(Peter),0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.18152-18162dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam505143h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009100172300001600263520136400279592002801643596012001671596009601791650001601887650001901903650002101922650001901943650002301962650001201985650001501997650001502012650001802027650001402045650002102059650001002080650001002090650001702100651002102117653001602138653002902154653001602183653002102199653001902220700001702239700001902256773011402275856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60595775520221118004713.0180607e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059577552DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2018.14355812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTüredi, Mustafa10aSeed screening of three pine species for glyphosate sensitivity for forest restoration  ap. 502-507.  aAustrian black pine (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) are commonly used in restoration practices in the Mediterranean base including Turkey. Direct seeding can secure desired level of tree establishment and survival on degraded sites wherever, favorable safe sites are scattered throughout the landscape. Glyphosate is a commonly used herbicide for weed control in forest, nursery and restoration sites worldwide, due to its broad-spectrum efficacy and considerably less toxicity on the environment compared to other chemicals. The present study screened the glyphosate phytotoxicity of three dominant pine species in Turkey during a seed germination trial, after seeds had been presoaked in 15 different dose-glyphosate solutions varying between 0 and 5%, v:v. Glyphosate applications damaged seed germination speed more than cumulative germination rate. As a systemic herbicide, glyphosate appeared highly phytotoxic to Austrian black pine. Scots pine showed an intermediate glyphosate phytotoxicity. Maritime pine was the least sensitive species, tolerating glyphosate at ≤1% doses. In conclusion, glyphosate may be used at low doses on restoration sites seeded with maritime pine while it is not recommended to be used on degraded sites seeded with Austrian black pine and Scots pine.  aPublisher supplied data  a(BAP-2015.02.02.399)cFundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Rio Grande do Nortedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005670  aBAP-2015.02.02.399cthe Scientific Research Project (BAP) Coordination of Düzce University 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus pinaster 3aPinus sylvestris 3adirect seeding 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3aglyphosate 3alandscapes 3aphytotoxicity 3ascreening 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3atrees 3aweed control 3aTurkey (country) 0aGermination 0aglyphosate phytotoxicity 0aPinus nigra 0aPinus sylvestris 0aPinus pinaster1 aEşen, Derya1 aÇetin, Bilal,0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 May 4, v. 152, no. 3 p.502-507dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2018.14355813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012400168300001600292520149800308592002801806650002601834650002101860650001301881650000901894650002201903650001301925650001001938650001001948650001101958650002501969650003701994650001402031650001002045650001002055650001702065651001002082653002602092653001202118653001002130653001302140653001502153653000902168700001402177700001702191700001702208700001502225700001702240700001402257700002102271700001502292700002002307700001802327700001902345773011502364856008202479852000902561655001202570IND60557215020221120091913.0180830e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055721502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Isfaqul10aMolecular characteristics of Clostridium difficile isolates from human and animals in the North Eastern region of India  ap. 306-311.  aA total of 1034 samples were collected from different sources and C. difficile was isolated from 18 (9.04%) of 199 human, 9 (4.89%) of 184 cattle, 29 (12.44%) of 233 pig, and from 23 (13.94%) of 165 poultry samples. Variations were observed on the rate of isolation according to age and clinical conditions (diarrhoea). None of the samples from cow, sheep, goat, local chicken, and wild animals yielded any C. difficile. Out of those isolates, 8, 2, 19 and 6 isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry, respectively were toxigenic. The toxigenic isolates carried both tcdA, and tcdB (A⁺B⁺) and most of the human and the pig isolates were also positive for binary toxin genes (cdtA and cdtB). The A⁺B⁺ isolates belonged to three different toxinotypes (0, VI and XXXIII). Human and pig A⁺B⁺ isolates belonged to three (045, 126 and ACD 019) and four (046, 087, 126 and ACD 011) different ribotypes, respectively and the ribotypes of two cattle isolates were 014 and ACD 010. Six A⁺B⁺ avian isolates belonged to six different ribotypes (014, 087, SLO 134, SLO 160, ACD 012, ACD 014). The non-toxigenic isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry were grouped into 7, 4, 4 and 7 different ribotypes, respectively. PFGE analysis could not differentiate similar ribotypes/toxinotypes of toxigenic isolates. All the toxigenic isolates showed cytopathic effect on Vero and Hela cell monolayers at 1:100 dilutions of cell-free culture supernatants within 18–20 h of inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3acell free system 3achickens 3acows 3acytopathogenicity 3adiarrhea 3agenes 3agoats 3ahumans 3anontoxigenic strains 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aribotypes 3asheep 3aswine 3awild animals 3aIndia 0aClostridium difficile 0aAnimals 0aHuman 0aRibotype 0aToxinotype 0aPFGE1 aBorah, P.1 aSharma, R.K.1 aRajkhowa, S.1 aRupnik, M.1 aSaikia, D.P.1 aHasin, D.1 aHussain, Iftikar1 aDeka, N.K.1 aBarkalita, L.M.1 aNishikawa, Y.1 aRamamurthy, T.0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2016 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.306-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245017200158300001800330520202700348592002802375650002402403650001402427650002302441650001302464650001502477650001302492650001502505650001902520700003002539700002602569700006202595773014702657856007702804852000902881655001202890IND60607914420221121073419.0181020e20180724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060791442DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b047792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kaka10aEnergy Landscape in Supramolecular Coassembly of Platinum(II) Complexes and Polymers: Morphological Diversity, Transformation, and Dilution Stability of Nanostructures  ap. 9594-9605.  aEstablishment of energy landscape has emerged as an efficient pathway for improved understanding and manipulation of both thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of complicated supramolecular systems. Herein, we report the establishment of energy landscapes of supramolecular coassembly of platinum(II) complexes and polymers, as well as the fabrication of nanostructures with enhanced complexity and intriguing properties from the coassembly systems. In the energy landscape, coassembly at room temperature has been found to only allow the longitudinal growth of platinum(II) complexes and block copolymers into core–shell nanofibers that are the kinetically trapped products. Thermal annealing can switch on the transverse growth of platinum(II) complexes and block copolymers to produce core–shell nanobelts that are the thermodynamically stable nanostructures. The extents of the transverse growth are found to increase with thermal annealing temperatures, leading to nanobelts with larger widths. Besides, rapid quenching of a hot coassembly mixture to room temperature can capture intermediate nanobelt-block-nanofiber nanostructures that are metastable and capable of converting to nanobelts upon further incubation at room temperature. Moreover, sonication treatment has been found to couple with the energy landscape of the coassembly system and open a unique energy-driven pathway to activate the kinetically forbidden nanofiber-to-nanobelt morphological transformation. Furthermore, based on the established energy landscapes, nanosphere-block-nanobelt nanostructures with distinct segmented architectures have been fabricated by thermal annealing of the ternary mixture of platinum(II) complexes, block copolymers, and polymer brushes in a one-pot and single-step procedure. Finally, the nanobelts and nanosphere-block-nanobelt nanostructures are found to possess intriguing morphological stability against acid and dilution, exhibiting characteristics that are important for promising biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3acomposite polymers 3akinetics 3ananofibers 3aplatinum 3asonication 3athermodynamics1 aYeung, Margaret Ching-Lam1 aLeung, Sammual Yu-Lut1 aYam, Vivian W.

However, in Indonesia, there are few studies targeting climate indices and streamflow. A previous study found difficulty in developing a statistical prediction model for this relationship due to its non-linear nature. This study attempted to address that gap by applying multiple regression (MR) models using second- and third-order polynomial functions to show the non-linear relationship between climate and flow regime indices. First, a correlation analysis was performed to check the variable relationships. There was a good and significant correlation of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with the flow regime indices. Secondly, MR models were developed with the same-time variables. The developed model showed that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) had the effect of strongly increasing the high flow in La Niña phases. Finally, time-lagged MRs were developed aiming at forecasting. Lagged MR models with six-month leading climate indices demonstrated a relatively good correlation with the observed data (mostly R > 0.700) with moderate accuracy (root mean square error = 44–51%). It suggests that the forecasting of flow regime may be possible using ENSO and IOD indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3ariver flow 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater 3awater management 3aIndian Ocean 3aIndonesia1 aTamagawa, Ichiro 1 aHarada, Morihiro 0 tWater.g2021 May 14, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131013753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009200172500001900264520183300283592002802116650001202144650000902156650000902165650002602174650001902200650002202219650001302241650002502254650001402279650001502293650001302308650001802321650000902339650001702348650001502365650001202380650001202392651000902404653001602413653002502429653001402454653001602468653001802484653002002502700002702522700002802549700002102577700006202598700005502660700003002715773010802745856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60734572420221120030628.0210519e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073457242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1081422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdóñez, Raziel A.10aInsufficient and excessive N fertilizer input reduces maize root mass across soil types  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aQuantifying maize root response to nitrogen (N) fertilizer, soil texture, and weather is crucial to understand complex soil-root-plant processes. We performed a 2-year x 4 locations (sand content range: 5–95%) x N treatments (range: 0 to 336 kg N ha⁻¹) field experiment in Iowa, U.S. to (1) determine the response of root traits to N fertilizer, and (2) develop generalized functions to aid understanding and prediction of root mass and root to shoot (R:S) ratio. Deep root samples (0−210 cm, increments of 30 cm) were collected using the soil core approach at early to middle grain fill period and quantified root mass, length, and N and C concentrations. In addition, yield and shoot biomass was measured. Root traits and yield had different responses to N fertilizer input. Root mass was maximized at 168 kg N ha⁻¹; zero and excessive N fertilization decreased root mass by 33 and 17 %, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly affected root traits only in the top 30 cm soil layer. Soil texture affected root traits in a dry year (root mass was positively associated with silt and clay), but not in a wet year, suggesting that soil moisture overwhelms the effect of texture. The combined data (N rates x locations x years) revealed a negative relationship between R:S ratio and yield. This resulted in a new set of equations (e.g., upper bound R:S = e⁽–¹.⁵ – ⁰.⁰⁴*ʸⁱᵉˡᵈ⁾) that can replace the constant R:S approach used in the literature. Yield, which is commonly measured, integrates the effects of environment, management, and genetic variation; hence the proposed equations can be widely applied. This study provides evidence that different plant traits are maximized at different levels of mineral N nutrition. Results can enhance biophysical models and prediction of R:S ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aclay 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3agenetic variation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrition 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asand fraction 3asilt 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3atexture 3aweather 3aIowa 0aRoot length 0aSpecific root length 0aC:N ratio 0aRoot carbon 0aMaize biomass 0aNitrogen uptake1 aCastellano, Michael J.1 aDanalatos, Gerasimos N.1 aWright, Emily E.1 aHatfield, Jerry L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2981-88561 aBurras, Lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3318-32801 aArchontoulis, Sotirios V.0 tField crops research.g2021 June 15, v. 267 p.108142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1081423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245018300169520098700352592002801339650002701367650003101394650002001425650003101445650002901476650002001505650001901525650002901544650002601573650004001599650001401639700002401653773012301677856008101800852000901881655001201890IND60742698120221122034847.0210624e20210621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074269812DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100607762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiemens, Nikolai 10aStreptococcus pyogenes (“Group A Streptococcus”), a Highly Adapted Human Pathogen—Potential Implications of Its Virulence Regulation for Epidemiology and Disease Management  aStreptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci; GAS) is an exclusively human pathogen. It causes a variety of suppurative and non-suppurative diseases in people of all ages worldwide. Not all can be successfully treated with antibiotics. A licensed vaccine, in spite of its global importance, is not yet available. GAS express an arsenal of virulence factors responsible for pathological immune reactions. The transcription of all these virulence factors is under the control of three types of virulence-related regulators: (i) two-component systems (TCS), (ii) stand-alone regulators, and (iii) non-coding RNAs. This review summarizes major TCS and stand-alone transcriptional regulatory systems, which are directly associated with virulence control. It is suggested that this treasure of knowledge on the genetics of virulence regulation should be better harnessed for new therapies and prevention methods for GAS infections, thereby changing its global epidemiology for the better.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3adisease control 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3aimmune response 3anon-coding RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional regulatory elements 3avirulence1 aLütticken, Rudolf 0 tPathogens.g2021 June 21, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100607763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011300162300001600275500001500291520105700306592002801363650004301391650002801434650005601462650003201518650002501550650001701575650003101592650001001623650003301633650001001666653000801676653001801684653002301702653002401725653004701749700001801796700001501814700001501829700001901844773011501863856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60557215120221120091935.0180830e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055721512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aRapid and specific detection of porcine parvovirus by isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification assays  ap. 300-305.  a2019-12-06  aPorcine parvovirus (PPV) is a major cause of swine reproductive failure and reported in many countries worldwide. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays using a real-time fluorescent detection (PPV real-time RPA assay) and a lateral flow dipstick (PPV RPA LFD assay) were developed targeting PPV NS1 gene. The detection limit of PPV real-time RPA assay was 300 copies per reaction within 9 min at 38 °C, while the RPA LFD assay has a detection limit of 400 copies per reaction in less than 20 min at 38 °C. In both assays, there were no cross-reactions with porcine circovirus type 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classical swine fever virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus. Based on a total of 128 clinical samples examined, the sensitivity and the specificity of the developed RPA assays for identification of PPV was 94.4% and 100%, respectively, when compared to real-time (qPCR) assay. Therefore, the RPA assay provides a rapid, sensitive and specific alternative for PPV detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3afluorescence 3aUngulate protoparvovirus 1 3agenes 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aswine 0aPPV 0aRPA LFD assay 0aSuid herpesvirus 1 0aReal-time RPA assay 0aRecombinase polymerase amplification assay1 aQin, Xiaodong1 aZhang, Wei1 aLi, Yanmin1 aZhang, Zhidong0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2016 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.300-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006200170300001600232520128000248592002801528650000801556650002601564650002101590650001901611650002601630650002601656650001201682650002401694650001401718650001301732653001201745653001201757653001401769653003701783700002801820700002001848700002101868700002901889700006101918773009001979856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60584773920221119052318.0190206e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058477392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheung, Yee-Wai10aAptamer-mediated Plasmodium-specific diagnosis of malaria  ap. 131-136.  aThere is a critical need for better malaria rapid diagnostic tests to discriminate Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection given the recent observation of HRP2 deletions in P. falciparum parasites. We previously identified a DNA aptamer, 2008s, that targets P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) and developed a sensitive aptamer-tethered enzyme capture (APTEC) assay. Here, we characterise two different LDH-binding DNA aptamers in their species-specific activities, then integrate within biochemical diagnostic assays and test in clinical samples. An enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay demonstrated that aptamer pL1 bound with high affinity to both PfLDH and P. vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH), whereas aptamer 2008s was specific to PfLDH. An aptamer-tethered enzyme capture (APTEC) assay confirmed the specificity of 2008s in binding and capturing the enzyme activity of PfLDH which could be observed colorimetrically. In malaria patient samples, the 2008s APTEC assay was specific for P. falciparum blood samples and could discriminate against P. vivax blood samples. An aptamer for specific detection of falciparum malaria holds promise as a new strategy for species-specific malaria diagnosis rather than the conventional HRP2 immuno-assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3ablood sampling 3adiagnostic techniques 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amalaria 3anucleotide aptamers 3aparasites 3apatients 0aAptamer 0aMalaria 0aDiagnosis 0aPlasmodium lactate dehydrogenase1 aDirkzwager, Roderick M.1 aWong, Wai-Chung1 aCardoso, Josiane1 aD'Arc Neves Costa, Joana1 aTanner, Julian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5459-15260 tBiochimie.g2018 Feb., v. 145 p.131-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245014300187300001600330520162300346592002801969650002801997650001502025650001202040650001302052650001702065650002202082650000902104650001902113650002402132650000702156650001102163650001602174650005202190650002802242650001802270650002102288650002502309650005902334650000902393650001302402650003102415650001302446650001402459650003302473650005002506650001602556700002102572700001902593773012002612856008102732852000902813655001202822IND4474614320221119164727.0150215e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447461432DNAL7 a228068092pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-011-0824-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwagu, Tochukwu N.10aStabilization of a raw starch digesting amylase from Aspergillus carbonarius via immobilization on activated and non-activated agarose gel  ap. 335-345.  aApplications of raw starch digesting amylases (RSDAs) are limited due to instability, product inhibition of enzyme and contamination. RSDA from Aspergillus carbonarius was stabilized through immobilization on agarose gel by adsorption, spontaneous crosslinking and conjugation using glycidol, glutaraldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde. Effects of immobilization on kinetics, catalytic, storage and operational stability of immobilized enzyme were evaluated. Polyglutaraldehyde activated agarose RSDA (PGAg-RSDA) gave the highest immobilization yield (100%) with expressed activity of 86.7% while that of glycidol activated RSDA (GlyAg-RSDA) was 80.4%. A shift in pH from optimum of 5 for the soluble enzyme to 6 for RSDA adsorbed on agarose followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (AgRSDA-CROSS) and simultaneous adsorption and crosslinking (AgRSDA-RET), and pH 7 for PGAg-RSDA was seen. PGAg-RSDA and AgRSDA-CROSS were most pH stable and retained over 82% of their activities between pH 3.5 and 9 compared to 59% for the soluble enzyme. Thermoinactivation studies showed that immobilized RSDAs with the exception of GAg-RSDA retained over 90% of their activities at 60°C for 120 min while soluble enzyme retained only 76% activity under the same condition. AgRSDA-CROSS, PGAg-RSDA, Gly-RSDA and GAg-RSDA retained approximately 100% of their activities after 30 days storage at 4°C. GlyAg-RSDA retained 99.6%, PGAg-RSDA 94%, AgRSDA-CROSS 90%, GAg-RSDA 86.5% and Ag-RSDA-RET 80% activity after 10 batch reactions. Immobilization stabilized RSDA and permits processing at higher temperatures to reduce contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus carbonarius 3aadsorption 3aagarose 3aamylases 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme inhibition 3agels 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3astarch 3atemperature 2aAmylasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAspergillusxenzymology 2aBiotechnology 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEnzymes, Immobilized 2aFungal Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGels 2aGlutaral 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aSepharose 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistry 2aStarchxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTemperature1 aOkolo, Bartho N.1 aAoyagi, Hideki0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.335-345dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0824-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002400190245011200214300001800326506007600344520158700420592002802007506003702035650002202072650001702094650001702111650001002128650001302138650002402151650001402175650001402189650001402203650001102217650000902228700002102237700002402258700001602282700002402298700002702322773010302349856008502452852000902537655001202546IND60532011520221207121322.0160726e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053201152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b000102doi7 aPMC43824102pmcid7 a257932842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecroos, Christophe10aVariable Active Site Loop Conformations Accommodate the Binding of Macrocyclic Largazole Analogues to HDAC8  ap. 2126-2135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe macrocyclic depsipeptide Largazole is a potent inhibitor of metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), some of which are drug targets for cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, Largazole partially resembles Romidepsin (FK228), a macrocyclic depsipeptide already approved for clinical use. Each inhibitor contains a pendant side chain thiol that coordinates to the active site Zn²⁺ ion, as observed in the X-ray crystal structure of the HDAC8–Largazole complex [Cole, K. E., Dowling, D. P., Boone, M. A., Phillips, A. J., and Christianson, D. W. (2011) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 12474]. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of HDAC8 complexed with three synthetic analogues of Largazole in which the depsipeptide ester is replaced with a rigid amide linkage. In two of these analogues, a six-membered pyridine ring is also substituted (with two different orientations) for the five-membered thiazole ring in the macrocycle skeleton. The side chain thiol group of each analogue coordinates to the active site Zn²⁺ ion with nearly ideal geometry, thereby preserving the hallmark structural feature of inhibition by Largazole. Surprisingly, in comparison with the binding of Largazole, these analogues trigger alternative conformational changes in loops L1 and L2 flanking the active site. However, despite these structural differences, inhibitory potency is generally comparable to, or just moderately less than, the inhibitory potency of Largazole. Thus, this study reveals important new structure–affinity relationships for the binding of macrocyclic inhibitors to HDAC8.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ageometry 3ahistone deacetylase 3aneoplasms 3apyridines 3athiazoles 3athiols 3azinc1 aClausen, Dane J.1 aHaines, Brandon E.,1 aWiest, Olaf1 aWilliams, Robert M.1 aChristianson, David W.0 tBiochemistry.g2015 Mar. 31, v. 54, no. 12 p.2126-2135dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b000103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245013700211500001900348506007600367520191600443592002802359506003702387650001202424650001802436650002502454650002202479650001602501650001802517650002402535650001902559650001202578650001502590650001902605650001502624650001802639650001302657650001102670650001702681650001402698650001302712651001502725653001402740653001702754653002502771653001502796653001102811653002502822653002702847700001802874700002002892700002102912700002302933700006002956773009403016856008503110852000903195655001203204IND60690940720221207094417.0200508e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069094072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e024622doi7 aPMC68198382pmcid7 a316875612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, M.

The aim of this study is to compare nutrient contents in different parts of two varieties of pumpkin. The nutritional compositions were analyzed by standard methods. Fatty acids and amino acids were analyzed by GC/MS and amino acid analyzer. The proximate compositions analysis data indicate that a higher amount of moisture (p < 0.001) and fat (p < 0.01) were observed in the seed of indigenous but the seed of hybrid were rich in crude fiber (p < 0.01) and carbohydrate (p < 0.001). On the contrary carbohydrate content was predominant in the flesh (p < 0.05) and peel (p < 0.01) of indigenous. The energy content was high in the peel, seed and flesh of indigenous (p < 0.001, 0.001 and 0.05 respectively). A significant amount of reducing sugar was found in the peel, flesh (p < 0.05) and seed (p < 0.001) of hybrid. Vitamin C content was high in peel (p < 0.001) and seed (p < 0.01) of indigenous and only in the flesh (p < 0.001) of the hybrid. A remarkable amount of Na, K, Fe and Zn were present in peel (p < 0.001) of hybrid. The notable amount of P and Cu (p < 0.01) were present in the seed and K, Fe and Ca (p < 0.001) were in the flesh of indigenous. The seed of hybrid was enriched with saturated fatty acid (capric acid, p < 0.001; myristic acid, p < 0.01 and stearic acid, p < 0.05), whereas unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid, p < 0.05) were rich in the seed of indigenous. A significant amount of threonine, serine, methionine, isoleucine and tyrosine were present in the seed of indigenous (p < 0.01) but only alanine in the seed of hybrid (p < 0.01). These results suggested that a considerable amount of nutrients were present in all three parts of the two varieties, thus both varieties could be the potential source of nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine 3aascorbic acid 3acarbohydrate content 3acomparative study 3acrude fiber 3adecanoic acid 3adietary supplements 3aenergy content 3ahybrids 3aisoleucine 3alinolenic acid 3amethionine 3amyristic acid 3apumpkins 3aserine 3astearic acid 3athreonine 3atyrosine 3aBangladesh 0aChemistry 0aFood science 0aAgricultural science 0aIndigenous 0aHybrid 0aSaturated fatty acid 0aUnsaturated fatty acid1 aIslam, Tahera1 aUddin, M.

This study effectively demonstrates that poly-N-isopropylmethacrylamide based microgel coatings prevent bacterial adhesion. The coating preparation via a spraying approach proved to be simple and both cost and time efficient creating a homogeneous dense microgel monolayer. In particular, the influence of cross-linking density, microgel size, and coating thickness was investigated on the initial bacterial adhesion. Adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600 was imaged using a parallel plate flow chamber setup, which gave insights in the number of the total bacteria adhering per unit area onto the surface and the initial bacterial deposition rates. All microgel coatings successfully yielded more than 98% reduction in bacterial adhesion. Bacterial adhesion depends both on the cross-linking density/stiffness of the microgels and on the thickness of the microgel coating. Bacterial adhesion decreased when a lower cross-linking density was used at equal coating thickness and at equal cross-linking density with a thicker microgel coating. The highest reduction in the number of bacterial adhesion was achieved with the microgel that produced the thickest coating (h = 602 nm) and had the lowest cross-linking density. The results provided in this paper indicate that microgel coatings serve as an interesting and easy applicable approach and that it can be fine-tuned by manipulating the microgel layer thickness and stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abacterial infections 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3amicrogels 3aspraying1 aMergel, Olga1 avan der Mei, Henny C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0760-89001 aBusscher, H.

In Experiment 1, extent of timing-of-ovulation synchronization among cows was evaluated after imposing an estrogen/progesterone-based treatment regimen. At progesterone device removal (D8), cows were administered: eCG, or FSH or served as untreated Controls. In Experiment 2, percentage of cows P/AI was evaluated when the Experiment 1-treatment regimen was imposed. On D10, all cows were artificially inseminated. In Experiment 3, cows were assigned to two treatment groups (Control and eCG) on D8 to evaluate percentage of cows P/AI and estrous expression. In Experiment 1, follicular dynamics were similar among treatment groups. In Experiment 2, follicular growth was greater (P = 0.0001) with the eCG treatment. There was an interaction of treatment × parity (P = 0.007) on percentage of cows P/AI. There was a greater percentage of primiparous cows P/AI in the eCG-treated than Control and FSH-treated cows. There was a greater percentage of eCG-treated multiparous cows pregnant as a result of TAI than Control cows. There was an interaction of treatment × parity (P = 0.005) on P/AI in Experiment 3, in which the eCG effect was more pronounced in primiparous cows. Treatment with FSH, therefore, was not as effective as eCG in stimulation of follicular growth or enhancing percentage of cows pregnant as a result of TAI. Physiological effects of eCG, however, were also more evident in primiparous cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3aprogesterone 3azebu 0aFixed-time artificial insemination 0aOvulation synchronization 0aFollicular growth 0aEquine chorionic gonadotropin 0aFollicle-stimulating hormone1 aSimões, L.M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4449-21341 aSilva, L.A.C.L.1 aGirotto, R.W.1 aScandiuzzi, L.A.1 aMassoneto, J.P.M.1 aBaruselli, P.S.1 aSouza, J.C.1 aSales, J.N.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8217-755X0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2021 May, v. 228 p.106751-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.1067513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245013200166300001800298520112700316592002801443650001901471650003901490650001901529650001301548650001101561650001301572700001801585700002201603700002101625773010501646856008401751852000901835655001201844IND4460208420221119170110.0141111e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446020842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.05.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruns, Stefan10aMorphological analysis of physically reconstructed capillary hybrid silica monoliths and correlation with separation efficiency  ap. 5187-5194.  aWe report an experimental study on the structural (especially radial) heterogeneity of eleven 100μm i.d. capillary tetramethoxysilane–methyltrimethoxysilane hybrid silica monoliths with different pore and skeleton sizes, which were imaged by an optimized confocal laser scanning microscopy method. This method allows the optical sectioning of the monoliths, which is a prerequisite for quantitative morphological image analysis. Both radial porosity profiles and chord length distributions were calculated in the macropore domain for each column from at least 100 complete cross-sectional views along the column axis. The statistical approach visualized radial heterogeneities on different length scales in the monolithic structures. Chord length distributions followed a simplified k-gamma function, and a structural parameter obtained from this function is introduced to provide a scalar measure of column heterogeneity. It enables the comparison of monoliths with different pore sizes and helps to establish correlations between the microscopic properties of a column, eddy dispersion, and its separation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aimage analysis 3aporosity 3asilica 3askeleton1 aHara, Takeshi1 aSmarsly, Bernd M.1 aTallarek, Ulrich0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 1218, no. 31 p.5187-5194dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.05.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009400168300001600262520119500278592002801473650001901501650002701520650002901547650002901576650002801605651001401633653002101647653003201668653001801700700002101718773009301739856008301832852000901915655001201924IND60606913020221119023017.0180730e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060691302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiawan, Yogi14aThe environmental Kuznets curve in Indonesia: Exploring the potential of renewable energy  ap. 187-198.  aThere is an increasing interest in investigating the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis because it suggests the existence of a turning point in the economy that will lead to a sustainable development path. Although many studies have focused on the EKC, only a few empirical studies have focused on analyzing the EKC with specific reference to Indonesia, and none of them have examined the potential of renewable energy sources within the EKC framework. This study attempts to estimate the EKC in the case of Indonesia for the period of 1971–2010 by considering the role of renewable energy in electricity production, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration as the estimation method. We found an inverted U-shaped EKC relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the long run. The estimated turning point was found to be 7729 USD per capita, which lies outside of our sample period. The beneficial impacts of renewable energy on CO2 emission reduction are observable both in the short run and in the long run. Our work has important implications both for policymakers and for the future development of renewable energy in Indonesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity generation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 3aIndonesia 0aRenewable energy 0aEnvironmental Kuznets curve 0aCointegration1 aManagi, Shunsuke0 tEnergy policy.g2016 Nov., v. 98 p.187-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245018500170300001600355520211500371592002802486650002002514650001502534650002502549650002502574650001802599650002702617650001702644650000902661650001702670650001802687650002602705650002002731650001402751650002002765650001602785650002002801650001902821650001502840650001502855650001802870650001502888650003002903650001802933650002402951700001402975700001502989700001203004700001703016700001803033700001603051700001503067700002003082700001403102700001803116773008503134856008903219852000903308655001203317IND50059993320221117011433.0141110e20121124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005999332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Juan10aEffects of dietary isoleucine on growth, the digestion and absorption capacity and gene expression in hepatopancreas and intestine of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

Jian). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) (6.9±0.03g) were randomly distributed into six groups with four replicates each, fed semi-purified isonitrogenous diets (335.8g crude protein/kg diet) containing graded levels of Ile (4.2, 7.0, 9.5, 11.9, 13.9 and 16.9g/kg diets) for 60days. The relative expression of gene was performed by real-time quantitative PCR. Compared with the control group, Ile supplementation increased (P<0.05): (1) specific growth rate (SGR) and feed intake, (2) body protein content and protein retention value, (3) intestine fold height, (4) activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase in hepatopancreas and intestine, (5) activities of alkaline phosphatase in distal intestine, Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in intestine, (6) glutamate–oxaloacetate transaminase activity in hepatopancreas, and (7) relative mRNA expression of chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase in hepatopancreas, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in mid intestine, Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase in intestine and target of rapamycin (TOR) in hepatopancreas and mid intestine. However, Ile supplementation decreased (P<0.05): (1) feed conversion ratio, (2) glutamate–pyruvate transaminase activity in hepatopancreas, and (3) relative mRNA expression of trypsin in hepatopancreas, alkaline phosphatase in intestine, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in distal intestine and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) in hepatopancreas, proximal and mid intestine. Collectively, this study indicated that dietary Ile improves fish growth, promotes the digestive and absorptive ability and regulates gene expression of the digestive and brush border enzymes, TOR and 4E-BP. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of SGR, the Ile requirement of juvenile Jian carp (6.90–63.39g) was estimated to be a 12.9g/kg diet, corresponding to 38.4g/kg of dietary protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aabsorption 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal growth 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody protein 3acarp 3achymotrypsin 3acrude protein 3adiet study techniques 3adietary protein 3adigestion 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3ahepatopancreas 3aintestines 3aisoleucine 3amessenger RNA 3amicrovilli 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein value 3aregression analysis1 aLiu, Yang1 aJiang, Jun1 aWu, Pei1 aChen, Gangfu1 aJiang, Weidan1 aLi, Shuhong1 aTang, Ling1 aKuang, Shengyao1 aFeng, Lin1 aZhou, Xiaoqiu0 tAquaculture.g2012 Nov. 24, v. 368-369 p.117-128dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167520163600280592002801916650002301944650001501967650001901982650001402001650002702015650001802042650001302060650002402073650001502097650001502112650001402127650000902141650001902150650002102169650001502190650002002205653001702225653002502242653002702267653003302294653003002327653002302357700005402380700005602434700001202490700001702502700001302519700001702532700001302549700005702562773011302619856008602732852000902818655001202827IND60767899420221121185926.0220714e20220320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076789942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1309242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yibo10aRevealing the underlying molecular basis of phosphorus recycling in the green manure crop Astragalus sinicus  aThe use of green manure as an organic fertilizer to main crops has been widely proposed as a sustainable method for ecological restoration and increasing soil fertility in degraded environments. Given the increasing excessive application of phosphate (Pi) fertilizer and the accompanying risk of environmental pollution, a strategy is required to increase the Pi absorption efficiency of green manures with nitrogen (N)-fixing ability and further improve N–P recycling and the soil remediation effect in agroecosystems. Leguminous crops, such as milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus), are the most widely used green manure plant species. In this study, through physiological assessments of different Astragalus sinicus cultivars under Pi starvation, an elite variety, Astragalus sinicus Xinzi-1 was identified, which showed high tolerance to Pi starvation and approximately 25%–60% higher Pi content than other varieties. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that, upon Pi starvation, the expression profiles of core genes involved in Pi transport and signaling were globally and dramatically altered in Xinzi-1. Specifically, the expression of genes encoding Pi uptake transporters and acid phosphatases in Xinzi-1 were remarkably induced under Pi deficient condition. The results showed that increasing the Pi absorption efficiency of N-fixing green manure can improve the N–P recycling efficiency and soil remediation effect of green manures. This study also provides new insights for future research on appropriate breeding guidance, variety evaluation, and field management of green manures in sustainable agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus sinicus 3aabsorption 3aagroecosystems 3acultivars 3aecological restoration 3agreen manures 3anitrogen 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3asoil remediation 3astarvation 3atranscriptomics 0aGreen manure 0aPhosphorus recycling 0aPhosphate accumulation 0aEnvironmental sustainability 0aFull-length transcriptome 0aAstragalus sinicus1 aWang, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8123-60711 aGuo, Zhenhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6009-30051 aXu, Lei1 aZhao, Hongyu1 aZhao, Pu1 aMa, Chunhong1 aYi, Keke1 aJia, Xianqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2033-20480 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 20, v. 341 p.130924-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1309243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002100181245013400202300001800336506007600354520139600430592002801826506003701854650002701891650001401918650002201932650002201954650001001976650001201986650001401998650002202012650002402034650002302058650001102081650001902092651001002111653001402121653001402135653002102149653001502170653002702185653002102212653002302233653001302256700002402269700002202293700001602315773010202331856007402433852000902507655001202516IND60115133520221207055048.0150202e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011513352DNAL7 a241695942pmid7 aPMC38385522pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, Heather M.10aGenetic evidence for predominantly hydrochoric gene flow in the invasive riparian plant Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam)  ap. 1743-1750.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Riparian systems are prone to invasion by alien plant species. The spread of invasive riparian plants may be facilitated by hydrochory, the transport of seeds by water, but while ecological studies have highlighted the possible role of upstream source populations in the establishment and persistence of stands of invasive riparian plant species, population genetic studies have as yet not fully addressed the potential role of hydrochoric dispersal in such systems. Methods A population genetics approach based on a replicated bifurcate sampling design is used to test hypotheses consistent with patterns of unidirectional, linear gene flow expected under hydrochoric dispersal of the invasive riparian plant Impatiens glandulifera in two contrasting river systems. Key results A significant increase in levels of genetic diversity downstream was observed, consistent with the accumulation of propagules from upstream source populations, and strong evidence was found for organization of this diversity between different tributaries, reflecting the dendritic organization of the river systems studied. Conclusions These findings indicate that hydrochory, rather than anthropogenic dispersal, is primarily responsible for the spread of I. glandulifera in these river systems, and this is relevant to potential approaches to the control of invasive riparian plant species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3aintroduced plants 3aseeds 2aAnimals 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aImpatiensxgenetics 2aIntroduced Species 2aRivers 2aSeed Dispersal 0aWales 0aDispersal 0agene flow 0aHimalayan balsam 0ahydrochory 0aImpatiens glandulifera 0ainvasive species 0apropagule pressure 0ariparian1 aMaggs, Christine A.1 aMurray, Tomás E.1 aProvan, Jim0 tAnnals of botany.g2013 Dec., v. 112, no. 9 p.1743-1750dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct2273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012300176300001600299500001900315520166700334592002802001650001402029650002502043650001602068650001502084650002502099650001902124650001802143650002202161650001102183650002102194650001702215650002202232650001602254650002602270650001902296650001802315653001302333653002102346653001602367700001802383700001602401700001602417700002102433773012202454856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60689735920221118072831.0200423e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068973592DNAL7 a10.1080/19390211.2018.14491592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Mandeep Kumar10aAmelioration of Diabetes-Induced Diabetic Nephropathy by Aloe vera: Implication of Oxidative Stress and Hyperlipidemia  ap. 227-244.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the effect of Aloe vera in diabetes-induced nephropathy in rats. As diabetes-associated hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, we evaluated the protective effect of whole leaf extract of Aloe vera on the basis of its hypolipidemic and antioxidative property. Aloe vera (300 mg/kg orally) has been noted to possess renoprotective effect in experimental diabetic nephropathy. However, its mechanism is not fully understood. Rats were administered streptozotocin (STZ) (55 mg/kg intraperitoneally once) to induce experimental diabetes mellitus. The development of diabetic nephropathy was assessed biochemically and histologically. In addition, the diabetes-induced lipid profile and renal oxidative stress were assessed. The single administration of STZ produced diabetes, which induced renal oxidative stress, altered the lipid profile, and subsequently produced nephropathy in eight weeks by increasing serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, proteinuria, and glomerular damage. Treatment with Aloe vera (300 mg/kg/day orally) was noted to be more effective against the diabetes-induced nephropathy and renal oxidative stress as compared to lisinopril (1 mg/kg/day orally), a reference agent. It may be concluded that diabetes-induced oxidative stress and lipid alterations may be accountable for the induction of nephropathy in diabetic rats. The treatment with Aloe vera (300 mg/kg/day orally) may have prevented the development of diabetes-induced nephropathy by reducing lipid alteration, decreasing renal oxidative stress, and providing direct renoprotective action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adiabetic nephropathy 3ahyperlipidemia 3aleaf extracts 3alipid composition 3alipids 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aprotective effect 3aproteinuria 3arenoprotective effect 3astreptozotocin 3aurea nitrogen 0adiabetes 0alipid alteration 0anephropathy1 aSarup, Yogesh1 aTomar, Ritu1 aSingh, Mary1 aKumar, Puspendra0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 16, no. 2 p.227-244dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2018.14491593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003800148245007100186300001200257500001100269520142600280592002801706650002301734650002601757650001701783650000801800650005201808650000901860650001301869650002701882650000901909650001001918650001201928650001201940650001301952700003401965700002801999700002402027700002502051700006402076773011302140856008302253852000902336655001202345IND60712807120221122224443.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071280712DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04292-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillar Corrales, M.q(Margarita),10aCoronavirus in cat flea: findings and questions regarding COVID-19  ap. 409.  aLetter  aThe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. Recent evidence raised the question about the possibility that cats may be a domestic host for SARS-CoV-2 with unknown implications in disease dissemination. Based on the fact that the domestic cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, are abundant ectoparasites infesting humans, companion animals and wildlife and that coronavirus-like agents have been identified in the ectoparasite tick vector, Ixodes uriae of seabirds, herein we considered the presence of coronaviruses in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular in C. felis. We identified coronavirus-derived and cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme RNA/proteins in C. felis. Although current evidence suggests that pets are probably dead-end-hosts with small risk of transmission to humans, our results suggested that cat flea may act as biological and/or mechanical vectors of SARS-CoV. Although preliminary, these results indicate a possibility of ectoparasites acting as reservoirs and vectors of SARS-CoV and related beta-coronavirus although with little disease risk due to systemic transmission route, low viremia, virus attenuation or other unknown factors. These results support the need to further study the role of animal SARS-CoV-2 hosts and their ectoparasite vectors in COVID-19 disease spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aCtenocephalides felis 3aIxodes uriae 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acats 3apandemic 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arisk 3aticks 3aviremia 3aviruses 3awildlife1 aFernández de Mera, Isabel G.1 aArtigas-Jerónimo, Sara1 aContreras, Marinela1 aGortázar, Christian1 aFuente, José de la,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7383-96490 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.409-409dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04292-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300002200270520094600292592002801238650001501266650002101281650001301302650001301315650001301328650001201341650002601353650002701379650002101406700001601427700001801443700001601461773012701477856007401604852000901678655001201687IND60669454520221119051255.0190920e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066945452DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20166g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanming10aInfluence of monomer conformation on the mechanical and tribological properties of thermosetting polyimides  ap. 101533-101543.  aA series of thermosetting polyimide oligomers with different diamines (isomers) and same calculated number-average molecular weights (Mₙ) were synthesized with BPDA (biphenyl-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride), 4,4′-ODA (4,4′-oxydianiline), 3,4′-ODA (3,4′-oxydianiline) and 4-PEPA (4-phenylethynylphthalic anhydride). Herein, we investigate the effect of monomer configuration on the mechanical, thermal and tribological properties of thermosetting polyimides. Experimental results demonstrate the relationship between molecular configuration and mechanical, thermal and tribological properties. It is revealed that as the content of 4,4′-ODA increases, Tg, Young's modulus and hardness increases and coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate (WR) decrease under most conditions. Compared with variations of COFs and WRs of TPIs to velocity or load, it is easy to confirm the major influencing factor under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3acarboxylic acids 3adiamines 3afriction 3ahardness 3aisomers 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular weight1 aTao, Liming1 aWang, Tingmei1 aWang, Qihua0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 5, no. 123 p.101533-101543dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20166g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012000167300001600287520104500303592002801348650002101376650001101397650001701408650001201425650001801437650001701455650001901472650001301491650001401504650001301518650001301531650001101544653002801555653002001583653001901603653001101622700002001633700002601653700001801679700001801697773010601715856008701821852000901908655001201917IND60570755920221118201250.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057075592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ming10aEnhanced acetone-butanol-ethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates by using starchy slurry as supplement  ap. 126-134.  aThis study aims to improve acetone-butanol-ethanol production from the hydrolysates of lignocellulosic material by supplementing starchy slurry as nutrients. In the fermentations of glucose, xylose and the hydrolysates of Salix schwerinii, the normal supplements such as buffer, minerals, and vitamins solutions were replaced with the barley starchy slurry. The ABE production was increased from 0.86 to 14.7g/L by supplementation of starchy slurry in the fermentation of xylose and the utilization of xylose increased from 29% to 81%. In the fermentations of hemicellulosic and enzymatic hydrolysates from S. schwerinii, the ABE yields were increased from 0 and 0.26 to 0.35 and 0.33g/g sugars, respectively. The results suggested that the starchy slurry supplied the essential nutrients for ABE fermentation. The starchy slurry as supplement could improve the ABE production from both hemicellulosic and cellulosic hydrolysate of lignocelluloses, and it is particularly helpful for enhancing the utilization of xylose from hemicelluloses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix schwerinii 3abarley 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3aminerals 3anutrients 3aslurries 3avitamins 3axylose 0aAcetone-butanol-ethanol 0aLignocelluloses 0aStarchy slurry 0aXylose1 aKuittinen, Suvi1 aVepsäläinen, Jouko,1 aZhang, Junhua1 aPappinen, Ari0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 243 p.126-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011800184300001600302520062100318592002800939650002300967650002800990650001101018650003001029650001901059650002701078650003501105650003401140650002901174650002001203650005201223650003101275650005901306700001801365700001201383700001701395773009601412856008101508852000901589655001201598IND50073978020221118192504.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007397802DNAL7 a243227732pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1420-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Peng-Song10aConstruction and optimization of a Pseudomonas putida whole-cell bioreporter for detection of bioavailable copper  ap. 761-766.  aA Pseudomonas putida whole-cell bioreporter for detecting bioavailable copper was constructed by inserting a CueR-regulated sensor element upstream of a promoterless green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene.

This new inorganic–organic hybrid polymer shows high thermostability with a 5 wt % loss temperature of 436 °C, as well as good transparency (a sheet with an average thickness of 1.5 mm shows high transmittance of 92% varying from 400 to 1100 nm). Moreover, the polymer exhibits both low dielectric constant (<2.56) and low dissipation factor (<3.1 × 10–³) in a wide range of frequencies from 40 Hz to 30 MHz even at a high frequency of 5 GHz. The polymer also shows low water uptake (<0.04%) and low Dₖ (near 2.63) after immersing it in water at room temperature for 3 days. These data imply that this polymer is very suitable to be utilized as a high-performance dielectric material for fabrication of high-frequency printed circuit boards or encapsulation resins for integrated circuit dies in the microelectronic industry. Furthermore, this work also provides a route for the preparation of fluorinated POSS-based polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acomposite polymers 3aelectronic circuits 3aencapsulation 3aindustry 3apolymerization 3aresins 3athermal stability 3atransmittance 3awater uptake 0aPolyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) 0afluoropolymers 0ahigh-performance polymers 0adielectric constant 0ahydrophobicity1 aSun, Jing1 aZhou, Junfeng1 aJin, Kaikai1 aFang, Qiang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 12, v. 9, no. 14 p.12782-12790dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b014153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013300164300001800297500001900315520135500334592002801689650002401717650001401741650001301755650001201768650001601780653002001796653002001816653001401836653002101850653002901871700002501900700002201925700005701947700002302004700002402027773012602051856008302177852000902260655001202269IND60687427120221118212908.0200628e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068742712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaim, Layla10aVariation of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.

P. Kumm. (1871)). However, the application of nano-additives has not been reported in such cultivation yet. The study investigated the effect of nano-urea added in two different doses (3 g and 5 g per kg substrate), once (at spawning or after first flush) or twice (at spawning and after first flush) to the growing substrate consisting of wheat straw and spent oyster substrate (1:1, w/w). Results showed that the application of nano-urea once has induced the highest number of mushroom flushes (four flushes) despite the dose applied. Contrarily to early findings, where high doses of nitrogen have caused inhibition of mushroom growth and production, nano-urea application has had better effects when applied twice. With 5 g/kg, it induced the shortest period between the first and the third flush (15 days). With 3 g/kg, it resulted in the highest biological and economic yields at the third flush (332.7 g/bag and 283.1 g/bag respectively), in total (973.4 g/bag and 854.0 g/bag respectively), the highest biological efficiency (109.6%), and pileus diameter/stipe length ratio (2.8). Experimental findings of the current study may be potentially applied at commercial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3amushrooms 3anitrogen 3aoysters 3awheat straw 0aOyster mushroom 0aSpent substrate 0aNano-urea 0aBiological yield 0aMushroom characteristics1 aAlsanad, Mohammed A.1 aEl Sebaaly, Zeina1 aShaban, Nidal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1106-25681 aFayssal, Sami Abou1 aSassine, Youssef N.0 tSaudi journal of biological sciences.g2020 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.1573-1579dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12399x1319-562X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245008400162520133500246592002801581650000901609650001601618650001101634650002701645650001901672650001901691650000901710650001501719650001101734650000901745650001501754650002901769650001001798651001001808700001901818700002701837700002001864773011701884856007502001852000902076655001202085IND60649746920221119212410.0190706e20170611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064974692DNAL7 a10.3390/land60200392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattarai, Richa10aDetection of Land Subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, Using DInSAR Technique  aDifferential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) is a remote sensing technique that is capable of detecting land surface deformation with centimeter accuracy. In this research, this technique was applied to two pairs of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) data to detect land subsidence in the Kathmandu valley from 2007 to 2010. The result revealed several subsidence areas towards the center of the valley ranging from a maximum of 9.9 km2 to a minimum of 1 km2 coverage with a maximum velocity of 4.8 cm/year, and a minimum velocity of 1.1 cm/year, respectively. The majority of the subsidence was observed in old settlement areas with mixed use development. The subsidence depth was found to gradually increase from the periphery towards the center in almost all detected subsidence areas. The subsidence depth was found to be in a range of 1 cm to 17 cm. It was found that the concentration of deep water extraction wells was higher in areas with higher subsidence rates. It was also found that the detected subsidence area was situated over geological formations mainly consisting of unconsolidated fine-grained sediments (silica, sand, silt, clay and silty sandy gravel), which is the major factor affecting the occurrence of land subsidence due to groundwater extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3adeformation 3agravel 3agroundwater extraction 3ainterferometry 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asatellites 3asilica 3asilt 3asubsidence 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awells 3aNepal1 aAlifu, Haireti1 aMaitiniyazi, Aikebaier1 aKondoh, Akihiko0 tLand.g2017 June 11, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land60200393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245012900208506007600337520149600413592002801909506003701937650001801974650001401992650001602006650001302022650001002035650001502045650000902060650001402069650001202083650001102095650001702106650001302123650001002136650001002146700002302156700002002179700002102199700002102220773011902241856007802360852000902438655001202447IND60649371620221207124636.0190704e20181011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064937162DNAL7 a10.3390/insects90401402doi7 aPMC63159182pmcid7 a303143992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParis, Véronique,10aEffects of Alternative Blood Sources on <i>Wolbachia</i> Infected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Females within and across Generations  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWolbachia bacteria have been identified as a tool for reducing the transmission of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Research groups around the world are now mass rearing Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti for deliberate release. We investigated the fitness impact of a crucial element of mass rearing: the blood meal required by female Ae. aegypti to lay eggs. Although Ae. aegypti almost exclusively feed on human blood, it is often difficult to use human blood in disease-endemic settings. When females were fed on sheep or pig blood rather than human blood, egg hatch rates decreased in all three lines tested (uninfected, or infected by wMel, or wAlbB Wolbachia). This finding was particularly pronounced when fed on sheep blood, although fecundity was not affected. Some of these effects persisted after an additional generation on human blood. Attempts to keep populations on sheep and pig blood sources only partly succeeded, suggesting that strong adaptation is required to develop a stably infected line on an alternative blood source. There was a decrease in Wolbachia density when Ae. aegypti were fed on non-human blood sources. Density increased in lines kept for multiple generations on the alternate sources but was still reduced relative to lines kept on human blood. These findings suggest that sheep and pig blood will entail a cost when used for maintaining Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti. These costs should be taken into account when planning mass release programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aWolbachia 3aarboviruses 3abacteria 3ablood 3ablood meal 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahumans 3amass rearing 3aplanning 3asheep 3aswine1 aCottingham, Ellen 1 aRoss, Perran A.1 aAxford, Jason K.1 aHoffmann, Ary A.0 tInsects.g2018 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects90401403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002900186245015300215300002000368506007600388520130900464592002801773506003701801650001301838650001401851650001901865650002901884650001201913650001901925650001101944650003501955650002201990650001302012650001202025650001702037650001302054650001202067653001702079653002102096700002002117700002202137700002002159700002002179700002102199773017702220856007902397852000902476655001202485IND60173811720221207072939.0150603e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017381172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13116601102doi7 aPMC37808742pmcid7 a240031332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHämäläinen, Riikka H.10aTissue- and cell-type–specific manifestations of heteroplasmic mtDNA 3243A>G mutation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived disease model  ap.

The molecular basis of this variability is mostly unknown because the lack of model systems has hampered mechanistic studies. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from patients carrying the most common human disease mutation in mtDNA, m.3243A>G, underlying mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. During reprogramming, heteroplasmic mtDNA showed bimodal segregation toward homoplasmy, with concomitant changes in mtDNA organization, mimicking mtDNA bottleneck during epiblast specification. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons and various tissues derived from teratomas manifested cell-type specific respiratory chain (RC) deficiency patterns. Similar to MELAS patient tissues, complex I defect predominated. Upon neuronal differentiation, complex I specifically was sequestered in perinuclear PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin-positive autophagosomes, suggesting active degradation through mitophagy. Other RC enzymes showed normal mitochondrial network distribution. Our data show that cellular context actively modifies RC deficiency manifestation in MELAS and that autophagy is a significant component of neuronal MELAS pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidosis 3aautophagy 3adisease models 3aelectron transport chain 3aenzymes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amitochondrial DNA 3amutation 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3atissues 0amitochondria 0adisease modeling1 aManninen, Tuula1 aKoivumäki, Hanna1 aKislin, Mikhail1 aOtonkoski, Timo1 aSuomalainen, Anu0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Sept. 17, v. 110, no. 38 p.E3622-E3630dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13116601103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245057800163246013800741300001600879520092600895592002801821650002101849650002201870650002001892700001401912773009501926856004802021852000902069655001202078IND4472411120221117011242.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447241112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-011-0806-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, GuanYong10aUn élément pour modéliser des flux en chenaux potentiels entre des structures souterraines imperméables dans un champ d’écoulement de nappe régionale en milieu urbain Un elemento para modelar flujos potenciales en canales entre estructuras subterráneas impermeables en un campo de flujo de aguas subterráneas urbano regional 城市区域地下水流场模拟中处理防渗结构间管道流的方法 Um elemento para a modelação de potenciais fluxos em canal entre estruturas subterrâneas impermeáveis num campo de fluxo regional urbano de água subterrânea3 aAn element for modeling potential channel flows between impervious underground structures in an urban regional groundwater flow field  ap. 313-323.  aIn an urban regional groundwater flow field, the presence of thousands of channels between impervious structures makes the field difficult to simulate using the finite-element method (FEM), because the scale of the field is usually several orders of magnitude larger than that of the channels. To overcome this problem, a simple element for the simulation of potential channel flows has been developed. This element works with linear triangular elements and can be easily implemented in a finite-element code to simulate the channel flows with a sparse mesh without a loss of global accuracy. The transmissivity matrix of this element is deduced from the analytical solution for channel flow. The application of the element is discussed, and the accuracy of the element is assessed. The element makes it easy to merge small structures that are close to each other into a larger one that can be modeled with a sparse mesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrologic models 3astream channels1 aCao, Hong0 tHydrogeology journal.g2012 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.313-323dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-011-0806-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245013600210300001600346500001900362506007600381520178600457536030202243592002802545596007102573596007802644506003702722650001302759650001702772650002402789650003702813650001402850650001702864650001902881650001402900650001102914650001202925650001302937650002402950650002202974653003702996653001203033700002003045700001703065700002203082773012103104856008503225852000903310655001203319IND60689736220221207144451.0200423e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068973622DNAL7 a10.1080/19390211.2018.14545682doi7 aPMC63149192pmcid7 a296721842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Amy C.10aOral Supplementation with Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methylbutyrate, Arginine, and Glutamine Improves Lean Body Mass in Healthy Older Adults  ap. 281-293.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOral intake of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine, and glutamine may ameliorate muscle loss by stimulating protein synthesis and decreasing protein degradation while simultaneously decreasing inflammation. Previous studies provide evidence for improvement in body composition with dietary supplementation of these ingredients among patients with muscle-wasting diseases. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of this amino acid mixture on lean body mass, muscle volume, and physical function among healthy older adults. Thirty-one community-dwelling men and women, aged 65–89 years, were randomized to either two oral doses of the amino acid supplement (totaling 3 g HMB, 14 g arginine, 14 g glutamine) or placebo daily for six months. At baseline and month six, lean body mass was measured by air displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and four-compartment model. Muscle volume of quadriceps was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and participants performed a battery of tests to assess physical function. As compared to the placebo group, the treatment group exhibited improvement in a timed stair climb (p =.016) as well as significant increases in lean body mass by all methods of assessment (p <.05). Regional analysis by DXA revealed increased arm lean mass in the supplement group only (p =.035). However, no change was observed in MRI-derived quadriceps volume. Dietary supplementation with HMB, arginine, and glutamine improved total body lean mass among a small sample of healthy older adults. Further research is indicated to elucidate mechanisms of action and to determine whether supplementation may benefit frail elders. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no.

In this triple-blinded clinical trial, 46 Iranian patients with metabolic syndrome, from both sexes, aged 25–70 years, who fulfilled inclusion criteria were randomly categorized to receive either the synbiotic or a placebo capsule, twice a day for three months, plus a weight-loss diet using stratified random sampling based on body mass index (BMI). Each synbiotic capsule consisted of seven strains probiotic bacteria (2× 10⁸) plus fructooligosaccharide as a prebiotic. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests were assessed at baseline and at the end of week 12 for fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), peptide YY (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The mean changes of weight, BMI, FBS, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and GLP-1 between the two groups was statistically significant (p < .001). Furthermore, peptide YY (PYY) increased significantly in the synbiotic group (p ≤ .05). The trend of weight loss in the synbiotic group was significant until the end of the study (p < .001) while it stopped at week 6 in the placebo group. Synbiotic treatment may improve the status of BMI, FBS, insulin resistance, HOMA-IR, GLP-1, and PYY in patients with metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aappetite 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3adigestive system 3adysbiosis 3afructooligosaccharides 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid composition 3ametabolic syndrome 3apeptide YY 3aplacebos 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aweight loss 0amicroflora 0asynbiotic1 aHedayati, Mehdi1 aRashidkhani, Bahram1 aSaadat, Navid1 aShakerhossini, Rahebeh0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2019 May 4, v. 16, no. 3 p.294-306dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2018.14557883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013600167300001600303520124600319592002801565650001301593650001101606650001301617650000901630650001801639650000901657650001801666650001401684650002201698650001301720650001401733650001101747650000901758650001901767650001101786650001101797653001401808653002201822653002101844653001701865653002201882700002701904700001901931700002401950773013801974856007802112852000902190655001202199IND60595798620221122161710.0190514e20180210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059579862DNAL7 a10.1139/cjas-2017-01642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodenhuis, Mary A.10aEffect of grain type and dried distillers grains plus solubles oil concentration on site of digestion in cattle fed finishing diets  ap. 368-375.  aThe objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of grain type (rolled corn vs. rolled barley) and oil concentration of dried corn distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS; moderate = 7.9% vs. low = 4.5% ether extract) on site of digestion. Seven ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein steers (716 ± 8.9 kg) were used in a 4 × 7 Youden square with experimental periods of 24 d. True ruminal organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) digestibility (% of intake) as well as intestinal (% of entering duodenum) and total tract starch digestibility was greater (P ≤ 0.03) in steers fed diets containing barley than in steers fed diets containing corn. Ruminal disappearance and ruminal, intestinal, and total tract OM, CP, and starch digestibility were not influenced (P ≥ 0.11) by feeding diets containing DDGS with differing oil concentration. Total tract lipid digestibility (%) was greater (P < 0.001) in steers fed diets containing moderate-oil DDGS than low-oil DDGS. These data indicate that including a low-oil DDGS, as compared with a moderate-oil DDGS, in finishing diets containing rolled corn or rolled barley does not influence intake or site of digestion of nonlipid components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abarley 3acannulas 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adistillers grains 3aduodenum 3afinishing 3alipids 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3astarch 3asteers 0adigestion 0adistillers grains 0afinishing cattle 0agrain source 0aoil concentration1 aKeomanivong, Faithe E.1 aBauer, Marc L.1 aSwanson, Kendall C.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2018 Feb. 10, v. 98, no. 2 p.368-375dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x1918-18257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2017-01643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007100157300001400228520126300242592002801505650002801533650002401561650001601585650002701601650001201628650002601640650001001666650001001676650002101686650001901707700001501726700002101741700001401762700002101776700001701797700001801814700002201832700001501854700001501869700001601884773012401900856007302024852000902097655001202106IND60478931720221116164217.0160116e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047893172DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.123742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuárez, M.L.10aCommunication interference in sympatrically occurring moth species  ap. 25-33.  aIn moth species, females emit a species‐specific sex pheromone that is perceived over long distance by conspecific males. The species‐specificity in the chemical communication channel is achieved by a combination of unique components in specific ratios and sometimes also by interspecific behavioural antagonists to deter sympatrically occurring heterospecific males. In this study, we determined possible antagonistic effects in Helicoverpa gelotopoeon Dyar (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) males to the major sex pheromone component of sympatrically occurring heliothine moths, Z11‐16:Ald, as well as to the sex pheromone of the sympatrically occurring Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (Z11‐16:Ald and Z9‐14:Ald). We also explored whether other co‐occurring species are attracted to these pheromone blends. Our field experiments showed that the addition of Z11‐16:Ald alone or in combination with Z9‐14:Ald inhibited trap catches of H. gelotopoeon males and that this inhibition depended on the concentration of these compounds. In addition, other moth species were attracted to the blends. Together, our results confirm the antagonistic effect of heterospecific sex pheromone compounds of H. virescens to H. gelotopoeon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa gelotopoeon 3aHeliothis virescens 3aantagonists 3achemical communication 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3amales 3amoths 3apheromone blends 3asex pheromones1 aRuiz, M.J.1 aFernández, P.C.1 aGoane, L.1 aVillagrán, M.E.1 aArce, O.E.A.1 aArmiñana, A.1 aPáez Jerez, P.G.1 aVega, M.H.1 aVera, M.T.1 aGroot, A.T.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2016 Jan., v. 158, no. 1 p.25-33dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.123743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008300172300001800255506010400273506007600377520086400453592002801317506003701345650005201382650001901434650001901453650001601472650001301488651001101501653001301512653001301525653001401538653001701552653003001569700002101599700002301620700002101643700002101664773009801685856008601783852000901869655001201878IND60772216120221207112910.0221004e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077221612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsitt, Catherine14aThe early impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in Region Stockholm, Sweden  ap. 2823-2827.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVaccination against SARS-CoV-2 started in Region Stockholm, Sweden in December 2020 with those in long-term care facilities or receiving home care vaccinated first followed by those aged over 80 years.

The main emphasis is laid on lamb, beef and poultry. So far, some methods have shown quite promising potential (e.g. stable isotope ratios, trace elements), others have remained unsatisfactory in their discriminating power to authenticate the geographic origin of meat (e.g. microbiological profile, sensory traits, volatile compounds). Other methods (e.g. animal genotype, gross chemical composition) could be auxiliary criteria as they help to determine related indicators such as feeding or housing conditions but not directly the origin. The complexity of this question is large. An integrated approach simultaneously addressing various species and production characteristics such as environment, animal husbandry conditions, breed, feeding and drinking water has to be developed. Strategies have to be different for global and micro-regional scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3abeef 3achemical composition 3adrinking water 3agenotype 3apoultry 3aprovenance 3araw meat 3asensory properties 3astable isotopes 3atrace elements 3avolatile compounds1 aGremaud, Gérard1 aHadorn, Ruedi1 aKreuzer, Michael0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2005 Aug., v. 221, no. 3-4 p.493-503dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-005-1158-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011200160300001800272520060700290592002800897650002200925650001600947650002300963650001800986650002501004650001601029650002201045650002201067700001701089700002101106700002801127700002201155700002101177700001601198773011901214856007501333852000901408655001201417IND60550237020221116143543.0160910e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055023702DNAL7 a10.1021/jo500771g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, Tapobrata10aAsymmetric Garratt–Braverman Cyclization: A Route to Axially Chiral Aryl Naphthalene–Amino Acid Hybrids  ap. 5608-5616.  aWe report the first example of a highly diastereoselective Garratt–Braverman cyclization leading to the synthesis of chiral aryl naphthalene–amino acid hybrids in excellent yields.

The AuNPs grew in situ on the surface of MoS₂ nanosheet to form efficient SERS hot spots by a spontaneous redox reaction with tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl₄) without any reducing agent. The morphologies of MoS₂ and AuNPs-decorated MoS₂ nanosheet were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, and AFM. The formation of hot spots greatly depended on the ratio of MoS₂ and HAuCl₄. When the concentration of HAuCl₄ was 2.4 mM, the as-prepared AuNPs@MoS₂-3 nanocomposite exhibited a high-quality SERS activity toward probe molecule due to the generated hot spots. The spot-to-spot SERS signals showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) in the intensity of the main Raman vibration modes (1362, 1511, and 1652 cm–¹) of Rhodamine 6G were about 20%, which displayed good uniformity and reproducibility. The AuNPs@MoS₂-based substrate was reliable, sensitive, and reproducible, which showed great potential to be an excellent SERS substrate for biological and chemical detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3areducing agents 3astatistical analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avibration 0aAuNPs@MoS2 nanocomposite 0aSERS-active substrate 0ahot spot 0auniformity1 aZhang, Chi1 aYuwen, Lihui1 aChao, Jie1 aZuo, Xiaolei1 aLiu, Xingfen1 aSong, Chunyuan1 aFan, Chunhai1 aWang, Lianhui0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Nov. 12, v. 6, no. 21 p.18735-18741dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am50430923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04087naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245013900210300002000349506007600369520173500445592002802180506003702208650001402245650000802259650001602267650001202283650001602295650001902311650001702330650001102347650002502358650001802383650001202401650001302413650001902426650001402445650002202459650003502481651001802516653002102534653001802555653001502573653002202588700002302610700002002633700001702653700001902670700002002689700001902709700003002728700002202758700001702780700002502797700002102822700001702843700001702860700002502877700002502902700001902927700002402946700002102970700002102991700002303012700001903035773017503054856007903229852000903308655001203317IND60173828520221207091138.0150603e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017382852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13082431102doi7 aPMC37917192pmcid7 a240437772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishiguchi, Koji M.10aWhole genome sequencing in patients with retinitis pigmentosa reveals pathogenic DNA structural changes and NEK2 as a new disease gene  ap. 16139-16144.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe performed whole genome sequencing in 16 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), a disease characterized by progressive retinal degeneration and caused by mutations in over 50 genes, in search of pathogenic DNA variants. Eight patients were from North America, whereas eight were Japanese, a population for which ARRP seems to have different genetic drivers. Using a specific workflow, we assessed both the coding and noncoding regions of the human genome, including the evaluation of highly polymorphic SNPs, structural and copy number variations, as well as 69 control genomes sequenced by the same procedures. We detected homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 7 genes associated with ARRP (USH2A , RDH12 , CNGB1 , EYS , PDE6B , DFNB31 , and CERKL) in eight patients, three Japanese and five Americans. Fourteen of the 16 mutant alleles identified were previously unknown. Among these, there was a 2.3-kb deletion in USH2A and an inverted duplication of ∼446 kb in EYS , which would have likely escaped conventional screening techniques or exome sequencing. Moreover, in another Japanese patient, we identified a homozygous frameshift (p.L206fs), absent in more than 2,500 chromosomes from ethnically matched controls, in the ciliary gene NEK2 , encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase. Inactivation of this gene in zebrafish induced retinal photoreceptor defects that were rescued by human NEK2 mRNA. In addition to identifying a previously undescribed ARRP gene, our study highlights the importance of rare structural DNA variations in Mendelian diseases and advocates the need for screening approaches that transcend the analysis of the coding sequences of the human genome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmericans 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3amacular degeneration 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3apatients 3aphotoreceptors 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aNorth America 0amedical genetics 0aophthalmology 0aciliopathy 0aretinal blindness1 aTearle, Richard G.1 aLiu, Yangfan P.1 aOh, Edwin C.1 aMiyake, Noriko1 aBenaglio, Paola1 aHarper, Shyana1 aKoskiniemi-Kuendig, Hanna1 aVenturini, Giulia1 aSharon, Dror1 aKoenekoop, Robert K.1 aNakamura, Makoto1 aKondo, Mineo1 aUeno, Shinji1 aYasuma, Tetsuhiro R.1 aBeckmann, Jacques S.1 aIkegawa, Shiro1 aMatsumoto, Naomichi1 aTerasaki, Hiroko1 aBerson, Eliot L.1 aKatsanis, Nicholas1 aRivolta, Carlo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 110, no. 40 p.16139-16144dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13082431103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245014200167300001600309520117600325592002801501506003701529650000801566650001701574650001901591650002301610650002401633650001501657650002001672700002201692700002301714773012601737852000901863856008301872655001201955IND4460131420221207101622.0220615e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446013142DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192911039002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnoch, Steven J.14aThe Use of a Chemistry-based Profiler for Covalent DNA Binding in the Development of Chemical Categories for Read-across for Genotoxicity  ap. 131-145.  aAn important molecular initiating event for genotoxicity is the ability of a compound to bind covalently with DNA. However, not all compounds that can undergo covalent binding mechanisms will result in genotoxicity. One approach to solving this problem, when in silico prediction techniques are being used, is to develop tools that allow chemicals to be grouped into categories based on their ability to bind covalently to DNA. For this analysis to take place, compounds need to be placed within categories where the trend in toxicity can be explained by simple descriptors, such as hydrophobicity. However, this can occur only when the compounds within a category are structurally and mechanistically similar. Chemistry-based profilers have the ability to screen compounds and highlight those with similar structures to a target compound, and are thus likely to act via a similar mechanism of action. Here, examples are reported to highlight how structure-based profilers can be used to form categories and hence fill data gaps. The importance of developing a well-defined and robust category is discussed in terms of both mechanisms of action and structural similarity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3agenotoxicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alaboratory animals 3amechanism of action 3aprediction 3aproblem solving1 aCronin, Mark T.D.1 aEllison, Claire M.0 tATLA.

These compounds have shown remarkable anticancer activity against multiple human cancer cell lines. Herein, we describe efficient, enantioselective syntheses of FR901464, spliceostatin A, six corresponding diastereomers and an evaluation of their splicing activity. Syntheses of spliceostatin A and FR901464 were carried out in the longest linear sequence of 9 and 10 steps, respectively. To construct the highly functionalized tetrahydropyran A-ring, we utilized CBS reduction, Achmatowicz rearrangement, Michael addition, and reductive amination as key steps. The remarkable diastereoselectivity of the Michael addition was specifically demonstrated with different substrates under various reaction conditions. The side chain B was prepared from an optically active alcohol, followed by acetylation and hydrogenation over Lindlar’s catalyst. The other densely functionalized tetrahydropyran C-ring was derived from readily available (R)-isopropylidene glyceraldehyde through a route featuring 1,2-addition, cyclic ketalization, and regioselective epoxidation. These fragments were coupled together at a late stage through amidation and cross-metathesis in a convergent manner. Six key diastereomers were then synthesized to probe the importance of specific stereochemical features of FR901464 and spliceostatin A, with respect to their in vitro splicing activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylation 3aalcohols 3aamination 3aantineoplastic activity 3acatalysts 3adiastereomers 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantioselectivity 3aepoxidation reactions 3aglyceraldehyde 3ahumans 3ahydrogenation 3aneoplasms 3aorganic chemistry 3aregioselectivity 3aspliceosomes 3astereochemistry1 aChen, Zhi-Hua1 aEffenberger, Kerstin

Stomach contents (n = 161) were collected from October 2013 to May 2014 using a nonlethal stomach-flushing technique. A total of 680 food items (624 animal items and 56 plant items) was found in 161 stomachs of skinks, representing 19 unique animal categories. We found that the diet of E. multifasciata is composed mainly of small, sedentary and clumped prey and that this skink specialises on spiders, insect larvae, snails, grasshoppers and crickets (with a combined importance index of 60%). Dietary composition, prey size and total prey volume in E. multifasciata changed between dry and rainy seasons and among regions. The total volume of food items consumed by males was larger than that of females, and the diversity and evenness index of prey categories were larger in males than in females. However, using rarefaction curves revealed that females have the higher prey-taxon richness after points between 130 and 140 prey items for frequency, and between 160 and 170 prey items for number of items, and the differences were not statistically significant. The foraging behaviour of E. multifasciata best fits a ‘widely foraging’ model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aOrthoptera 3aScincidae 3adiet 3aecology 3afemales 3aforaging 3agrasshoppers 3ainsect larvae 3amales 3amodels 3asnails 3astomach 3awet season 3aVietnam 0adiet 0afeeding 0afood 0aforaging mode 0alizards 0askinks1 aNgo, Binh V.1 aHoang, Thuong T.1 aNguyen, Thi T.T.1 aDang, Hai P.0 tJournal of natural history.g2015 Oct. 26, v. 49, no. 39-40 p.2417-2436dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2015.10218763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015300171300001600324500001900340520158800359592002801947650002101975650001001996650001902006650001402025650001202039650001702051650001202068650001002080650001202090650003702102650000902139650002802148650001502176650002502191650003202216653001202248653001302260653001302273653001302286653001702299653001602316653003802332700001802370700002102388700002402409700002302433700001802456773012102474856008502595852000902680655001202689IND60689736620221118070248.0200423e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068973662DNAL7 a10.1080/19390211.2018.14583662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, Mitsuhiro10aAshitaba (Angelica Keiskei) Exudate Prevents Increases in Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Induced by Obesity in Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetic Mice  ap. 331-344.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAngelica keiskei koidzumi (ashitaba) is consumed as a traditional folk medicine and health food in Japan. Ashitaba extract contains abundant flavonoids containing chalcones. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the primary physiological inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator. Excessive amounts of PAI-1 in plasma disrupt the fibrinolytic balance and promote a prothrombotic state with which thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases are associated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ashitaba yellow exudate (AE) on enhanced PAI-1 levels in Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetic (TSOD) mice. AE significantly decreased food efficiency and plasma PAI-1 in TSOD mice but did not affect lean control Tsumura Suzuki nonobese (TSNO) mice. AE also decreased some parameters in the plasma, such as glucose, insulin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and gains in body weight, subcutaneous, mesenteric fat weight in TSOD mice but had little effect on these parameters in TSNO mice. Levels of adipose PAI-1 were significantly higher in TSOD than in TSNO mice. Major sources of plasma PAI-1 are thought to be adipose tissue and liver. AE significantly suppressed PAI-1 protein levels in the livers of both TSOD and TSNO mice. These results suggest that AE decreased plasma PAI-1 levels by suppressing both the adipose tissue retention of PAI-1 protein and liver PAI-1 production in TSOD mice. Supplementing the diet with AE might help to prevent thrombotic diseases or alleviate the risk of thrombotic diseases as well as to suppress metabolic state in obese individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica keiskei 3aJapan 3aadipose tissue 3achalcones 3aglucose 3ahealth foods 3ainsulin 3aliver 3aobesity 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3arisk 3at-plasminogen activator 3athrombosis 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aadipose 0aashitaba 0achalcone 0adiabetes 0ainflammation 0aobese mouse 0aplasminogen activator inhibitor-11 aFujinami, Aya1 aOishi, Katsutaka1 aKobayashi, Norihiro1 aOhnishi, Katsunori1 aOhkura, Naoki0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2019 May 4, v. 16, no. 3 p.331-344dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2018.14583663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245006700178300001400245520088000259592002801139650002101167650001501188650002101203650001301224650002201237650002001259650003601279650002501315650002001340650001401360650001501374650002001389650001501409653002401424653002001448653001401468653001201482653002001494700001701514700005601531700001501587700002201602700002101624700002101645700005501666773010701721856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60625464320221119192541.0190426e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062546432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2018.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Mohd Atiqueuzzaman10aCan membrane bioreactor be a smart option for water treatment?  ap. 80-87.  aThe gradual increase of organic and inorganic micropollutants in natural and drinking watercourses has posed a greater challenge for current water treatment technologies. Currently established water treatment processes such as activated sludge, microfiltration, reverse osmosis, adsorption, carbon nanotube etc. have a limited range of application, low energy recovery, and cost-intensive operation. Membrane bioreactor has already been utilized as a useful option to remove soluble organics, nutrients, and micropollutants from wastewater. Although currently established Membrane Bioreactors have few limitations, recent developments on this technology have improved its energy efficiency and reduced the operating and maintenance cost. Implementing these research findings in full-scale operation can make this process a favorable option in industrial wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3adrinking 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrofiltration 3anutrients 3apollutants 3areverse osmosis 3awastewater 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aMicropollutants 0aNutrients 0aFouling 0aWater treatment1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aGuo, Wenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-28581 aLiu, Yiwen1 aChang, Soon Woong1 aNguyen, Dinh Duc1 aNghiem, Long Duc1 aLiang, Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9100-60070 tBioresource technology reports.g2018 Dec., v. 4 p.80-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171300001600267500001900283520140400302592002801706650002101734650001701755650001601772650001601788650002701804650001801831650000901849650001501858650001401873650004801887650002401935653005701959653005502016653003202071653001702103700001802120700001502138700001702153773012102170856008502291852000902376655001202385IND60689736720221118070254.0200423e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068973672DNAL7 a10.1080/19390211.2018.14587682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsada, Norihiko10aEffects of Shiitake Intake on Serum Lipids in Rats Fed Different High-Oil or High-Fat Diets  ap. 345-356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aShiitake (Lentinula edodes) extract, eritadenine, has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, and its hypocholesterolemic actions are involved in the metabolism of methionine. However, the mechanisms by which eritadenine affects cholesterol metabolism in animals fed a high-fat diet containing different sources of lipids have not yet been elucidated in detail. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of shiitake supplementation on serum lipid concentrations in rats fed a diet including a high amount of a plant oil (HO [high oil] and HOS [high oil with shiitake] groups), animal fat (HF [high fat] and HFS [high fat with shiitake] groups), or MCT- (medium-chain triglyceride–) rich plant oil (HM [high MCT] and HMS [high MCT with shiitake] groups). Rats in the HOS, HFS, and HMS groups were fed shiitake. When rats were fed a diet containing shiitake, serum triglyceride, cholesterol levels, and LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) activities were lower in rats given MCT-rich plant oil than in those that consumed lard. The lipid type in the diet with shiitake also affected serum cholesterol levels and LCAT activities. The diet containing MCT-rich plant oil showed the greatest rates of decrease in all serum lipid profiles and LCAT activities. These results suggest that shiitake and MCT-rich plant oil work together to reduce lipid profiles and LCAT activity in serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentinula edodes 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3ahigh fat diet 3alard 3amethionine 3amushrooms 3aphosphatidylcholine-choline acyltransferase 3aplant fats and oils 0aLCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) activity 0aMCT- (medium-chain triglyceride–) rich plant oil 0ashiitake (Lentinula edodes) 0atriglyceride1 aKairiku, Rumi1 aTobo, Mika1 aOno, Akifumi0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2019 May 4, v. 16, no. 3 p.345-356dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2018.14587683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014400174500002200318520150300340592002801843650000801871650002001879650001101899650001501910650001701925650001301942650002601955650001301981650002401994650001102018653001502029653001602044653001802060653003702078700002502115700002402140700001802164700002602182700001702208700001902225773006002244856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60584752820221117200500.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058475282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Michihito10aDevelopment of a rapid and quantitative method for the analysis of viral entry and release using a NanoLuc luciferase complementation assay  aPre-press version  aSubviral particles (SVPs) self-assemble and are released from cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding flavivirus structural proteins. Flavivirus-like particles (VLPs), consisting of flavivirus structural proteins and a subgenomic replicon, can enter cells and cause single-round infections. Neither SVPs or VLPs possess complete viral RNA genomes, therefore are replication-incompetent systems; however, they retain the capacity to fuse and bud from target cells and follow the same maturation process as whole virions. SVPs and VLPs have been previously employed in studies analyzing entry and release steps of viral life cycles. In this study, we have developed quantitative methods for the detection of cellular entry and release of SVPs and VLPs by applying a luciferase complementation assay based on the high affinity interaction between the split NanoLuc luciferase protein, LgBiT and the small peptide, HiBiT. We introduced HiBiT into the structural protein of West Nile virus and generated SVPs and VLPs harboring HiBiT (SVP-HiBiT and VLP-HiBiT, respectively). As SVP-HiBiT emitted strong luminescence upon exposure to LgBiT and its substrate, the nascently budded SVP-HiBiT in the supernatant was readily quantified by luminometry. Similarly, the cellular entry of VLP-HiBiT generated luminescence when VLP-HiBiT was infected into LgBiT-expressing cells. These methods utilizing SVP-HiBiT and VLP-HiBiT will facilitate research into life cycles of flaviviruses, including WNV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWest Nile virus 3agenome 3aluciferase 3aluminescence 3aplasmids 3aquantitative analysis 3areplicon 3astructural proteins 3avirion 0aFlavivirus 0aVirus entry 0aVirus release 0aLuciferase complementation assay1 aAnindita, Paulina D.1 aPhongphaew, Wallaya1 aCarr, Michael1 aKobayashi, Shintarō,1 aOrba, Yasuko1 aSawa, Hirofumi0 tVirus research.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245016500179300001500344520212700359592002802486650001502514650001202529650001302541650001202554650001102566650001502577650001202592650000902604650001202613650001902625650001002644650001002654650001602664651001102680653002102691653003102712653001402743653001702757653001202774653001602786700003102802700002802833773011502861856008502976852000903061655001203070IND60570322220221120214259.0190403e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057032222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Ramos, Ignacio M.10aContrasting responses of insects and vertebrates as seed consumers of two neotropical oak species: The interactive effects of individual crop size and seed mass  ap. 99-106.  aTree species often exhibit considerable variability among individuals in seed crop size and averaged seed mass within the same year. However, very little is known about the consequences for seed consumers’ preferences of this potentially large between-individual variability. In this study we quantified seed production and seed manipulation rates by animals over three years in two coexisting oak species of southeast Mexico (Quercus germana and Q. xalapensis) with the principal aim of evaluating the influence of two relevant plant traits (individual crop size and seed mass) on the responses of two guilds of acorn consumers with contrasting foraging behaviors and dietary breadths (vertebrate versus granivorous insects). We detected interactive effects of these two plant traits on seed consumers’ preferences, with important differences between the two groups of acorn-feeding animals. In general, high densities of large-sized acorns triggered a negative density-dependent response (i.e. satiating effect) in granivorous insects and a positive response (i.e. attractive effect) in vertebrates, whereas the opposite occurred when considering the fraction of small-sized acorns. The potential consequences of producing bigger seeds will partly depend on the relative abundance of the two guilds of acorn consumers. Thus, in plant populations with overabundance of vertebrates, the higher attraction of large-sized seeds for these generalist consumers could counteract the satiating effect exercised on granivorous insects through multi-infestation. However, in forest sites with less abundance of vertebrates, the risk of seed predation (mostly by insects) could be reduced in those trees producing huge quantities of large-sized seeds. In summary, we found clear evidences that the direction and magnitude of density-dependent seed removal can differ not only between different groups of seed consumers but also among different fractions of seed size, which highlights the importance of considering this plant trait to better understand the complexity of mechanisms operating in these plant-animal interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aQuercus 3aforaging 3aforests 3afruits 3agranivores 3ainsects 3arisk 3asatiety 3aseed predation 3aseeds 3atrees 3avertebrates 3aMexico 0aNeotropical oaks 0aIndividual seed production 0aSeed mass 0aSeed removal 0aInsects 0aVertebrates1 aGarcía-De La Cruz, Yureli1 aGómez-Aparicio, Lorena0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 401 p.99-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016100170300001800331520160100349592002801950650002301978650003102001650001302032650002102045650001702066650002602083650001802109650001002127650002102137650001802158650001102176650001402187650001202201650001202213650002902225650001302254653002702267653003202294653001802326653002302344653001902367700002202386700001702408700001702425700002102442700001602463700002202479700002002501700001802521700002502539773009902564856008602663852000902749655001202758IND60570257620221116215826.0190319e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Sarbari10aNeem leaf glycoprotein generates superior tumor specific central memory CD8+ T cells than cyclophosphamide that averts post-surgery solid sarcoma recurrence  ap. 4421-4429.  aThe success of cancer vaccines is limited as most of them induce corrupted CD8+ T cell memory populations. We reported earlier that a natural immunomodulator, neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP), therapeutically restricts tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Here, our objective is to study whether memory CD8+ T cell population is generated in sarcoma hosts after therapeutic NLGP treatment and their role in prevention of post-surgery tumor recurrence, in comparison to the immunostimulatory metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment. We found that therapeutic NLGP and CTX treatment generates central memory CD8+ T (TCM) cells with characteristic CD44+CD62LhighCCR7highIL-2high phenotypes. But these TCM cells are functionally impaired to prevent re-appearance of tumors along with compromised proliferative, IL-2 secretive and cytotoxic status. This might be due to the presence of tumor load, even a small one in the host, which serves as a persistent source of tumor antigens thereby corrupting the TCM cells so generated. Surgical removal of the persisting tumors from the host restored the functional characteristics of memory CD8+ T cells, preventing tumor recurrence after surgery till end of the experiment. Moreover, we observed that generation of superior TCM cells in NLGP treated surgically removed tumor hosts is related to the activation of Wnt signalling in memory CD8+ T cells with concomitant inhibition of GSK-3β and stabilisation of β-catenin, which ultimately activates transcription of Wnt target genes, like, eomesodermin, a signature molecule of CD8+ TCM cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3afunctional properties 3aglycoproteins 3ahosts 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-2 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3asarcoma 3asurgery 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaccines 0aNeem leaf glycoprotein 0aCentral memory CD8+ T cells 0aTumor surgery 0aSarcoma recurrence 0aWnt signalling1 aSarkar, Madhurima1 aGhosh, Tithi1 aGuha, Ipsita1 aBhuniya, Avishek1 aSaha, Akata1 aDasgupta, Shayani1 aBarik, Subhasis1 aBose, Anamika1 aBaral, Rathindranath0 tVaccine.g2017 Aug. 03, v. 35, no. 34 p.4421-4429dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245010700216520179000323592002802113650002902141650001102170650000902181650001102190650001602201650001202217650000902229650001002238650001402248650003202262650001502294650001402309650002402323650001002347650001602357651001602373653001602389653001402405653002002419653001902439653001002458653001702468700002102485700002002506700002202526773010902548856009002657852000902747655001202756IND60697919020221122141335.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069791902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittmer, Keren E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1813-219714aThe effect of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration on fecundity of ewes on a New Zealand sheep farm  aResearch on Soay Island sheep showed a positive association of serum 25(OH)D concentration and fecundity, while similar research on Scottish sheep didn’t show an association with fecundity but did show an association with weaned lamb weight. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations of ewes at mating, on a commercial sheep farm, was associated with subsequent prolificacy.On a sheep and beef farm in the North Island of New Zealand 200 mixed-age Romney ewes (Ovis aries) had weights recorded and blood was collected by jugular venepuncture in April (autumn) at mating. Pregnancy testing was conducted 12 weeks after mating, using real time ultrasound to confirm pregnancy and determine whether the dams were carrying singletons, twins or triplets. Serum 25(OH)D₂ and D₃ concentrations, total calcium, and phosphorus concentrations were measured in the 200 pregnant ewes. A multinomial logistic regression model was fitted to the data in order to determine significant predictors of the ultrasound scanning result.The mean serum total 25(OH)D concentrations of single, twin and triplet bearing ewes were 102.0 ± 3.4, 101.0 ± 2.4 and 83.0 ± 4.5, respectively. In a multinomial logistic regression model serum total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₃ concentrations were also negatively correlated with ewes pregnant with triplets (P = 0.015), while weight was significantly associated with both twin and triplet bearing ewes (P < 0.001).The reason for the lower serum 25(OH)D concentration in sheep bearing triplets is unclear, and further research is required in order to determine the mechanisms behind this. The results suggest that an effect on ewe fecundity may only be seen when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are marginal.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3aRomney 3aSoay 3aautumn 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3aewes 3afarms 3afecundity 3alivestock and meat industry 3aphosphorus 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3atwins 3aultrasonics 3aNew Zealand 0aProlificacy 0aVitamin D 0aCholecalciferol 0aErgocalciferol 0aSheep 0aReproduction1 aSurendran, Adeel1 aElder, Peter A.1 aHoyle, Theresa J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2020 Sept., v. 190 p.106149-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300002000297520185200317592002802169596006302197596006302260596004902323650001702372650000902389650001702398650002002415650001802435650001402453650001402467650001402481650002302495650001302518650001202531650001602543651001002559700001902569700001302588700001402601700001902615700001702634700001902651773015502670856008302825852000902908655001202917IND60708474620221121155113.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09771-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guoyong10aIdentifying environmental pollution recorded in street dust using the magnetic method: a case study from central eastern China  ap. 34966-34977.  aUrban street dust constitutes important intermediate products for the transmission of solid organic and inorganic pollutants in the urban environment. In this study, 133 street dust samples were collected from Xinyang to explore their magnetic characteristics, spatial distribution, and environmental implications using magnetic measurements. The results are as follows. (1) There were ferrimagnetic, antiferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic (e.g., lepidocrocite) minerals in the dust. Among these, the dominant magnetic carriers were ferrimagnetic minerals. Furthermore, magnetite was a first-order ferrimagnetic carrier. (2) The magnetic domains of the dust were pseudo single-domain to multi-domain. (3) The magnetic concentration (χ and SIRM) of dust were 2.6 and 4.1 times higher than those of background samples that were not polluted by urban and anthropogenic activities, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the dust consisted of high concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals and coarse magnetic particles. (4) The magnetic distribution was spatially different. The industrial area, which was the most polluted sampling area, had the highest magnetic concentration and the coarsest magnetic particles. This was attributable to industrial emissions, fossil fuel combustion, and exhaust emissions from heavy-laden trucks. Residential and commercial areas, which were the second most polluted areas, had higher concentration and coarser particles. This was primarily due to the high population density and traffic activities of mini-cars (i.e., high flux and exhaust emissions). Hence, the conclusion is that the magnetic characteristics, spatial distribution, and the sources of dust are dictated by anthropogenic activities. Our results indicate that the magnetic method is a highly effective tool to monitor urban environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a41602187cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a41877435cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018GGJS-04cXinyang Normal University Funds 3acase studies 3adust 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3alepidocrocite 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3apollution 3apopulation density 3aresearch 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aZhang, Ronglei1 aHan, Yan1 aLü, Bin,1 aMeng, Yuanhang1 aWang, Shijie1 aWang, Ningning0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.34966-34977dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09771-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014100171300001600312520090200328592002801230650001201258650001101270650001001281650001901291650001801310650002201328650001001350650002201360650002101382651001001403651001101413653002401424653000901448653001401457653002101471653000801492700002501500700001901525700002501544700002101569700002101590773007801611856008101689852000901770655001201779IND50072331520221119162016.0160511e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233152DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0321-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessina, Giuseppina10aPlant communities preferences of terrestrial crustaceans (Isopoda: Oniscidea) in a protected coastal area of southeastern Sicily (Italy)  ap. 354-362.  aWe studied the plant communities preferences of oniscidean isopods in a protected coastal area in southeastern Sicily that is characterized by ponds, dunes and rocky coast. In total, five sites were sampled between March 2003 and February 2004 using pitfall traps. A total of 7,326 specimens were found, belonging to 23 species. The vegetation analysis, using the phytosociological method, recognized a total of 11 types of plant communities, with specific ecological features. Measuring the species richness, diversity and annual activity density (aAD) values of the terrestrial isopod communities from each sampling site revealed differences among the various plant communities. PCA analysis confirmed the correlation between isopods species and specific plant communities. Moreover our results show that the high species richness is associated with a high vegetation cover and number of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsopoda 3acoasts 3adunes 3aphytosociology 3apitfall traps 3aplant communities 3aponds 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation cover 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aterrestrial isopods 0apond 0adiversity 0aactivity density 0aPCA1 aMontesanto, Giuseppe1 aPezzino, Elisa1 aSciandrello, Saverio1 aCaruso, Domenico1 aLombardo, Bianca0 tBiologia.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 69, no. 3 p.354-362dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0321-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04353naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245011000210300001800320506007600338520207500414592002802489506003702517650002202554650001802576650001502594650002002609650001602629650001002645650001202655650002102667650002102688650002102709650002302730650001002753650000902763650001302772650001402785650001202799653003202811653001702843653002302860653002502883653002802908653004302936653003202979653002103011653001803032653002803050653000703078653000803085653001003093653000803103653000703111653000803118653000803126653000903134653000903143653000903152653000803161653000703169653000703176653000803183653000803191653001103199653000803210700001703218700001903235700002303254700002203277700001803299773009903317856008603416852000903502655001203511IND60570257820221207074817.0190319e20170724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.0392doi7 aPMC55872422pmcid7 a286685652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatta, Yasuko10aM2SR, a novel live influenza vaccine, protects mice and ferrets against highly pathogenic avian influenza  ap. 4177-4183.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses has heightened global concern about the threat posed by pandemic influenza. To address the need for a highly effective universal influenza vaccine, we developed a novel M2-deficient single replication (M2SR) influenza vaccine virus and previously reported that it provided strong heterosubtypic protection against seasonal influenza viruses in mice. In the current study, we assessed M2SR induced protection against H5N1 influenza in mice and ferrets.Mice were intranasally inoculated with M2SR viruses containing the HA and NA from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (M2SR H5N1) or A/California/07/2009 (M2SR H1N1). All M2SR vaccinated mice survived lethal challenge with influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), whereas 40% of mice vaccinated with recombinant H5 HA and none of the naïve controls survived. M2SR H5N1 provided sterile immunity, whereas low levels of virus were detected in the lungs of some M2SR H1N1 vaccinated mice. In contrast, recombinant H5 HA vaccinated mice and naïve controls showed systemic infection.M2SR H5N1 induced strong serum and mucosal antibody responses (IgG and IgA classes) against H5 HA, with high hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers. In contrast, while M2SR H1N1 elicited cross-reactive antibodies recognizing the H5 HA2 stalk region or the neuraminidase, no HAI activity against H5N1 virus was detected after M2SR H1N1 immunization.Both M2SR H5N1 and H1N1 also protected ferrets against lethal challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/2004. A prime–boost regimen provided optimal protection with no virus detected in the respiratory tract or brain after challenge. As in the mouse model, only the M2SR H5N1 vaccine induced HAI antibodies against the challenge virus in ferrets, while the M2SR H1N1 was able to provide protection without the induction of HAI antibodies.In summary, effective protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus was provided by both homologous H5N1 M2SR and heterologous H1N1 M2SR demonstrating the cross-protective attributes of the M2SR platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aavian influenza 3ablood serum 3abrain 3aferrets 3ahemagglutination 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfluenza vaccines 3alungs 3amice 3apandemic 3asialidase 3aviruses 0aUniversal influenza vaccine 0aM2-deficient 0aSingle replication 0aSterilizing immunity 0aHeterosubtypic immunity 0aHighly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza 0aHemagglutination inhibition 0aHA2 stalk region 0aNeuraminidase 0aLong-lasting protection 0aav 0aBAL 0aELISA 0aFCS 0aHA 0aHAI 0aHEK 0aM2SR 0aM2CK 0aMDCK 0aMEM 0aNA 0aOD 0aPFU 0aRDE 0aTCID50 0aTMB1 aBoltz, David1 aSarawar, Sally1 aKawaoka, Yoshihiro1 aNeumann, Gabriele1 aBilsel, Pamuk0 tVaccine.g2017 July 24, v. 35, no. 33 p.4177-4183dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010300171520097500274592002801249650001301277650001401290650002601304650001101330650001101341650001101352651001001363653001701373653003701390653002201427653002101449700002001470700001301490773010201503856008701605852000901692655001201701IND60697919320221122141319.0200808e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069791932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1067252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiaping10aInternet Use and Lower Life Satisfaction: The Mediating Effect of Environmental Quality Perception  aThis paper studies the impact of Internet use on life satisfaction, and the channel through which this impact occurs by using data from the 2016 China Family Panel Studies. Employing seemingly unrelated regression to estimate mediation models, we find that in China, Internet use makes people significantly less satisfied with the environmental quality and their living conditions; meanwhile, the dissatisfaction in environmental quality caused by Internet use plausibly mediates the negative effect of Internet use on life satisfaction. Heterogeneity analyses confirm significant differences with regard to the urban-rural division, gender and relative income. Furthermore, the more important the Internet is for an individual's information acquisition, the less satisfied he or she feels with environmental quality and living conditions. The findings shed light on several policy-relevant issues, e.g., the relationship between Internet use and environmental activism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aactivists 3aenvironmental quality 3agender 3aincome 3amodels 3aChina 0aInternet use 0aEnvironmental quality perception 0aLife satisfaction 0aMediating effect1 aCheng, Mingwang1 aYu, Ning0 tEcological economics.g2020 Oct., v. 176 p.106725-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1067253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245009800202300002000300520086700320592002801187596007501215650002301290650001601313650001801329650001901347650001901366650002701385650001501412650001401427650001301441650000901454651001001463700001701473700001901490700001701509700001501526700001901541773015501560856008301715852000901798655001201807IND60708474920221121155053.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09779-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wenzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6192-515210aAcute toxicity of fluazinam to aquatic organisms and its bioaccumulation in Brachydanio rerio  ap. 35000-35007.  aFluazinam (FZN) is a dinitroaniline fungicide. To evaluate the environmental risk of FZN in aquatic environments and ascertain the potential danger to typical aquatic organisms in China, the acute toxicity of FZN to representative aquatic organisms, including Brachydanio rerio, Chlorella vulgaris Beij., Daphnia magna Straus, and Xenopus laevis, was measured, and its bioaccumulation properties in Brachydanio rerio were further investigated. The results showed that the acute toxicity of FZN to Brachydanio rerio and Xenopus laevis is extremely high, and the bioaccumulation factor BCF₈d of FZN in Brachydanio rerio ranges between 2287 and 3570, implying that it has high bioaccumulation properties. FZN poses a strong environmental risk for aquatic organisms and possesses great bioaccumulation properties, which may cause pollution to aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200201cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aXenopus laevis 3aacute toxicity 3abioaccumulation factor 3afungicides 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3aChina1 aKong, Deyang1 aZhang, Weidong1 aBu, Yuanqing1 aLi, Juying1 aShan, Zhengjun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.35000-35007dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09779-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011000161300001600271520123300287592002801520650001501548650001301563650002001576650001701596650001801613650002201631650001801653650001201671650001301683650001501696650001501711650001101726650002401737650001401761650001601775700002301791773012801814856007801942852000902020655001202029IND60445648920221117002909.0151029e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044564892DNAL7 a10.5735/086.052.04012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReunanen, Pasi10aDynamic Animal Populations in Managed Forests: Species Ecological Requirements and Sustainable Harvesting  ap. 221-235.  aForest management has altered forested environments and provoked stress to many natural habitats and biodiversity. The goal of biodiversity management is the long-term persistence of populations in human-modified environments. We demonstrate a spatio-temporal modeling approach to address the relationship between various management objectives and population persistence in the long-term in a commercial forest landscape. We used the flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) as example species. They are all forest species but they have distinctly different habitat requirements. In the model, forest growth, forest clearing and regional population dynamics were simulated and operated simultaneously. We addressed regional population persistence by varying the conservation goal: First, there are no obligations to protect the species. Second, forest stands where the species occur are not cleared. Third, the entire species' habitat is preserved. The general message from our analysis is that the sustainable area cleared annually depends on the species' habitat requirements, and species' responses to management have various time lags.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegithalos 3aPicoides 3aPteromys volans 3abiodiversity 3aforest growth 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3asquirrels 3awoodpeckers1 aMönkkönen, Mikko0 tAnnales zoologici Fennici.g2015 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.221-235dFinnish Zoological and Botanical Publishingx0003-455X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5735%2F086.052.04013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009400159300002000253500001900273520133200292592002801624650005201652650001601704650002901720650001601749650002701765650001301792650001701805650001701822700001901839773012501858856007401983852000902057655001202066IND60715858620221118212249.0201104e20201102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071585862DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra08222h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Puja10aAmino acid interacting network in the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  ap. 39831-39841.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe relation between amino acid (AA) sequence and biologically active conformation controls the process of polypeptide chains folding into three-dimensional (3d) protein structures. The recent achievements in the resolution achieved in cryo-electron microscopy coupled with improvements in computational methodologies have accelerated the analysis of structures and properties of proteins. However, the detailed interaction between AAs has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we present a de novo method to evaluate inter-amino acid interactions based on the concept of accurately evaluating the amino acid bond pairs (AABP). The results obtained enabled the identification of complex 3d long-range interconnected AA interacting network in proteins. The method is applied to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that although nearest-neighbor AAs in the primary sequence have large AABP, other nonlocal AAs make substantial contribution to AABP with significant participation of both covalent and hydrogen bonding. Detailed analysis of AABP in RBD reveals the pivotal role they play in sequence conservation with profound implications on residue mutations and for therapeutic drug design. This approach could be easily applied to many other proteins of biomedical interest in life sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acids 3acryo-electron microscopy 3adrug design 3agermplasm conservation 3ahydrogen 3apolypeptides 3atherapeutics1 aChing, Wai-Yim0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 02, v. 10, no. 65 p.39831-39841dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08222h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245017300174300001600347520141500363592002801778650001201806650001201818650002301830650001301853650001901866650001101885650001401896650001401910650002101924650001101945650001601956653001801972653001501990653001202005653001802017653001402035653002402049700006202073700001902135773009702154856008502251852000902336655001202345IND60783490720221116165108.0220906e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078349072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Jonathan D.14aThe use of kaolin and dolomite bed additives as an agglomeration mitigation method for wheat straw and miscanthus biomass fuels in a pilot-scale fluidized bed combustor  ap. 749-762.  aRenewable biomass fuels are frequently used for power generation. Biomass ash causes bed agglomeration in fluidized bed boilers due to the formation of alkali silicate melts. Very few prior studies have tested dolomite and kaolin bed additives for agglomeration mitigation with agricultural biomasses. In this work, pelletized miscanthus and wheat straw were tested in a pilot-scale 65kWₜₕ fluidized bed combustor with varying dosages of dolomite and kaolin on a silica sand bed. Neither additive improved defluidization time with wheat straw, whereas additive use at all dosages prevented bed defluidization with miscanthus. Agglomerates were studied through a novel, detailed SEM/EDX analysis across structural features. SEM/EDX analysis presented evidence of chemical reaction between both additives and fuels. Potassium in ash migrated into kaolin particle at depths of up to 60 μm. With dolomite, calcium and magnesium raised melt temperatures. Thermochemical modelling of the ash and additive combinations predicted that additive use would substantially reduce ash melt formation. It is proposed that the wheat straw pellet acted as a “ready-made” agglomerate structure due to release of molten ash to the pellet surface which bed material then sticks to, hence the lack of change to defluidization time regardless of additive use. Future studies into this behaviour would improve additive use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acalcium 3achemical reactions 3adolomite 3afluidized beds 3akaolin 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3apower generation 3aquartz 3awheat straw 0aFluidized bed 0aCombustion 0aBiomass 0aAgglomeration 0aAdditives 0aAgricultural wastes1 aDaood, Syed Sheraz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4580-25041 aNimmo, William0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 196 p.749-762dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007100167300001600238520164700254592002801901650001801929650001201947650001101959650001001970650001501980650002601995650001802021650002002039650000902059650002202068650002002090650001102110653001202121653001102133653002702144653002602171653001602197700001902213700002002232773007802252856008102330852000902411655001202420IND50072331920221119161753.0160511e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233192DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0325-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Trivima10aExpression pattern of PsAPY1 during apical hook development in pea  ap. 293-299.  aApyrase (ATP diphosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.5) catalyzes hydrolysis of nucleoside tri- and di-phosphates to nucleoside monophosphates and orthophosphates. In the present study, the spatio-temporal expression of an apyrase gene (PsAPY1) in pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska), was investigated during early stages of apical hook development using nonradioactive mRNA in-situ hybridization. During the formation of apical hook; at 45 hours after sowing (HAS), expression of PsAPY1 was obvious in epidermis and vascular bundle. By 60 HAS, the apical hook was completely formed. At this stage, transcript accumulation became higher than at the previous stage and expression was also visible in the cortex tissues of the developing hook. However, at 78 HAS, the curvature of the hook was reduced and hook was in the process of opening. At this time, expression of PsAPY1 was visible in all the above-mentioned tissues although the level of expression was slightly lower than at the previous stage (60 HAS). Apical hook formation provides a unique mechanism of protection for delicate shoot meristem in dicot plants. Its establishment is orchestrated by differential elongation rates of cells within the structure. The expression pattern of a gene provides essential information concerning the likely appearance and localization of its encoded protein and this helps to understand the mechanism of development of plant cells and tissues. Higher expression of PsAPY1 during the process of hook development indicates its essential role in the process of formation and maintenance of hook curvature and thus aids in protection of delicate shoot meristem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aapyrase 3acortex 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3aorthophosphates 3apeas 3aplant development 3ashoot meristems 3asowing 0aapyrase 0aPsAPY1 0aATP diphosphohydrolase 0ain-situ hybridization 0aapical hook1 aMorita, Eugene1 aAbe, Shunnosuke0 tBiologia.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 69, no. 3 p.293-299dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0325-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008100173300001600254500002000270500000900290520218800299592002802487596007502515596007302590596001802663650003502681650002202716650002102738650001502759650002102774650001202795650001202807650001502819650001102834650001302845650002902858650001302887650002102900650002502921650002802946650001302974650001302987650001603000650001903016650001203035650001103047650000903058651001103067700002503078700002603103700001903129773013303148856008303281852000903364655001203373IND60663474820221121020615.0220803e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347482DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2018.03.01982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Emerson F.

Regardless of the nitrogen source, the nitrogen fertilization increased the potato tuber yield up to rates between 136 kg nitrogen ha⁻¹ and at least 160 kg nitrogen ha⁻¹. Ammonium sulfate nitrate plus DMPP promoted greater total and marketable tuber yields than urea and higher agronomic efficiency compared to urea and ammonium sulfate. There is a potential for ammonium sulfate nitrate plus DMPP to improve the synchronization between soil nitrogen availability and potato nitrogen demand when potato is cultivated in a tropical sandy soil. A suitable N source and an optimal application rate can improve the N‐use efficiency of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) while minimizing N losses, especially when potato is grown in sandy soils. Three experiments were conducted at irrigated sandy soil sites in São Paulo State, Brazil, to evaluate the effects of ammonium sulfate (AMS), ammonium sulfate nitrate with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4‐dimethylpyrazole phosphate (ASN+DMPP), and urea applied at three N rates (80, 120, and 160 kg ha⁻¹), as well as a zero‐N control on potato (cv. Agata). Leaf N and S concentrations, tuber yield, and agronomic efficiency (AE) were measured. The 80 kg N ha⁻¹ rate was applied in the furrow at planting, and the other rates were split‐applied, with 40 kg N ha⁻¹ in the furrow at planting and the remainder applied at hilling. Regardless of the N source, the N fertilizer rates increased the potato leaf N concentration and tuber bulking of the potato crop, which in turn increased the tuber yield up to rates between 136 kg N ha⁻¹ and at least 160 kg N ha⁻¹. Among the N sources, ASN+DMPP fertilizer resulted in a higher potato tuber set and yield than urea and led to the highest AE compared to AMS and urea. Overall, these results suggest the potential for ASN+DMPP to improve the synchronization between soil N availability and potato N demand and provide a more appropriate balance of N forms in the soil when potato is cultivated in sandy soils in a tropical climate.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)  cNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)  cIoshida Group 3a3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aammonium sulfate 3acrop yield 3afertilizer rates 3afurrows 3ahilling 3airrigation 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3asandy soils 3atropical soils 3atropics 3atubers 3aurea 3aBrazil1 aSoratto, Rogério P.1 aFernandes, Adalton M.1 aRosen, Carl J.0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Jan., v. 111, no. 1 p.378-389dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.03.01983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013400157300002000291520103200311592002801343650002101371650000901392650002201401650000901423650001301432650001401445650002101459650001301480650002101493650001301514700001701527773012401544856007401668852000901742655001201751IND60641990620221118223846.0190506e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064199062DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04741j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Zhenlei10aPhase transformations of vanadium recovery from refractory stone coal by novel NaOH molten roasting and water leaching technology  ap. 36917-36922.  aIn this study, a novel NaOH molten roasting and water leaching technology, an eco-friendly process with good selectivity and good availability, was investigated for vanadium recovery from refractory stone coal. In addition, the phase transformations during the vanadium recovery process were also studied. During the NaOH molten roasting process, the monoclinic crystalline structure of muscovite (K(Al,V)₂[Si₃AlO₁₀](OH)₂) was converted into the orthorhombic crystalline structure of Na₂SiO₃ and the tetragonal crystalline structure of gehlenite (Ca₂Al₂SiO₇); this could promote the liberation and recovery of vanadium. During the water leaching process, the tetragonal crystalline structure of gehlenite (Ca₂Al₂SiO₇) was converted into the monoclinic crystalline structure of Ca₃Si₂O₇·H₂O. Ca₃Si₂O₇·H₂O, a kind of C–S–H gel, produced during the water leaching process probably covered the surface of the roscoelite and thus prevented effective vanadium recovery from roscoelite.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium silicate 3acoal 3acrystal structure 3agels 3aleaching 3amuscovite 3aphase transition 3aroasting 3asodium hydroxide 3avanadium1 aZhang, Yimin0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 26, v. 7, no. 59 p.36917-36922dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04741j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013100169300001400300520099800314592002801312650001901340650001601359650001401375650001301389650001301402650002701415650001501442650001101457650002901468650002501497650002901522650001301551650001901564650001701583650001101600650001001611650001301621653001501634653003501649653002701684653005401711653003301765700001801798700001201816700001601828700001801844773011101862856008601973852000902059655001202068IND60592480720221118040509.0190325e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059248072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shukai10aDurability and environment evaluation of an eco-friendly cement-based material incorporating recycled chromium containing slag  ap. 23-31.  aThis study investigates the durability of cement-based materials incorporating recycled chromium containing slag (CCS), including chloride permeability, carbonation resistance, freeze-thaw cycle and microstructure development. Additionally, the environmental impacts on the cement-based material with the addition of CCS are evaluated by toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and energy consumption. The obtained results show that the durability properties of chromium containing slag concrete (CCSC) are improved based on the addition of 20–25 wt% CCS and 5–10 wt% silica fume (SF), and the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) can be well immobilized in the cement-based product. Furthermore, the incorporation of recycled CCS can significantly reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emission of cement-based materials. Based on this study, it is possible to utilize the recycled CCS to produce a clean and durable eco-friendly construction product.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3achlorides 3achromium 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adurability 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aleaching 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3asilica 3aslags 3atoxicity 0aDurability 0aChromium containing slag (CCS) 0aEnvironment evaluation 0aToxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) 0aHexavalent chromium (Cr(VI))1 aShui, Zhonghe1 aYu, Rui1 aZhang, Xiao1 aZhu, Shouyong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 01, v. 185 p.23-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009300162300001600255520103300271592002801304650002901332650002401361650001001385650001301395650001901408650002201427650002301449650001201472650001901484650001301503650001101516651001601527700002501543700001801568700002301586700003001609700002801639700002001667700001601687700002201703700002501725700002101750700002301771700002801794700003501822700002401857700001701881700002201898700002801920700000701948773012801955856007802083852000902161655001202170IND60445650120221122081918.0151029e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044565012DNAL7 a10.5735/086.052.04042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Anthony D.10aCurrent and Potential Threats to Nordic Duck Populations — A Horizon Scanning Exercise  ap. 193-220.  aWe review the current and future threats to duck populations that breed, stage, moult and/or winter in the Nordic countries. Migratory duck species are sensitive indicators of their changing environment, and their societal value confirms the need to translate signals from changes in their distribution, status and abundance into a better understanding of changes occurring in their wetland environments. We used expert opinion to highlight 25 major areas of anthropogenic change (and touch briefly on potential mitigation measures through nature restoration and reserve management projects) that we consider key issues likely to influence Nordic duck populations now and in the near future to stimulate debate, discussion and further research. We believe such reviews are essential in contributing to development of successful management policy as well as stimulating specific research to support the maintenance of duck species in favourable future conservation status in the face of multiple population pressures and drivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aconservation status 3aducks 3aexercise 3aexpert opinion 3aissues and policy 3amigratory behavior 3amolting 3asocial benefit 3awetlands 3awinter 3aScandinavia1 aJónsson, Jón Einar1 aAarvak, Tomas1 aBregnballe, Thomas1 aChristensen, Thomas Kjær1 aClausen, Kevin Kuhlmann1 aClausen, Preben1 aDalby, Lars1 aHolm, Thomas Eske1 aPavón-Jordan, Diego1 aLaursen, Karsten1 aLehikoinen, Aleksi1 aLorentsen, Svein-Håkon1 aMøller, A.

Propolis is a natural product derived from plant resins and contains chemical compounds with potential antimicrobial activity against N. ceranae. Here, we determined the efficacy of propolis from A. mellifera (USA) and Tetrigona apicalis (stingless bees, Thailand) colonies as treatments for N. ceranae infection in honey bee workers. Newly emerged bees were individually fed 2 μL of 50% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 1 × 10⁵N. ceranae spores. Following this, the infected bees were treated with 50% propolis extracted from A. mellifera or T. apicalis hives and fed in 50% sucrose solution (v/v). All bees were maintained at 34 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5% RH. Dead bees were counted daily for 30 d to calculate survival. We also determined infection rate (# infected bees/100 bees), infectivity (number of spores per bee) and protein content in the hypopharyngeal glands and hemolymph on 7, 14, and 21 d post infection as measures of bee health. Propolis from both bee species significantly reduced bee mortality, infection rate and infectivity compared with those of untreated bees and led to significantly greater protein contents in hypopharyngeal glands and hemolymph in treated bees than in untreated ones (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, propolis from A. mellifera and T. apicalis colonies shows promise as a control against N. ceranae infection in honey bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema ceranae 3aantimicrobial properties 3ahemolymph 3ahoney 3ainvertebrates 3amortality 3apathogenicity 3apropolis 3aprotein content 3astingless bees 3asucrose 3aThailand 0aHoney bee 0aTetrigona apicalis 0aStingless bee1 aBenbow, Mark E.1 aSuwannapong, Guntima1 aEllis, James D.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2021 Oct., v. 185 p.107666-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2021.1076663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245006100206300001400267520102000281592002801301650001101329650001301340650001501353650001701368650001101385650002401396650001401420650002301434650002001457650002701477653001301504653001301517653001901530653001701549653001801566653001501584700001801599700001601617773011401633856008801747852000901835655001201844IND60540229120221119181705.0190318e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054022912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1661-414910aEffects of sediments on the reproductive cycle of corals  ap. 13-33.  aDredging, river plumes and natural resuspension events can release sediments into the water column where they exert a range of effects on underlying communities. In this review we examine possible cause–effect pathways whereby light reduction, elevated suspended sediments and sediment deposition could affect the reproductive cycle and early life histories of corals. The majority of reported or likely effects (30+) were negative, including a suite of previously unrecognized effects on gametes. The length of each phase of the life-cycle was also examined together with analysis of water quality conditions that can occur during a dredging project over equivalent durations, providing a range of environmentally relevant exposure scenarios for future testing. The review emphasizes the need to: (a) accurately quantify exposure conditions, (b) identify the mechanism of any effects in future studies, and (c) recognize the close interlinking of proximate factors which could confound interpretation of studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3adredging 3agerm cells 3alife history 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3awater pollution 3awater quality analysis 0aSediment 0aDredging 0aCoral spawning 0aReproduction 0aFertilization 0aSettlement1 aRicardo, G.F.1 aNegri, A.P.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 100, no. 1 p.13-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010900160300002000269520069300289592002800982650001201010650002201022650002001044650001301064650001301077650001401090650001301104700002101117700002101138700002101159700002001180700002401200700001901224700001801243700001901261773012401280856007401404852000901478655001201487IND60641990720221118223841.0190506e20170626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064199072DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04742h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravkina, O.

Mg electrodeposition processes in two specific PEGylated-ILs were compared against that in the widely studied N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid (BMPyrTFSI). The two chelating IL systems (one with a pendent polyether chain with three ether oxygens, MPEG₃PyrTFSI, and the other with a seven-ether chain, MPEG₇PyrTFSI) showed substantial improvement over BMPyrTFSI for Mg electrodeposition/dissolution. The best overall electrochemical performance was in MPEG₇PyrTFSI. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize galvanostatically deposited Mg, revealing production of pure, dendrite-free Mg deposits. Reversible Mg electrodeposition was achieved with high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 90% and high current density (ca. 2 mA/cm² for the stripping peak). Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize Mg²⁺ speciation in the PEGylated ILs and BMPyrTFSI containing Mg(BH₄)₂ by study of Raman modes of the coordinated and free states of borohydride, TFSI–, and polyether COC groups. Quantitative analysis revealed that the polyether chains can displace both TFSI– and BH₄– from the coordination sphere of Mg²⁺. Comparison of the different IL electrolytes suggested that these displacement reactions may play a role in enabling Mg deposition/dissolution with high CE and current density in these PEGylated IL media. These results represent the first demonstration of reversible electrochemical deposition/dissolution of Mg in an ionic liquid specifically designed with this task in mind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aquantitative analysis 3acations 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnesium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aionic liquids 3aRaman spectroscopy 0aelectrolytes1 aKumar, Ashok1 aButtry, Daniel A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 138, no. 2 p.641-650dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b110313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006400173300001800237520048600255536016600741592002800907596002600935650002000961650001200981650002800993650001501021653001301036653001601049653001201065653001701077700002001094773012601114856008601240852000901326655001201335IND60699837620221119195056.0200708e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069983762DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.17544822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVendetti, Jann E.10aSpecies name formation for zoologists: a pragmatic approach  ap. 2999-3018.  aThe formation of scientific names for species may be challenging for modern systematists without a background in Latin or familiarity with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Using Geographic Information System (GIS) and SPSS, the spatial and temporal patterns of ozone in Shenzhen were illustrated. Using a generalized additive model (GAM), the associations between ozone and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases causing mortality were analyzed, adjusted for meteorological factors and other major air pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) and carbon monoxide (CO), and stratified by lag, age, and gender. The results showed that, during 2013, ozone was the second main air pollutant in Shenzhen apart from PM<inf>2.5</inf>, with average daily concentrations of 95.9 µg/m3 and 76.8 µg/m3 for the ozone 1-h mean and the daily ozone 8-h maximum concentration, respectively. The daily level of ozone had a higher concentration from September to October, and relatively low concentration from May to June. Obviously, a higher concentration was found in central parts of Shenzhen with the largest population, indicating higher risks. The excess risk (ER) percentage of the cardio-respiratory mortality rate showed a clearly accumulative effect at L03, with the highest ER percentage of 1.08 (0.88–1.27) per 10 µg/m3 increase in the ozone 8-h maximum concentration for all the population. Males were found to be more sensitive to ozone compared with females, and the elderly were more susceptible to ozone exposure than younger people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acarbon monoxide 3aelderly 3afemales 3ageographic information systems 3ahealth effects assessments 3amales 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk1 aBai, Yu1 aZhang, Fengying1 aWang, Wuyi1 aLiu, Xiaojian1 aKrafft, Thomas0 tSustainability.g2017 Apr. 07, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90405593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012300187300001600310520143400326592002801760650001101788650002401799650002801823650001201851650002301863650001501886650001701901650001001918650002301928650001701951650001501968650001401983650001001997650003702007650003802044650001202082650002602094650002702120650003402147650005202181650005302233650002702286650002802313650007502341650005102416650002902467650006702496650006802563650002902631650000902660650001402669700002502683700001702708700002502725700002302750700002302773773010502796856008402901852000902985655001202994IND60113895120221121084243.0141112e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389512DNAL7 a230008162pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAloui, Achref10aInfluence of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation on cadmium induced Medicago truncatula root isoflavonoid accumulation  ap. 233-239.  aCadmium is a serious environmental pollution threats to the planet. Its accumulation in plants affects many cellular functions, resulting in growth and development inhibition, whose mechanisms are not fully understood. However, some fungi forming arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis with the majority of plant species have the capacity to buffer the deleterious effect of this heavy metal. In the present work we investigated the capacity of Rhizophagus irregularis (syn. Glomus irregularis) to alleviate cadmium stress in Medicago truncatula. In spite of a reduction in all mycorrhizal parameters, plants colonized for 21 days by R. irregularis and treated by 2mgkg⁻¹ cadmium displayed less growth inhibition in comparison to plants grown without cadmium. Cadmium strongly increased the accumulation of some isoflavonoids and their derivates: formononetin, malonylononin, medicarpin 3-O-β-(6′-malonylglucoside), medicarpin and coumestrol. Interestingly, in plants colonized by R. irregularis we noticed a strong reduction of the cadmium-induced accumulation of root isoflavonoids, a part for medicarpin and coumestrol. Moreover, transcripts of chalcone reductase, a protein that we reported previously as being down-regulated in R. irregularis-colonized M. truncatula roots, revealed a similar expression pattern with a strong increase in response to cadmium and a reduced expression in cadmium-treated mycorrhizal roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus 3aMedicago truncatula 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3acadmium 3achalcone reductase 3acoumestrol 3aformononetin 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3aheavy metals 3amedicarpin 3apollution 3aroots 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aBiomass 2aCadmiumxpharmacology 2aCoumestrolxmetabolism 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGlomeromycotaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGlucosidesxmetabolism 2aIsoflavonesxmetabolism 2aMedicago truncatulaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPterocarpansxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aSymbiosis1 aDumas-Gaudot, Eliane1 aDaher, Zeina1 avan Tuinen, Diederik1 aAschi-Smit, Samira1 aMorandi, Dominique0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 60 p.233-239dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013500187300001800322520113300340592002801473650001501501650001601516650001101532650002201543650000901565650000901574650001601583650000901599650001301608650001401621650002101635650002401656650001701680650001201697650006201709650004601771650001101817650003501828650001801863650001001881650000901891650000901900650002401909650002501933650002501958650002901983650005002012650002602062650003602088700002502124700002202149700002002171700001802191700002202209700002702231773010802258856008102366990002302447852000902470655001202479IND60090620820221120023940.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009062082DNAL7 a214213212pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamashita, Shuji10aControlled-release system of single-stranded DNA triggered by the photothermal effect of gold nanorods and its in vivo application  ap. 2130-2135.  aGold nanorods have strong absorption bands in the near-infrared region, in which light penetrates deeply into tissues. The absorbed light energy is converted into heat by gold nanorods, the so-called ‘photothermal effect’. Hence, gold nanorods are expected to act not only as on-demand thermal converters for photothermal therapy but also as controllers of a drug-release system responding to irradiation by near-infrared light. To achieve a controlled-release system that can be triggered by light irradiation, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was modified on gold nanorods. When the dsDNA-modified gold nanorods were irradiated by near-infrared light, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was released from gold nanorods due to the photothermal effect. The amount of released ssDNA was dependent upon the power and exposure time of light irradiation. Release of ssDNA was also observed in tumors grown on mice after light irradiation. Such a controlled-release system of oligonucleotide triggered by the photothermal effect could expand the applications of gold nanorods that have unique optical characteristics in medicinal fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acontrollers 3aenergy 3aexposure duration 3agold 3aheat 3airradiation 3amice 3ananorods 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aGoldxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aHumans 2aHyperthermia, Inducedxmethods 2aInfrared Rays 2aLight 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aNanotubesxchemistry 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxmetabolismxtherapy. 2aPhototherapyxmethods 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxchemistry1 aFukushima, Hiromitsu1 aAkiyama, Yasuyuki1 aNiidome, Yasuro1 aMori, Takeshi1 aKatayama, Yoshiki1 aNiidome, T.q(Takuro),0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 19, no. 7 p.2130-2135dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009500167300001800262520137600280592002801656650001501684650001301699650001301712650001101725650001301736650003301749650001301782650001101795650001901806653001401825653001201839653000901851653001501860653002401875700002001899773012601919856008602045852000902131655001202140IND60699837720221119194737.0200708e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069983772DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.17564962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalma, Umme10aMicroscopic morphology of the antennule and antenna of the marine isopod Cirolana harfordi  ap. 2929-2949.  aThe use of scanning electron microscopy on the cuticle outgrowths called setae (that contain sensilla) in crustaceans is useful for, understanding how crustacean species sense their environment and for taxonomic studies. So far, most of the setal morphology studies have been performed on decapod crustaceans such as lobsters and shrimps and there has been a comparative lack of such research on marine isopods, from which terrestrial isopods such as woodlice or slaters have evolved. In the current study, electron microscopy was used to study the antennal setae of the marine isopod Cirolana harfordi using magnification powers of up to 40, 000. C. harfordi displayed a number of setal types including setae that had a sub-terminal pore that contained a cupule-shaped structure and plumose setae which are pennate in structure and have two rows of setules along the setal shaft in a fashion analogous to a palm leaf. These plumose setae may be useful to the animal in detecting water currents. Differences in the structure and placement of setae on the antennae of C. harfordi as compared to two other marine isopods, Bathynomus pelor and Natatolana borealis (that have had a comprehensive study of antennae setal morphology performed on them in previous studies) indicate that scanning electron microscopy of isopod setae may be useful in taxonomic studies of isopods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBathynomus 3aDecapoda 3aantennae 3aleaves 3alobsters 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensilla 3ashrimp 3awater currents 0aAntennule 0aantenna 0aseta 0acrustacean 0amarine invertebrate1 aThomson, Murray0 tJournal of natural history.g2019 Dec. 25, v. 53, no. 47-48 p.2929-2949dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2020.17564963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012700176300001400303520113700317592002801454650002301482650001301505650001701518650001901535650002801554650001001582650003201592650001801624700002401642700002001666700001901686700001701705700001801722773011001740856008301850852000901933655001201942IND60087465820221120132342.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008746582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Prashant Kumar10aAntifungal, anti-aflatoxigenic, and antioxidant efficacy of Jamrosa essential oil for preservation of herbal raw materials  ap. 11-16.  aThis study reports on fungal deterioration of five herbal raw materials and the antifungal, anti-aflatoxigenic, and antioxidant efficacy of Jamrosa essential oil (EO) and its two major components. Herbal raw materials were found associated with 14 fungal species, including strains of aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus. Jamrosa EO and its major components Z-citral and linalyl acetate were assessed against the highest aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) producing strain, A. flavus LHPA₉. Jamrosa EO MIC for A. flavus LHPA₉ and the concentration that suppressed aflatoxin B₁ production was 0.4 μl ml⁻¹. This EO was found more efficacious than its major components individually as well as in combination. Z-citral inhibited AFB₁ completely at 1.0 μl ml⁻¹ while linalyl acetate did so at 0.7 μl ml⁻¹. The combination of both the compounds completely inhibited AFB₁ production at 0.8 μl ml⁻¹. Free radical scavenging activities (IC₅₀) of EO, Z-citral, linalyl acetate, and a combination of both compounds were 86 μl ml⁻¹, 94 μl ml⁻¹, 217 μl ml⁻¹, and 158 μl ml⁻¹, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aacetates 3aaflatoxin B1 3aessential oils 3afree radical scavengers 3afungi 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3araw materials1 aŚuklā, Ravīndra,1 aSingh, Priyanka1 aPrakash, Bhanu1 aKedia, Akash1 aDubey, N.

Attenuation of EGF-receptor (EGFR) signaling is mediated by endocytosis and ubiquitination by the E3-ligase Cbl. En route to lysosomes, but before incorporation of the EGFR into internal vesicles of MVBs, the EGFR undergoes Usp8-mediated deubiquitination. ErbB2 displays enhanced recycling back to the cell surface, and therefore we hypothesized that Usp8 is not part of the ErbB2 trafficking pathway. Here, we demonstrate, in the context of a chimeric EGFR-ErbB2 receptor, that (i) EGF induces pY1091 Cbl binding site-dependent K63-polyubiquitination of EGFR-ErbB2, (ii) Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation of EGFR-ErbB2 wt and Y1091F mutant receptor, (iii) EGF-induced activation of EGFR-ErbB2 induces Usp8 tyrosine phosphorylation, and (iv) ubiquitination of the EGFR-ErbB2 wt and Y1091F mutant is enhanced upon coexpression of catalytically inactive Usp8-C748A in the presence and absence of EGF. We further show that Usp8 tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of EGFR-ErbB2 is (a) independent of Y1091, (b) dependent on Src- and EGFR-ErbB2-kinase activity, (c) enhanced upon coexpression of Usp8-C748A, and (d) partly dependent on the Microtubule Interacting and Transport (MIT) domain of Usp8. Our findings demonstrate that Usp8 is part of the ErbB2 endosomal trafficking pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3achimerism 3aendocytosis 3alysosomes 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3atyrosine 3aubiquitination1 avan Leeuwen, Jeroen E.M.0 tCellular signalling.g2011 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.458-467dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.10.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014200173300001600315520074100331592002801072650001701100650001701117650002701134650001001161650001501171700002401186700005801210700005901268773017101327856008401498852000901582655001201591IND60687192120221117234843.0200327e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068719212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b010512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForster, Louise C.10aDynamic NMR and Computational Studies Inform the Conformational Description of Dendrillane Terpenes from the Nudibranch Goniobranchus coi  ap. 714-719.  aTwo new oxygenated terpenes (1 and 2) have been characterized from the Australian nudibranch Goniobranchus coi.

The study unveils the following: (i) propylene prefers 1,2‐insertion over 2,1‐insertion both kinetically and thermodynamically, explaining the observed 1,2‐insertion regioselectivity for propylene insertion. (ii) The 2,1‐inserion of pMS is kinetically less favorable but thermodynamically more favorable than 1,2‐insertion. The observation of 2,1‐insertion pMS at the end of polymer chain is due to thermodynamic control and that the barrier difference between the two insertion modes become smaller as the chain length becomes longer. (iii) The pMS insertion results in much higher barriers for subsequent either propylene or pMS insertion, which causes deactivation of the catalytic system. (iv) Small H₂can react with the deactivated [Zr]−pMS−PPₙfacilely, which displace functionalized pMS−PPₙchain and regenerate [Zr]H active catalyst to continue copolymerization. The effects of counterions are also discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The well known pharmacological effect is a result of the ability of cardiac glycosides to inhibit the Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase. Within recent years cardiac glycosides have furthermore been suggested to possess valuable anticancer activity. To mimic the labile trisaccharide of digitoxin with a stabile carbohydrate surrogate, we have used sulfur linked ethylene glycol moieties of varying length (mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-ethylene glycol), and furthermore used these linkers as handles for the synthesis of bivalent steroids. The prepared compounds were evaluated for their potencies to inhibit the Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase and for their cytotoxic effect on cancerous MCF-7 cells. A clear trend is observed in both inhibition and cytotoxic effect, where the bioactivity decreases as the size increases. The most potent Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase inhibitors are the compounds with the shortest ethylene glycol chain (Kₐₚₚ 0.48μM) and thiodigitoxigenin (Kₐₚₚ 0.42μM), which both are comparable with digitoxigenin (Kₐₚₚ 0.52μM). For the cancer cell viability assay the shortest mimics were found to have highest efficacy, with the best ligand having a monoethylene glycol unit (IC₅₀ 0.24μM), which was slightly better than digitoxigenin (IC₅₀ 0.64μM), while none of the novel cardiac glycoside mimics display an in vitro effect as high as digitoxin (IC₅₀ 0.02μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell viability 3achemistry 3acytotoxicity 3adigitoxigenin 3adigitoxin 3aethylene glycol 3aheart failure 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3asodium 3asulfur 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBiomimetic Materialsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDigitoxinxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism.1 aSchmidt, Steffen1 aFedosova, Natalya U.1 aMollenhauer, Jan1 aJensen, Henrik H.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 19, no. 7 p.2407-2417dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008200212300001600294520099500310592002801305650001501333650004501348650001701393650001401410650003101424650002101455650003601476700002001512700002201532700001601554773009201570856008501662990002301747852000901770655001201779IND60098215020221118045209.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009821502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0032doi7 aPMC30845312pmcid7 a207279682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTristan, Carlos14aThe diverse functions of GAPDH: Views from different subcellular compartments  ap. 317-323.  aMultiple roles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) have been recently appreciated. In addition to the cytoplasm where the majority of GAPDH is located under the basal condition, GAPDH is also found in the particulate fractions, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, and the small vesicular fractions. When cells are exposed to various stressors, dynamic subcellular re-distribution of GAPDH occurs. Here we review these multifunctional properties of GAPDH, especially linking them to its oligomerization, posttranslational modification, and subcellular localization. This includes mechanistic descriptions of how S-nitrosylation of GAPDH under oxidative stress may lead to cell death/dysfunction via nuclear translocation of GAPDH, which is counteracted by a cytosolic GOSPEL. GAPDH is also involved in various diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Therapeutic strategies to these conditions based on molecular understanding of GAPDH are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell death 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amitochondria 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative stress 3apost-translational modification1 aShahani, Neelam1 aSedlak, Thomas W.1 aSawa, Akira0 tCellular signalling.g2011 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.317-323dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245010300166520182200269592002802091650001402119650001702133650001402150650002502164650001702189650002402206650001502230650001102245650001502256650001602271650002102287650001502308650001102323650003002334650002702364650001402391650001402405650001702419650002102436650001302457650001902470650002002489653001402509653001902523653001702542653003002559773011502589856007602704852000902780655001202789IND60728278020221121104430.0210219e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072827802DNAL7 a10.3897/rio.3.e149442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKissling, W. Daniel10aHas frugivory influenced the macroecology and diversification of a tropical keystone plant family?  aSeed dispersal by fruit-eating animals is a pivotal ecosystem function in tropical forests, but the role that frugivores have played in the biogeography and macroevolution of species-rich tropical plant families remains largely unexplored. This project investigates how frugivory-relevant plant traits (e.g. fruit size, fruit color, fruit shape etc.) are distributed within the angiosperm family of palms (Arecaceae), how this relates to diversification rates, and whether and how it coincides with the global biogeographic distribution of vertebrate frugivores (birds, bats, primates, other frugivorous mammals) and their ecological traits (e.g. diet specialization, body size, flight ability, color vision etc.). Palms are particularly suitable because they are well studied, species-rich, characteristic of tropical rainforests, and dispersed by all groups of vertebrate seed dispersers. Using newly compiled data on species distributions and ecological traits in combination with phylogenies we will test (1) how fruit trait variability relates to palm phylogeny and other aspects of plant morphology (e.g. leaf size, plant height, growth form), (2) whether geographic variability in fruit traits correlates with geographic distributions of animal consumers and their traits, and (3) to what extent interaction-relevant plant traits are related to palm diversification rates. This combined macroecological and macroevolutionary approach allows novel insights into the global ecology and the evolution of a tropical keystone plant family. This is important for the conservation and sustainable management of tropical rainforests because palms are often key components of subsistence economies, ecosystem dynamics and carbon storage and therefore help to enhance nature’s goods, benefits and services to humanity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArecaceae 3abiogeography 3abody size 3acarbon sequestration 3acolor vision 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aflight 3afrugivores 3afruit color 3afruit morphology 3afruit size 3afruits 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3aleaf area 3aphylogeny 3aplant height 3aplant morphology 3aresearch 3aseed dispersal 3atropical plants 0aFrugivory 0amacroevolution 0amacroecology 0aplant-animal interactions0 tResearch Ideas and Outcomes.g2017 July 11, v. 3 p.e14944-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27349x2367-71637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e149443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173300001800303520229000321592002802611650001602639650002002655650002702675650001502702650001302717650001602730650001402746650001402760650002602774650002302800650001502823650001502838650002402853650000902877650001202886653002202898653001302920653002402933653001102957653000802968653000702976653000802983653000702991700002002998700002203018700006003040700002603100700005603126773009903182856008603281852000903367655001203376IND60633809620221122063533.0191227e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063380962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.02.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorman, Daniel A.10aCaregiver’s attitudes, beliefs, and experiences for influenza vaccination in Australian children with medical comorbidities  ap. 2244-2248.  aInfluenza vaccination is recommended and funded for Australian children with medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe influenza. Despite this, influenza vaccine coverage remains low within this population. We examined caregivers’ attitudes and practices for influenza vaccination in children with medical comorbidities.Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with caregivers of children (6 months to <18 years old) with medical comorbidities attending sub-speciality paediatric outpatient clinics at the Royal Children’s Hospital (Melbourne), Princess Margaret Hospital (Perth), and Leading Steps private paediatric clinic (Gold Coast). Multivariate linear regression was used to identify surveys responses predictive of receipt of influenza vaccination in 2017.From the 611 surveys collected, 556 were suitable for analysis. Caregiver reported 2017 influenza vaccine coverage was 52.2% in children with medical comorbidities. Caregivers who believed influenza vaccines to be ≥50% effective were more likely to vaccinate their children (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]:3.79 (2.41; 5.96). Those who expressed concerns about vaccine side effects were less likely to vaccinate their children (aOR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.30; 0.80]). Influenza vaccine uptake was significantly more likely for children who had been previously recommended influenza vaccination by their hospital-based physician (aOR: 4.33 [95% CI: 2.58; 7.27]) and had previously received a hospital-based vaccination (aOR: 3.11 [95% CI 1.79; 5.40]). Hospital-based physicians were also caregivers’ most commonly reported source of trusted vaccination information (63.5%). Whilst only 29.3% of caregivers reported their child had been recommended influenza vaccination during a previous admission, 80.1% of caregivers stated they were receptive to their child receiving potential future influenza vaccinations during hospitalisations.Reported influenza vaccination coverage in children with medical comorbidities remains inadequate. An important finding of this study is that influenza vaccination recommendation by children’s hospital physicians and previous vaccine receipt in hospital was associated with vaccine uptake. Opportunities for vaccination, especially during hospitalisation, must be examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aadverse effects 3aattitudes and opinions 3acaregivers 3achildren 3acomorbidity 3ahospitals 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3aodds ratio 3aphysicians 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asurveys 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aChildren 0aMedical comorbidity 0aSurvey 0aaOR 0aWA 0aNIP 0aGP1 aDanchin, Margie1 aVan Buynder, Paul1 aMoore, Hannah C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6434-82901 aBlyth, Christopher C.1 aSeale, Holly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1877-53950 tVaccine.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 37, no. 16 p.2244-2248dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.02.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245016000184300001400344520126700358592002801625650002001653650002901673650002301702650001701725650001901742650001101761650001801772650001101790650001801801650001101819650001001830650004101840650001101881650001201892650001601904650002101920650001301941650001901954650000701973650001501980650001301995650001402008650001802022700002902040700002702069700002802096700003202124773011002156856008302266852000902349655001202358IND60087466420221123031554.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008746642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillén-Jiménez, Flor de Ma.10aLindane biodegradation by the Fusarium verticillioides AT-100 strain, isolated from Agave tequilana leaves: Kinetic study and identification of metabolites  ap. 36-47.  aA fungal strain able to use lindane as a carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions was isolated from Agave tequilana leaves by enrichment techniques. With molecular techniques, it was identified as Fusarium verticillioides. The effect of a number of nutritional and environmental factors on the pesticide biodegradation was investigated using a Plackett–Burman design. Lindane biodegradation was higher in the presence of limited amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus. The addition of agave leaves to the culture medium and the use of higher concentrations of lindane, copper, and yeast extract improved the efficiency of the biodegradation process. The analysis of the metabolites using GC–MS identified γ-pentachlorocyclohexene and benzoic acid derivatives. This finding suggests that there is an aerobic carboxylation step, reported for the first time, in the lindane biodegradation pathway of F. verticillioides. Adding organic matter such as Agave tequilana leaves to the culture medium improved the fungal viability, eliminated the lag growth phase for fungal growth, and increased the pH value of the culture medium. The increased pH helped to overcome the toxicity of the benzoic acid derivatives that were released during lindane degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave tequilana 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aaerobic conditions 3abenzoic acid 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarboxylation 3acopper 3aculture media 3aenergy 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleaves 3alindane 3ametabolites 3amicrobial growth 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3atoxicity 3aviability 3ayeast extract1 aCristiani-Urbina, Eliseo1 aCancino-Díaz, Juan C.1 aFlores-Moreno, Jorge L.1 aBarragán-Huerta, Blanca E.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2012 Oct., v. 74 p.36-47dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2012.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016400168300001400332520164500346592002801991650001102019650001702030650001302047650001102060650001902071650001102090650001402101650001502115651001002130653002102140653001802161653002502179653001502204653001802219700001802237700005402255700001902309700001802328773008502346856008502431852000902516655001202525IND60526154420221121183936.0190403e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052615442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2015.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, Alpa10aGeochemical and Sr–Nd isotopic variations in palaeoflood deposits at mainstem–tributary junction, western India: Implications on late Holocene flood events  ap. 32-43.  aElement geochemistry and Sr–Nd isotopes have been used to characterise the palaeoflood sediments at a tributary junction in lower Narmada Valley archiving the Little Ice Age (LIA) and to determine the present day sources for the mainstem and the tributary sediments. The major and trace element concentrations show minor variations in values post 360CalyrBP. The 87Sr/86Sr and εNd values of palaeoflood sediments range from 0.7122 to 0.7191 and −2.89 to +6.28 respectively. The bed sediments from the mainstem river (Narmada) and its tributary (Karjan) yield 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.72394 and 0.7113 and εNd values of −7.18 and +6.09 respectively. Potential sources of palaeoflood sediments have been investigated from Sr and Nd isotope compositions and mixing of the mainstem as well as the tributary sediments is suggested. Pronounced contribution from the Deccan Basalt during the early part of the Little Ice Age is inferred. The more radiogenic Nd values indicate a contribution from the weathering of younger Deccan basalts, especially the Poladpur formations. The control of weathering intensity and mineral sorting is observed in ‘higher than the source rock’ 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the sediments. The major and trace element variations during the last 700years are not conclusive although, isotopic signatures of the flood sediments help in constraining the flux from the tributaries. Sr and Nd isotopic composition of the palaeoflood sediments can be used to track the monsoon intensity and pattern but their concentrations in a fluvial system remain primarily controlled by mineral sorting processes and mixing of sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3ageochemistry 3aisotopes 3amixing 3amonsoon season 3arivers 3astrontium 3aweathering 3aIndia 0aSr–Nd isotopes 0aLate Holocene 0aPalaeoflood deposits 0aSW monsoon 0aWestern India1 aBhushan, Ravi1 aBalaji, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5498-16581 aBand, Shraddha1 aChamyal, L.S.0 tCatena.g2016 Apr., v. 139 p.32-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012400173300001300297500001400310520135100324592002801675650001501703650001501718650001901733650001001752650000901762650001601771650001401787653000801801653001401809653001601823653002001839653001401859653001301873700002501886700002201911773009401933856008202027852000902109655001202118IND60728278320221121104351.0210219e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072827832DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1016.596172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLago-Barcia, Domingo10aRevision and description of six species of Choeradoplana (Platyhelminthes, Tricladida), with an emendation to the genus  ap. 1-48.  aNAL-light  aLiving representatives of the Neotropical genus Choeradoplana Graff, 1896 (Geoplaninae, Tricladida, Platyhelminthes) are easily recognized by the typical shape of the head which is laterally expanded, rolled-up, and ventrally provided with two glandular cushions. In this study, the morphology and phylogeny (cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene) of several species of land planarians are taxonomically investigated. Four of the six species studied are new to science, namely: Ch. eudoxiae Silva & Carbayo, sp. nov., Ch. claudioi Lago-Barcia & Carbayo, sp. nov., Ch. onae Lago-Barcia & Carbayo, sp. nov., and Ch. riutortae Lago-Barcia & Carbayo, sp. nov. The species Choeradoplana albonigra and Ch. eudoxiae deviate from the usual body shape pattern in that the head does not present lateral expansions nor glandular cushions, becoming indistinguishable from its sister genus Cephaloflexa . Pseudogeoplana tristriata (Schultze & Müller, 1857) is also redescribed from a newly collected specimen and was discovered to be a member of Choeradoplana . Graff (1899) also studied another specimen that was considered to be conspecific with P. tristriata ; however, in this new it is concluded that it is not conspecific but rather a new species. The name Pseudogeoplana aevipandemiae Lago-Barcia & Carbayo, sp. nov. is suggested for Graff’s specimen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aTricladida 3aconspecificity 3agenes 3ahead 3anew species 3aphylogeny 0aCOI 0aflatworms 0aGeoplaninae 0aland planarians 0arolled up 0ataxonomy1 aSilva, Marcos Santos1 aCarbayo, Fernando0 tZooKeys.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 1016 p.1-48dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1016.596173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132040001800163100002300181245012400204300001600328506017300344520144900517650002601966650002301992650001502015650001602030650002102046650001602067650002002083650001502103650002202118650001702140650001902157651002402176700001802200700002202218773014302240856011202383856007702495956009702572961000902669852000902678655001202687IND60005904620221214223754.0140702s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000590462DNAL7 a3018962aris7 a10113/590462hdl7 a10.2489/jswc.69.3.73A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrintz, Jeffrey L.10aRangeland health assessment : the key to understanding and assessing rangeland soil health in the Northern Great Plains  ap. 73A-77A.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAs the science related to soil and rangeland health evolves, so do their protocols and assessment methodologies. Rangeland health assessments consist of evaluating how well ecological processes such as the water cycle, energy flow and nutrient cycling are functioning at a site. Soil health is the capacity of a soil to maintain its function and flow of ecosystem services given a specific set of physical, chemical and environmental boundaries. When soil health deteriorates, its capacity to support and regulate ecosystems is diminished affecting energy flows, nutrient cycling, and productivity among others. Soil health principles have been developed primarily for agricultural systems yet they are relevant to all soils and therefore also apply to rangelands. However, there are concerns regarding the application of soil health principles to rangeland ecology and management amongst resource professionals and managers of private/public rangelands. This paper will attempt to clarify how each of these principles applies to rangeland ecology and describe how existing science based inventory protocols can be used to assess not only the health of the rangeland soil resource but also the overall health of the rangeland resource. Our approach consists in explaining how each of the 4 soil principles listed above is relevant to rangeland health and we list the indicators of rangeland health that each soil health principle is related to. 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3ahydrologic cycle 3ainventories 3arangeland soils 3arangelands 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asoil treatment 3aGreat Plains region1 aToledo, David1 aBoltz, Stanley C.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2014, v. 69, no. 3 p.73A-77AdSoil Conservation Society of AmericawJournal:1947x1941-33007nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/590463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.69.3.73A3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Publ1171%20Toledo.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014700162300001600309500001500325520155400340592002801894650001301922650002501935650002401960650001901984650001502003650002402018650002402042650001002066650003702076650002102113650001802134650002202152650001502174650001002189650001402199650001402213650002102227650001102248650001402259650001102273650000902284650001202293650001402305650001702319650001002336650001802346650001902364653001102383653001702394700001602411700005902427700001702486700001502503700002102518700005602539700001702595773014502612856008002757852000902837655001202846IND60604229520221120133045.0180716e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060422952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b045652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Haohao10aProtective Effects of DHA-PC against Vancomycin-Induced Nephrotoxicity through the Inhibition of Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in BALB/c Mice  ap. 475-484.  a2019-12-06  aThe clinical use of glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin is usually accompanied by nephrotoxicity, limiting its application and therapeutic efficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate the protection of DHA-enriched phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) against nephrotoxicity using a model of vancomycin-induced male BALB/c mice with renal injury by measuring death curves, histological changes, and renal function indexes. The addition of DHA in DHA and DHA-PC groups were 300 mg/kg per day on the basis of human intake level in our study. Results indicated that DHA-PC could dramatically extend the survival time of mice, while traditional DHA and PC had no significant effects. Moreover, oral administration of DHA-PC exhibited better effects on reducing vancomycin-induced increases of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, cystatin C, and kidney injury molecule-1 levels than traditional DHA and PC. DHA-PC significantly delayed the development of vancomycin-induced renal injury, including tubular necrosis, hyaline casts, and tubular degeneration. A further mechanistic study revealed that the protective effect of DHA-PC on vancomycin-mediated toxicity might be attributed to its ability to inhibit oxidative stress and inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which was associated with upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of caspase-9, caspase-3, cytochrome-c, p38, and JNK. These findings suggest that DHA-PC may be acted as the dietary supplements or functional foods against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3anecrosis 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asignal transduction 3arenal function 3acreatinine 3adietary supplements 3aoral administration 3ablood 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3aglycopeptides 3aprotective effect 3avancomycin 3amales 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3ahistology 3amodels 3amice 3akidneys 3acaspase-9 3acytochrome c 3adeath 3aurea nitrogen 3anephrotoxicity 0aDHA-PC 0atherapeutics1 aZou, Junzhe1 aZhang, Tiantian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7127-85931 aChe, Hongxia1 aGao, Xiang1 aWang, Chengcheng1 aWang, Yuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7315-99341 aXue, Changhu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Jan. 17, v. 66, no. 2 p.475-484dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b045653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010300169300001600272520173100288592002802019650002502047650002502072650001102097650001702108650001402125650001902139650001902158650003702177650001602214650002602230650001002256650001002266700002602276700002402302700002102326700002002347700002502367700001902392773013402411856008202545852000902627655001202636IND60615254020221121203403.0181204e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061525402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-018-1506-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Charlotte10aResistance against Fusarium graminearum and the relationship to β-glucan content in barley grains  ap. 621-634.  aFusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum (FG) is a destructive disease impacting barley worldwide. The disease reduces the grain yield and contaminates grains with mycotoxins, such as the trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON). Although the infection mainly affects the grain yield, little is known about its impact on grain structural and biochemical properties. Yet, such information is instrumental to characterize the facets of resistance in the grains. After artificial inoculation of six barley cultivars with FG in a 2 years field test, different levels of symptoms on spikes, of colonisation of grains and of DON content were observed. The infections caused a reduction in grain weight and an average decrease of 10% of the β-glucan content in grains, indicating alterations of grain filling, composition and structure. According to our results, we postulate the presence of two distinct resistance mechanisms in the grain, tolerance to grain filling despite infection as well as the inhibition of mycotoxin accumulation. Differently to wheat, in barley, type IV resistance (tolerance of the grain to infection) is directly linked with type III resistance (resistance against kernel infection). The resistance against toxin accumulation (named type V resistance in wheat) appeared to be independent to all other resistance types. Generally, the resistance was significantly influenced by the environment and by genotype x environment interactions explaining the generally weak stability of resistance in barley. Interestingly, a significant and inverse relationship between DON contamination and β-glucan content in grains suggests that high β-glucan content in grains contributes to type V resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acultivars 3adeoxynivalenol 3afilling period 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3aresistance mechanisms 3aseeds 3awheat1 aSchöneberg, Torsten,1 aVogelgsang, Susanne1 aMorisoli, Romina1 aBertossa, Mario1 aMauch-Mani, Brigitte1 aMascher, Fabio0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Nov., v. 152, no. 3 p.621-634dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-018-1506-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245013300215300001600348520166500364592002802029650001602057650002902073650001402102650001102116650002002127650002602147650001702173650002102190650002802211650002602239650002202265650001502287650001602302650001402318650003302332651001002365700001902375700002102394700002202415700002602437700002602463700002202489700002102511700004302532700002002575700002002595700002402615700002102639700002402660700002102684700002102705700002302726700001902749700006302768700002002831700006502851700006102916700002702977773013303004856008403137852000903221655001203230IND60687192920200514000000.0200327e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068719292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b011282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaloney, Katherine N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3472-759310aCryptic Species Account for the Seemingly Idiosyncratic Secondary Metabolism of Sarcophyton glaucum Specimens Collected in Palau  ap. 693-705.  aSarcophyton glaucum is one of the most abundant and chemically studied soft corals with over 100 natural products reported in the literature, primarily cembrane diterpenoids. Yet, wide variation in the chemistry observed from S. glaucum over the past 50 years has led to its reputation as a capricious producer of bioactive metabolites. Recent molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that S. glaucum is not a single species but a complex of at least seven genetically distinct species not distinguishable using traditional taxonomic criteria. We hypothesized that perceived intraspecific chemical variation observed in S. glaucum was actually due to differences between cryptic species (interspecific variation). To test this hypothesis, we collected Sarcophyton samples in Palau, performed molecular phylogenetic analysis, and prepared chemical profiles of sample extracts using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Both unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (linear discriminant analysis) statistical analyses of these profiles revealed a strong relationship between cryptic species membership and chemical profiles. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis using feature-based molecular networking permitted identification of the chemical drivers of this difference between clades, including cembranoid diterpenes (2R,11R,12R)-isosarcophytoxide (5), (2S,11R,12R)-isosarcophytoxide (6), and isosarcophine (7). Our results suggest that early chemical studies of Sarcophyton may have unknowingly conflated different cryptic species of S. glaucum, leading to apparently idiosyncratic chemical variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcophyton 3abiochemical polymorphism 3achemistry 3acorals 3acryptic species 3adiscriminant analysis 3aditerpenoids 3aflame ionization 3ainterspecific variation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3aPalau1 aBotts, Ryan T.1 aDavis, Taylor S.1 aOkada, Bethany K.1 aMaloney, Elizabeth M.1 aLeber, Christopher A.1 aAlvarado, Óscar,1 aBrayton, Charlie1 aCaraballo-Rodríguez, Andrés Mauricio1 aChari, Jason V.1 aChicoine, Brent1 aCrompton, J.

While, little is known about their role in potato (Solanum tuberosum). This report describes the cloning and characterization of a DREB transcription factor cDNA, StDREB2, isolated from potato (cv Nicola) plants submitted to salt treatment. Based on a multiple sequence alignment, this protein was classified into the A-5 group of DREB subfamily. Expression studies revealed that StDREB2 was induced in leaves, roots and stems upon various abiotic stresses and in response to exogenous treatment with abscisic acid (ABA). In agreement with this expression pattern, over-expression of StDREB2 in transgenic potato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt stress. These data suggest that the isolated StDREB2 encodes a functional protein involved in plant response to different abiotic stresses. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that the StDREB2 protein bound specifically to the DRE core element (ACCGAGA) in vitro. Moreover, Semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript level of a putative target gene i.e. δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) was up-regulated in transgenic plants submitted to salt stress conditions. A concomitant increase in proline accumulation was also observed under these conditions. Taking together, all these data suggest that StDREB2 takes part in the processes underlying plant responses to abiotic stresses probably via the regulation of ABA hormone signaling and through a mechanism allowing proline synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabscisic acid 3abinding proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectrophoresis 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aplant response 3apotatoes 3aproline 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence alignment 3astems 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aDehydration 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aOrnithine-Oxo-Acid Transaminasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Components, Aerialxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProlinexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSalt Tolerance. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSignal Transduction 2aSolanum tuberosumxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aPirrello, Julien1 aBen Amor, Hela1 aHammami, Asma1 aCharfeddine, Mariam1 aDhieb, Amina1 aBouzayen, Mondher1 aGargouri-Bouzid, Radhia0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 60 p.98-108dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245004700182300001600229520076200245592002801007650002301035650002601058650002001084650004501104650001801149650002301167650001601190650003801206650001701244650002901261650003501290650004101325650003401366650004001400650003801440650004001478650002601518650002701544700002001571773010401591856008101695852000901776655001201785IND50060331720221121142505.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006033172DNAL7 a229021702pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRymen, Bart10aTuning growth to the environmental demands  ap. 683-690.  aWhen plants encounter adverse environmental conditions, they often respond by modifying their growth patterns. This growth response tunes morphogenesis with environmental demands and allows plants to prioritize stress response over growth. The underlying molecular mechanism involves an active reprogramming of cell proliferation and cell expansion. Recent studies are starting to shed light on how various environmental and developmental cues are integrated and how this integration affects growth regulatory processes. Environmental signals modulate developmental pathways at multiple entry points, by which they tune the outcome of developmental pathways. In addition, developmental regulators mediate universal stress signals to a proper local response.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3aenvironmental factors 3astress response 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCell Division 2aCell Proliferation 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Cellsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Developmentxphysiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiological 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aSugimoto, Keiko0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2012 Dec., v. 15, no. 6 p.683-690dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001600269520062500285592002800910650002200938650002400960650002000984650002801004650001301032650001001045650000701055650001001062650001101072650001101083650001801094650002201112700002301134700001901157700002001176773010101196856008101297852000901378655001201387IND60520115520221120213340.0160513e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052011552DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452160101482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolovyev, M.

Healing of newly grafted plants is often considered to be a critical process requiring a highly controlled environment. Setting up healing chambers and managing healing conditions can be major challenges for small-scale producers that limit graft survival and discourage further attempts at using grafting technology. Here, we demonstrate a simple “chamberless healing” strategy for grafted tomato plants using regular indoor conditions without the need to install and manage a sophisticated healing chamber. We hypothesize that tomato can form a high-quality graft in a healing environment with relative humidity below 70% and ambient temperatures between 22 and 25 °C. ‘Tribute’ beefsteak tomato as the scion was grafted onto ‘Estamino’ rootstock in the 2018 experiment, whereas ‘Multifort’ and ‘Shield RZ F1 (61-802)’ were used as the rootstocks in the 2019 experiment. After grafting, the seedlings for the chamberless healing treatment were kept in uncovered seedling trays and misted with water two or three times per day. Seedlings in other treatments were placed in a humidity dome or wrapped chamber to maintain high humidity during the first few days after grafting. In the 2018 experiment, chamberless healing was compared with covered treatments with different ventilation times during the first few days after grafting. In the 2019 experiment, chamberless healing was compared with a standard graft healing chamber treatment to further validate its feasibility. In both 2018 and 2019, all treatments showed high graft survival rates (>85%) at 21 days after grafting (DAG), and plants from the chamberless healing treatment had a lower incidence of adventitious root growth than plants from other healing treatments (0% to 7% vs. 33% to 78%). In the 2019 experiment, no differences in graft union strength, photosynthetic rate, biomass accumulation, or flowering time were observed between the chamberless and standard healing treatments. Plants with chamberless healing were slightly (8%) shorter than the standard treatment at 21 DAG, but no difference was observed at 27 DAG. Although some additional management is required during healing to prevent water loss, the alternative chamberless system assessed in this study exhibited great potential to facilitate small-scale graft healing for producing grafted tomato transplants under standard indoor conditions without any sophisticated healing environment and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aadventitious roots 3abiomass production 3aphotosynthesis 3arelative humidity 3aroot growth 3arootstocks 3ascions 3aseedlings 3atomatoes 0aflowering 0agrafting 0agrowth 0ahumidity 0arootstock 0ascion 0asurvival rate1 aZhao, Xin1 aSharma, Ashwin1 aBrecht, Jeffrey K.1 aColee, James0 tHortTechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.115-124dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:2120x1943-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH04707-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245019800180300001600378520123500394592002801629596003101657650002501688650001101713650001801724650001301742650002001755650001001775650000901785650000901794650001201803650001201815650002201827650001301849650001901862650001701881650001401898650001401912650002001926650001701946700002401963700003401987700002202021700002402043700007102067773012102138856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60615254620221120030150.0220603e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061525462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-018-0425-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Madrigal, Fátima10aTemporal root responses in Arabidopsis thaliana L. to chromate reveal structural and regulatory mechanisms involving the SOLITARY ROOT/IAA14 repressor for maintenance of identity meristem genes  ap. 251-262.  aThe Arabidopsis root system is modified in response to stress generated by high concentrations of nonessential ions such as chromate [Cr(VI)]. In this work, the distribution of auxin and its transporters PIN1 and PIN7, as well as the expression of genes that maintain the identity of the root meristem, were analyzed in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (WT) seedlings and in a mutant affected in the SOLITARY ROOT (SLR1/IAA14) locus, which is required for root response to Cr(VI). We show that primary root inhibition, auxin transporter levels, and expression of meristem identity genes were maintained in the slr-1 mutants but not in WT plants in response to Cr(VI) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Notably, the outermost single cell layer of the lateral root cap, which normally dies and tends to peel off, remains viable and increases in size following exposure of WT plants, but not slr-1 mutants, to Cr(VI). Our results suggest that (1) the primary root tip senses Cr(VI), (2) the external lateral root cap may play a protective role during Cr(VI) exposure, and (3) Cr(VI) impacts cell division in root meristems via auxin redistribution and SLR1/IAA14 function, influencing the expression of root meristem genes.  aPublisher supplied data  aCB-2011-01-169769cConacyt 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aauxins 3acell division 3achromium 3agene expression 3agenes 3aions 3aloci 3amutants 3apeeling 3aprotective effect 3aroot cap 3aroot meristems 3aroot systems 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3astress response 3atransporters1 aOrtiz-Castro, Randy1 aRuiz-Herrera, León Francisco1 aCervantes, Carlos1 aLópez-Bucio, José1 aMartínez Trujillo, Miguel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6523-66180 tPlant growth regulation.g2018 Nov., v. 86, no. 2 p.251-262dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-018-0425-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010500167300001800272520084900290592002801139650001101167650002301178650001001201650001301211700002101224700006401245773013501309856008001444852000901524655001201533IND60681730720221119015532.0200117e20191219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068173072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolov, Andrey A.10aPerceiving Zeolite Self-Assembly: A Combined Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approach within the Tiling Model  ap. 1523-1528.  aWe present an extended tiling model of the assembly of the zeolite frameworks, where the building units can be natural tiles (minimal cages of the framework) as well as parts of the tiles.

We have showed that the observed intimate or epitaxial intergrowth of zeolite minerals can be perceived as a result of several possible ways of crystal growth with different methods of connection of the half-units from the same set. We have considered many zeolite pairs, for which the intergrowth was either observed or not revealed yet, and demonstrated that our model properly predicts and interprets the intergrowth phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3atiles 3azeolites1 aBlatova, Olga A.1 aBlatov, Vladislav A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4048-72180 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 19, v. 124, no. 2 p.1523-1528dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245013100192300001600323520172000339592002802059650002602087650001902113650001002132650002202142650002602164650000902190650002402199650001802223650001702241650001302258650001202271650001202283650002502295650003502320650003202355650002802387650003702415650003602452650003802488650003602526650002002562650002902582650005402611650004902665700002602714700001902740700001902759773010502778856008402883852000902967655001202976IND60113896620221122233021.0141112e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389662DNAL7 a229354772pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldelli, Enrico10aEffect of mycophenolic acid on trans-plasma membrane electron transport and electric potential in virus-infected plant tissue  ap. 137-140.  aMycophenolic acid (MPA) is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor whose antiviral mechanism of action is supposed to interfere with NAD⁺/NADH conversion. Its effects on trans-plasma membrane electron transport (t-PMET) and on trans-plasma membrane electric potential (t-PMEP), which are involved in the NAD⁺/NADH conversion, were investigated using microelectrochemical techniques in tobacco plants infected by Cucumber mosaic virus. In these tests, ferricyanide (Fe³⁺) was used as electron acceptor in assays performed with intact cells; ferricyanide is converted to ferrocyanide (Fe²⁺) by one-electron reduction, and the rate of this reduction can be monitored in order to investigate the effects on t-PMET or t-PMEP. Considering tests on t-PMEP, MPA treatment of samples induced membrane depolarization and this effect was greater in healthy samples compared to infected ones. In any case, complete repolarization was achieved, indicating no irreversible damage to the membrane due to MPA administration. Moreover, in samples pre-treated with MPA, the extent of depolarization caused by Fe³⁺ administration was lower than in samples without pre-treatment but the MPA effect was not related to virus infection. With regard to tests on t-PMET, MPA caused a reduction in Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ conversion compared to untreated plants. However, infected samples were less sensitive to MPA treatment, which may be due to the concurrent entry of MPA within the symplast that, as indicated by t-PMEP tests, was lower in infected samples. In conclusion, MPA interferes with membrane activity linked to NAD⁺/NADH conversion, acting differently in infected or healthy samples during drug uptake by cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3adrugs 3aelectron transfer 3ainosine monophosphate 3airon 3amechanism of action 3aplant tissues 3apretreatment 3asymplast 3atobacco 3aviruses 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAntiviral Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aCucumovirusxphysiology 2aElectron Transportxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aMycophenolic Acidxpharmacology 2aNADxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxphysiologyxvirology. 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxphysiologyxvirology.1 aPanattoni, Alessandra1 aLuvisi, Andrea1 aTriolo, Enrico0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 60 p.137-140dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012100171300001800292520112400310592002801434650002501462650002001487650001901507650001901526650001201545650001901557650001001576650000901586650002701595650003301622650001301655650002201668700001901690700002001709700001801729700001701747700003701764700001801801700001801819700002001837700002001857773010801877856008101985990002302066852000902089655001202098IND60090622420221122051654.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009062242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoigebazar, Lathika10aSynthesis of ⁶⁸Ga-labeled DOTA-nitroimidazole derivatives and their feasibilities as hypoxia imaging PET tracers  ap. 2176-2181.  aThe imaging of hypoxia is important for therapeutic decision making in various diseases. ⁶⁸Ga is an important radionuclide for positron emission tomography (PET), and its usage is increasing, due to the development of the ⁶⁸Ge/⁶⁸Ga-generator. In the present study, the authors synthesized two nitroimidazole derivatives by conjugating nitroimidazole and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) via an amide bond (4) and a thiourea bond (5). Both derivatives were labeled with ⁶⁸Ga with high labeling efficiency and were stable after labeling. The low partition coefficients (logP) of ⁶⁸Ga-4 (−4.6) and ⁶⁸Ga-5 (−4.5) demonstrated the hydrophilic natures of the derivatives, and both showed higher uptake in cancer cell lines cultured under hypoxic condition than under normoxic condition. However, ⁶⁸Ga-5 showed higher liver uptake than ⁶⁸Ga-4 in a biodistribution study due to higher lipophilicity. In an animal PET study, ⁶⁸Ga-4 showed higher standard uptake values (SUV) in tumors than ⁶⁸Ga-5 in mice xenografted with CT-26 mouse colon cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adecision making 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahypoxia 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3amice 3apartition coefficients 3apositron-emission tomography 3athiourea 3atracer techniques1 aJeong, Jae Min1 aHong, Mee Kyung1 aKim, Young Ju1 aLee, Ji Youn1 aŚeṭṭi Reñjāḷa, Dinēś,1 aYi, Yun-sang,1 aLee, Dong Soo1 aChung, June-Key1 aLee, Myung Chul0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 19, no. 7 p.2176-2181dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266520138800282592002801670650002601698650001401724650001201738650001101750650002201761650002501783650002301808650002801831650001501859650001401874650001901888650002401907650002801931651001001959653001501969653002501984653002802009653001002037653001102047700001602058700001602074700001602090773011202106856008602218852000902304655001202313IND60592477620221118040438.0201209e20180520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059247762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liguo10aToward cleaner production: What drives farmers to adopt eco-friendly agricultural production?  ap. 550-558.  aDue to the indiscriminate use of chemical inputs like pesticides, serious agricultural diffused pollution is arising, not only with the ecological environment damaging, but also with the agriculture sustainable development restricted. It is imperative for China to reduce pesticides use. Under the decentralized production background, farmers’ willingness to reduce pesticides is worth discussing. This paper aims to explore farmers’ willingness to reduce pesticides use based on its determinants analysis. A structured questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 924 farmers in rural China. Binary logistic regression model was used to examine the determinants. The results showed that farmers’ environmental concern, pesticides residues cognition, agro-products quality concern and input controls positively and significantly influence farmers’ willingness to reduce pesticides, while non-agricultural income share influence negatively. Results also reveal that farmers’ self-discipline is more effective than government regulations; enhancing farmers’ self-discipline is important to guide farmers toward environmentally-friend measures in agricultural production. This paper recommended that policy makers take measures to improve farmers’ environmental awareness and strengthen input supervision. Improved effectiveness of pesticides usage is also needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3acognition 3afarmers 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apesticide residues 3apesticide use reduction 3apesticides 3apollution 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aPesticides 0aBinomial logit model 0aAgricultural production 0aChina 0aSurvey1 aLi, Xuerong1 aYu, Jiangli1 aYao, Xiaoli0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 20, v. 184 p.550-558dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010000160300001800260520170200278592002801980650001502008650001502023650001102038650002202049650002602071650000902097650001302106650000902119650001402128650001402142650001502156650002402171650001302195650001102208650001702219650002302236650000902259700001802268700002302286700002102309700002002330700002302350700002602373773014102399856007402540852000902614655001202623IND60670905020221121044247.0191002e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067090502DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta05794e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosnes, Mali H.10aIntriguing differences in hydrogen adsorption in CPO-27 materials induced by metal substitution  ap. 4827-4839.  aAn extraordinarily interesting series of metal–organic framework compounds are the isostructural microporous coordination polymers [M₂(dhtp)] (CPO-27–M, M–MOF-74 or M₂(dobdc)) in which a high concentration of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites results in high initial heats of adsorption for a variety of adsorbents. We present here a comparative study of hydrogen gas adsorption experiments on CPO-27–Cu and –Mn, which show significant differences in their hydrogen uptake behaviours which can be attributed to the difference in interaction between hydrogen and the respective metal cation incorporated in the framework structure. Inelastic neutron scattering and neutron diffraction experiments were carried out to gain additional insight into the adsorption processes leading to the difference in hydrogen uptake behaviour by the two compounds. On the basis of the experimental results the hydrogen uptake properties of CPO-27–Cu and –Mn are compared, and finally related to the properties of the other members of the CPO-27 series. It is found that CPO-27–Cu demonstrates the lowest isosteric heat of adsorption for H₂ of all the CPO-27–M materials reported to date, where M = Ni, Co, Mg, Zn, Mn, and Fe, whereas CPO-27–Mn demonstrates the second lowest. While all the previously reported CPO-27 materials show two steps in the adsorption isotherm and two distinct values corresponding to the first and second adsorption sites in the heats of adsorption, these are not observed for CPO-27–Cu. Consequently, the open metal site and the second adsorption site are energetically equivalent, and there is no preference for the hydrogen gas at the open metal centre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acobalt 3acomparative study 3acoordination polymers 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3aneutron diffraction 3aneutrons 3anickel 3aporous media 3asorption isotherms 3azinc1 aOpitz, Martin1 aFrontzek, Matthias1 aLohstroh, Wiebke1 aEmbs, Jan Peter1 aGeorgiev, Peter A.1 aDietzel, Pascal D.

The dominant species of trees were Haldina cordifolia, Albizia odoratissima and Lagerstroemia duperreana. The Important Value Index (IVI) values of trees were 132.91, 17.78 and 14.22, respectively. The pattern for the decomposition coefficients (k) was highest in the wet period (May-September) and lowest in the dry period (October-April). The carbon and nitrogen return patterns increased in the dry period (October- April) and decreased in the wet period (May-September). Carbon and nitrogen loss in the decomposing litter continually decreased during the decomposition process from the initial levels, with a final relatively rapid release in the wet period. Results from this study was understanding of community composition, litterfall production and litter decomposition for understanding potential of secondary mixed deciduous forest for balancing carbon for mitigating greenhouse gas effect in the local area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbizia odoratissima 3aLagerstroemia 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adeciduous forests 3adominant species 3aforest litter 3agreenhouse gases 3alungs 3anational parks 3anitrogen 3ashifting cultivation 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aThailand 0aspecies composition 0alitter 0acarbon 0anitrogen 0asecondary mixed deciduous forest 0ashifting cultivation1 aPoolsiri, Roongreang1 aKatzensteiner, Klaus1 aPengthamkeerati, Pattra1 aThongdeenok, Piyapong0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2014 Mar. 12, v. 55, no. 4 p.196-204dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2013-00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245019200161300001800353500001900371520177600390592002802166650001202194650001602206650001102222650002202233650001502255650003102270650001502301650001702316650001602333653003202349653002402381653001802405653001602423653003202439700001802471700001602489700001702505700001702522700001702539700001602556700001602572700005502588700005802643700001502701700001602716773013902732856007802871852000902949655001202958IND60728775120221118024213.0210224e20210212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c188402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yanming10aTemplate-Directing Coupled with Chemical Activation Methodology-Derived Hexagon-like Porous Carbon Electrode with Outstanding Compatibility to Electrolytes and Low-Temperature Performance  ap. 8206-8218.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe conversion of asphalt into hexagon-like porous carbon (HPC) with a micro-mesoporous structure is realized by the coupling of template-directing and chemical activation methodologies. The specific surface area of HPC can reach up to 1356 m² g–¹ even at such a low-proportioned dosage of activator (0.5-fold) and is also larger than those of template-directed carbon and activation-derived carbon, as it benefited from the coupling merits of template-directing and chemical activation. Excellent capacitive-energy-storage behavior with respect to rate capability, capacitance retention, and durability are delivered by HPC//HPC symmetric supercapacitors assembled with aqueous and organic electrolytes. This great compatibility for different kinds of electrolytes and electrode properties is owed to the robust hexagon-like microarchitecture feature associated with hierarchical pore structure, which not only hinders the stacking between each other but also provides a buffer function for the volume variation and sufficient active sites for the storage of electrolyte ions. The drastic temperature variation has almost no influence on the diffusion and transfer rate of electrolyte ions, further evidencing the advanced feature of the hierarchical pore structure. Additionally, HPC//Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ LIC assembled with the Li-based electrolyte also presents a superior Ragone performance. The coexistence of micro- and mesopores for the HPC makes it an attractive electrode material for various capacitive-energy-storage devices. This work provides a promising way to realize the plasticity of pore channels and mass production of high capacitive storage ability of electrode material via the combination of template-directing and chemical activation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3adurability 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aplasticity 3asurface area 3atemperature 0ahierarchical pore structure 0acapacitive behavior 0acompatibility 0aelectrolyte 0alow-temperature performance1 aLi, Shengping1 aYang, Zipan1 aWu, Mingzhen1 aWang, Xuejie1 aXu, Chenggen1 aZhang, Xilu1 aLin, Rundan1 aMa, Xinlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7034-48401 aHuang, Guoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3947-02831 aLu, Chunxi1 aGao, Jinsen0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 12, v. 13, no. 7 p.8206-8218dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c188403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245008400200500002200284520160700306592002801913650001101941650002301952650001401975650001301989650002402002650002002026650001002046650001902056650002602075650001302101650002002114650003102134650002202165653002702187653002202214653002302236653001802259653001902277700001202296700001602308700001602324773006302340856008202403852000902485655001202494IND60570255620221116220841.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8187-741512aA systematic review of the cost and economic outcomes of home enteral nutrition  aPre-press version  aStudies are lacking in the health economic implications of home enteral nutrition (HEN) in home-residing and long-term care/institutionalized patients. The aims of this review were to determine the total costs, the cost-effectiveness and other economic outcomes for HEN.A systematic search of randomized trials and observational studies available from January 2000 to April 2016 was performed using standard literature and electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were adults receiving HEN with economic outcomes in the long-term care or home settings. There was no restriction to the control groups used in the studies.A total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were not specifically designed for economic evaluation. Cost per QALY was lower in residents residing in home compared to long-term care facilities, and HEN appeared to be cost-effective for those with pressure ulcers. Higher costs were incurred for patients with dementia on HEN. Lower hospitalization costs and infection rates were reported for patients who switched to commercial feeds from blenderized food. The availability of nutritional support teams may decrease overall costs but these studies were of poor study quality.The lack of good quality economic evaluation studies affected the ability to conclude the overall cost-effectiveness of HEN. There is a trend for cost-saving and improved clinical outcomes in some populations. HEN is unlikely beneficial for patients with dementia. The availability of a nutrition support team may lead to cost savings and improved clinical outcomes for HEN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3adementia 3aeconomic evaluation 3aenteral feeding 3afeeds 3along term care 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3apressure ulcers 3aquality-adjusted life year 3asystematic review 0aHome enteral nutrition 0aEconomic outcomes 0aCost-effectiveness 0aCost-analysis 0aLong-term care1 aGoh, G.1 aBanks, M.D.1 aBauer, J.D.0 tClinical nutrition.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245012800167300001600295520296400311592002803275650002203303650001903325650001203344650001403356650001203370650000903382650002003391650001703411650001703428650001003445650000903455700001803464700002003482700001403502773009303516856008403609852000903693655001203702IND4458840620221119153414.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445884062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2011.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Greef, K.H.10aProof of Principle of the Comfort Class concept in pigs. Experimenting in the midst of a stakeholder process on pig welfare  ap. 172-185.  aAnimal welfare in livestock systems is strongly dependent on husbandry conditions. ‘Comfort Class’ is defined as a specific minimal level of husbandry conditions of animals, at which the ability of animals to meet their needs is not compromised by husbandry conditions. It is assumed that if this level is attained, animal welfare (the quality of life as experienced by the animal) will not be restricted by husbandry conditions. This idea of a Comfort Class level originates from an early interdisciplinary innovation trajectory in pig husbandry and was adopted by the major Dutch pig farmers' organisation and the major Dutch animal protection organisation. These two parties built a Comfort Class facility as a proof of principle to test and demonstrate the idea. The aim of the first study in this facility was to empirically test whether a facility that meets the Comfort Class level results in good animal welfare for pigs. In two batches each with 144 undocked pigs, housed in three group sizes, observations were made on tail integrity, skin lesions, activity patterns and degree of synchronisation and clustering of eating and lying behaviour. In the first batch, tail and skin damage was at a low level. The second batch, starting with 64% of the animals having bitten tails, ended with almost all tails recovered. Activity patterns were similar for group sizes and growing stages. Resting behaviour was highly synchronised, but rather spread out over the lying area. Synchronisation of eating was limited, as 52% of the meals were taken alone and a further 29% by two pigs together. The study offered support for the hypothesis, that the Comfort Class level results in a good quality of life for pigs, especially based on the absence of observed welfare infringements (conclusion 1). Results on space use, synchronisation and clustering indicated that the theoretically derived requirements on space allowance and number of feeders might be reduced without compromising the Comfort Class level. The expected limited statistical power of the experiment did not hinder further development, as, during the process, working on the scientific underpinning of the concept was more important than the actual rigidity of the conclusions. The concurrent scientific activities legitimated the stakeholders' activities and emphasised their claim that practical animal welfare improvement is possible. The project initiated further experimentation and design in practice and contributed to market introduction of welfare improved pork. The methodology applied in the project turned out to be the start of a series of interactive innovation initiatives in animal production sector, leading to the RIO ("Reflexief Interactief Ontwerp", Dutch for Reflexive Interactive Design) innovation approach. Conclusion 2 of this study is that this interactive approach to experimentation facilitates the implementation of science based welfare improvements in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3aanimal welfare 3afarmers 3aingestion 3amarkets 3apork 3aquality of life 3askin lesions 3astakeholders 3aswine 3atail1 aVermeer, H.M.1 aHouwers, H.W.J.1 aBos, A.P.0 tLivestock science.g2011 July, v. 139, no. 1-2 p.172-185dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012300172500001900295520198500314592002802299650002302327650002802350650001602378650002402394650002802418650001802446650001702464650001702481650002602498650001402524650001402538650002602552650001702578650002002595650001802615653001602633653003702649653002302686653002802709653001802737700001302755700001402768700001902782700002202801700002102823700001902844700002502863700002202888700001902910700002002929700002102949773010302970856008203073852000903155655001203164IND60697916920221120072757.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069791692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1108912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasui-Yamada, Sonoko10aImpact of phase angle on postoperative prognosis in patients with gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhase angle (PhA), by bioelectrical impedance analysis, has been used in patients with several diseases; however, its prognostic value in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatobiliary-pancreatic (HBP) cancer is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PhA on postoperative short- outcomes and long-term survival in these patients.This retrospective study reviewed data from 501 patients with GI and HBP cancers who underwent first resection surgery. The data were divided into the following groups according to the preoperative PhA quartile values by sex: high-PhA group with the highest quartile (Q4), normal-PhA group with middle quartiles (Q3 and Q2), and low-PhA group with the lowest quartile (Q1). Preoperative nutritional statuses, postoperative short-term outcomes during hospitalization, and 5-y survival between three groups were compared. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the prognostic effect of PhA.PhA positively correlated with body weight, skeletal muscle mass, and handgrip strength, and negatively correlated with age and levels of C-reactive protein. The low-PhA group showed a higher prevalence of malnutrition (48%) than normal-PhA (25%), and high-PhA groups (9%; P < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative severe complications was 10% for all patients (14% in low-PhA, 12% in normal-PhA, and 4% in high-PhA; P = 0.018). The incidence of prolonged stays in a postoperative high-care or intensive care unit was 8% in all patients (16% in low-PhA, 8% in normal-PhA, and 2% in high-PhA; P < 0.001). The 5-y survival rate was 74% in all patients (68% in low-PhA, 74% in normal-PhA, and 79% in high-PhA; P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that a low-PhA group was an independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–3.90; P = 0.034).PhA is a useful short-term and long-term postoperative prognostic marker for patients with GI and HBP cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody weight 3aconfidence interval 3agastrointestinal system 3ahand strength 3ahazard ratio 3amalnutrition 3amultivariate analysis 3aprognosis 3aresection 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3askeletal muscle 3asurvival rate 0aPhase angle 0aBioelectrical impedance analysis 0aNutritional status 0aGastrointestinal cancer 0aPostoperative1 aOiwa, Yu1 aSaito, Yu1 aAotani, Nozomi1 aMatsubara, Atsumi1 aMatsuura, Sayaka1 aTanimura, Mayu1 aTani-Suzuki, Yoshiko1 aKashihara, Hideya1 aNishi, Masaaki1 aShimada, Mitsuo1 aHamada, Yasuhiro0 tNutrition.g2020 Nov.,  Dec., v. 79-80 p.110891-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1108913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03906naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245016200204500002200366520223300388592002802621650003202649650002802681650002102709650001302730650002402743650002802767650001002795650001902805650001402824650001202838650001702850650001102867650002302878650001502901650002402916650001702940650001202957653001402969653001602983653002902999653002903028700001403057700001603071700001503087700001803102700001403120700001403134700001803148700002003166773006303186856008203249852000903331655001203340IND60570255720221116220430.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarino, L.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1257-121X10aBioimpedance spectroscopy measurements of phase angle and height for age are predictive of outcome in children following surgery for congenital heart disease  aPre-press version  aChildren with congenital heart disease (CHD) are often growth restricted (low weight- and/or height-for-age) which may increase risk of poor post operative resilience. Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been used to determine body composition in different clinical settings and has been shown to mark differences in nutritional state and clinical outcome.

We sought to describe the relationship between nutritional status, phase-angle and post-operative outcomes in children with congenital heart disease.Single centre prospective cohort study.Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Southampton Children’s Hospital.122 children with CHD following cardiac surgery (March 2015–April 2016). Outcome variables included growth, mechanical-ventilation, PICU length of stay (PICU-LOS) and phase-angle at 50Hz.BIS measurements were taken before and on the day of surgery (day 0), day 2 post-operatively and on discharge from hospital. Pre-operative moderate malnutrition defined as height-for-age-z-score (HAZ) ≤ -2 was observed in 28.5% of infants and 20.6% of children. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between phase-angle, HAZ and clinical outcomes. Moderate-malnutrition (HAZ ≤-2) was associated with an increased PICU-LOS (odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval: 1.8; 1.1–2.7, p=0.008) whilst a low Phase-angle (≤2.7°) on day 2 was associated with longer PICU-LOS (OR 7.8; 2.7-22.45, p<0.001); When the model was adjusted for age, known risk factors and length of surgery, HAZ ≤-2 and phase-angle ≤2.7° on day 2 were associated with longer PICU-LOS (p=0.001 and p=0.04 respectively) and together explained 81.7% of the variability in PICU-LOSModerate malnutrition (HAZ ≤-2) in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with longer PICU-LOS. Post-operative measures of BIS phase angle may further improve our ability to identifying hose children with an increased risk of prolonged PICU-LOS compared to using pre-operative anthropometry alone.

However, due to the low activity of ZnO at low temperature, most of the current work is focused on detecting NO₂ at high operating temperatures (200–500 °C), which will inevitably increase energy consumption and shorten the lifetime of sensors. In order to overcome these problems and improve the practicality of ZnO-based NO₂ sensors, it is necessary to systematically understand the effective strategies and mechanisms of low-temperature NO₂ detection of ZnO sensors. This paper reviews the latest research progress of low-temperature ZnO nanomaterial-based NO₂ gas sensors. Several efficient strategies to achieve low-temperature NO₂ detection (such as morphology modification, noble metal decoration, additive doping, heterostructure sensitization, two-dimensional material composites, and light activation) and corresponding sensing mechanisms (such as depletion layer theory, grain boundary barrier theory, spill-over effects) are also introduced. Finally, the challenges and future development directions of low-temperature ZnO-based NO₂ sensors are outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acomposite materials 3aenergy 3agases 3agrains 3ametals 3aphysicochemical properties 3ashortenings 3atemperature 3awills1 aZhao, Guodong1 aSun, Meiling1 aJia, Fuchao1 aWang, Xiaomei1 aZhou, Tong1 aYin, Guangchao1 aLiu, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 10, no. 65 p.39786-39807dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra07328h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245008200179300001600261500000900277520056600286592002800852650002700880650001200907650001200919650001300931650002500944650001300969650001100982650001000993700001801003700001801021773012201039856009701161852000901258655001201267IND60663472120221120142046.0191122e196503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347212DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1965.00021962005700020015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWedin, W.

The lipid biomarker concentrations in the Changjiang Estuary mud area (CEMA) indicated eutrophication accelerated after the 1970s. Meanwhile, Mo/Al indicated hypoxia has increased since 1960s. Eutrophication and hypoxia in the CEMA are primarily a result of the dramatically increased load of terrestrial nutrients from the Changjiang to the East China Sea. The lipid biomarker concentrations in the southwest Cheju Island mud area (SCIMA) showed primary production is controlled mainly by changes in regional climate and marine current. No significant hypoxia occurred in the SCIMA over the past century as indicated by Mo/Al. Therefore, geochemical indicators of eutrophication and hypoxia revealed different patterns between the CEMA and SCIMA, suggesting the role of river-derived nutrients in sustaining eutrophication and hypoxia in the CEMA since the 1960s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiomarkers 3aclimate 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahypoxia 3alipids 3amolybdenum 3anutrients 3aprimary productivity 3awater pollution 3aEast China Sea 0aChangjiang Estuary 0aEutrophication 0aHypoxia 0aBiomarker 0aRedox sensitive element 0aSediments1 aFeng, Xuwen1 aShi, Xiaolai1 aBai, Youcheng1 aYu, Xiaoguo1 aShi, Xuefa1 aZhang, Weiyan1 aZhang, Rongping0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 99, no. 1-2 p.76-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.07.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001800273500001900291520182200310592002802132596004602160650002202206650001202228650001802240650002002258650001002278650001402288650001302302650003002315650001902345650001102364650001302375650001302388650003002401650001502431650001102446650001802457700005702475773012202532856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60708472320221121093915.0200826e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-020-02913-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGermec, Mustafa10aEnhanced production of Aspergillus niger inulinase from sugar beet molasses and its kinetic modeling  ap. 1939-1955.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOBJECTIVE: The fermentation medium contains many complex components (vitamins, minerals, etc.) for better growth of the microorganisms. The increasing purity and number of these components used in the medium seriously affect the cost of the microbial process. This study aimed to further optimize the concentration of the components used in the medium (yeast extract and peptone) for inulinase fabrication by Aspergillus niger from sugar-beet molasses in shake flask fermentation by using Central Composite Design (CCD) and to kinetically identify the fermentation. RESULTS: The results indicated that the optimal medium composition consisted of only 4.2% (w/v) yeast extract. By using the fermentation environment, the inulinase generation, inulinase/sucrase ratio, maximum inulinase generation rate, maximum sugar depletion rate, and substrate utilization yield were determined as 1294.5 U/mL, 1.2, 159.6 U/mL/day, 7.4 g/L/day, and 98.1%, respectively. The kinetic analysis of the fungal development (logistic model) indicated that a specific development rate and initial biomass concentration were 0.89/day and 1.79 g/L, respectively. Inulinase and sucrase productions are mixed-development associated since the α value ≠ 0 (8.46 and 4.31 U/mgX) and the β value ≠ 0 (5.15 and 4.83 U/mgX day), respectively (Luedeking–Piret model). Besides, the maintenance value (Z) (0.009 gS/gX day) was lower than γ value (1.044 gS/gX), showing that A. niger commonly uses the substrates for enzyme fabrication and fungal development (modified Luedeking–Piret model). CONCLUSIONS: The enzyme activity was increased by optimizing the concentration of the components used. It was demonstrated that the proposed kinetic models can victoriously define fungal development, enzyme fabrication, and sugar depletion.  aPublisher supplied data  aFDK-2019-4761cAkdeniz Üniversitesi (TR) 3aAspergillus niger 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3ainulinase 3akinetics 3aliquid state fermentation 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3amolasses 3apeptones 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3asugar beet 3asugars 3ayeast extract1 aTurhan, Irfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8469-29530 tBiotechnology letters.g2020 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.1939-1955dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-02913-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245005900168300001600227500001400243520185100257592002802108650000802136650001302144650001302157650001702170650001502187650001102202650001002213650000902223650001502232650001402247650001102261650002302272650001102295650001702306653001502323653001802338653001602356653001802372653001902390653001602409700001902425700002402444773013202468856007902600852000902679655001202688IND60726122420221119044218.0210204s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072612242DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2020-05662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallender, Nigel A.10aCardiorespiratory demands of competitive rock climbing  ap. 161-168.  aNAL-light  aRock climbing has become a mainstream sport, contested on the Olympic stage. The work/rest pattern of bouldering is unique among disciplines, and little is known about its physiological demands. This study characterised the cardiorespiratory responses to simulated competition. Eleven elite boulderers (7 male) volunteered to participate (age = 23.3 ± 4.5 years; mass = 68.2 ± 9.7 kg; stature = 1.73 ± 0.06 m; body fat = 10.4% ± 5%). Subjects completed incremental treadmill running to determine maximal capacities. On a separate day, they undertook a simulated Olympic-style climbing competition comprising 5 boulder problems, each separated by 5 min of rest. Pulmonary ventilation, gas exchange, and heart rate were assessed throughout. Total climbing time was 18.9 ± 2.7 min. Bouldering elicited a peak oxygen uptake of 35.8 ± 7.3 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ (∼75% of treadmill maximum) and a peak heart rate of 162 ± 14 beats·min⁻¹ (∼88% of maximum). Subjects spent 22.9% ± 8.6% of climbing time above the gas exchange threshold. At exercise cessation, there was an abrupt and significant increase in tidal volume (1.4 ± 0.4 vs. 1.8 ± 0.4 L; p = 0.006, d = 0.83) despite unchanged minute ventilation. Cardiorespiratory parameters returned to baseline within 4 min of the rest period. In conclusion, competitive bouldering elicits substantial cardiorespiratory demand and evidence of tidal volume constraint. Further studies are warranted to explore the effect of cardiorespiratory training on climbing performance. Novelty: Competitive bouldering evokes a high fraction of maximal oxygen uptake and prolonged periods above the gas exchange threshold. Climbing appears to impose a constraint on tidal volume expansion. Cardiorespiratory indices in elite climbers return to baseline within 2–4 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abody fat 3aexercise 3agas exchange 3aheart rate 3aheight 3amales 3amass 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3aoxygen 3apeak oxygen uptake 3asports 3atidal volume 0abouldering 0aoxygen uptake 0arespiratory 0arock climbing 0asport climbing 0aventilation1 aHayes, Tara N.1 aTiller, Nicholas B.0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2021, v. 46, no. 2 p.161-168dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2020-05663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010800207520178500315592002802100650001402128650002002142650001702162650001602179650002002195650001902215650001502234650001502249651001002264653001702274653001602291653003502307653002602342653003302368653001002401700005402411700001902465773011402484856008602598852000902684655001202693IND60783488120221116164837.0220830e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jingze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6462-313010aCapacity optimization and feasibility assessment of solar-wind hybrid renewable energy systems in China  aThe solar-wind hybrid renewable energy systems, including wind farm, photovoltaic (PV) plant, concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, electric heater, battery, and bidirectional inverter, are analyzed in 36 typical locations in China. The effects of wind and solar energy resources on power supply reliability and economy and the optimal installed capacities are analyzed. The regions in China recommended for the development of the systems are given. Results show that the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of system in Huade can be as low as 0.1 $/kWh when 90% of annual load demand is met. The wind speed and solar irradiation have a major effect while the complementary characteristics of wind and solar energy have an auxiliary effect on power supply reliability and cost of the system. Compared with the system in Tongliao, the LCOE of system in Qiqihar with lower wind speed and solar irradiation intensity is reduced by 9.8% due to the better complementary characteristics of wind and solar energy. For systems in locations with different wind and solar energy resources, the wind farm or PV plant is still the technology with the greatest cost advantage but the worst power supply reliability. The electric heater with thermal energy storage and power cycle is an essential factor to greatly improve power supply reliability economically. Meanwhile, one of the solar field and battery should be integrated into the system according to the direct normal irradiance conditions. When high power supply reliability is pursued, the CSP plant is recommended to be introduced in most regions. Moreover, the commercial promotion of CSP plant brings the most significant economic benefits to the system. As the CSP plant cost is reduced by 30%, the LCOE of system is reduced by 20.4%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3alight intensity 3asolar energy 3asolar farms 3asolar radiation 3athermal energy 3awind farms 3awind speed 3aChina 0aSolar energy 0aWind energy 0aHybrid renewable energy system 0aCapacity optimization 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aChina1 aYang, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6261-43991 aDuan, Yuanyuan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 25, v. 368 p.133139-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014500174520155900319592002801878650001801906650001301924650001901937650001701956650001301973650002001986650001202006650001602018650001402034650001402048650001602062650002002078651001402098653001502112653001102127653002102138653001202159653001302171700002602184773011902210856008702329852000902416655001202425IND60683450220221116170127.0200228e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2020.1041742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegert, Caroline10aCavilignum pratchettii gen. et sp. nov., a novel type of fossil endocarp with open locules from the Neogene Gray Fossil Site, Tennessee, USA  aA suite of fossil endocarps representing a new taxon from the early Pliocene Gray Fossil Site, Tennessee, USA, is described as Cavilignum pratchettii gen. et sp. nov. Cavilignum is represented by circular to oblong endocarps that have a truncate apex, a mucronate base, and a smooth outer surface. The endocarp wall has three layers. The outermost layer is of uncertain composition. The inner wall structure is fibrous, with an outer layer of radially oriented fibers and an inner layer of circumferentially oriented fibers. The endocarps typically have four chambers (locules) divided by thick septa; two narrow canals penetrate the septa from the apex to the base of each endocarp. The locules are open apically. Because no evidence of structures that may have sealed the chambers was found, Cavilignum is interpreted as having open germination pores. Apically oriented, open germination pores most obviously suggest an affinity with the angiosperm family Symplocaceae, but endocarps of Symplocaceae differ from Cavilignum in several critical characteristics (e.g., wall histology, presence of a basal pit). While several other groups (e.g., Anacardiaceae, Cornales) produce drupaceous fruits with endocarps comparable in some characteristics to those of Cavilignum, none is structurally congruent enough to suggest an affinity with the new fossil genus. Thus, Cavilignum cannot be conclusively assigned to a known extinct or extant angiosperm genus or family. Cavilignum is the first extinct plant genus described from the Gray Fossil Site macroflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardiaceae 3aCornales 3aPliocene epoch 3aSymplocaceae 3aendocarp 3aextinct species 3afossils 3agermination 3ahistology 3anew genus 3anew species 3aplants (botany) 3aTennessee 0aAngiosperm 0aFossil 0aGray Fossil Site 0aNeogene 0aPliocene1 aHermsen, Elizabeth J.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2020 Apr., v. 275 p.104174-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2020.1041743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245007600162300001700238520146600255592002801721650001901749650001901768650003501787650001301822650001701835650001701852650001401869650003901883650001101922653002201933653002901955653000801984653002101992700001502013700001302028700001702041700001902058700001602077700001802093700001902111773010802130856007902238852000902317655001202326IND60750582320221123040250.0220920e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058232DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2021-01002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Huimin10aIsolation of microglia from retinas of chronic ocular hypertensive rats  ap. 992-1001.  aMicroglia are the principal glial cells involved in the processes of immune inflammation within both retina and optic nerve, especially under the context of glaucomatous neuropathy. Considering the distinguishing role of retinal microglia in glaucoma and the lack of established protocol for microglia isolation from animal glaucoma model, the present study aimed to develop and validate a method with characteristics of both simplicity and efficiency for retinal microglia isolation from chronic ocular hypertensive (COH) rats. A Percoll gradient of various concentrations was used to separate microglia from whole retinal cells of the COH rats and control group. The finally isolated microglia were identified by CD11b and Iba-1 immunofluorescence staining, and the cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Additionally, the proportion of microglia in the whole retina cells was identified by flow cytometry. Results showed that the survival rates of isolated retinal microglia with the Percoll gradient method were 67.2 ± 4% and 67.6 ± 3% in control and COH groups, respectively. The proportion of the microglia population in the whole retinal cells was about 0.4–0.93%. To conclude, the present study confirmed that the application of Percoll gradient could effectively separate microglia from retinas of COH rats, which will probably enrich the tool kit for basic researchers of glaucoma specialty and help with scientific investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglaucoma 3ainflammation 3anerve tissue 3aneuroglia 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aretina 0aretinal microglia 0aprimary cells separation 0aCOH 0aPercoll gradient1 aYou, Huan,1 aSun, Jun1 aChen, Junjue1 aHuang, Shouyue1 aHuang, Ping1 aLiu, Xiaohong1 aZhong, Yisheng0 tOpen life sciences.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 16, no. 1 p.992-1001dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2021-01003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009600177300001600273520082800289592002801117650002901145650002301174650001501197650001101212773010001223856005501323852000901378655001201387IND4476332120221119153153.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447633212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02238.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Lawrence R.,10aIntegration of the study of natural and anthropogenic disturbances using severity gradients  ap. 916-922.  aDisturbance is an integral part of every ecosystem, but humans are altering disturbance regimes in fundamental ways that can alter outcomes for ecosystem structure and function. Fortunately, advances in understanding ecosystem responses to natural disturbances can address the ecological consequences of the novel suite of disturbances now created by humans. Complex interactions among both natural and anthropogenic disturbances at many overlapping spatial and temporal scales can be examined across severity gradients. The gradient approach applies ecological tools to differential conditions of stability and fertility, degrees of biological legacy and rates of successional recovery and can help address modern concerns about socioâeconomic consequences of disturbance and the sustainability of ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahumans0 tAustral ecology.g2011 Dec., v. 36, no. 8 p.916-922dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02238.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245020000172300001400372520100000386592002801386650002201414650001601436650001601452650001101468650001801479650001101497650002201508650001201530650002301542650002001565650001901585651001001604653001601614653001601630653002301646653001801669653001501687700001801702700002001720700002401740700001801764700002201782700001801804773011501822856008801937852000902025655001202034IND60540227020221119142635.0190318e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054022702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.07.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Kazuhiro10aChattonella (Raphidophyceae) bloom spatio-temporal variations in Tachibana Bay and the southern area of Ariake Sea, Japan: Interregional displacement patterns with Skeletonema (Bacillariophyceae)  ap. 54-60.  aIn 2010, a massive bloom of the raphidophycean flagellate Chattonella occurred in the Ariake Sea and Tachibana Bay. Bloom dynamics and hydrographical conditions were examined by field survey. The development and decline of the bloom occurred three times in Tachibana Bay. First and third bloom developments synchronized with precipitation, and the second bloom developed in synchronization with a salinity decrease which occurred in relation to an increase of river discharge from the Chikugo River which takes several days to flow from the Ariake Sea. These results imply that the bloom was transported with the low salinity water from the Ariake Sea to Tachibana Bay. During blooms along the northern coast of Shimabara Peninsula, the predominant phytoplankton species changed from Chattonella to Skeletonema. Low salinity water intrusion induced an interregional difference of the Chattonella and Skeletonema bloom spatially-differentiated by the salinity in the Ariake Sea and Tachibana Bay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChattonella 3aSkeletonema 3acoasts 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3awater pollution 3awater salinity 3aJapan 0aChattonella 0aSkeletonema 0aLow salinity water 0aTachibana Bay 0aAriake Sea1 aOnitsuka, Goh1 aShimizu, Manabu1 aYamatogi, Toshifumi1 aIshida, Naoya1 aKitahara, Shigeru1 aHirano, Keiji0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 99, no. 1-2 p.54-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.07.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015100170520221300321592002802534650001202562650001602574650001202590650001702602650002102619650002502640650002702665650001602692650001402708650002602722650001502748650001602763651001102779653001302790653001602803653003702819653002502856653002402881700001702905700001502922700001802937773010502955856008603060852000903146655001203155IND60750582520221123040323.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1268942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHokanson, K.J.10aHummock-scale controls on groundwater recharge rates and the potential for developing local groundwater flow systems in water-limited environments  aWe use two-dimensional numerical models to identify controls on groundwater recharge, water table dynamics, and the sink-source function of fine-textured hummocks in water-limited environments. A silty clay loam hummock with aspen forest cover in the sub-humid Boreal Plains region of Canada is used to develop a conceptual model and calibrate a variably-saturated flow model to better investigate the dynamics of recharge, water table position, and lateral flow between the forested hummock and adjacent peatland. Scenario testing (achieved by raising and lowering the hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude and altering the hummock height and length) provides further understanding of the controls that hydraulic conductivity and hummock morphometry exert on recharge and forestland-peatland interactions. We find that the hydraulic conductivity of the glacial till has the largest control over recharge, followed by the hummock height and length and, lastly, annual atmospheric fluxes. Hummocks with higher hydraulic conductivity or long morphometric profiles are most often sinks of water as they promote increased root-water uptake, while taller hummocks with lower hydraulic conductivity tend to act as hydrologic sources for adjacent wetlands. The magnitude of annual recharge and water table elevation are poorly correlated with annual atmospheric fluxes due to the strong effects of multi-year storage deficits or surpluses; however, they are appreciably affected by decadal wet-dry cycles typical of the Boreal Plains climate. Additionally, we show that both distance along a hummock and elevation are key factors in controlling the spatial distribution of recharge at a single hummock. It is common to conceptualize the water table as a shallow and subdued replica of surface topography, where water flows from topographic highs (i.e., forestlands) to topographic lows (i.e., peatlands) in humid environments; however, as we show here, recharge rates, water table elevation, and the sink-source function of a forested hummock in water-limited environments is highly variable in time and space, and strongly dependent on both the hydrogeological and morphometric properties of the hummock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aforest land 3aforests 3aglacial till 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amorphometry 3apeatlands 3asilty clay loam soils 3atopography 3awater table 3aCanada 0aRecharge 0aGroundwater 0aForestland-peatland interactions 0aSink-source function 0aHillslope hydrology1 aThompson, C.1 aDevito, K.1 aMendoza, C.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.126894-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1268943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013400154300001800288520100600306592002801312650001101340650001601351650001701367650001901384650001501403650002201418650002101440650001201461650002501473650001601498700001401514700002001528700001601548700001601564700001701580700001401597700001901611700001301630700002001643773014101663856007401804852000901878655001201887IND60670905920221121044118.0191002e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067090592DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta05817h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Min10aLow cost and environmentally benign crack-blocking structures for long life and high power Si electrodes in lithium ion batteries  ap. 2036-2042.  aThe high capacity Si (4200 mA h g⁻¹, Li₄.₄Si) commonly undergoes cracking and delamination due to drastic volume change (∼300%) during lithiation/delithiation processes in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, abundant and sustainable natural polymer gum arabic (GA) and low cost polyacrylic acid (PAA) are used to fabricate Si anodes with resilient, crack-blocking properties. The esterification reaction between GA and PAA establishes a flexible network resulting in reinforced mechanical strength and enhanced coherent strength. Meanwhile, the water vapour resulting from the esterification reaction generates micron-sized pores which relieves the stress and blocks the formation and propagation of cracks. As a result of the crack-blocking effect, the resultant Si anodes present a superior volumetric capacity of 2890 A h L⁻¹. In addition, charge–discharge cycling for more than 1000 cycles is achieved with the Li insertion capacity limited to 1000 mA h g⁻¹ at a 1 C rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiopolymers 3adelamination 3aesterification 3agum arabic 3alithium batteries 3apolyacrylic acid 3asilicon 3astrength (mechanics) 3awater vapor1 aZhao, Hui1 aXiao, Xingcheng1 aShi, Feifei1 aWu, Mingyan1 aQiu, Jingxia1 aLi, Sheng1 aSong, Xiangyun1 aLiu, Gao1 aZhang, Shanqing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 3, no. 5 p.2036-2042dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta05817h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010100176300001800277520106300295592002801358650002601386650001701412650001401429650001201443650001001455650001601465650001301481650001001494650001001504650001401514650002101528650001701549650002701566650002201593650000901615700001901624700002401643700002801667773010101695856008501796852000901881655001201890IND60537052920221120042509.0160807e20160817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705292DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2016.11922052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Ashmawy, Nahla E.10aEffect of Pomegranate Hull Extract on Liver Neoplastic Changes in Rats: More than an Antioxidant  ap. 1044-1051.  aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The current work was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effect of pomegranate hull extract (PHE) in livers of rats exposed to the hepatocarcinogen diethyl nitrosamine (DENA) with emphasis on oxidative stress, proliferation, and apoptosis. Male albino rats were divided into three groups: normal control, DENA group, and PHE group. PHE was given to rats orally 3 times weekly for 10 wk, 4 wk before and 6 wk after DENA (200 mg/kg, single i.p. dose). The results indicated a prophylactic effect of PHE against neoplastic changes in the liver, which was evidenced by the decrease of tumor size, liver index, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2; and the increase of glutathione. PHE group also showed decreased expression of liver cyclin D1 and β-catenin genes compared with DENA group. It is proved that PHE has antitumorigenic effect and could be a candidate for anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acyclins 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3amales 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3apomegranates 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aprotective effect 3arats1 aKhedr, Eman G.1 aEl-Bahrawy, Hoda A.1 aAbd El-Fattah, Eslam E.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2016 Aug. 17, v. 68, no. 6 p.1044-1051dTaylor & Francisx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2016.11922053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245016100128300001600289520127800305592002801583650001301611650001101624650001901635650002601654650001801680650001701698650000901715650001001724650001901734650001201753650001301765650001101778650001701789650001001806650002501816651001001841700001701851773012801868852000901996655001202005IND60445631720221117002427.0151029e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044563172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xin-Wei10aArtificial Warming Advances Egg-Laying and Decreases Larval Size in the Dung Beetle Aphodius erraticus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in a Tibetan Alpine Meadow  ap. 174-180.  aThe Tibetan Plateau is one of the areas in the world most sensitive to global warming. Dung beetles are the most abundant decomposer species group responsible for cattle dung removal in the Tibetan alpine meadow, and are critical to nutrient cycling and primary production of the grazing system. This study evaluates the possible effects of global warming on early life-history traits of dung beetles. We established three warmed open-top chambers (OTCs, about 2.3 °C higher than the control) and three ambient OTCs, each containing nine fresh dung pats that were bagged with a nylon screen (0.2 mm in mesh size). Twenty adults of a dominant coprophagous beetle species, Aphodius erraticus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) had been put into each dung bag at the beginning of the experiment and the timings of egg-laying and hatching, and egg and larval size were followed for 80 days. Artificial warming advanced egg-laying and hatching by 4.1 and 7.2 days, respectively; warming decreased egg and larval size by 22.1% and 33.4%, respectively. This short-term study demonstrates that early lifehistory traits of A. erraticus are sensitive to artificial warming, which suggests that global warming may also change life history traits of other organisms in detritus-based systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphodius 3aadults 3aalpine meadows 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acattle manure 3adung beetles 3aeggs 3afeces 3aglobal warming 3agrazing 3ahatching 3alarvae 3alife history 3anylon 3aprimary productivity 3aChina1 aSun, Shu-Cun0 tAnnales zoologici Fennici.g2012 June, v. 49, no. 3 p.174-180dFinnish Zoological and Botanical Publishingx0003-455X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011600175300001200291500001900303520167200322592002801994596005102022650003002073650001902103650001902122650001202141650003002153650001302183650002302196650001102219650000902230650001602239650001502255651001002270700003302280700001902313773015202332856008302484852000902567655001202576IND60708472920221121093855.0210325e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08563-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvalakshmi, Selvaraj10aPredicting the habitat distribution of rubber plantations with topography, soil, land use, and climatic factors  ap. 598.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCommercial demand is the prerequisite for the expansion of rubber plantation, which is highly dependent on climate, topography, and soil factors. Without the contextual knowledge on these factors, the expansion of rubber plantation would remain unproductive. This study thereby aimed to evaluate the current and future suitable habitat distributions of rubber using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. A total of 148 field-based presence locations and environmental variables (soil, bioclimatic, topography, and land use) were used to predict the suitable areas of rubber plantations using HadGEM2-ES climate model. Medium and high climatic representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (4.5 and 8.5) were selected to predict the suitable habitats for the years 2050 and 2070. Among various factors, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of warmest quarter, and soil exchangeable H⁺ contributed significantly to the distribution of rubber. Currently, 1119 km² and 2716 km² were predicted as high and moderately suitable areas respectively. It is predicted with increase rates in the high suitable areas, 49.96% and 328.95% by 2050 and 2070 respectively under RCP 4.5. This result indicates that the medium climate change of RCP 4.5 may have a direct positive effect on the expansion of habitat suitability of rubber. We also found potential areas for rubber cultivation in Jinghong and Mengla townships, where the further expansion is anticipated with desirable land-use planning by conserving reserve forest and native vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data  a41877064cNational Science Foundation of China 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3arubber 3asoil 3atemperature 3atopography 3aChina1 aKalarikkal, Remya Kottarathu1 aYang, Xiaodong0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Sept., v. 192, no. 9 p.598-598dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08563-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163300002000265520183500285592002802120650002002148650001202168650001402180650002402194650001902218650001302237650001102250650001102261650001802272651001002290700001402300700001702314700001402331773015502345856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60708473020221121093856.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-4038-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Sheng10aRemote sensing-based water quality assessment for urban rivers: a study in linyi development area  ap. 34586-34595.  aNowadays, urban rivers play an important role in city development and make great contributions to urban ecology. Most urban rivers are the drinking water sources and water quality is extremely critical. The current assessment method in national standard of China has multiple limitations; therefore, this paper introduces an advanced assessment, that is, Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI). This method can help to provide comprehensive and objective water quality assessment for the urban rivers. Moreover, CWQI can prevent waste of the water resource, since current assessment is pessimistic and tent to underestimate water samples to a lower grade. Linyi development area is selected as study region and CWQI method is applied to assess two major urban rivers within the area. The water monitoring data from 2014 to 2017 is acquired in 24 parameters. Since the CWQI calculation is still based on traditional water quality measurement in parameters, there will be a huge cost when increasing research scale and accuracy. In this paper, remote sensing technique is employed to develop models of CWQI scores from satellite data. By utilizing 23 selected monitoring instances and matching satellite data, linear regression analysis shows that red band data has highest correlation with CWQI in both two urban rivers in the study region. In addition, two testing datasets with five instances for each river are used to validate the RS-based CWQI models and the results show that testing datasets can be fitted well. With the models, CWQI distribution diagrams are generated and assist both spatial and temporal analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can indicate actual water quality pattern which is validated by field visit. The proposed approach in this paper has satisfying effectiveness and robustness.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecology 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3arivers 3awastes 3awater quality 3aChina1 aLiu, Chao1 aQian, Binjie1 aMiao, Qun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.34586-34595dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-4038-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245014200215500001900357520152000376592002801896650001801924650001101942650002001953650002101973650002601994650001402020650001802034650001902052653002502071653003202096653002602128653002902154653002602183653002602209700002502235700007102260773012002331856008802451852000902539655001202548IND60697917820221122174033.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069791782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Avishreshth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5153-724110aQuantification of embodied energy and carbon footprint of pervious concrete pavements through a methodical lifecycle assessment framework  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study provided a systematic lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodology that was used to quantify the total embodied energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions involved in construction of a new pavement. Furthermore, a comparative LCA was performed to adjudge the benefits offered by pervious concrete pavement (PCP) over Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP) for different mixing procedures, and distinct base layers. The system boundaries included the following phases of pavement LCA: raw material production, transportation, and pavement construction. The total embodied energy and GHG emissions were quantified for a functional unit of 1 km single lane road, 3.5 m wide, and 0.35 m thickness. The relative contribution of each component to energy consumption and GHG emissions was estimated and the variability of LCA model parameters was understood using sensitivity analysis. The results dictated that the total embodied energy and GHG emissions in PCP with aggregate base layer were reduced by up to 3% and 2.7%, respectively, compared to that of PCCP with similar configuration. Further, a capital cost analysis was conducted due to non-availability of maintenance and end-of-life data, which indicated that PCP is almost 1.21% costlier than PCCP for RMC mixing, and 4.13% cheaper for in-situ mixing. The conceptual approach developed in this study provided a generalized methodical framework that could be used to assess the environmental credibility of pavement systems for site-specific conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital costs 3acement 3aembodied energy 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3apavements 3araw materials 3atransportation 0aLifecycle assessment 0aPervious concrete pavements 0aTotal embodied energy 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aCapital cost analysis 0aResource conservation1 aVaddy, Poornachandra1 aBiligiri, Krishna Prapoorna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2313-08150 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2020 Oct., v. 161 p.104953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001600162245013700178300001200315500000900327520047300336592002800809650001200837650001100849650001600860650001200876650001300888650001500901650001200916650001400928650001000942650000900952650001100961650001400972773011800986856009701104852000901201655001201210IND60663472920221122012557.0191122e195801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1958.00021962005000010002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaas, H.

The gulf is known to have been rather largely contaminated by heavy metals during the last century, and although indications of recovery have been reported, it is crucial to know the levels of sea floor sediment contamination before any decisions of activities are taken by the authorities. In order to predict sediment toxicity the sediment concentrations acquired during a study from 2001 to 2004 are compared to Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQG: s), which reveal that in the majority of the subsamples the metals and arsenic exceed the threshold levels of the used SQG: s, some exceed also the probable effect level.

However, their implementation as practical biomedical skin patches or wearable devices has so far been limited by their insufficient transdermal adhesion strength. In this work, a new polyampholytic terpolymer (PAT) hydrogel with enhanced skin adhesion was developed using a novel and simple strategy that tunes the structure of ion-pair associations (IPAs), acting as cross-links, in the hydrogel via adding an extra neutral monomer component into the network without changing the total charge balance. The PAT hydrogels were synthesized by the terpolymerization of the neutral monomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm) (or 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)) as well as the cationic monomer 3-(methacryloylamino) propyl-trimethylammonium chloride (MPTC) and the anionic monomer sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS). Their IPA, which determines their network structure, was modulated by varying the feed concentration of the neutral monomer, Cₙₘ. An increase of Cₙₘ within an optimized Cₙₘ window (0.3–0.4 M) decreased the cross-linking density (strength and density of the IPAs) of the PAT hydrogels, reducing the softening temperature and Young’s modulus, which increased compliance but maintained sufficient mechanical strength and thereby maximized the contact surface and enhanced skin adhesion. The DMAAm monomers, compared to the HEMA monomers, produced the higher skin adhesion of the PAT hydrogel, which was explained by the difference in their reactivity to the MPTC and NaSS. This study demonstrated this new method to develop the PAT hydrogels with excellent skin adhesion and biocompatibility while maintaining good toughness, compliance, and SELF behavior and the potential of the PAT hydrogels for biomedical skin patches and wearable devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3achlorides 3acompliance 3acrosslinking 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3asodium 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 0apolyampholyte terpolymer hydrogel 0aion-pair association 0askin adhesion 0asoftening temperature 0aself-recovery and self-healing1 aLee, Dae Sung1 aJung, Yong Chae1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8806-30701 aOh, Jeong-Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1606-07161 aNa, Yang Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3039-01020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 13, no. 7 p.8889-8900dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c194273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300002000271500001900291520115100310592002801461650001101489650001901500650002101519700001401540700001901554700001601573700001801589700001401607700001701621773012501638856007401763852000901837655001201846IND60715857320221118211518.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071585732DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra07652j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Jiaying10aStructural configuration and tetragonal phase stability in the equiatomic quaternary Heusler compound TiZnMnSi  ap. 39731-39738.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeusler materials have aroused great scientific research interest during recent years due to their special electronic and magnetic properties. Especially for the equiatomic quaternary Heusler compounds, they exhibit very high composition flexibility and structure tunability. In this work, we have carried out a systematic study on the structural configuration and tetragonal stability for the Heusler compound TiZnMnSi by first-principles calculations. Results reveal the type-A structure with ferromagnetic state possesses the lowest total energy and thus should be the ground state configuration. Based on the equilibrium lattice constant, the electronic band structures and magnetic moments have been computed. The tetragonal phase transformation is then investigated by using the total energy variation under different tetragonal strains, and the stability analysis of the mechanical and dynamic properties indicates that TiZnMnSi exhibits a strong tendency for the tetragonal phase. These findings could provide reference data for relative experiments as well as a very helpful theoretical reference for this fascinating class of materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aferromagnetism 3aphase transition1 aGu, Qijia1 aKhenata, Rabah1 aGuo, Fayang1 aWang, Yanfeng1 aYang, Tie1 aTan, Xingwen0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 10, no. 65 p.39731-39738dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra07652j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009300171300001400264520102200278592002801300650002001328650002001348650001101368650001201379650001401391650000901405650001301414650001501427650001101442650001501453650001901468650002201487650001201509650003401521650001301555650003001568650003701598650002001635651001001655653001801665653000901683653000901692653000901701700001601710700001901726700001401745700001701759700001501776700001301791773011501804856008801919852000902007655001202016IND60540227520221119142626.0190318e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054022752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weiwei10aPersistent organic pollutants carried on plastic resin pellets from two beaches in China  ap. 28-34.  aMicroplastics provide a mechanism for the long-range transport of hydrophobic chemical contaminants to remote coastal and marine locations. In this study, plastic resin pellets were collected from Zhengmingsi Beach and Dongshan Beach in China. The collected pellets were analyzed for PAHs, PCBs, HCHs, DDTs, chlordane, heptachlor, endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin. The total concentration of PCBs ranged from 34.7–213.7ngg−1 and from 21.5–323.2ngg−1 in plastic resin pellets for Zhengmingsi Beach and Dongshan Beach respectively. The highest concentrations of PCBs were observed for congeners 44, 110, 138, 155 and 200. The total concentration of PAHs ranged from 136.3–1586.9ngg−1 and from 397.6–2384.2ngg−1 in the plastic pellets, whereas DDTs concentration ranged from 1.2–101.5ngg−1 and from 1.5–127.0ngg−1 for the two beaches. The elevated concentrations of pollutants appear to be related to extensive industrial development, agricultural activity and the use of coal in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aaldrin 3abeaches 3achlordane 3acoal 3adieldrin 3aendosulfan 3aendrin 3aheptachlor 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrialization 3apellets 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aplastics 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3awater pollution 3aChina 0aMicroplastics 0aPCBs 0aPAHs 0aOCPs1 aMa, Xindong1 aZhang, Zhifeng1 aWang, Yan1 aWang, Juying1 aWang, Jing1 aMa, Deyi0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 99, no. 1-2 p.28-34dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012900156300001800285520135400303592002801657650001901685650002301704650002301727650000901750650001301759650001801772650001401790650001601804650001401820650001801834650001401852650002301866650001101889650003701900700001301937700001201950773014001962856007402102852000902176655001202185IND60670906520221121033634.0191002e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067090652DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta05827e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Shilin10aControllable assembly of two types of metal nanoparticles onto block copolymer nanospheres with ordered spatial distribution  ap. 3382-3389.  aIn this study, we report a novel method to assemble two types of metal nanoparticles onto poly(styrene-b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-P2VP) block copolymer nanospheres with ordered spatial distribution. As a first step, core–shell metal–polymer particles have been fabricated, which consist of dodecanethiol (DT)–Au aggregation as core and PS-P2VP block copolymer as shell. Such core–shell particles have been obtained by swelling the DT–Au contained PS-P2VP nanoblocks, which are derived from Rayleigh instability of DT–Au@PS-P2VP nanotubes inside the cylindrical nanopores of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. The core size and shell thickness of the particles can be tuned by the weight ratio of PS-P2VP to DT–Au content. An increase of the DT–Au content results in an increase of the DT–Au core size, combined with a red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak in the UV-vis spectra. Such core–shell particles have been further decorated with Pd nanoparticles on the shell due to the microphase separation of the PS-P2VP, which shows efficient catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH₄. Thus, the Au and Pd nanoparticles have been selectively assembled onto the PS-P2VP particles with ordered spatial distribution, leading to composite particles with multiple functions from both metal nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3ananospheres 3ananotubes 3ap-nitrophenol 3apalladium 3asodium borohydride 3athiols 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aCao, Jie1 aLu, Yan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Feb. 3, v. 3, no. 7 p.3382-3389dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta05827e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245014900167300001600316520189500332592002802227650002302255650001102278650000902289650001302298650001802311650001802329650001502347650001402362700001902376700001902395700001202414700002302426700001402449700002102463700002202484700002402506700002002530700002202550773012902572856007802701852000902779655001202788IND60541880920221117181837.0160823e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054188092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b095292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedford, Nicholas M.10aSequence-Dependent Structure/Function Relationships of Catalytic Peptide-Enabled Gold Nanoparticles Generated under Ambient Synthetic Conditions  ap. 540-548.  aPeptide-enabled nanoparticle (NP) synthesis routes can create and/or assemble functional nanomaterials under environmentally friendly conditions, with properties dictated by complex interactions at the biotic/abiotic interface. Manipulation of this interface through sequence modification can provide the capability for material properties to be tailored to create enhanced materials for energy, catalysis, and sensing applications. Fully realizing the potential of these materials requires a comprehensive understanding of sequence-dependent structure/function relationships that is presently lacking. In this work, the atomic-scale structures of a series of peptide-capped Au NPs are determined using a combination of atomic pair distribution function analysis of high-energy X-ray diffraction data and advanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Au NPs produced with different peptide sequences exhibit varying degrees of catalytic activity for the exemplar reaction 4-nitrophenol reduction. The experimentally derived atomic-scale NP configurations reveal sequence-dependent differences in structural order at the NP surface. Replica exchange with solute-tempering MD simulations are then used to predict the morphology of the peptide overlayer on these Au NPs and identify factors determining the structure/catalytic properties relationship. We show that the amount of exposed Au surface, the underlying surface structural disorder, and the interaction strength of the peptide with the Au surface all influence catalytic performance. A simplified computational prediction of catalytic performance is developed that can potentially serve as a screening tool for future studies. Our approach provides a platform for broadening the analysis of catalytic peptide-enabled metallic NP systems, potentially allowing for the development of rational design rules for property enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3aprediction 3ascreening1 aHughes, Zak E.1 aTang, Zhenghua1 aLi, Yue1 aBriggs, Beverly D.1 aRen, Yang1 aSwihart, Mark T.1 aPetkov, Valeri

Taoyuan, China, is famous worldwide as a special ecosite for ultrahigh rice yield. Climatological factors affecting this phenomenon have been identified, but the potential molecular processes and environmental mechanisms promoting ultrahigh yield remain mysteries. This study identifies soil biotic factors affecting ultrahigh yield, considering soil microbial community structure and metagenomic functions during four key rice growth stages, together with results from nitrogen enrichment experiments and rice root transcriptome analysis. Our results show that Taoyuan has more diverse bacterial taxa, less diverse fungal taxa, and a 10-fold-stronger connection among microbial taxa as well as a significantly higher proportion of nutrient transport functions than a regular site. Notably, our metagenomic analysis shows that Taoyuan contains more taxa with nitrogen metabolism functions and a higher abundance of genes involved in the nitrification process (e.g., hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and nitric oxide dioxygenase), promoting effective transformation of ammonium (NH₄⁺) to nitrate (NO₃⁻) in rice fields and stimulating high expression of nitrate transporters in rice roots, leading to ultrahigh yields. Our results indicate that soil microbiota contribute to ultrahigh rice yield in Taoyuan, and indicate that nitrogen metabolism functions could be one of the mechanism for the ultrahigh yield of rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aammonium 3abiotic factors 3acommunity structure 3adevelopmental stages 3afood security 3afungi 3agenes 3agrain yield 3ahydroxylamine 3ametagenomics 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient transport 3aoxidoreductases 3apaddies 3arice 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil biota 3asoil microorganisms 3atranscriptomics 3atransporters 3aChina 0aUltrahigh yield 0aMicrobiome 0aMetagenomic 0aTranscriptome 0aNitrate transporters1 aHu, Jihong1 aXia, Qiongmei1 aZhang, Shilai1 aLi, Xin1 aPan, Xiangyu1 aZhao, Ruoping1 aWang, Ruiwu1 aYan, Weiming1 aShangguan, Zhouping1 aHu, Fengyi1 aYang, Congdang1 aWang, Wen0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 Apr., v. 143 p.107741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1077413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169520148000284592002801764650001101792650002601803650002201829650001101851650001701862650001701879650001901896653004001915653002501955653003701980653004202017700001402059700001602073700001602089773011402105856008602219852000902305655001202314IND60783489120221116165102.0220830e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyan10aExploration in carbon emission reduction effect of low-carbon practices in prefabricated building supply chain  aPrefabricated buildings (PBs) are recognized as an effective solution to reduce emissions in the construction industry. Existing researches reveal abatement potential of prefabrication comparing to traditional construction methods, but overlook low-carbon practices adopted by stakeholders during prefabrication processes which can unlock green opportunity for PBs. This paper develops a game-based system dynamics (SD) model to explore the implementation effects of low-carbon practices from prefabricated building supply chain (PBSC) perspective. SD model describes the equilibriums of game model and reflects the sources of carbon emissions during prefabrication processes, including prefabricated components production, transportation and on-site assembly. Major variables influencing carbon emission reduction level of PBSC are also discussed. The results demonstrate that 1) low-carbon practices can effectively mitigate carbon emissions while the participants' profits are improved; 2) with gradual enhancement of developers’ environmental awareness and continuous promotion of prefabrication, effects of low-carbon practices can be further strengthened; 3) carbon taxes cannot always stimulate implementation of low-carbon practices, especially in the initial development stage of prefabricated buildings. This research can provide the PBSC members with supports for adopting low-carbon practices and help government formulate a prospective carbon-reduction policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aconstruction industry 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3atransportation 0aPrefabricated building supply chain 0aLow-carbon practices 0aCarbon emission reduction effect 0aGame-based system dynamics simulation1 aDu, Qiang1 aLü, Cheng,1 aLi, Jingtao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 25, v. 368 p.133153-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015600164300002000320520157900340592002801919596005401947596008202001596008802083596008202171650001202253650002102265650001402286650001602300650001702316650002202333650001402355650001302369650001302382651001002395700001402405700001602419700001402435700001602449700001702465773015502482856008302637852000902720655001202729IND60708473520221121093902.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06791-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yanyan10aAssessment of background levels and pollution sources for arsenic and fluoride in the phreatic and confined groundwater of Xi’an city, Shaanxi, China  ap. 34702-34714.  aThe presence of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater and their impacts on human health have been reported in many countries worldwide, but little information is available on As or F⁻ contamination in Xi’an city. This study highlights the distribution and sources of As and F⁻ anomalies in different aquifers of Xi’an city, based on the assessment of natural background levels (NBLs) and threshold values (TVs). Groundwater samples collected from phreatic and confined aquifers were analyzed to evaluate NBLs and TVs, using median + 2MAD, Tukey inner fence (TIF), and percentile-based methods. Results showed that NBLs and TVs of As and F⁻ in the phreatic aquifer were lower than those in the confined aquifer, indicating importance of the geological effects on the enrichment of arsenic and fluoride in the confined aquifer. Combined with hydrogeochemical methods, the distributions of As and F⁻ anomalies show that high concentrations of As in both aquifers and F⁻ in the confined aquifer can be attributed to the upward flow of geothermal water through faults and ground fissures, while high concentrations of F⁻ in the phreatic aquifer may be greatly influenced by contaminated rivers. Although geological structures such as faults and ground fissures contribute to the high concentrations of potentially toxic elements, anthropogenic activities cannot be ignored because over exploitation of groundwater accelerates the development of ground fissures and results in the upward flow and mixing of geothermal water with groundwater in the upper aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data  a41572236cthe Natural Science Foundation of China  a201301084cthe Public Welfare Fund Project of the Ministry of Water Resources  a211529180149cInvestigation and evaluation of environmental hydrogeology in Xi’an  a300102298712cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,CHD 3aarsenic 3aconfined aquifer 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3ahydrogeochemistry 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aQian, Hui1 aWang, Haike1 aChen, Jie1 aRen, Wenhao1 aYang, Faxuan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.34702-34714dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06791-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245015600163300001600319520145600335592002801791650002501819650002501844650002401869650001401893650001201907650001201919650002101931650001701952650001501969650001101984650002401995650001702019650001402036650001002050650001302060653002602073653003402099653002502133653001502158653002202173653002502195653000802220653000702228653000802235653000702243653000702250653000702257653000802264653000802272653000802280653000802288653000902296653000802305653001202313653000802325653000802333653000702341653000902348700001702357700001702374700001702391700001402408700001502422700001502437773011202452856008602564852000902650655001202659IND60592479120221118040610.0201209e20180520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059247912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Qi10aSustainable deep eutectic solvents preparation and their efficiency in extraction and enrichment of main bioactive flavonoids from sea buckthorn leaves  ap. 826-835.  aDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) have naturally emerged as an alternative for traditional organic solvents for their efficiency on extracting natural products from plant materials. In the present study, 12 kinds of DESs (choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor) were firstly prepared and applied to extract five main flavonoids (namely rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin) from sea buckthorn leaves (SBL) combined with microwave-assisted extraction. The results showed that the extraction efficiencies of target flavonoids by DES were significantly superior to 70% ethanol. Aiming at obtaining the optimal procedure, the extraction conditions were statistically investigated. Under the optimal conditions in pilot-scale application, the total maximum extraction yields of five main flavonoids reached to 20.820 mg/g, which was 1.321–2.400 folds to those by the traditional extraction methods. Meanwhile, the following enrichment of targets compounds from DES extraction solution exhibited excellent recoveries in the range of 72.36–84.99% were achieved by macroporous resin AB-8. In addition, the enriched flavonoids by AB-8 resin exhibited better antioxidant activities as compared with those unenriched. The results indicated that the potential of the developed method as a promising safe and sustainable alternative for selectively extraction and separation of bioactive substances from plant materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3achlorides 3acholine 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisorhamnetin 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3amicrowave treatment 3aporous media 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asolvents 0aDeep eutectic solvent 0aMicrowave-assisted extraction 0aSea buckthorn leaves 0aFlavonoids 0aMacroporous resin 0aAntioxidant activity 0aSBL 0aRU 0aQOG 0aQU 0aKA 0aIS 0aILs 0aDES 0aHBD 0aHBA 0aChCl 0aMAE 0aDES-MAE 0aHRE 0aUAE 0aDW 0aBV/h1 aLiu, Ju-Zhao1 aWang, Lidao,1 aKang, Yu-Fei1 aMeng, Yao1 aJiao, Jiao1 aFu, Yu-Jie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 20, v. 184 p.826-835dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245014700166300001300313520071400326592002801040650001701068650002101085650002301106650001501129650001301144650001101157650001401168650002601182650002101208653001701229653002301246653001601269653001501285653002101300700002301321773011501344856007701459852000901536655001201545IND60519989820221120124502.0160512e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998982DNAL7 a10.1515/ffp-2015-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGłowacka, Barbara10aEfficacy of Mospilan 20 SP and Trebon 30 EC in the protection of Scots pine Pinus silvestris L. against the common pine sawfly Diprion pini L.  ap. 3-10.  aThe study was carried out to evaluate the possibilities to control the common pine sawfly Diprion pini L. with the use of plant protection products Mospilan 20 SP (20% acetamipryd) and Trebon 30 EC (300 g etofenprox/l).

Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adecline 3adrought 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3amodels 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asocioeconomic development 3asolar radiation 3asupport vector machines 3asurface temperature 3awater table 0aSupport vector machine 0aGRACE 0aData assimilation1 aMishra, Ashok K.1 aYu, Zhongbo1 aLü, Haishen1 aLi, Yajie0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.126929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1269293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245010300151520153200254592002801786650002201814650001201836650001101848650002501859700001801884773012601902856007302028852000902101655001202110IND60651940920221118033903.0190712e20170324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065194092DNAL7 a10.3390/su90404842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Han10aStudy on Influence Factors of Electric Vehicles Charging Station Location Based on ISM and FMICMAC  aAlong with the rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles, there is urgent need to construct electric vehicles charging stations (EVCSs) to satisfy the charging demand. However, during the process of carrying out quantitative and qualitative analysis on location decisions, it is necessary to make clear the relationships and role between various factors which make impacts on charging station location. Studies are inadequate in analyzing the influence factors with regard to this respect. This study aims to identify the influence factors, as well as the driving and dependence power of these factors and to analyze the interactions among them. This work proposes to use interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Matriced'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (fuzzy cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) (FMICMAC) based approach which is a novel effort in this sector. Moreover, rankings of the identified factors have also been obtained. Based on review of literature and brainstorming among experts in the EVCS field and academia, this paper puts forward 12 factors that impact EVCS location in five aspects. After ISM and FMICMAC analysis, it is concluded that area attribute and geographical environment are defined as key factors while construction cost and annual operation and maintenance cost are the objective factors. The developed integrated structured model will be beneficial in understanding the interrelationship and dependency among the identified factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric vehicles 3aexperts 3amodels 3aqualitative analysis1 aNiu, Dongxiao0 tSustainability.g2017 Mar. 24, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90404843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164300001600278520150800294592002801802650002001830650002001850650003701870650002001907650001801927650002501945651000901970700001401979700002701993773010002020856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60520112420221121161731.0160513e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052011242DNAL7 a10.1134/S106422931603008X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedaghat, A.10aEstimation of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity by artificial neural networks ensemble in smectitic soils  ap. 347-357.  aThe saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ₛ) of the soil is one of the main soil physical properties. Indirect estimation of this parameter using pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) has received considerable attention. The Purpose of this study was to improve the estimation of K ₛ using fractal parameters of particle and micro-aggregate size distributions in smectitic soils. In this study 260 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from Guilan province, the north of Iran. The fractal model of Bird and Perrier was used to compute the fractal parameters of particle and micro-aggregate size distributions. The PTFs were developed by artificial neural networks (ANNs) ensemble to estimate K ₛ by using available soil data and fractal parameters. There were found significant correlations between K ₛ and fractal parameters of particles and microaggregates. Estimation of K ₛ was improved significantly by using fractal parameters of soil micro-aggregates as predictors. But using geometric mean and geometric standard deviation of particles diameter did not improve K ₛ estimations significantly. Using fractal parameters of particles and micro-aggregates simultaneously, had the most effect in the estimation of K ₛ . Generally, fractal parameters can be successfully used as input parameters to improve the estimation of K ₛ in the PTFs in smectitic soils. As a result, ANNs ensemble successfully correlated the fractal parameters of particles and micro-aggregates to K ₛ .  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroaggregates 3aneural networks 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asmectitic soils 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 3aIran1 aBayat, H.1 aSafari Sinegani, A.

In this study, a probe-based qPCR method was developed, targeting a sterol 14-alpha demethylase (CYP51) paralogue, CYP51C unique to the genus Fusarium, for the simultaneous detection of F. asiaticum, F. ussurianum and F. vorosii. Specificity of the assay was demonstrated for a wide range of Fusarium species, including all tested FGSC members (n=6), originating from different hosts and geographic regions. Alongside a previously published assay for detection of F. graminearum, we were able to show that members of the Asian clade of the FGSC (i.e. F. asiaticum, F. ussurianum and F. vorosii) were the primary etiological agent in wheat seeds samples originating from Central-East China. The grain samples from the UK tested negative for the presence of the FGSC's Asian clade and positive for presence of F. graminearum. It is likely that only F. graminearum s.s. is present in the UK, but the presence of other FGSC members cannot be ruled out and need further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aetiological agents 3aseeds 3ahosts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3awheat 3aChina 3aUnited Kingdom 0aReal-time PCR detection 0aGibberella zeae 0aCYP51 0aFusarium head blight (FHB) 0aFusarium1 aWaalwijk, Cees1 aVan der Lee, Theo1 aFan, Jieru1 aAtkins, Sarah1 aWest, Jonq(Jon S.),1 aFraaije, Bart A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 166, no. 1 p.148-154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014800184300001800332520076400350592002801114650001901142650001301161650001501174650002001189650001701209650001101226650001301237650003201250650007501282650001701357650003201374650004701406650003101453650001101484650007601495650005201571650003501623650006001658650003601718650007101754700001901825700001901844700002001863700002301883700001701906700001801923700001901941700002401960700002101984773010802005856008102113990002302194852000902217655001202226IND60090619420221121034542.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009061942DNAL7 a214196312pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Pankaj10aSelective biocatalytic aminolysis of (±)-epichlorohydrin: Synthesis and ICAM-1 inhibitory activity of (S)-(+)-3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols  ap. 2263-2268.  aRegio- and enantioselective synthesis of (S)-(+)-3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols has been achieved by the epoxide ring opening of (±)-epichlorohydrin with different aromatic amines in the presence of Candida rugosa lipase.

These biguanide drugs elevate 5′-AMP, which allosterically activates AMPK and promotes phosphorylation on Thr172 of AMPK catalytic α subunits. Although kinases phosphorylating this site have been identified, phosphatases that dephosphorylate it are unknown. The aim of this study is to identify protein phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate AMPKα-Thr172 within cells. Our initial data indicated that members of the protein phosphatase ce:sup>/ce:sup>/Mn²⁺-dependent (PPM) family and not those of the PPP family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases may be directly or indirectly inhibited by phenformin. Using antibodies raised to individual Ppm phosphatases that facilitated the assessment of their activities, phenformin stimulation of cells was found to decrease the ce:sup>/ce:sup>/Mn²⁺-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity of Ppm1E and Ppm1F, but not that attributable to other PPM family members, including Ppm1A/PP2Cα. Depletion of Ppm1E, but not Ppm1A, using lentiviral-mediated stable gene silencing, increased AMPKα-Thr172 phosphorylation approximately three fold in HEK293 cells. In addition, incubation of cells with low concentrations of phenformin and depletion of Ppm1E increased AMPK phosphorylation synergistically. Ppm1E and the closely related Ppm1F interact weakly with AMPK and assays with lysates of cells stably depleted of Ppm1F suggests that this phosphatase contributes to dephosphorylation of AMPK. The data indicate that Ppm1E and probably PpM1F are in cellulo AMPK phosphatases and that Ppm1E is a potential anti-diabetic drug target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aantibodies 3adephosphorylation 3agene silencing 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphosphorylation 3aserine 3athreonine1 aPaterson, James1 aKelsall, Ian R.1 aMartín-Granados, Cristina1 aHastie, C.

This study analyzes the drying behavior of knitted fabrics produced from various fibers at different ambient air conditions. Drying kinetics and modeling of fabrics dried in standard environmental conditions were investigated in the first part. Polyester and lyocell fabrics were found to be the fastest drying samples. A two-stage modeling that is a combination of linear approach and thin-layer equations was used, and the best fitted equation was found to be the logarithmic one. The two-stage model was also proved to predict the drying rate. The second part included the effects of ambient humidity on drying times and rates. Drying time of polyester and polyester blended fabrics was affected by the increase in the humidity to a great extent. Furthermore, a quadratic function was found to be highly correlated with the computed data, so it was proposed to define the drying behavior by ambient air humidity and drying time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ablended fabrics 3aclothing 3adrying 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3ahumidity 3amodels 3aphysical activity 3apolyesters 3asummer 3asweating 0aClothing comfort 0adrying curve 0adrying rate 0amathematical modeling 0atextile materials1 aGürlek, Gökhan,1 aOglakcioglu, Nida0 tDrying technology.g2017 Mar. 12, v. 35, no. 4 p.509-521dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2016.11921903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001400273520124300287592002801530650001201558650001701570650001101587650002201598650001201620650001501632650002301647650001701670650001501687650001201702650002401714650002201738650002001760650002401780650000901804650001601813650001901829653001701848653002201865653002201887700002801909700003101937700002401968773007401992856008402066852000902150655001202159IND60529774220221120182115.0161020e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052977422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolé-Navais, Pol10aEarly pregnancy B vitamin status, one carbon metabolism, pregnancy outcome and child development  ap. 91-96.  aPericonception supplementation with folic acid is recommended until 12 gestational weeks to prevent neural tube defects. Doses of folic acid contained in supplements and timing and length of use during pregnancy vary. The effects of status in periconception and pregnancy folate, cobalamin, betaine and their interactions on one carbon metabolism (1C), as well as the global effect of 1C on foetal growth and pregnancy outcome, are reviewed. Results from prospective studies are reviewed. Cessation of folic acid supplement use after the first trimester is associated with a sharp drop in plasma folate status and enhanced conversion of betaine to dimethylglycine. Dimethylglycine production is also higher in mothers with low folate status than in those with normal-high folate status. The effects of high doses of folic acid on one carbon metabolism in mothers with low early pregnancy cobalamin status and on foetal growth are also reviewed. Several studies report that moderately elevated early pregnancy fasting plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is inversely associated with birth weight and a predictor of intrauterine growth retardation. There is also evidence for increased risk of preterm birth when maternal folate status is low.  aPublisher supplied data 3abetaine 3abirth weight 3acarbon 3achild development 3afasting 3afolic acid 3agrowth retardation 3ahomocysteine 3ametabolism 3amothers 3aneural tube defects 3apregnancy outcome 3apremature birth 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3avitamin B12 3avitamin status 0aHomocysteine 0aPregnancy outcome 0aChild development1 aCavallé-Busquets, Pere1 aFernandez-Ballart, Joan D.1 aMurphy, Michelle M.0 tBiochimie.g2016 July, v. 126 p.91-96dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245018200207300001800389520121100407592002801618650001901646650003001665650001001695650001101705650001601716650001401732650003701746650006401783650007601847650001601923650001101939650002201950650006201972650003602034700001802070700001902088700001602107700002202123773010802145856008102253990002302334852000902357655001202366IND60090619520221121034601.0141102e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009061952DNAL7 a214297522pmid7 aPMC30662692pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Tarek10aDesign, synthesis and structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies of 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives: Dual activity as cholinesterase and Aβ-aggregation inhibitors  ap. 2269-2281.  aA novel class of 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidines (7a–u, 8a–f, 9a–e) that possess substituents with varying steric and electronic properties at the C-2 and C-4 positions, were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual cholinesterase and amyloid-β (Aβ)-aggregation inhibitors. In vitro screening identified N-(naphth-1-ylmethyl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-amine (9a) as the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC₅₀=5.5μM). Among this class of compounds, 2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-N-(naphth-1-ylmethyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (9e) was identified as the most potent and selective BuChE inhibitor (IC₅₀=2.2μM, selectivity index=11.7) and was about 5.7-fold more potent compared to the commercial, approved reference drug galanthamine (BuChE IC₅₀=12.6μM). In addition, the selective AChE inhibitor N-benzyl-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-amine (7d), exhibited good inhibition of hAChE-induced aggregation of Aβ₁–₄₀ fibrils (59% inhibition). Furthermore, molecular modeling studies indicate that a central pyrimidine ring serves as a suitable template to develop dual inhibitors of cholinesterase and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation thereby targeting multiple pathological routes in AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholinesterase 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3adrugs 3amodels 3apyrimidines 3ascreening 3astructure-activity relationships 2aAmyloid beta-Peptidesxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistry. 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDrug Design 2aHumans 2aModels, Molecular 2aPyrimidinesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aZhao, Xiaobei1 aHabib, Lila K.1 aYang, Jerry1 aRao, Praveen P.N.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 19, no. 7 p.2269-2281dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.02.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001800270520044300288592002800731650001500759650001300774650001400787650000900801650001600810650000900826651002100835651001000856653000900866653002600875653001400901653001300915653001400928653002500942653001900967653002600986653001401012653001901026653003401045653004001079700001601119773008801135856008101223852000901304655001201313IND60520962820221117040624.0160527e20120224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052096282DNAL7 a10.2478/v10058-012-0006-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharti, H.10aFirst Record of the Genus Myopias (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) from India, with Description of New Species  ap. e-33-e-35.  aMyopias shivalikensis Bharti et Wachkoo, sp. n. is described based on a single worker, collected in lower Shivalik range (700 m a. s. l.) of Northwest Himalaya by soil core method.

A viable-colony staining method using Nile red was used to screen for PHA-producing bacteria followed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screen using primers to amplify the partial nucleic acid sequence of the phaC1 synthase gene for confirmation. Microbes containing lipophilic storage compounds isolated from environmental samples could readily be detected by the colony staining method. They were further examined by Sudan Black staining to highlight the inclusions inside the cells. These isolates were subsequently subjected to PCR analysis. As a result, more than a hundred strains were identified as PHA-positive isolates from this screening approach. These results conclusively demonstrate that environmental bacterial strains able to accumulate the PHAs could readily be obtained by this screening method. We propose a polyphasic approach using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic screening method to rapidly screen and identify bacteria able to produce significant amounts of mcl-PHAs from environment. This approach can be adopted as a rapid screen for micro-organisms able to accumulate PHAs to be used for potential manufacture and other industrial applications. 3aSudan dyes 3abacteria 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3aisolation techniques 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 2aAcyltransferasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyestersxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 0aenvironmental isolates 0amicrobial polyesters 0amid-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates 0apolyhydroxyalkanoate synthase1 aChuang, Y.-C.1 aChen, C.

We used 7% NaCl glucose-yeast extract-peptone-fish extract broth and agar media (pH 9·5) for pour-plating and enrichment culture for 16 cheese samples produced in six European countries. HALAB were present in 9 of the 16 samples at <20->10⁷ CFU g⁻¹. In three mould-ripened soft cheeses, HALAB counts ranged from 10⁶ to 10⁷ CFU g⁻¹ and were one order (two samples) and six orders (one sample) of magnitude greater than that of nonhaloalkaliphilic, common LAB, as enumerated on lactobacilli MRS agar. The 16S rRNA gene sequences (500 bp) of 51 of the 55 isolates examined were identical or similar to that of Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans or Alkalibacterium olivapovliticus and related species, all of which are HALAB. HALAB of possible marine origin were present in various soft, semi-hard and semi-soft cheeses and were highly predominant in some mould-ripened cheeses. HALAB of possible marine origin are members of the microflora of various cheeses and, when dominant, may play a role in the ripening of cheeses. Microbial analysis of LAB flora in cheeses should take into consideration the presence of HALAB. 3aAlkalibacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aMarinilactibacillus 3aagar 3acheese ripening 3aenrichment culture 3aflora 3alactic acid bacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asemisoft cheeses 3asodium chloride 3asoft cheeses 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aLactobacillaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 3aEurope 0aalkaliphile 0ahalophile 0amarine lactic acid bacteria 0aMarinilactibacillus1 aKodama, K.1 aYasuda, H.1 aOkamoto-Kainuma, A.1 aKoizumi, K.1 aYamasato, K.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.308-313dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02073.x3electronic resource  a20070221b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02227naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245010300164300001600267520094300283650000801226650001601234650002101250650003101271650002801302650001701330650001001347650001701357650001901374650003001393650001401423653002801437653001801465700001701483700001501500700001701515773012701532852000901659856009301668930003301761946001101794655001201805IND4390934420221116143450.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439093442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02118.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoh, C.10aScreening and purification for novel cytochrome b₅ from uncultured environmental micro-organisms  ap. 475-480.  aWe describe a sequence-based PCR method suitable for the isolation of a novel soluble heme-binding domain of cytochrome b₅ (cyt b₅) gene directly from metagenomic DNA is described. Using the degenerate primer set, a cyt b₅ gene was isolated directly from metagenomic DNA. Based on the sequence-based PCR method, the similar conserved motif of cyt b₅ from Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain makes the novel target gene. The gene encoding cyt b₅ was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET expression system. The expressed recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and characterized. Sequence-based strategy is an effective method for application of the novel gene from metagenomic DNA.

Twelve serum-free media formulations with or without additional supplements were tested against a standard growth medium containing 2% FBS in HCT-8 cell cultures. After a 48-h incubation period, the level of parasite development was determined by ELISA. The extent of development in the serum-free media was determined as a percentage of infections compared with those obtained using a standard growth medium. Several of the serum-free media formulations, which included MDCK, UltraMDCK, PC-1, UltraCHO and UltraCulture, compared favourably with a traditional, standard growth medium. Moreover, increasing FBS concentrations to 10% actually resulted in an overall decrease in development in many cultures. Several serum-free medium formulations are available which allow development of C. parvumin vitro at levels comparable with standard media employing FBS. These serum-free media are particularly useful for applications, which may require a more defined medium without the presence of FBS. Moreover, the elimination of FBS as a variable allows investigators the ability to more closely regulate their experimental systems when growing C. parvum in cell cultures. 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3acell culture 3aculture media 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aparasites 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCryptosporidium parvumxgrowth & development 2aCulture Media, Serum-Free 2aHumans 0aculture 0adevelopment 0ain vitro 0amedium1 aUpton, S.J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.520-523dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02101.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009000146300001600236500001500252520126200267650001801529650002001547650002001567650002301587650001601610650001101626650001201637650003401649650001101683650004101694650001101735650000901746650003301755650002801788650005401816650002701870650006701897650005901964650001302023653001202036653003102048653001002079653002002089700001502109700002002124773009702144852000902241939003302250946001302283655001202296IND9102834220221116143429.0910712e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910283422DNAL7 a18830902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, R.H.10aFrequency and severity of osteochondrosis in horses with cervical stenotic myelopathy  ap. 873-879.  a2019-12-04  aWe compared the frequency and severity of osteochondrosis lesions in young Thoroughbred horses with cervical stenotic myelopathy (CSM) vs that in clinically normal Thoroughbreds of the same age.

Minimal sagittal diameter was significantly smaller in horses with CSM from C2 through C6; no difference was detected at C7. Severity of cervical vertebral osteochondrosis was greater in the horses with CSM, however frequency was not different. Frequency and severity of nonosteochondrosis lesions were not different in cervical vertebrae or appendicular skeleton. Frequency and severity of appendicular skeleton osteochondrosis lesions were both greater in horses with CSM. Osteochondrosis and nonosteochondrosis lesions were more severe on facets at sites of compression than on facets at noncompressed sites in horses with CSM. However, compression was also observed at sites with no articular facet lesions. The association of widespread osteochondrosis and spinal canal narrowing with CSM suggests CSM may represent a systemic failure in the development or maturation of cartilage and bone. 3ayoung animals 3aspinal diseases 3aosteochondrosis 3adisease prevalence 3ameasurement 3ahorses 2aAnimals 2aCervical Vertebraexpathology 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aHorses 2aMale 2aMedulla Oblongataxpathology 2aMyelographyxveterinary 2aOsteochondritisxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSpinal Cordxpathology 2aSpinal Cord Compressionxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSpinal Stenosisxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSyndrome 0alesions 0avertebral articular facets 0aspine 0avertebral canal1 aReed, S.M.1 aWeisbrode, S.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1991 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.873-879x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03812naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245009200170300001800262500001500280520151900295650001901814650001201833650002201845650000901867650001101876650000901887650001601896650000901912650001201921650002801933650001901961650002601980650001302006650001802019650001102037650001202048650002902060650002002089650003402109650000902143650003002152650004102182650001102223650000902234650001202243650003302255650005502288650002702343650003202370650004802402650004202450650004702492650005102539651001002590653001702600653001602617653002502633700001302658700001202671700001302683700001202696700001302708700001302721700001202734700001502746700001302761773007602774852000902850856007802859930003302937945001302970946001102983655001202994IND2055107920221116143228.0970128s1996    au |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205510792DNAL7 a87129232pmid7 a10.1007/BF017186092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, J.H.10aImmunogenicity and relative attenuation of different vaccinia-rabies virus recombinants  ap. 1055-1065.  a2019-12-04  aImmunogenicity and relative attenuation were examined for the following Tian Tan strain vaccinia-rabies recombinant viruses: 1) NGc-1, which coexpresses the glycoprotein (G) and nucleocapsid protein (N) of the rabies virus Challenge Virus Standard (CVS) strain; 2) Nc-1, which expresses the CVS N; 3) Gc-2, Gc-3, Gc-4, and Gc-5, which express CVS G via promoters from different vaccinia strains or from different vaccinia genome loci; 4) Ga-1, which expresses the G of rabies virus strain aG; and 5) Gas-1; which expresses the carboxyl-truncated G ectodomain (Gs) of strain aG. All but Nc-1 and Gas-1 induced rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) and protected groups of mice at very high frequencies from intramuscular (IM) or intracranial (IC) challenge with CVS or SW1 Shanghai dog street rabies virus (SRV); Nc-1 and Gas-1 were partly protective, more frequently against IM challenge. NGc-1 and Gc-5 appeared to induce high levels of VNAs sooner after immunization than the other constructs in mice. Relative attenuation assessed by IM infection of neonatal mice, IC infection of adult mice, and intradermal infection of rabbits with varying doses was best for NGc-1. All the recombinants were at least 100-fold more attenuated than the parent, Tian Tan vaccinia virus. Gc-2, Gc-3, Gc-4, Gc-5, and NGc-1 induced VNAs after immunization of dogs, and a subset of VNA-positive animals vaccinated with NGc-1 or Gc-3 were protected against an otherwise lethal IM injection of SRV at 21 days after vaccination. 3aneutralization 3arabbits 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aloci 3agenome 3adogs 3avaccination 3amice 3aviruses 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aVaccinia virus 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aneonates 3aglycoproteins 3aadults 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aAntigens, Viral 2aCapsidxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDogs 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGlycoproteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aRabbits 2aRabiesxprevention & control 2aRabies virusxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSkinximmunologyxvirology. 2aVaccines, Attenuatedxgeneticsximmunology. 2aVaccinia virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aViral Core Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 3aChina 0aRabies virus 0aattenuation 0avirus neutralization1 aWang, J.1 aCai, B.1 aZhao, W.1 aZhu, Y.1 aChao, R.1 aChen, L.1 aXue, H.1 aYing, B.L.1 aLi, C.P.0 tArchives of virology.g1996, v. 141, no. 6 p.1055-1065x0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF017186093Available from publisher's Web site  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdJT1  aNon-US 7aarticle02916naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245007700196300001600273500002400289520125900313650001701572650002201589650001201611650003401623650001701657650007201674650008801746650001401834650007301848650007501921650002601996650002602022650006002048650006802108650005002176650004502226700002202271773012502293852000902418856005502427655001202482IND4459369120221116143403.0110625e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445936912DNAL7 a220592462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01147.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyse Jackson, Peter.14aThe context and development of a global framework for plant conservation  ap. 227-232.  aIncludes references  aA new international initiative for plant conservation was first called for as a resolution of the International Botanical Congress in 1999. The natural home for such an initiative was considered to be the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD agreed to consider a Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) at its 5th meeting in 2000. It was proposed that the GSPC could provide an innovative model approach for target setting within the CBD and, prior to COP5, a series of inter-sessional papers on proposed targets and their justification were developed by plant conservation experts. Key factors that ensured the adoption of the GSPC by the CBD in 2002 included: (1) ensuring that prior to and during COP5, key Parties in each region were supportive of the Strategy; (2) setting targets at the global level and not attempting to impose these nationally; and (3) the offer by Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) to support a GSPC position in the CBD Secretariat for 3 years, which provided a clear indication of the support for the GSPC from non-governmental organizations (NGO). © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 166, 227-232. 3abiodiversity 3abotanical gardens 3aexperts 3anongovernmental organizations 2aBiodiversity 2aBotanyxeconomicsxeducationxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomicsxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aEcosystem 2aEndangered Speciesxeconomicsxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aGardeningxeconomicsxeducationxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aInternationalityxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aOrganizationsxeconomicsxhistoryxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aPublic Healthxeconomicsxeducationxhistory. 2aResearchxeconomicsxeducationxhistory.1 aSHARROCK, SUZANNE0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2011 July, v. 166, no. 3 p.227-232dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01147.x 7aarticle01336naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008000129300001600209500001500225520057400240650002700814650001500841650001600856650002000872653001300892653000900905773007900914852000900993939003301002946001101035655001201046IND9102820720221116143345.0910711e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910282072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShattuck, S.O.10aRevision of the dolichoderine ant genus Axinidris (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  ap. 105-120.  a2019-12-04  aThe Afrotropical ant genus Axinidris is revised.

We describe a method to obtain concentration maps of fluorescent tracers on cross sections of soil cores with a high spatial resolution. The fluorescence signal of two dye tracers, brilliant sulfaflavine (BF; 1H-Benz(de)isoquinoline-5-sulfonic acid, 2,3-dihydro-6-amino-1,3-dioxo-2-(p-tolyl)-, monosodium salt) and sulforhodamine B (SB; xanthylium, 3,6-bis(diethylamino)-9-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-, inner salt, sodium salt), was imaged on the exposed cross sections. The fluorescence signal was corrected for variable illumination light intensity and optical properties of the soil across the exposed surface. Correction factors for varying optical soil properties were derived from the image of the reflected excitation light at the exposed surface. Linear calibration relations related the corrected fluorescence image to the total tracer concentration (C(t)) map, that is, mass of dye dissolved in the soil solution and sorbed to the soil particles per unit volume bulk soil. Corrections for varying optical properties of the soil surface were important to reduce the uncertainty of the concentration that was estimated from the fluorescence signal. For BF, the calibration relations were different for different soil materials and a soil specific calibration had to be used. Variations in background fluorescence were an important source of uncertainty of the BF concentration estimates but can be overcome by applying higher concentrations. For SB, variations in calibration relations and in the background fluorescence were considerably smaller, and so is the uncertainty of the estimated SB concentrations. 3aimage analysis 3afluorescence 3aleaching 3asolutes 3aloam soils 3areflectance 3afluorescent dyes 0asurface layers 0afluorescent tracers 0aregosols 0acambisols1 aGahwiller, P.1 aWydler, H.1 aSchultze, U.1 aFluhler, H.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 3 p.760-773aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02851naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007400128300001600202500001500218520167300233650002301906650002401929650002001953650001501973650001201988650001702000650002102017650002202038650001202060650001302072650001002085650002002095651001702115653002402132653001002156653001102166700001702177700001602194773012702210852000902337930003302346945001302379946001302392655001202405IND2328245420221116143448.0020726e200205  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlobodian, N.10aCultivation-induced effects on belowground biomass and organic carbon  ap. 924-930.  a2019-12-05  aLand conversion and cultivation effects on belowground biomass and C were assessed at a fescue (Festuca altaica Trin. ssp. hallii) prairie site and an adjacent cultivated field seeded to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Belowground biomass and soil organic C (SOC) were measured in three landform element groups (upper level and convex shoulder elements [UL], low-catchment-area footslope elements [FS], and low-elevation level and high-catchment-area footslope elements [LL]) at both sites. Upper level, FS, and LL landscape positions in the prairie had, respectively, eight, 12, and 13 times more belowground biomass in the top 60 cm of soil than their cultivated field counterparts. In the upper 1.8 m of soil, belowground biomass in the prairie grassland increased downslope (UL = 1849 +/- 306, FS = 2533 +/- 899, and LL = 3663 +/- 1248 g m(-1)). In the cultivated field, LL landscape positions had higher levels of belowground biomass than either UL or FS positions (UL = 228 +/- 54.5, FS = 200 +/- 47.0, and LL = 294 +/- 76.8 g m(-2)). Losses of C from belowground biomass accounted for 17.6% of total SOC losses in UL landscape positions, and 71.7% of losses in FS positions after cultivation. Lower level positions had the greatest loss of belowground plant C (-15.6 Mg ha(-1)) but overall the SOC had increased by 9.0 Mg ha(-1). In these position the loss of belowground C was offset by significantly higher SOC additions to the surface through soil redistribution. On a whole landscape basis, the C loss because of changes in belowground biomass is a large part of the C change that occurs during the transition from native prairie to arable agriculture. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3aFestuca altaica 3alandscapes 3atillage 3abulk density 3alosses from soil 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3aprairies 3aroots 3agrassland soils 3aSaskatchewan 0asoil organic matter 0aslope 0acarbon1 aVan Rees, K.1 aPennock, D.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 3 p.924-930aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02723naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006800123300001600191520180700207650002302014650000902037650002502046650002502071650002502096650003002121651001202151653002202163653001702185773012702202852000902329930003302338945001302371946001302384655001202397IND2328241520221116143353.0020726e200205  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, B.C.10aSpatial and statistical similarities of local soil water fluxes  ap. 753-759.  aUnderstanding the spatial and statistical distribution of soil water flux in a field is fundamental for stochastic modeling soil water flow and chemical transport in spatially variable soils. The objective of this study was to examine the persistence of the spatial pattern and statistical distribution of local soil water flux for different application rates during constant flux rainfall infiltrations. A series of constant flux-infiltration experiments were conducted in a spatially variable field. The local soil water fluxes for each of the 0- to 0.2-, 0- to 0.4-, 0- to 0.6-, and 0- to 0.8-m depths were determined from the change of water storage as a function of time before the wetting front passes the end of vertically installed time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. The spatial similarity (persistent spatial pattern) of the measured soil water flux for different application rates at four depths was examined using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results showed that there was no persistent spatial similarity among measured soil water fluxes for the 0- to 0.2-, 0- to 0.4-, 0- to 0.6-, and 0- to 0.8-m depths. This indicates that transient infiltration experiments with different application rates have different flow pathways for each of the 0- to 0.2-, 0- to 0.4-, 0- to 0.6-, and 0- to 0.8-m depths. The statistical similarity (persistent statistical distribution) of soil water flux for different application rates was examined using histograms. Chi-square tests indicated that the histograms of soil water flux for different application rates were different for each of the 0- to 0.2-, 0- to 0.4-, 0- to 0.6-, and 0- to 0.8-m depths, suggesting the stochastic convective flow model may not be used to predict flow and transport in this field for different application rates. 3aprobes (equipment) 3arain 3aspatial distribution 3astatistical analysis 3astochastic processes 3atime domain reflectometry 3aOntario 0adownward movement 0ainfiltration0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 3 p.753-759aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02667naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009500125300001600220520162000236650002301856650002301879650002801902650002501930650002101955650003001976651001102006653002202017653002002039700001602059700001602075700001902091773012702110852000902237930003302246945001302279946001302292655001202305IND2328241320221116143356.0020726e200205  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadler, A.10aHorizontal and vertical TDR measurements of soil water content and electrical conductivity  ap. 735-743.  aWhen time domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to measure soil water content (theta) and salinity, the probes can be installed either horizontally or vertically. We tested the common convention that theta values averaged from horizontal probes will be equal to a vertical direct measurement. In a laboratory experiment, a sandy loam soil, packed uniformly (0.02-m layers to 0.18-m depth) into a box, was gradually wetted to saturation by CaCl2 solutions of 0, 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.5, 5.9, and 8.4 dS m(-1). Horizontal and vertical TDR probes for measuring theta and electrical conductivity of the bulk soil (sigma(a)) were installed during soil packing. A comparison between theta values averaged from three horizontal probes and from two vertical ones showed deviations of 0.02 (L L(-1)). A simple water redistribution model was used to attribute this deviation to the process of averaging the horizontal results. The best practical attainable reproducibility, under our experimental conditions, were close to the theoretical limit 0.005 (L L(-1)) but the average experimental reproducibility of theta was 0.01 to 0.02 (L L(-1)). Width of the soil layer affecting the moisture measurement was reconfirmed to be close to 30 mm. The resistors-in-series model was found to be a good approximation to describe the soil profile sigma(a) from separately measured horizontal sigma(a). Final values of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution (sigma(w)) after sufficient leaching were in good agreement with sigma(w) values calculated by an empirical protocol that uses sigma(a), theta, and a soil texture property. 3aprobes (equipment) 3asoil water content 3aelectrical conductivity 3aspatial distribution 3asandy loam soils 3atime domain reflectometry 3aIsrael 0ahorizontal probes 0avertical probes1 aGreen, S.R.1 aVogeler, I.1 aClothier, B.E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 3 p.735-743aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02904naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001600211520155300227650001701780650002201797650002101819650002001840650001501860650001901875650002601894650002101920650001501941650001401956650002101970650001901991651001002010653001702020653002002037700001602057700002202073700001702095700001402112700001302126700001602139700001402155700001702169700001702186773012702203852000902330930003302339945001302372946001302385655001202398IND2328244020221116143345.0020726e200205  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegmi, A.P.10aYield and soil fertility trends in a 20-year rice-rice-wheat experiment in Nepal  ap. 857-867.  aThe rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system occupies about 13.5 million ha in South Asia and is important for the region's food security. We examined the long-term yield trends, changes in soil nutrient fractions (both total and available), and nutrient balances in a 20-yr rice-rice-wheat experiment conducted in the Indo-Gangetic plain of Nepal. The yield of first rice crop fertilized with recommended NPK fertilizer or farmyard manure (FYM) declined an average of 0.09 or 0.07 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These 20-yr trends explained only 20 to 21% of the variability in yield, and inexplicable shorter-term yield trends were observed. Likewise, wheat yield declined at 0.05 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (with both NPK and FYM) over the 20 yr. However, the yield of second rice crop did not decline over that period. The total and available N and P, and total and labile C contents of soil from Year 10 to 20 were either maintained or increased, but total K and available K declined. The apparent K balance showed net losses of 62.3 and 15.2 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) with NPK and FYM treatments, respectively. Depletion of soil K and inadequate K fertilization seems to be the primary reasons of limited and declining yield of first rice and wheat crop. In addition, the yield of wheat declined because of a delay in sowing, which was estimated to be 0.04 Mg ha(-1) for each day delay in sowing. The study showed that the current local fertilizer recommendations, particularly for K, for the rice-rice-wheat system are inadequate. 3aOryza sativa 3aTriticum aestivum 3acropping systems 3aNPK fertilizers 3acrop yield 3asoil fertility 3along term experiments 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3anutrient content 3aanimal manures 3aNepal 0ayield losses 0atriple cropping1 aLadha, J.K.1 aPathak, Himanshu.1 aPasuquin, E.1 aBueno, C.1 aDawe, D.1 aHobbs, P.R.1 aJoshy, D.1 aMaskey, S.L.1 aPandey, S.P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 3 p.857-867aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03012naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015400129300001400283500001500297520176200312650001602074650002302090650003002113650001002143650000802153650002502161650001602186650001302202653001202215653002402227653003202251653002102283653001102304700001502315700001602330700001902346700002002365773012502385852000902510930003302519945001302552946001302565655001202578IND2331787720221116143312.0030404e200301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233178772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, D.A.10aConsiderations for improving the accuracy of permittivity measurement using time domain reflectometry: air-water calibration, effects of cable length  ap. 62-70.  a2019-12-05  aIn a paper presented by Heimovaara (1993) a method of calibrating TDR sensors was presented using air and water. Time has moved on but time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are still calibrated in a number of different ways. In this article we present a rigorous investigation of the method proposed by Heimovaara and demonstrate its accuracy. We demonstrate that the placement of a starting point in any place other than the one determined using Heimovaara's method results in erroneous permittivity measurement. This will be most significant at low values of permittivity. We propose that Heimovaara's method be adopted as a standard method for calibrating TDR sensors for measuring permittivity. The discussion centers on the placement of the first time marker used to measure the signal travel time from which permittivity is measured. Our modeling results suggest that this point is slightly forward of the apex of the bump on the waveform which corresponds to the impedance increase as the wave travels from the cable into the TDR sensor head. We also demonstrate that using the apex of this bump as a starting point reference can lead to erroneous measurements of travel time in layered dielectric media. Finally we examine the use of long cables to connect sensors to the TDR. We demonstrate that the travel time in the cable changes as a function of temperature and that fixed travel time markers based on cable length cause error in the measurement of travel time. For a 2.6-m cable the error was 1.6% at 50 degrees C, and 4.7% for a 10.3-m cable, relative to calibration at 25 degrees C. Software that tracks the sensor head either through the impedance mismatch caused by the head or using an electrical marker eliminates this source of error. 3acalibration 3aprobes (equipment) 3atime domain reflectometry 3awater 3aair 3aelectrical equipment 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 0asensors 0adielectric constant 0alength of electrical cables 0aelectrical wires 0aerrors1 aSchaap, M.1 aJones, S.B.1 aFriedman, S.P.1 aGardner, C.M.K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 , v. 67, no. 1 p.62-70aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02513naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245013300171300001600304500002400320520154300344650001201887650001601899650001101915650001101926650001901937650001301956650001201969650002201981700001702003700001802020773008002038852000902118856004802127655001202175IND4425381020221116143218.0090829e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442538102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-009-0339-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalcsits, Lee Anthony10aWarm temperature accelerates short photoperiod-induced growth cessation and dormancy induction in hybrid poplar (Populus x spp.)  ap. 971-979.  aIncludes references  aThere is increasing evidence that temperature, in addition to photoperiod, may be an important factor regulating bud dormancy. The impact of temperature during growth cessation, dormancy development, and subsequent cold acclimation was examined in four hybrid poplar clones with contrasting acclimation patterns: 'Okanese'--EARLY, 'Walker'--INT1, 'Katepwa'--INT2, and 'Prairie Sky'--LATE. Four day-night temperature treatments (13.5/8.5, 18.5/13.5, 23.5/8.5, and 18.5/3.5°C) were applied during a 60-day induction period to reflect current and predicted future annual variation in autumn temperature for Saskatoon, SK. Warm night temperature (18.5/13.5°C) strongly accelerated growth cessation, dormancy development, and cold acclimation in all four clones. Day temperature had the opposite effect of night temperature. Day and night temperatures appeared to act antagonistically against each other during growth cessation and subsequent dormancy development and cold acclimation. Growth cessation, dormancy development, and cold acclimation in EARLY and LATE were less affected by induction temperature than INT1 and INT2 suggesting that genotypic variations exist in response to temperature. Separating specific phenological stages and the impact by temperature on each clone revealed the complexity of fall phenological changes and their interaction with temperature. Most importantly, future changes in temperature may affect time to growth cessation, subsequently altering the depth of dormancy and cold hardiness in hybrid poplar. 3aPopulus 3aacclimation 3aautumn 3aclones 3acold tolerance 3adormancy 3ahybrids 3anight temperature1 aSilim, Salim1 aTanino, Karen0 tTrees.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.971-979dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-009-0339-7 7aarticle02867naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008900128300001600217500001500233520161100248650001801859650001901877650001801896650001201914650001901926650001201945650002001957650001601977650001501993650002102008650001902029650001402048651001102062653002302073653002002096653001202116653001802128700001902146700002102165700001602186773012702202852000902329930003302338945001302371946001302384655001202397IND2331788620221116143219.0030404e200301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233178862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, R.N.10aOrganic ligand and pH effects on isotopically exchangeable cadmium in polluted soils  ap. 112-121.  a2019-12-05  aOrganic ligands excreted by plant roots and pH changes in the rhizosphere are two factors that may modify the phytoavailability of Cd. The effect of these components on the quantity (isotopically exchangeable) and intensity (distribution between the solid and solution phases) of Cd in a polluted acidic and calcareous soil was examined in detail using a batch experimental system. The organic ligands included (0.25-5 mM) sodium tartrate, the free acid and sodium salt of citrate, histidine, and deoxymugineic acid (DMA). A reduction of pH was identified as the mechanism of Cd solubilization in the presence of some ligands. In other cases, however, organic ligands caused greater Cd solubilization than that because of pH changes alone. It was concluded that organic ligands might increase solution concentrations of Cd, in both soils, through a number of reaction mechanisms other than decreasing pH (e.g., varying the surface charge of the soil, cation exchange, aqueous metal complexation, etc.). In the acidic soil a reduction of pH from 5.7 to 3.8 only increased the quantity of isotopically exchangeable Cd (E value) by 17%, thus, indicating the existence of a recalcitrant nonlabile fraction of Cd in this soil. The organic ligands were also unable to significantly alter the E value of Cd. In contrast, the presence of organic ligands and decreases in pH elevated the E value of Cd in the calcareous soil by as much as 300%. It is postulated that conditions in the rhizosphere may not only increase the solution concentration of Cd, but also increase the quantity of phytoavailable Cd (L value). 3aradionuclides 3asoil pollution 3asoil solution 3asoil pH 3asodium citrate 3acadmium 3asilt loam soils 3acitric acid 3asolubility 3acalcareous soils 3apolluted soils 3ahistidine 3aFrance 0adeoxymugineic acid 0asodium tartrate 0aligands 0aorganic salts1 aMerrington, G.1 aMcLaughlin, M.J.1 aMorel, J.L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 , v. 67, no. 1 p.112-121aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02424naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008300126300001400209500001500223520156000238650001101798650001501809650002201824650002501846653001901871653001301890700001401903773012501917852000902042930003302051945001302084946001302097655001202110IND2331788320221116143236.0030404e200301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233178832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarboux, F.13aAn instantaneous-profile laser scanner to measure soil surface microtopography  ap. 92-99.  a2019-12-05  aSoil surface roughness affects overland flow and soil erosion processes, yet studies on roughness effects are hampered by the difficulty of acquiring microtopographic data. The purpose of this study is to develop an instantaneous surface-profile laser scanner that has significantly higher data acquisition rate and smaller overall size than previous laser scanners. This laser scanner consists of two diode lasers and a digital camera mounted on a single rail. The lasers project a bright line on the surface and the shape of this line, digitized by the camera from an oblique angle, changes depending on the surface microtopography. From the geometry of the laser-camera assembly, the line image is converted to surface heights using a calibration procedure based on a triangulation principle. A computer drives the translation of the laser-camera assembly along the rail, processes the images from the camera, and records the surface profile data during the scan. This ensures the reconstruction of the surface morphology by juxtaposing successive profiles. The current system can measure the microtopography of a 50 cm by 4 m surface with a positional and elevational accuracy of 0.5 mm. The scanner can digitize six surface profiles per second. This translates to a time of 7.4 min to scan a 4-m long section with profiles taken every 1.5 mm apart. The instantaneous-profile laser scanner is significantly faster than previous scanner technologies and allows new research opportunities in quantifying surface boundary processes, such as soil erosion. 3alasers 3atopography 3asurface roughness 3asoil micromorphology 0asurface layers 0ascanning1 aHuang, C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2003 , v. 67, no. 1 p.92-99aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02843naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007000181300001600251500002400267500001500291520132400306650002201630650002701652650001601679650001101695650003701706650001701743650001101760650001101771650002401782650002001806650001601826650001601842650003901858650003001897650001801927650002001945650002701965650003201992650002902024650001802053650002702071653004302098700002402141773010302165852000902268856004802277655001202325IND4407293120221116143215.0080627e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440729312DNAL7 a185217062pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-008-9321-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yuepeng13aAn overview of the apple genome through BAC end sequence analysis  ap. 581-588.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe apple, Malus x domestica Borkh., is one of the most important fruit trees grown worldwide. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map of the apple genome has been recently constructed. Based on this physical map, a total of ~2,100 clones from different contigs (overlapping BAC clones) have been selected and sequenced at both ends, generating 3,744 high-quality BAC end sequences (BESs) including 1,717 BAC end pairs. Approximately 8.5% of BESs contain simple sequence repeats (SSRs), most of which are AT/TA dimer repeats. Potential transposable elements are identified in ~21% of BESs, and most of these elements are retrotransposons. About 11% of BESs have homology to the Arabidopsis protein database. The matched proteins cover a broad range of categories. The average GC content of the predicted coding regions of BESs is 42.4%; while, that of the whole BESs is 39%. A small number of BES pairs were mapped to neighboring chromosome regions of A. thaliana and Populus trichocarpa; whereas, no pairs are mapped to the Oryza sativa genome. The apple has a higher degree of synteny with the closely related Populus than with the distantly related Arabidopsis. BAC end sequencing can be used to anchor a small proportion of the apple genome to the Populus and possibly to the Arabidopsis genomes. 3asequence analysis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aArabidopsis 3aapples 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aOryza sativa 3agenome 3aclones 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aMalus domestica 3afruit trees 3atransposons 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenome, Plant 2aMalusxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRetroelements 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa1 aKorban, Schuyler S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Aug., v. 67, no. 6 p.581-588dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-008-9321-9 7aarticle02139naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245007400169300001600243500002400259520122600283650002401509650002301533650001201556650001501568650000701583650001601590651001201606700001901618700002401637773009501661852000901756856004801765655001201813IND4419642720221116143333.0090424e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441964272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-008-9166-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGathmann, F.

These patterns were compared against simulations using artificial landscapes. A Moving Window Mantel Correlogram indicated the presence of both a strong local spatial aggregation and a global trend toward higher dissimilarity of sites with increasing geographical distance, especially beyond 50 km. Ordination plots showed a clear global gradient from a southern group of springs to a northern group (likely related to temperature and pH), which dominated the global, total, and local plots in both a SCA (Spatial CA) and a SPCA (Spatial PCA) analysis. However, the results of the local analysis differed markedly between the two methods: while the local plot for the SCA analysis indicated considerable variation among sites belonging to the same spatial group (thought to be related to discharge and random colonization episodes) and showed a pattern that was different from both the global and total analysis plots, the local SPCA plot showed little within-group variation and resembled the global and total plots. 3acommunity structure 3ainsect communities 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3apH 3atemperature 3aOntario1 aManne, Lisa L.1 aWilliams, D.

Loamy and clayey soil materials were apparently placed on the mound before 1100 CE by people of the Middle Mississippian culture. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the extent of soil formation during the past 850 yr, (ii) to determine the time period, extent, and direction of tillage, and (iii) to determine the erosion phase of soil on a mound and the extent of soil loss from erosion. The high amount and regular decrease in organic C with depth in 16 soil profiles suggested that since 1925 no tillage and little soil erosion had occurred on the sideslopes of M57. In the sideslope and footslope positions on the north, south, and east transects, the fine-loamy soil materials with fly ash were thickest suggesting that any tillage translocation and soil erosion must have occurred after 1864. This resulted in the current elongated south to north axis which was parallel to the tract boundary and the direction of plowing. The amounts and distribution of the fly ash in the upper 20 cm indicated that cultivation between 1864 and 1925 may have mixed some fly ash into the 20-cm deep tillage zone. Fly-ash content of soil layers to the 40-cm depth on the footslope was primarily a result of fly ash being deposited after the 1850s on the original soil surface and the subsequent deposition of sediment rich in fly ash. 3ahistory 3afly ash 3asoil organic carbon 3alandscapes 3atillage 3asoil depth 3aloam soils 3awater erosion 3asoil formation 3aIllinois 0aancient monuments 0asoil organic matter 0aslope 0amounds 0adeposition 0acarbon1 aJones, R.L.1 aGennadiyev, A.N.1 aChernyanskii, S.1 aWoods, W.I.1 aLang, J.M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 6 p.1911-1921aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02764naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011900128300001800247500001500265520153100280650001201811650002401823650000901847650001301856650001201869650001301881650001901894650001501913650002101928650001501949653004401964653001902008653001602027653001802043653004202061653001502103700001502118773012902133852000902262930003302271945001302304946001302317655001202330IND2331156720221116143515.0030304e200212  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233115672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, R.O.10aMeasuring agronomic and environmental soil phosphorus saturation and predicting phosphorus leaching with Mehlich 3  ap. 2033-2039.  a2019-12-05  aThe role that soil testing can play in identifying agricultural soils with an increased potential for P loss is an important topic. Our research compared the Mehlich 3 P saturation ratio (M3-PSR) with the ammonium oxalate degree of P saturation (DPS(ox)), and the M3-PSR was then evaluated for predicting agronomic and environmental soil P saturation thresholds. Intact soil columns (15-cm diam, 20 cm deep) and soil samples were collected from five soil series that ranged in soil texture, chemical properties, and Mehlich 3 P. The soils were analyzed for pH, organic matter (OM) and oxalate and Mehlich 3 extractable P, Al, and Fe. Each intact column was leached with the equivalent of 5 mm of rainfall and resulting leachate analyzed for P. Mehlich 3 extractable Al, Fe, and P were closely related to oxalate extractable Al, Fe, and P, although Mehlich 3 extracted only a small amount of Fe compared with oxalate. The M3-PSRs, calculated as the molar ratios of Mehlich 3 extractable P/[Al + Fe] (ratio I) and P/Al (ratio II), were well correlated to each other and to DPS(ox). All three P saturation measurements showed a threshold or change point above which the concentration of P in column leachate increased rapidly. Both the agronomic optimum M3-PSRs and the environmental limit suggested in the Netherlands for DPS(ox) (25%) were below the observed change point. The M3-PSR measured in a single Mehlich 3 extraction shows excellent promise for identifying soils that represent an increased risk for P leaching losses. 3asoil pH 3asoil organic matter 3airon 3aleaching 3atesting 3aaluminum 3asoil fertility 3aextraction 3asoil test values 3aphosphorus 0aoxalate degree of phosphorus saturation 0asoil chemistry 0aextractants 0asoil analysis 0amehlich 3 phosphorus saturation ratio 0asaturation1 aSims, J.T.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 6 p.2033-2039aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03055naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012000125300001800245500001500263520156400278650002301842650002101865650002801886650001201914650001801926650001301944650001201957650001201969650002401981650001902005650001502024650002102039650001502060650001102075651001302086653002602099653004102125653002902166653001602195653002802211653001802239700001802257700001702275700001802292700001802310773012902328852000902457930003302466945001302499946001302512655001202525IND2331156120221116143447.0030304e200212  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233115612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSims, J.T.10aEvaluation of Mehlich 3 as an Agri-environmental soil phosphorus test for the Mid-Atlantic United States of America  ap. 2016-2032.  a2019-12-05  aLaws and guidelines limiting P applications to cropland based on soil P exist in the Mid-Atlantic USA because of water quality concerns. We evaluated Mehlich 3 (M3) as an environmental soil P test using 465 soils typical to the Mid-Atlantic region and found M3-P accurately predicted water soluble P (WSP), desorbable P (Fe oxide strip P [FeO-P]), and total sorbed P (oxalate P). The M3-P saturation ratio (M3 [P/(Al+Fe)]) was linearly related to the well-established oxalate P saturation method (DPS(ox)) and a M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] range of 0.10 to 0.15 corresponded to reported environmental limits for DPS(ox) (25-40%). Rainfall simulation and column leaching studies showed M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] predicted runoff and leachate P concentrations better than M3-P. We suggest consideration of the following approach now used in Delaware for agri-environmental interpretation of M3-P and M3 [P/(Al+Fe)]: (i) Below optimum (crop response likely; M3-P less than or equal to 50 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] < 0.06); (ii) Optimum (economic response to P unlikely, recommendations for P rarely made; M3-P = 51-100 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] = 0.06-0.11); (iii) Above Optimum (soil P will not limit crop yields, no P recommended; M3-P > 100 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] > 0.11); (iv) Environmental (implement improved P management to reduce potential for nonpoint P pollution-in Delaware M3-P > 150 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] > 0.15 is now used). (v) Natural Resource Conservation (no P applied even if the potential water quality impact is low to conserve P, a finite natural resource). 3aagricultural soils 3aland application 3afertilizer requirements 3asubsoil 3asewage sludge 3aleaching 3atesting 3atopsoil 3acoastal plain soils 3asoil fertility 3aextraction 3asoil test values 3aphosphorus 3arunoff 3aDelaware 0adesorbable phosphorus 0afertilizer requirement determination 0awater soluble phosphorus 0aextractants 0atotal sorbed phosphorus 0asoil analysis1 aMaguire, R.O.1 aLeytem, A.B.1 aGartley, K.L.1 aPautler, M.C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 6 p.2016-2032aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011600127300001800243520160000261650001201861650001701873650001701890650002001907650001501927650001201942650002301954650001901977650001301996650000802009650002802017651001202045653001702057700001902074700001502093773012902108852000902237930003302246945001302279946001302292655001202305IND2324322320221116143207.0011204e200107  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232432232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNabb, D.H.10aSoil wetness and traffic level effects on bulk density and air-filled porosity of compacted boreal forest soils  ap. 1238-1247.  aSoil compaction is a common consequence of forest harvesting that has the potential to affect several soil processes and forest productivity. Our objective was to quantify the relationships between soil trafficking, soil wetness, and soil air-filled porosity, and the compacted bulk density and air-filled porosity of 14 boreal forest soils in West-Central Alberta, Canada. Bulk density and air-filled porosity were measured on nontrafficked soil and adjacent areas immediately after the site was subjected to 3, 7, and 12 cycles of skidding with mostly wide-tired skidders. Significant increases in bulk density (P < 0.05) occurred after three cycles at each site when the soil water potential was higher than -15 kPa; the significant increase occurred to a depth of at least 22 cm. The increase in bulk density became asymptotic between 7 and 12 cycles, but the increases were not significantly different from the bulk density at three cycles. The relationship between air-filled porosity and trafficking was the inverse of the level of bulk density and trafficking, but the increase in bulk density of wet soil was limited by an air-filled porosity of about 0.10 m3 m(-3). Soil compaction only occurred when the soils were at or wetter than field capacity, which can easily be measured in the field with a hand-held tensiometer or alternatively, estimated from a field measure of soil consistence. Managing felling operations to maximize transpiration of trees to reduce soil wetness is an effective tactic to avoid significant soil compaction by these types of equipment in this environment. 3alogging 3aforest soils 3abulk density 3asoil compaction 3asoil water 3atraffic 3askidding equipment 3afield capacity 3aporosity 3aair 3asilvicultural practices 3aAlberta 0atraffickling1 aStartsev, A.D.1 aNguyen, H.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 4 p.1238-1247aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03236naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001800214520186200232650000902094650001302103650001202116650002102128650002402149650001502173650001702188650002002205650002102225650001902246650002102265650002002286650001102306650001302317650000902330650002302339650002302362651001502385653001302400653001802413653001802431653001902449700001802468700001602486700001902502773012902521852000902650930003302659945001302692946001302705655001202718IND2324321220221116143127.0011204e200107  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232432122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, J.A.10aImmobilization of fertilizer nitrogen in rice: effects of straw management practices  ap. 1143-1152.  aA recent transition in rice straw management, from open-field burning to soil incorporation in combination with winter-fallow flooding, has led to uncertainty in evaluating long-term N fertility. A 2-yr field study of 15N-labeled fertilizer and crop residue was initiated in the fourth year of a rice straw management trial to examine the impacts of winter flooding and straw management on N fertilizer immobilization and crop uptake. After six seasons of residue incorporation and winter flooding, no effect on total soil C or N was observed. During the fifth and sixth year of the field study, microbial biomass C and N were greater for straw incorporation than for straw burned. Microbial biomass contained a sizable portion of soil-recovered 15N fertilizer after the first (23%) and second (10%) crop season of the 15N study. The half-life of the 15N in the biomass ranged from 0.55 to 0.87 yr. One year after 15N-fertilizer application, greater recovery of 15N in the soil from straw incorporation versus burning (22.2 versus 18.7%) resulted in a slight increase in residual fertilizer N recovery in grain in the second growing season of the 15N study. Increased soil 15N recovery 1 yr after fertilizer application in the straw incorporation treatment, however, was offset by higher grain recovery of 15N in the burned treatment during the first growing season. Hence, the net result of these competing soil and plant sinks for fertilizer N led to similar 15N losses after 2 yr (50.3 +/- 2.2%) under burned and incorporated straw. The cumulative effects of straw incorporation resulted in greater net N mineralization, an increase in microbial biomass N, and greater recovery of 15N in soil one year after application. Clearly, an active, labile N pool was formed when straw was incorporated that led to a reduction in fertilizer N dependency for rice. 3aurea 3anitrogen 3abiomass 3anitrogen content 3asoil microorganisms 3arice straw 3aOryza sativa 3astable isotopes 3aisotope labeling 3asoil fertility 3alosses from soil 3anutrient uptake 3awinter 3anitrates 3arice 3aflooded conditions 3aammonium compounds 3aCalifornia 0aflooding 0astraw burning 0aincorporation 0aimmobilization1 aHorwath, W.R.1 aEagle, A.J.1 aVan Kessel, C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 4 p.1143-1152aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010100127300001800228500001500246520176200261650002802023650002302051650003002074650001202104650001402116650002202130650002102152653001902173653002402192700001602216700001502232700001702247773012902264852000902393930003302402945001302435946001302448655001202461IND2324934920221116143155.0020122e200109  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232493492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNissen, H.H.10aTime domain reflectometry sensitivity of lateral variations in bulk soil electrical conductivity  ap. 1351-1360.  a2019-12-05  aIt has been assumed, but not proved, that the spatial weighting and sample volume of Time domain reflectometry (TDR) regarding bulk soil electrical conductivity (EC(b)) equal those determined for the relative dielectric permittivity (K). In this study, two types of experiments were carried out: (i) sensitivity experiments where the cumulative vertical weighting as a function of distance between the probe rods and the soil surface were determined for both K and EC(b) at two different soil water contents and (ii) solute diffusion experiments to evaluate the discrepancies between actual and TDR-measured relative EC(b) in the case where a steep gradient in EC(b) passes the probe. Three-rod TDR probes and a sandy loam soil were used in both experiments. The sensitivity experiments confirmed that TDR weights K and EC(b) equally in the transverse plane. Hence, previously established relationships to calculate the weighting function and sample area of a given TDR-probe geometry apply for both K and EC(b). The diffusion experiments showed that if a steep vertical solute gradient passes a horizontally inserted TDR probe, the TDR-measured EC(b) profile will be more spread than the actual profile passing the probe. This phenomenon of artificial (TDR-induced) diffusion is caused by (i) TDR probes not representing a point measurement, and (ii) the nonlinear weighting of K and EC(b) in the transverse plane. As the steepness of the solute concentration profile diminishes the TDR-induced diffusion decreases rapidly and becomes negligible for most applications. The effect of TDR-probe geometry on the discrepancy between actual and TDR-measured relative concentration was examined theoretically for selected two- and three-rod probe configurations. 3aelectrical conductivity 3asoil water content 3atime domain reflectometry 3asolutes 3adiffusion 3aspatial variation 3asandy loam soils 0asurface layers 0adielectric constant1 aMoldrup, P.1 aOlesen, T.1 aJensen, O.K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 5 p.1351-1360aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006100126300001800187500001500205520154300220650002201763650002301785650003901808650002501847650002401872650001501896650002501911650001501936650002001951650001701971650001001988653002401998653002202022653002202044700001802066700001602084773012902100852000902229930003302238945001302271946001302284655001202297IND2324319720221116143131.0011204e200107  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232431972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrugt, J.A.10aCalibration of a two-dimensional root water uptake model  ap. 1027-1037.  a2019-12-05  aAlthough solutions of multidimensional transient water flow can be obtained by numerical modeling, their application may be limited in part as root water uptake is generally considered to be one-dimensional only. The objective of this study was to develop and test a two-dimensional root water uptake model, which can be incorporated into numerical multidimensional flow models. The two-dimensional uptake model is based on the model by Raats, but is extended with a radial component. Subsequently, the root water uptake model was incorporated into a two-dimensional flow model, and root water uptake parameters were optimized, minimizing the residuals between measured and simulated water content data. Water content was measured around a sprinkler-irrigated almond tree (Prunus laurocerasus M.J.Roem) for a 16-d period at 25 locations, following irrigation. To calibrate the flow and root water uptake model, a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to find the approximate global minimum of the optimized parameter space. The final fitting parameters were determined using the Simplex algorithm (SA). With the optimized root water uptake parameters, simulated and measured water contents during the 16-d period were in excellent agreement, with R2 values generally ranging between 0.94 and 0.99 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.015 m3 m(-3). The developed root water uptake model is extremely flexible and allows spatial variations of water uptake as influenced by nonuniform (drip irrigation) and uniform water application patterns. 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aspatial distribution 3aPrunus laurocerasus 3aalgorithms 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater flow 3amicroirrigation 3awater uptake 3aroots 0amathematical models 0asimplex algorithm 0agenetic algorithm1 aHopmans, J.W.1 aSimunek, J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 4 p.1027-1037aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02314naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011600125300001400241500001500255520136300270650001601633650001601649650001201665650001401677650002301691650001601714650001601730650001501746650002001761651001001781653001701791653001201808773007901820852000901899939003301908946001101941655001201952IND9102861020221116143052.0910722s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910286102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarada, T.10aEffects of photoperiod and temperature on phototaxis in a water strider, Gerris paludum insularis (Motschulsky)  ap. 27-34.  a2019-12-04  aA long-day photoperiod (14.5 h light-9.5 h dark) in the adult stage induces a higher degree of positive phototaxis by adults of a water strider, Gerris paludum insularis (Motschulsky), than a short-day (9.5 h light-14.5 h dark) regardless of the photoperiod in the nymphal stages. The critical photoperiod to induce the higher degree of positive phototaxis is between 14.5 and 12 h. When specimens have been reared under a short-day photoperiod (9.5 h light-14.5 h dark) in the nymphal stages and have been transferred to a long-day (14.5 h light-9.5 h dark) just after the last ecdysis, they show a high degree of positive phototaxis having a lower threshold illumination (about 1300 1x) to bring about the saturation response of positive phototaxis, than adults which have been reared under the long-day photoperiod throughout the nymphal and adult stages (about 2500 1x). The experience of an abrupt decrease (12-10 h) in photoperiod below the critical one extends (from 15-24 days to 34-38 days) the reaction time of positive phototaxis to a long-day photoperiod. Moreover, the restoration of the photoperiod to 12 h shortens the reaction time from the extended one almost to the usual one (21-28 days). Low (10 +/- 2 degrees C) and high (30 +/- 2 degrees C) temperatures induce negative phototaxis and a high degree of positive phototaxis, respectively. 3aHeteroptera 3aoviposition 3arearing 3asex ratio 3aseasonal variation 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3aphototaxis 3aaquatic insects 3aJapan 0areproduction 0aaquaria0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 1 p.27-34x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02269naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245006500141300001800206520092100224650002901145650001401174650001801188650002101206650002501227650002401252650001201276650003101288650002601319650002801345650003301373650002501406650000901431650003901440650002301479650004101502650003801543650003601581653002801617700001601645773009501661852000901756939003301765946001301798655001201811IND9102851820221116142933.0910719e19910405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910285182DNAL7 a20075702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, B.10aStructure of the yeast ribosomal 5 S RNA-binding protein YL3  ap. 6120-6123.  aA gene coding for the 5 S rRNA-binding protein (YL3) in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was isolated using a polymerase chain reaction-amplified gene probe. The DNA sequence contains no introns and codes for a 297 amino acid (Mr = 33,741) protein. Although the protein is just 1 residue longer than in rat, unlike the high sequence homology in the 5 S rRNAs from the same organisms, only about 45% of the amino acid residues are conserved with surprisingly little homology in the carboxyl-terminal end. Nevertheless, comparative studies indicate that a number of structural features are conserved including small repeats in the primary structure and a number of helical estimates in the higher order structure. One of the sequence repeats also appears to be present in the carboxyl-terminal end of the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIIA suggesting an evolutionary relationship in these 5 S RNA-binding proteins. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aribosomes 3aribosomal RNA 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5Sxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aRats 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRibosomal Proteins 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0amolecular sequence data1 aNazar, R.N.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Apr. 5, v. 266, no. 10 p.6120-6123x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03608naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008000145300001600225520208700241650000902328650003102337650001502368650002002383650001502403650001102418650001202429650002402441650002102465650005702486650001102543650004302554650004602597650002302643650000902666650005302675650002102728650003102749653001802780653006002798700001502858700001602873700001502889700001802904700001602922773009702938852000903035939003303044946001303077655001203090IND9102835820221116143053.0910715e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910283582DNAL7 a18831022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, K.S.10aComparison of four methods of estimating glomerular filtration rate in cats  ap. 961-964.  aFour methods of evaluating renal function were performed in 6 cats anesthetized with halothane in oxygen. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured simultaneously in each cat by exogenous creatinine clearance (ECC), bolus inulin clearance, and 99mTc(Sn)-diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) clearance determined by 2 different methods. In the first DTPA clearancemethod (DTPA-1), we measured radioactivity in serial blood specimens to construct plasma disappearance curves for calculation of GFR. In the second DTPA clearance method (DTPA-2), we used serial external head counts of radioactivity and a single blood specimen to construct plasma disappearance curves for calculation of GFR. Bolus inulin clearance was calculated from plasma disappearance curves using a 1-compartment open pharmacokinetic model (IN-1) and a 2-compartment open pharmacokinetic model (IN-2). Glomerular filtration rates were measured over 3 hours, for creatinine and DTPA methods, and over 4 hours for the inulin methods. The GFR obtained with the reference method (ECC) was 2.56 +/- 0.61 ml/min/kg of body weight (mean +/- SD). Values for GFR determined by ECC and DTPA-1 were significantly correlated (r = 0.852; P less than or equal to 0.05). Correlationbetween ECC and DTPA 2 was not as good (r = 0.783; P less than or equal to 0.10), but the 2 DTPA methods significantly correlated with one another (r = 0.897; P less than or equal to 0.05). Regardless of the method of calculation, bolus inulin clearance was poorly correlated with ECC (IN-1: r = 0.538, P greater than or equal to 0.10; IN-2: r = 0.430, P greater than or equal to 0.10) and DTPA-1 IN-1: r = 0.601, P greater than or equal to 0.10; IN-2: r = 0.625, P greater than or equal to 0.10). The 2 methods of calculating inulin clearance were highly correlated (r = 0.927; P less than or equal to 0.01). The DTPA clearance calculated from directly measured plasma disappearance curves (DTPA-1) comparedfavorably with ECC as an estimate of GFR and appears to be a safe, reliable, and less invasive method of determining GFR incats. 3acats 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aestimation 3arenal clearance 3acreatinine 3ainulin 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCatsxphysiology 2aCreatininexbloodxdiagnostic usexpharmacokinetics. 2aFemale 2aGlomerular Filtration Ratexveterinary 2aInulinxdiagnostic usexpharmacokinetics. 2aKidneyxphysiology 2aMale 2aPentetic Acidxdiagnostic usexpharmacokinetics. 2aReference Values 2aReproducibility of Results 0aradioactivity 0a99mtc(sn)-diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid clearance1 aKomkov, A.1 aBrown, S.A.1 aLees, G.E.1 aHightower, D.1 aRusso, E.A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1991 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.961-964x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02773naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008300144300001600227500001500243520121200258650001301470650002801483650000901511650001101520650000901531650000801540650001401548650001101562650001001573650001201583650002301595650001901618650002101637650002301658650001501681650006201696650001901758650002101777650000901798650002201807650003101829650002001860650002001880650002201900653002401922700001701946700001401963700001501977700001501992700002402007773009702031852000902128939003302137946001302170655001202183IND9102835420221116143032.0910715e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910283542DNAL7 a18831002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyoshi, N.10aProto-oncogenes of genomic DNA in clinically normal animals of various species  ap. 940-944.  a2019-12-04  aTo provide information about oncogenes for molecular biological studies of tumors in domestic animals, theproto-oncogenes homologous to the c-myc, c-erbB-2, c-ros-1, c-yes-1, v-myc, v-Ki-ras, and v-Ha-ras oncogenes of genomic DNA in cattle, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, and chickens were investigated by Southern blot hybridization.

Our findings indicate that these proto-oncogenes are well conserved with species specificities in each animal. 3achickens 3ainterspecific variation 3acats 3acattle 3adogs 3aDNA 3aoncogenes 3ahorses 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCatsxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aChickensxgenetics 2aDNA Probes 2aDNA, Neoplasmxanalysisxbloodxisolation & purification. 2aDogsxgenetics 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aMale 2aMammalsxgenetics 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aProto-Oncogenes 2aSwinexgenetics 2aTestisxchemistry 0aspecies differences1 aTateyama, S.1 aOgawa, K.1 aNosaka, D.1 aOhashi, T.1 aSunyasootcharee, B.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1991 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.940-944x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01812naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009900125300001600224520096900240650002301209650001101232650002301243650003001266700001701296700001401313773012701327852000901454930003301463945001301496946001301509655001201522IND2327174720221116143128.0020521e200203  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232717472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, D.S.12aA heavy-duty time domain reflectometry soil moisture probe for use in intensive field sampling  ap. 396-401.  aMapping soil water content for site-specific management of farm fields is commonly achieved through grid soil sampling. This effort frequently requires intensive soil coring, which is destructive and time consuming. Precision farming and research can be facilitated if sampling techniques are improved and made cost effective. We designed and constructed a heavy-duty time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe of simple design that fits a hydraulic soil sampling machine. The design is simple enough to be adapted to the TDR equipment and hydraulic sampler that a researcher or practitioner may already possess. The probe consists of a housing and adapter that can be fabricated in a local machine shop from materials that are easily obtainable. Probe schematics and summary soil water maps obtained using the new design are presented. As with conventional TDR probe designs, stony or indurate soils may present particular problems in effective insertion of the probe. 3aprobes (equipment) 3adesign 3asoil water content 3atime domain reflectometry1 aWraith, J.M.1 aKegel, G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 2 p.396-401aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02763naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006800123300001600191520166700207650002301874650003201897650002401929650002001953650001201973650001601985650001302001650001802014650001402032650001602046650002002062650001402082653002402096653003302120700001702153773012702170852000902297930003302306945001302339946001302352655001202365IND2327178820221116143156.0020521e200203  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232717882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWell, R.12aA proposed method for measuring subsoil denitrification in situ  ap. 507-518.  aWe present and test a new approach for measuring denitrification in unsaturated subsoils in situ. The procedure consists of applying a test solution containing 15NO3(-) to the subsoil, measuring steady-state 15(N2 + N2O) concentration in the pore space of the 15N-labeled soil, and determining denitrification rates by fitting measured and simulated concentrations. We adapted and evaluated a numerical, spherical diffusion model to simulate production and diffusion of 15(N2 + N2O) evolved from a 15(N2 + N2O)-producing subsoil volume surrounded by an infinite nonproducing soil volume. The effects of gas diffusivity, gas production rate, and spatial distribution of 15NO3(-) on steady-state 15(N2 + N2O) concentrations were investigated with computer simulations, which proved the methodological principle theoretically. Field experiments were done using two different probe designs. Initially, multipurpose probes were used for applying 15NO3(-) solution to the subsoils and subsequent collection of gas samples, but denitrification rates were unrealistically high, probably because of depressed soil gas diffusivity caused by the probe installation procedure. Nondisturbing capillary probes were used for two subsequent in situ experiments. Here, in situ 15(N2 + N2O) concentrations were near the detection limit and resulted in denitrification rates between 0 and 7 g N ha(-1) d(-1) 10 cm(-1), which were comparable to rates determined by laboratory reference methods. We concluded that the in situ 15N gas emission method is a promising tool for measuring subsoil denitrification because it overcomes some of the limitations of the alternative techniques. 3aprobes (equipment) 3agas production (biological) 3asoil microorganisms 3adenitrification 3asubsoil 3amethodology 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3adiffusion 3adiffusivity 3asilt loam soils 3aemissions 0acomputer simulation 0anitrogen gas emission method1 aMyrold, D.D.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 2 p.507-518aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02901naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011800124300001800242520192800260650001202188650002402200650001502224650001302239650001602252650001702268650001602285650001402301650000702315700001502322700001702337773012902354852000902483930003302492945001302525946001302538655001202551IND2326863520221116142847.0020502e200112  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232686352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrafe, M.10aAdsorption of arsenate (V) and arsenite (III) on goethite in the presence and absence of dissolved organic carbon  ap. 1680-1687.  aThe environmental fate of arsenic (As) is of utmost importance as the public and political debate continues with the USEPA's recent proposal to tighten the As drinking water standard from 50 to 10 microgram L(-1). In natural systems, the presence of dissolved organic C (DOC) may compete with As for adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, hence increasing its potential bioavailability. Accordingly, the adsorption of arsenate [As (V)] and arsenite [As (III)] on goethite (alpha-FeOOH) was investigated in the presence of either a peat humic acid (Hap), a Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (FA) (International Humic Substances Society, St. Paul, MN), or citric acid (CA). Adsorption edges and kinetic experiments were used to examine the effects of equimolar concentrations of organic adsorbates on As adsorption. Adsorption edges were conducted across a pH range of 3 to 11, while the kinetic studies were conducted at pH 6.5 for As (V) and pH 5.0 for As (III). Both Hap and FA decreased As (V) adsorption, while CA had no effect. Humic acid reduced As (V) between pH 6 and 9 by approximately equal to 27%. Fulvic acid inhibited As (V) adsorption between pH 3 and 8 by a maximum of 17%. Arsenite adsorption was decreased by all three organic acids between pH 3 and 8 in the order of CA > FA approximately equal to Hap. The different pH regions in which Hap and FA decreased As (V) adsorption suggest that more than one functional group on these complex organic polymers may be responsible for binding to the alpha-FeOOH surface. Similarly, the relative surface affinity of the As(III or V) species and that of the competing organic ligand as a function of pH may play a major role in the outcome of As adsorption on alpha-FeOOH. The results of these experiments suggest that DOC substances are capable of increasing the bioavailability of As in soil and water systems in which the dominant solid phase is a crystalline iron oxide. 3aarsenic 3achemical speciation 3aadsorption 3agoethite 3ahumic acids 3afulvic acids 3acitric acid 3asolutions 3apH1 aEick, M.J.1 aGrossl, P.R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 6 p.1680-1687aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03012naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008000128300001800208500001500226520166600241650001901907650001601926650002101942650001301963650002501976650002002001650000902021650002002030650001102050650001802061650001602079650002002095651001102115653003202126653001402158653002102172653001802193653001902211653001102230700001302241700002202254700001702276700001602293773012902309852000902438930003302447945001302480946001302493655001202506IND2326867620221116142946.0020502e200112  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232686762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBresson, L.M.10aSoil surface structure stabilization by municipal waste compost application  ap. 1804-1811.  a2019-12-05  aLoess-derived soils of the northern Paris basin are prone to surface structure degradation leading to erosion, flooding, and pollution. Concomitantly, recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been recognized as an important environmental issue. The aim of this study was to test the impact of compost application on soil surface structure degradation and on the resulting runoff and erosion processes. Aggregates (0-30 mm) from a silty loam Typic Hapludalf were mixed with a MSW compost at a rate of 15 g kg(-1) (dry matter). Repacked seedbeds were exposed to a 19 mm h(-1) simulated rainfall for 60 min. Morphological evolution of the soil surface was monitored using sequential photographs. Crust and seedbed microstructures were studied after 4, 15, and 60 min of rainfall, using thin sections from resin-impregnated replicates. Runoff was measured every five minutes, and aliquots were sampled for sediment concentration. In control seedbeds, surface crusts quickly developed and the whole seedbed slumped because of aggregate coalescence through deformation in a viscous state. Compost application delayed crust formation and prevented seedbed slumping. This, in turn, delayed runoff from 2.5 to 9.2 mm of cumulative rainfall. Sediment concentration in the incipient runoff was decreased from 36.4 to 11 g L(-1). This could be ascribed to the stabilization of the aggregate framework, which allowed the particles detached from the top of surface aggregates to illuviate a few millimeters deeper. In a highly unstable soil, MSW compost application was efficient in combating soil surface structure degradation and its consequences on runoff and erosion. 3asediment yield 3adeformation 3aland application 3aseedbeds 3asoil micromorphology 3aerosion control 3arain 3asilt loam soils 3arunoff 3awater erosion 3ailluviation 3asoil aggregates 3aFrance 0asoil morphological features 0astability 0asoil degradation 0asoil slumping 0arefuse compost 0acrusts1 aKoch, C.1 aLe Bissonnais, Y.1 aBarriuso, E.1 aLecomte, V.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 6 p.1804-1811aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008800131300001800219500001500237520156600252650001801818650001201836650002101848650001301869650003101882650001401913650001301927650001701940650001501957650002901972650001502001650002102016651001102037653003102048653002202079653002302101653001302124700001902137700001802156773012902174852000902303930003302312945001302345946001302358655001202371IND2326867820221116142931.0020502e200112  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232686782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVestgarden, L.S.10aSoil solution response to nitrogen and magnesium application in a Scots pine forest  ap. 1812-1823.  a2019-12-05  aHigh inputs of N to N-limited forests may disturb the nutrient balance of the plant-soil system. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of N and Mg applications on soil water chemistry in a 35- to 45-yr-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in southern Norway. Fertilizer applications began in 1990 and soil water sampling was carried out in May through October 1997 to 1999. Nine years with annual (one dose) inputs of 30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) increased the annual average nitrate N (NO3-N) leaching below the B horizon to approximately equal to 2.1 kg ha(-1), compared with approximately equal to 0.1 kg ha(-1) in the control plots. An input of 90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) resulted in symptoms of N saturation. The soil water concentration of NO3(-) and ammonium (NH4(+)) increased, and the annual average leaching of inorganic N from May to October during the years 1997 to 1999 was approximately equal to 15 kg N ha(-1). The N addition significantly reduced the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and N (DOC and DON), but the contribution of DON to the total N leaching from the plots receiving the highest N dose was still large. Addition of 1.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of Mg increased the DOC and DON concentrations. The reason for this is unknown, and further studies are needed to understand DOC and DON dynamics. Even though applications of high single N doses are not directly comparable to chronic N depositions of small doses in precipitation, the results indicate future consequences to pine forests growing under similar conditions. 3asoil solution 3acalcium 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3amagnesium 3aaluminum 3aforest soils 3asoil water 3adissolved organic carbon 3aB horizons 3aammonium nitrate 3aNorway 0adissolved organic nitrogen 0aorganic compounds 0aammonium compounds 0anitrates1 aAbrahamsen, G.1 aStuanes, A.O.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 6 p.1812-1823aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02792naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008900127300001600216500001500232520159200247650001701839650001601856650002001872650001501892650002501907650000901932650001801941650002301959650002401982651001202006653002202018653002202040653001002062653001402072653002002086653001502106700001502121700001502136773012702151852000902278930003302287945001302320946001302333655001202346IND2326726920221116143029.0020425e200201  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232672692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, P.M.10aRedoximorphic features as indicators of seasonal saturation, Lowndes County, Georgia  ap. 315-323.  a2019-12-05  aRedoximorphic features are generally accepted to be reliable indicators of seasonal saturation although little data exist to verify or refine the relationship in southern Georgia. This 2-yr study used nested piezometers to investigate the relationship between seasonal saturation and redoximorphic features in seven pedons of the middle Coastal Plain near Valdosta, GA. Three clayey pedons including two Plinthic Kandiudults and a Plinthaquic Paleudult were studied along a hillslope transect. Four sandy pedons including a Typic Quartzipsamment, a Grossarenic Kandiudult, a Grossarenic Kandiaquult, and an Ultic Alaquod were studied along an upland and river terrace transect. Results indicate that (i) pedons that experienced a seasonal high water table are endosaturated; (ii) a gray matrix is indicative of seasonal saturation, on average for >50% of the time, although some sandy horizons may be saturated much less; (iii) Fe depletions are associated with saturation an average of 18% of the study period, a value less than commonly reported; (iv) Fe-concentration features occur in horizons saturated on average for 24% of the time, although some shallow, especially sandy, horizons were never or only briefly saturated during the study period. Upland and backslope soils, especially Kandiudults with plinthite and reticulate mottling, do not show a consistent relationship between saturation and redoximorphic features; these features appear to be relict and more monitoring in a variety of landscape settings is needed to determine the origin and significance of these features. 3aupland soils 3asandy soils 3aredox potential 3aclay soils 3asaturated conditions 3airon 3asoil horizons 3aseasonal variation 3acoastal plain soils 3aGeorgia 0ahigh water tables 0agray matrix color 0aslope 0adepletion 0abackslope soils 0asaturation1 aWest, L.T.1 aShaw, J.N.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 , v. 66, no. 1 p.315-323aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02266naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012100128300001800249500001500267520105500282650002301337650001301360650002301373650003001396650001701426650001301443650002101456653002701477653002501504653003001529653002901559653002901588653001501617700001501632700001201647773012901659852000901788930003301797945001301830946001301843655001201856IND2326860120221116142932.0020502e200112  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232686012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchsner, T.E.10aSimultaneous water content, air-filled porosity, and bulk density measurements with thermo-time domain reflectometry  ap. 1618-1622.  a2019-12-05  aThe partitioning of the soil volume between water, solids, and air strongly influences many soil processes. In this paper we demonstrate a new approach to nondestructively measure this partitioning. A thermo-time domain reflectometry (thermo-TDR) probe was inserted into sandy loam soil and used to apply thermal and electromagnetic pulses and to monitor the transport of these pulses through the soil. We used the resulting data to determine the soil water content, air-filled porosity, and volume fraction of solids, as well as degree of saturation and bulk density. When calibrated for this soil, the standard errors between thermo-TDR measurements and gravimetric measurements were 0.02, 0.07, and 0.05 m3 m(-3) for water content, volume fraction of solids, and air-filled porosity, respectively. The standard error for degree of saturation was 0.08 m3 m(-3), and for bulk density was 0.18 Mg m(-3). This technique has great potential for soil research and management, particularly if the accuracy of the bulk density measurement can be improved. 3asoil water content 3aporosity 3aprobes (equipment) 3atime domain reflectometry 3abulk density 3asoil air 3asandy loam soils 0avolume fraction of air 0adegree of saturation 0avolume fraction of solids 0asoil physical properties 0avolume fraction of water 0asaturation1 aHorton, R.1 aRen, T.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 6 p.1618-1622aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03215naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001800218520200200236650001602238650001202254650002302266650002402289650001602313650001502329650002002344650001502364650001902379650001902398650001302417650001302430650002102443653002102464653002302485700001402508700001602522700001602538700001802554773012902572852000902701930003302710945001302743946001302756655001202769IND2326859120221116143132.0020502e200112  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232685912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlesen, T.10aDiffusion of sorbing organic chemicals in the liquid and gaseous phases of repacked soil  ap. 1585-1593.  aTransport models for sorbing organic chemicals in soil require accurate predictions of the diffusion and sorption processes in both the liquid and gaseous phases. In this study, the ability of recently-presented diffusivity models in combination with equilibrium sorption models to predict the effective (i.e., including sorption effects) diffusion coefficient, Deff, as a function of soil-water content, theta, is tested for different sorbing organic chemicals in different soils. The water-induced linear reduction (WLR) gas diffusivity model, combined with a two-component (hydrophobic and vapor) equilibrium sorption model, well described short-term (<24 h) Deff(theta) of two volatile organic compounds, toluene and trichloroethylene (TCE), in Yolo loam (fine-silty, thermic Typic Xerorthent). Further extended with the constant slope impedance factor (CSIF) solute diffusivity model, the resulting two-phase diffusion and two-component equilibrium sorption (DATES) model accurately predicted short-term (48 h) Deff(theta) of a semivolatile pesticide, lindane (C6H6Cl6), in Gila silt loam (coarse-loamy, thermic Typic Torrifluvents). To test the DATES model for longer-term data, Deff(theta) of naphthalene (C10H8) in Lerbjerg sandy clay (L5) was measured at different soil-water contents and incubation times in air-tight diffusion cells. Because of sorption kinetics, both the apparent hydrophobic sorption coefficient, K(D), derived from the column diffusion experiments and K(D) derived from batch desorption experiments increased with naphthalene-soil contact time for t > 700 h. Consequently, an increasing K(D) value with time was required in the DATES model to obtain successful Deff(theta) predictions. Since chemical-soil contact time and adsorption-desorption history typically vary in each compartment of a soil profile, transport models, including sorption kinetics, will become very complex and DATES with a time-dependent K(D) relation may represent a useful model alternative. 3anaphthalene 3alindane 3avolatile compounds 3amathematical models 3adiffusivity 3aloam soils 3asilt loam soils 3aclay soils 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3asorption 3asoil air 3asandy clay soils 0adiffusion models 0adiffusivity models1 aGamst, J.1 aMoldrup, P.1 aKomatsu, T.1 aRolston, D.E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 , v. 65, no. 6 p.1585-1593aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle04336naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012500185300001600310500002400326520214500350650001502495650001602510650001502526650001402541650001802555650001902573650002002592650001802612650001602630650001202646650001302658650002102671650001302692650001102705650001102716650001002727650002002737650001302757650002202770650002502792650002202817650001802839650002002857650002502877650002502902650006402927650002002991650001703011650002003028650002503048650003103073650002803104650002503132650003303157650001403190650004603204650003603250650002503286650002303311700002003334700002103354700001803375700001703393700001903410773009203429852000903521856004803530655001203578IND4385091620221116142852.0061112e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438509162DNAL7 a168973042pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9071-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsaka, Toshifumi10aIdentification of Acetate- or Methanol-Assimilating Bacteria under Nitrate-Reducing Conditions by Stable-Isotope Probing  ap. 253-266.  aIncludes references  aStable-isotope probing (SIP) was used to identify acetate- or methanol-assimilating bacteria under nitrate-reducing conditions in activated sludge. A sludge sample obtained from wastewater treatment systems was incubated in a denitrifying batch reactor fed with synthetic wastewater containing [¹³C]acetate or [¹³C]methanol as the main carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. We analyzed how growth of bacterial populations was stimulated by acetate or methanol as the external carbon source in nitrogen-removal systems. Most of the acetate- or methanol-assimilating bacteria identified by SIP have been known as denitrifiers in wastewater treatment systems. When acetate was used as the carbon source, 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from ¹³C-labeled DNA were closely related to the 16S rRNA genes of Comamonadaceae (e.g., Comamonas and Acidovorax) and Rhodocyclaceae (e.g., Thauera and Dechloromonas) of the Betaproteobacteria, and Rhodobacteraceae (e.g., Paracoccus and Rhodobacter) of the Alphaproteobacteria. When methanol was used as the carbon source, 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from ¹³C-DNA were affiliated with Methylophilaceae (e.g., Methylophilus, Methylobacillus, and Aminomonas) and Hyphomicrobiaceae. Rarefaction curves for clones retrieved from ¹³C-DNA showed that the diversity levels for methanol-assimilating bacteria were considerably lower than those for acetate-assimilating bacteria. Furthermore, we characterized nitrite reductase genes (nirS and nirK) as functional marker genes for denitrifier communities in acetate- or methanol-assimilating populations and detected the nirS or nirK sequence related to that of some known pure cultures, such as Alcaligenes, Hyphomicrobium, and Thauera. However, most of the nirS or nirK sequences retrieved from ¹³C-DNA were clustered in some unidentified groups. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries retrieved from ¹³C-DNA, these unidentified nir sequences might be identified by examining the nir gene in candidates for true denitrifiers (e.g., the families Comamonadaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Methylophilaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae). 3aAcidovorax 3aAlcaligenes 3aAminomonas 3aComamonas 3aDechloromonas 3aHyphomicrobium 3aMethylobacillus 3aMethylophilus 3aRhodobacter 3aThauera 3aacetates 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3acarbon 3aclones 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amethanol 3anitrite reductase 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation growth 3aribosomal RNA 3astable isotopes 3awastewater treatment 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aGene Library 2aGenetic Markers 2aMethanolxmetabolism 2aMolecular Probe Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrite Reductasesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aWater Purification1 aYoshie, Sachiko1 aTsuneda, Satoshi1 aHirata, Akira1 aIwami, Norio1 aInamori, Yuhei0 tMicrobial ecology.g2006 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.253-266dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-006-9071-7 7aarticle03097naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245017300163300001600336500002400352520206100376650001102437650001302448650003302461650001402494650001202508651001802520700002202538700002102560700002402581773010902605852000902714856004802723655001202771IND4408757220221116142922.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440875722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-008-0026-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInda, Luis A.10aPhylogeny of Cleome L. and its close relatives Podandrogyne Ducke and Polanisia Raf.

Parsimony analysis of the molecular data recognized this group of cleomoid taxa as a strongly supported monophyletic lineage. Podandrogyne was imbedded within a highly supported Andinocleome clade, whereas Polanisia was placed as a member of a North American/Old World Cleome s. l. clade but with low support. The ITS data also indicated the sequential divergence of several basal Old World (sects. Cleome, Gymnogonia, Ranmanissa and Rutidosperma) and North American (subg. Physospermon, sect. Peritoma) lineages followed by more recent splittings of Central and South American lineages (the Andinocleome (sects. Pterosperma and Rimosperma) group, and sects. Melidiscus and Tarenaya). The morphological data showed extensive homoplasy and did not resolve the phylogeny of these cleomoids, although the cladistic analysis distinguished two poorly supported (subg. Eucleome and sect. Tarenaya) clades. Despite this, several sets of morphological and chromosomal secondary synapomorphies served to characterize the main sectional clades recovered in the molecular tree. Based on the strong support of the Cleome + Podandrogyne + Polanisia clade and the insufficient resolution and low support of the basal branches of this tree, and on the inherent homoplasy and unsatisfactory resolution of the morphological diagnostic traits used to characterize these taxa, a reunification of the three cleomoid genera under a large genus Cleome s. l. would be advisable. A biogeographical interpretation of our molecular phylogeny indicated and earlier origin of the ancestral Cleome lineages in the Old World, followed by colonization of North America and then a subsequent expansion towards central and South American with more recent secondary radiations in these subcontinents. 3aCleome 3abranches 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3aNorth America1 aTorrecilla, Pedro1 aCatalán, Pilar.1 aRuiz-Zapata, Thirza0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2008 Aug., v. 274, no. 1-2 p.111-126dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-008-0026-y 7aarticle03794naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010100182300001600283500002400299500001500323520143900338650002601777650001701803650002501820650002101845650001101866650002301877650001501900650004301915650003701958650001901995650002002014650002202034650003602056650001902092650001002111650002402121650001202145650001802157650001402175650001502189650001502204650001102219650001202230650000902242650002202251650002802273650002002301650002002321650002502341650008502366650008702451650008902538650003102627650002602658650001002684653002002694700002302714700002602737700002102763700002302784700002002807700001702827700003302844773010202877852000902979856004802988655001203036IND4440387120221116142858.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444038712DNAL7 a205894192pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-010-9820-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrimau, Fanny10aBinding Specificity of Recombinant Odorant-Binding Protein Isoforms is Driven by Phosphorylation  ap. 801-813.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNative porcine odorant-binding protein (OBP) bears eleven sites of phosphorylation, which are not always occupied in the molecular population, suggesting that different isoforms could co-exist in animal tissues. As phosphorylation is a dynamic process resulting in temporary conformational changes that regulate the function of target proteins, we investigated the possibility that OBP isoforms could display different binding affinities to biologically relevant ligands. The availability of recombinant proteins is of particular interest for the study of protein/ligand structure-function relationships, but prokaryotic expression systems do not perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications. To investigate the role of phosphorylation in the binding capacities of OBP isoforms, we produced recombinant porcine OBP in two eukaryotic systems, the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and the mammalian CHO cell line. Isoforms were separated by anion exchange HPLC, and their phosphorylation sites were mapped by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and compared to those of the native protein. Binding experiments with ligands of biological relevance in the pig, Sus scrofa, were performed by fluorescence spectroscopy on two isoforms of recombinant OBP expressed in the yeast. The two isoforms, differing only by their phosphorylation pattern, displayed different binding properties, suggesting that binding specificity is driven by phosphorylation. 3aKomagataella pastoris 3afluorescence 3arecombinant proteins 3aprotein isoforms 3ayeasts 3abinding properties 3aSus scrofa 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3astructure-activity relationships 3aanion exchange 3aphosphorylation 3amass spectrometry 3apost-translational modification 3aanimal tissues 3aswine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCHO Cells 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aFemale 2aLigands 2aMale 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Isoformsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Odorantxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aSwine 0aPichia pastoris1 aCornard, Jean-Paul1 aLe Danvic, Chrystelle1 aLagant, Philippe1 aVergoten, Gérard.1 aGrebert, Denise1 aPajot, Edith1 aNagnan-Le Meillour, Patricia0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.801-813dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-010-9820-4 7aarticle03540naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006700126300001400193500002400207520242400231650003302655650002502688650001802713650002602731650001002757650000902767650001702776650001802793650001602811650002202827650001202849650001302861650002302874650001402897650002302911650002102934650002402955651001802979773012402997852000903121655001203130IND4418598720221116143152.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441859872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuegg, P.L.10aManagement of mastitis on organic and conventional dairy farms  ap. 43-55.  aIncludes references  aThis paper compares management of mastitis on organic dairy farms with that on conventional dairy farms. National standards for organic production vary by country. In the United States, usage of antimicrobials to treat dairy cattle results in permanent loss of organic status of the animal, effectively limiting treatment choices for animals experiencing bacterial diseases. There are no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that can be used for treatment of mastitis on organic dairy farms, and usage of unapproved products is contrary to Food and Drug Administration guidelines. In general, organic dairy farms tend to be smaller, produce less, and more likely to be housed and milked in traditional barns as compared with conventionally managed herds. It is difficult to compare disease rates between herds managed conventionally or organically because perception and detection of disease is influenced by management system. To date, no studies have been published with the defined objective of comparing animal health on organic dairy herds with that on conventional dairy herds in the United States. European studies have not documented significant differences in animal health based on adoption of organic management. Few differences in bulk tank somatic cell counts have been identified between organic and conventional herds. Farmers that have adopted organic management consistently report fewer cases of clinical mastitis, but organic farmers do not use the same criteria to detect clinical mastitis. European dairy farmers that adopt organic management report use of a variety of conventional and alternative therapies for treatment and control of mastitis. In the United States, organic farmers treat clinical mastitis using a variety of alternative therapies including whey-based products, botanicals, vitamin supplements, and homeopathy. Organic farmers in the United States use a variety of alternative products to treat cows at dry-off. Virtually no data are available that support the clinical efficacy of any of the alternative veterinary products used for treatment or prevention of mastitis. Some associations between organic management and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens have been noted, but overall, few mastitis pathogens from both conventional and organic dairy herds demonstrate resistance to antibiotics commonly used for mastitis control. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal health 3aantibiotic resistance 3abarns 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3adisease detection 3afarmers 3amastitis 3aorganic production 3apathogens 3asomatic cell count 3aveterinary drugs 3avitamin supplements 3aUnited States0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 13_suppl p.43-55dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245017300167300001400340500002400354520163200378650001402010650001002024650001202034650001702046650001002063650002002073650001902093650002002112650002102132650001402153650001302167651001602180651002002196651001802216773009202234852000902326856004802335655001202383IND4411315020221116142939.0081010e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441131502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9563-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSefc, Kristina M.10aVariance in reproductive success and the opportunity for selection in a serially monogamous species: simulations of the mating system of Tropheus (Teleostei: Cichlidae)  ap. 21-35.  aIncludes references  aSexual selection is believed to play a major role in speciation processes of cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, in particular Lakes Malawi and Victoria, by driving diversification in male nuptial coloration. In Lake Tanganyika, a high rate of color pattern diversification is found in the genus Tropheus, where more than 100, mostly allopatric, color morphs have been described. Whether color pattern differentiation in Tropheus could follow from sexual selection as well, has not yet been conclusively shown. Unlike typical sexually selected species, Tropheus are sexually monomorphic, establish temporary pair bonds and spawn monogamously. Variance in mating success among individuals would still allow for sexual selection, but due to their high population census sizes, parentage data from natural populations are difficult to obtain. Simulations designed according to existing data on mating behavior in Tropheus suggested that variance in male reproductive success can be substantial and lead to levels of opportunity for selection, which are similar to values estimated, for example, from natural populations of sexually dimorphic songbirds. Variance in male success was mostly affected by the way females perceived and reacted to differences between males, and to a lesser extent by the duration of components of the reproductive cycles of males and females. These results indicate that future work on the importance of sexual selection in Tropheus should concentrate on mate choice cues and female mate choice behavior, but does not depend critically on the acquisition of more detailed life history data. 3aCichlidae 3acolor 3afemales 3alife history 3amales 3amating behavior 3amating systems 3apopulation size 3asexual selection 3asongbirds 3avariance 3aGreat Lakes 3aLake Tanganyika 3aLake Victoria0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Dec., v. 615, no. 1 p.21-35dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9563-1 7aarticle02457naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010600143300001400249500001500263520082900278650001601107650001001123650001601133650002301149650001301172650001701185650001101202650000901213650001801222650002201240650001001262650001901272650004701291650001201338650003701350650004801387650003701435650000901472650000901481650002101490650002501511650003101536650002201567650004601589653000901635653002001644653002701664700001501691773010701706852000901813930003301822945001301855946001101868655001201879IND2164208620221116143123.0980922s1998    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216420862DNAL7 a95030522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, M.10aEffects of soy protein on the morphology of ileum and the ultrastructure of liver cells in adult mice  ap. 73-76.  a2019-12-05  aThe influences of soy protein on the morphology of ileum and on the ultrastructure of liver were studied. Adult male mice of the Crj: CD-1 (ICR) strain were fed a semisynthetic diet containing casein or soy protein for three weeks. Villus heights in ileum from the mice fed soy protein diet were significantly greater than those fed casein diet. There were evident ultrastructural differences in the liver cells between the mice fed the two diets. Many lipid droplets from the mice fed the casein diet were larger than those fed the soy protein diet. The maximum diameter of lipid droplet per liver cell in the soy protein diet group was smaller than that in the casein diet group (p < 0.01). These results suggest that soy protein and casein affect the ultrastructure of liver and the morphology of ileum in different ways. 3ahepatocytes 3aileum 3asoy protein 3aexperimental diets 3adroplets 3adroplet size 3aheight 3amice 3aanimal models 3aintestinal mucosa 3avilli 3aultrastructure 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxadministration & dosage 2aIleumxanatomy & histologyxultrastructure. 2aLiverxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicrovillixultrastructure 2aRandom Allocation 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosage 0adiet 0adietary protein 0aanatomy and morphology1 aSuzuki, H.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1998, v. 68, no. 1 p.73-76x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03021naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001600264500001500280520104500295650002001340650000801360650001801368650001601386650002301402650001701425650003201442650001901474650000901493650002601502650003201528650002401560650002401584650002601608650001001634650001201644650002801656650000901684650004201693650004601735650001801781650003701799650002301836650003201859650001101891650001101902650000901913650001601922650002501938650002501963653001601988653000902004653002402013653002402037653001102061700001502072700001702087700001502104700001702119773010902136852000902245930003302254945001302287946001102300655001202311IND2057074620221116143054.0970513s1996    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205707462DNAL7 a89791672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, M.J.10aInfluence of dietary fish on fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane in coronary heart disease patients  ap. 378-379.  a2019-12-05  aThis study examines the effects of dietary fish oil on the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane in persons with coronary heart disease. Thirty men with myocardial infarction were studied during three consecutive periods, during which they consumed 1) their habitual diet, 2) a diet specially designed to prevent ischaemic cardiopathy, and 3) a diet rich in polyunsaturated fat, in which fish was substituted for meat. At the end of each diet, fatty acid concentrations in the erythrocyte membrane were measured, and a 48 h recall dietary questionnaire was used to determine the types of foods consumed. Despite the increase in the intake of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane failed to reflect the greater dietary supply of eicosapentaenoic acid, and showed increased concentrations of stearic (C16) and palmitic (C18) acid. The increase in dietary (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids markedly increased 22:4 (n-6), 22:5 (n-6), 22:5 (n-3) and 22:6 (n-3) fatty acids. 3anutrient intake 3amen 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3aexperimental diets 3aerythrocytes 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3acell membranes 3afish 3asaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3amyocardial infarction 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCoronary Diseasexblood 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aErythrocyte Membranexmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxblood 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xblood 2aFishes 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPalmitic Acidxblood 2aStearic Acidsxblood 0afatty acids 0adiet 0aomega-7 fatty acids 0aomega-9 fatty acids 0alipids1 aLlopis, J.1 aMataix, F.J.1 aUrbano, G.1 aJurado, M.L.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1996, v. 66, no. 4 p.378-379x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01618naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100003000140245010300170300001600273500002400289520065500313650000800968650001300976650001400989650000701003700002301010700001601033773010901049852000901158856008001167856006901247655001201316IND4460695220221116141729.0110804s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446069522DNAL7 a10.1653/024.094.02362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBujang, Nurmastini Sufina13aAn improved method for extraction and purification of termite endo-β-1,4-glucanase from FTA cards  ap. 356-358.  aIncludes references  aIn conclusion, we report an improved method for extraction and purification of termite nucleic acid from the FTA Plantsaver Card (Whatman), which involves elution with TE buffer (pH 8) and purification with Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega).

At least 100 genes encode proteins involved in the formation of nucleotide sugars. These nucleotide sugars are formed using the carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis, the sugar generated by hydrolyzing translocated sucrose, the sugars released from storage carbohydrates, the salvage of sugars from glycoproteins and glycolipids, the recycling of sugars released during primary and secondary cell wall restructuring, and the sugar generated during plant-microbe interactions. Here we emphasize the importance of the salvage of sugars released from glycans for the formation of nucleotide sugars. We also outline how recent studies combining biochemical, genetic, molecular and cellular approaches have led to an increased appreciation of the role nucleotide sugars in all aspects of plant growth and development. Nevertheless, our understanding of these pathways at the single cell level is far from complete. 3acell walls 3agenes 3aglycolipids 3aglycosylation 3agrowth and development 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproteoglycans 3arecycling 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aGuanosine Diphosphate Sugarsxmetabolism 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharidesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aUridine Diphosphate Sugarsxmetabolism1 aO'Neill, Malcolm A.0 tAnnual review of plant biology.g2011 June, v. 62 p.127-155dAnnual Reviews Incx1543-50087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-1039183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02446naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002200157245006100179300001500240500002400255520111500279650002701394650002301421650001701444650002101461650002101482650001201503650001101515650001101526650001701537650003001554650002101584650001901605650001001624650002001634650002301654650002901677650001701706700001801723700002301741700001801764773010001782852000901882856009701891655001201988IND4460654020221116141645.0110802s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446065402DNAL7 a10.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-1038572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillar, A.

We describe recent advances in our understanding of the mitochondrial respiratory machinery of cells, including the presence of a classical oxidative phosphorylation system linked to the cytosol by transporters, discussed alongside nonphosphorylating (and, therefore, non-energy conserving) bypasses that alter the efficiency of ATP synthesis and play a role in oxidative stress responses in plants. We consider respiratory regulation in the context of the contrasting roles mitochondria play in different tissues, from photosynthetic leaves to nutrient-acquiring roots. We focus on the molecular nature of this regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels that allow the respiratory apparatus of plants to help shape organ development and the response of plants to environmental stress. We highlight the challenges for future research considering spatial and temporal changes of respiration in response to changing climatic conditions. 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3acell respiration 3aclimatic factors 3acytosol 3aenergy 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3astress response 3atemporal variation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters1 aWhelan, James1 aSoole, Kathleen L.1 aDay, David A.0 tAnnual review of plant biology.g2011 June, v. 62 p.79-104dAnnual Reviews Incx1543-50087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-1038573Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01739naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245007200137300001600209500002400225520081300249650000901062650001301071650001301084650001101097650000901108650001801117650001001135700002001145700001901165700001701184700001801201700001501219773007301234852000901307856007301316655001201389IND4460644820221116141719.0110801s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446064482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanganal, Jagadeesh S.10aEffect of cow urine on wound healing property in Wister albino rats  ap. 317-321.  aIncludes references  aThe wound healing activity of cow urine was studied in Wistar albino rats.

Where as nitrofurazone treated animals showed 0 % and 0.50.3 % healing .The study revealed that the cow urine on external application to the wound, hastened the wound healing process. 3acows 3aexcision 3aimmunity 3amodels 3arats 3atissue repair 3aurine1 aJeyakumār, Ki.1 aJayaramu, G.M.1 aTikare, V.P.1 aPaniraj, K.L.1 aSwetha, R.0 tVeterinary world.g2011 July, v. 4, no. 7 p.317-321x0972-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.veterinaryworld.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02941naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245009500133300001600228500002400244520197900268650001002247650001502257650001802272650002502290650002302315650001902338650001002357650001102367650001502378650001502393651001002408700001802418773007302436852000902509856007302518655001202591IND4460643920221116141718.0110801s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446064392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Magda Mahmoud10aCod liver oil/honey mixture: An effective treatment of equine complicated lower leg wounds  ap. 304-310.  aIncludes references  aWounds are of great concern in animals as they affect animal productivity and their treatment represents an economic burden to the owners particularly in developing countries. The present study investigated the beneficial role of a mixture of cod liver oil and honey in treatment of old wounds in equines. In which, 3 horses and 7 donkeys were admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt with old wounds at the metacarpus (5 cases) and metatarsus (3 cases) and at the level of fetlock and carpal joints (one case each). Treatment of these wounds with cod liver oil/honey mixture markedly decreased their sizes and resulted in formation of a healthy scar after one month of treatment. To explain the mechanisms that underlie the effects of this mixture, 9 surgically-induced wounds at the metacarpus in 9 donkeys were treated with honey, cod liver oil or the mixture (3 wounds each) and compared with parallel untreated control wounds at the metatarsus. It was found that treatment of wounds with honey, cod liver oil and the mixture apparently decreased the size of wounds. Histopathological examination revealed that treated wounds with honey or cod liver oil showed complete epithelization over the wound areas. On the other hand, epithelization process was not complete in wounds treated with the mixture. Granulation tissue showed some variability between different treatments. Of which, wounds treated with the mixture showed a higher degree of maturity with increasing numbers of fibrocytes and parallel collagenous fibers. This could underlie the good results obtained in case studied wounds with the mixture. In conclusion, mixture of cod liver oil and honey is beneficial in treatment of old traumatized wounds in equine and this effect is primarily mediated by formation of healthy and mature scars. Cod liver oil or honey alone is beneficial for healing of recent and surgical wounds as they facilitate epithelization process. 3aasses 3acod (fish) 3acod liver oil 3adeveloping countries 3agranulation tissue 3ahistopathology 3ahoney 3ahorses 3ametacarpus 3ametatarsus 3aEgypt1 aRadad, Khaled0 tVeterinary world.g2011 July, v. 4, no. 7 p.304-310x0972-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.veterinaryworld.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04354naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245006800144300001400212500001500226520257600241650002002817650002302837650001302860650001402873650002102887650002002908650001802928650001402946650002302960650001502983650001402998650002603012650002603038650002403064650001403088650001403102650001403116650002403130650003203154650003003186650000903216650003103225650001103256650001103267650000903278650002903287650005803316653002303374653002503397653001203422653002503434653003303459653002803492653001103520773010703531852000903638930003303647945001303680946001103693655001203704IND2196047720221116141739.0981217s1997    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219604772DNAL7 a91292492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerster, H.10aVitamin A--functions, dietary requirements and safety in humans  ap. 71-90.  a2019-12-05  aIn recent years, new physiological functions of vitamin A have been identified in addition to its role in vision, namely its role in immune defence reducing morbidity of measles, of respiratory and possibly HIV infections, in gene regulation, in cell differentiation and morphogenesis. With the discovery of nuclear receptors for retinoic acid additional functions are likely to be found. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA)for vitamin A, including provitamin A carotenoids, vary greatly between countries. This may be explained by difficulties in establishing needs: Homeostatic mechanisms tightly control absorption, storage, release and transport of vitamin A to target tissue, and plasma concentrations do not reflect status unless there is vitamin A deficiency or excess. In the United States RDAs were established on the basis of vitamin A depletion-repletion studies with radio-labelled retinol. Intake requirements were calculated to amount to 1000 micrograms retinol equivalents (RE) for men, 800 micrograms RE for non-pregnant as well as pregnant women and 1300 micrograms RE for lactating women. Dietary intake studies in different countries have shown that it is in principle possible to obtain these values from the diet either as preformed vitamin A or in the form of provitamin A carotenoids or both. Risk groups for inadequate intakes include low-income groups and younger persons following weight-reducing and other unbalanced diets. Since experience with recommended intake values in the United States has been excellent, attempts at reducing these levels are unjustified and should be resisted. At intakes of up to three RDA values (approximately 3000 micrograms RE) no unwanted side-effects are to be expected. Even higher doses, if not taken chronically, have been well tolerated, e.g. in deprived populations with low liver reserves. The suggestion derived from a case-control study that vitamin A taken at supplemental doses of 2400 micrograms RE may be teratogenic have not been confirmed by several other studies. But it is judicious to follow the recommendations of the American Pediatric Society that women should not exceed a total daily intake of 3000 micrograms RE. In developing countries where acute and chronic vitamin A deficiency is endemic causing xerophthalmia and blindness and increasing the prevalence of infectious diseases and death in children, special efforts are being made by WHO/UNICEF to provide programs for the eradication of vitamin A deficiency by immediate treatment and by long-term changes in dietary practices. 3anutrient excess 3adisease prevention 3aimmunity 3aneoplasms 3ahealth promotion 3anutrient uptake 3aembryogenesis 3ainfection 3anutrient transport 3ametabolism 3amorbidity 3aintestinal absorption 3anutrient requirements 3avitamin supplements 3avitamin A 3amortality 3aexcretion 3asexual reproduction 3afood and nutrition programs 3aWorld Health Organization 2aDiet 2aDrug Evaluationxstandards 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aVitamin Axpharmacologyxphysiologyxtherapeutic use. 0aliterature reviews 0anutrition physiology 0ameasles 0avitamin a deficiency 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus 0ahuman health and safety 0aunicef0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1997, v. 67, no. 2 p.71-90x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03057naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012800144300001600272500001500288520138200303650002301685650002401708650001601732650001001748650001601758650001301774650002601787650000901813650001501822650001701837650002501854650001501879650001801894650002001912650001001932650004201942650006201984650001102046650002102057650001102078650004102089650002302130650002402153650002202177653001702199700002202216700002202238700001502260700001702275773010902292852000902401930003302410945001302443946001102456655001202467IND2199493720221116141707.0990628s1998    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219949372DNAL7 a96379522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasse, P.G.10aNutritional and psychological status of young women after a short-term use of a triphasic contraceptive steroid preparation  ap. 203-207.  a2019-12-05  aThe present study was aimed to assess the psychological status of young healthy women after the administration of a triphasic contraceptive steroid preparation for six complete menstrual cycles. Subjects had never used oral contraceptives (OC) and had neither a familial history of depression nor psychological disturbances. OC-induced psychological disturbances were interpreted for years as evidence of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. Other nutritional deficiencies, namely in cobalamin, folate and iron, can disturb the functioning of the central nervous system. In addition, a deficiency of any of these nutrients can lead to several anemia-induced symptoms that are highly susceptible to influence the psychological status. For ample evidence, nutritional status was then evaluated in parallel to psychological testing. Blood iron and vitamin levels of interest were found to be adequate and could not have biaised the response to a psychological test (MMPI). This study showed that a 6-month Triphasil treatment did not modify significantly the psychological status of subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first psychological study on young never OC-users taking an identical triphasic contraceptive steroid preparation to investigate early psychological side-effects due to OC, at a similar time of the menstrual cycle, when nutritional status was also evaluated. 3anutritional status 3aoral contraceptives 3avitamin B12 3awomen 3ablood serum 3aferritin 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3apyridoxine 3ayoung adults 3apsychosocial factors 3afolic acid 3amental health 3aadverse effects 2aAdult 2aContraceptives, Oralxadverse effects 2aEthinyl Estradiol-Norgestrel Combinationxadverse effects 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxblood 2aHumans 2aMental Disordersxchemically induced 2aNutritional Status 2aPsychological Tests 2aPyridoxinexblood 0ablood plasma1 aBerg, H. van den.1 aLivingstone, M.M.1 aDuguay, C.1 aBeaulieu, G.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1998, v. 68, no. 3 p.203-207x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013600125300001600261520147900277650002201756650001401778650002001792650001201812650003001824650002201854650002301876650002201899650002401921700001601945773008201961852000902043930003302052945001302085946001302098655001202111IND2058383620221116141724.0970715e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205838362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZera, A.J.10aBiochemical characterization of juvenile hormone esterases from lines selected for high or low enzyme activity in Gryllus assimilis  ap. 421-435.  aIn a previous study, activity of the insect endocrine regulator juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), in the cricket Gryllus assimilis, was subjected to bidirectional selection. This resulted in three pairs of high- and low-selected lines, each of which differed by 3.5-fold in JHE activity. In the present study, juvenile hormone esterases from these lines were characterized with respect to the Michaelis constant (Km), thermostability, and inhibition. None of three high-selected JHEs differed from its respective low-selected JHE in the Michaelis constant (Km) for juvenile hormone. Similarly, the high-selected JHEs did not differ from the low selected JHEs in thermostability or inhibition by either of two general esterase inhibitors (DFP, eserine) or a "JHE-specific" inhibitor (OTFP). Thus no evidence was obtained to suggest that the response to selection was due to allozymes or isozymes with altered kinetic or stability properties. Kinetic and stability properties were also very similar for the JHEs from the three high-selected or the three low-selected lines. Finally, none of the thermostability or inhibition profiles for any of the six JHEs exhibited sharp discontinuities, thus providing no evidence for the existence of multiple isozymes. The available evidence points to genetically variable regulators which affect the synthesis, degradation, or tissue distribution of JHE as being responsible for the divergence in JHE activity between the selected lines. 3aGryllus assimilis 3aallozymes 3aenzyme activity 3ainsects 3ajuvenile hormone esterase 3ajuvenile hormones 3aselection response 3athermal stability 3atissue distribution1 aZeisset, M.0 tBiochemical genetics.g1996 Dec., v. 34, no. 11/12 p.421-435x0006-29287nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245016900146300001600315520119100331650002001522650001801542650001601560650001201576650000901588650001701597650001201614650003401626650003301660650002901693650003301722650002901755650004101784650000901825650001701834653001401851653001401865653001601879653001501895653001301910653001601923700002601939773010901965852000902074930003302083945001302116946001102129655001202140IND2045475120221116141708.0950407s1994    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204547512DNAL7 a79604952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, J.B.T.10aHandling during suckling alters rat behavior but does not reverse the deleterious effects of undernutrition on naltrexone-induced inhibition of exploratory activity  ap. 152-156.  aThe effects of undernutrition during suckling, early environmental stimulation and naltrexone administration on the locomotor activity test were investigated in adult rats. Young rats were undernourishedfrom delivery until weaning (23 days) by feeding their dams a diet containing 7% casein diet. Mothers of well-nourished rats were fed a 25% casein diet. After weaning, both groups of rats received standard lab chow. From day 2 to day 8 after delivery the animals were stimulated by being placed individually in plastic containers for 4 minutes. From day 12 to 19 the litters were removed from their home cages and placed for 10 min in plastic cages. Exploratory behavior was assessed using a biocompartmentalized open field. The number of crossings from one compartment to the other and the number of rearings were recorded. Undernourished animals crossed less frequently than control animals and presented a higher latency to the first crossing response. Early handling increased the total number of rearing responses regardless of nutritional treatment. Naltrexone administration caused a dose-dependent reduction in the numberof rearing responses only in the well-nourished group. 3aanimal behavior 3adose response 3abody weight 3aposture 3arats 3amalnutrition 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aHandling, Psychological. 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aNaltrexonexpharmacology 2aNutrition Disordersxphysiopathology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0asucklings 0aresponses 0aexploration 0analtrexone 0ahandling 0astimulation1 aFernando de Mello, C.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1994, v. 64, no. 2 p.152-156x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03812naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010800142300001600250520168400266650001101950650002001961650001601981650002301997650001102020650001202031650002802043650000802071650002102079650002102100650001602121650002702137650000902164650001002173650002602183650001402209650002002223650001502243650001002258650001102268650002102279650003102300650003202331650001102363650002302374650000902397650003802406650003602444650003502480650002802515650002302543651000902566651000902575653002102584653002702605653001702632653002302649653003102672700001502703700001602718700001402734700001602748700001902764700001502783700001402798700001602812700001502828773010902843852000902952930003302961945001302994946001103007655001203018IND2054748320221116141741.0970106s1995    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205474832DNAL7 a88300002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzizi, F.10aPhysical, neuromotor and intellectual impairment in non-cretinous schoolchildren with iodine deficiency  ap. 199-205.  aThyroid status and neurologic, psychometric and auditory functions were evaluated in presumably normal schoolchildren aged 6 to 16 years from three areas of iodine deficiency in Iran. The subjects from each area were identified as members of groups A, B or C. In group A there were retarded growth, high prevalence of visible goiter (93%), low T4 (39%) and high TSH (70%). In group B 66% had a visible goiter and 7% had high serum TSH. In group C visible goiter was present in 22% of the subjects but they had normal thyroid function. Urinary iodine excretion was low in all three groups. Head circumference was less in groups A and B, as compared to C. Pyramidal signs occurred in over half of the subjects in group A (hyperreflexia in 39% and crossed adductor reflex in 29%). The glabellar sign was present in 50% of group A and 20% of group B. Forty-four percent of the subjects in group A and 17% in group B had hearing deficits as shown by audiometry. Psychomotor examination was performed using the Bender Gestalt test. A higher number of errors was evident in groups A and B their psychomotor age was below their chronological age. The results of the Raven test showed impairment of IQ in group A, with 55% having an IQ below 91 and 15% less than 70. The subjects in group B had lower IQ than group C, but higher than group A. There was a negative correlation between serum TSH and free thyroid indices and a positive correlation between TSH and the number of pyramidal signs. This study demonstrates that mild to moderate growth retardation and neurological, auditory and psychomotor impairments occur in apparently normal subjects residing in areas of iodine deficiency. 3aiodine 3aschool children 3aadolescents 3agrowth retardation 3agoiter 3ahearing 3apsychomotor development 3aage 3athyroid function 3athyroid hormones 3ablood serum 3ageographical variation 3aboys 3agirls 3anutrient deficiencies 3acognition 3adisease surveys 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aFemale 2aGoiterxetiology 2aGrowth Disordersxetiology 2aHearing Disordersxetiology 2aHumans 2aIodinexdeficiency 2aMale 2aNervous System Diseasesxetiology 2aPsychomotor Disordersxetiology 2aThyroid Glandxphysiopathology 2aThyroid Hormonesxblood 2aThyrotropinxblood 3aIran 0aIran 0aclinical aspects 0aneuromuscular diseases 0askeletal age 0ahearing impairment 0atrace element deficiencies1 aKalani, H.1 aKimigar, M.1 aGhazi, A.1 aSarshar, A.1 aNafarabadi, M.1 aRahbar, N.1 aNoohi, S.1 aMohajer, M.1 aYassai, M.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1995, v. 65, no. 3 p.199-205x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03007naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011000144300001600254500001500270520122100285650002501506650002001531650001701551650001301568650004301581650001701624650001801641650001001659650000901669650002201678650002501700650005001725650001601775650004701791650001601838650001101854650001801865650001601883650002401899650003301923650003201956650002401988650003102012650003202043650003002075650001602105650001702121653002302138700002402161700001402185700001902199773010902218852000902327930003302336945001302369946001102382655001202393IND2058143420221116141647.0970701s1996    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205814342DNAL7 a88439932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTessier, F.10aValidation of a micromethod for determining oxidized and reduced vitamin C in plasma by HPLC-fluorescence  ap. 166-170.  a2019-12-05  aAn HPLC micro-method with fluorescence detection has been developed to determine total vitamin C (vit C) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) concentrations in human plasma samples. This method is based on the rapid, specific reaction of DHA with dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine (DMPD) to form a fluorescent quinoxaline derivative that is quantified by HPLC in less than 5 minutes. The method was assessed with reference to the direct 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) colorimetric method. They were well correlated (r2 = 0.879), but the DMPD-HPLC method had the limit of detection 6 times lower than the standard method and the relative error for a vitamin standard was 10 times better than that of the standard method The plasma DHA to total vit C ratio varied from 10 to 60%, depending on sample processing. Plasma that were immediately analysed contained 10% DHA whatever the subject's age; frozen deproteinized samples kept 1 week (-67 degrees C) had 20%, and blood samples kept for one hour at room temperature before treatment had up to 60% DHA. The ratio in capillary samples taken from the finger was 11-42%. This rapid, specific and very sensitive micro-method is well suited to routine measurements of plasma vit C. 3adehydroascorbic acid 3avitamin content 3afluorescence 3avalidity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ablood plasma 3aascorbic acid 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aColorimetry 2aDehydroascorbic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFluorometry 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenylenediaminesxchemistry 2aPhenylhydrazinesxchemistry 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aanalytical methods1 aBirlouez-Aragon, I.1 aTjani, C.1 aGuilland, J.C.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1996, v. 66, no. 2 p.166-170x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03716naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245020300178300001600381500002400397520185900421650001802280650002402298650001302322650001202335650000902347650002402356650001902380650001602399650002302415650001602438650001102454650001602465650001202481650001202493650001202505650001902517650002302536650002602559650002402585650001602609651001602625651001202641651001102653651001202664651001002676651001102686651002902697651001302726651001602739651001602755700001702771700001302788700001402801700001302815700001302828700001602841773010302857852000902960856008502969655001203054IND4460690720110804000000.0110804s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446069072DNAL7 a213203632pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853110000102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAluja, M.10aIs the alpine divide becoming more permeable to biological invasions? – Insights on the invasion and establishment of the Walnut Husk Fly, Rhagoletis completa (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Switzerland  ap. 451-465.  aIncludes references  aThe Walnut Husk Fly, Rhagoletis completa Cresson (Diptera: Tephritidae), is native to North America (Midwestern US and north-eastern Mexico) and has invaded several European countries in the past decades by likely crossing the alpine divide separating most parts of Switzerland from Italy. Here, we determined its current distribution in Switzerland by sampling walnuts (Juglans regia L.) in ecologically and climatically distinct regions along potential invasion corridors. R. completa was found to be firmly established in most low altitude areas of Switzerland where walnuts thrive, but notably not a single parasitoid was recovered from any of the samples. Infested fruit was recovered in 42 of the 71 localities that were surveyed, with mean fruit infestation rate varying greatly among sites. The incidence of R. completa in Switzerland is closely related to meteorological mean spring temperature patterns influencing growing season length, but not to winter temperatures, reflecting survival potential during hibernation. Importantly, areas in which the fly is absent correspond with localities where the mean spring temperatures fall below 7 degrees C. Historical data records show that the natural cold barrier around the Alpine divide in the central Swiss Alps corresponding to such minimal temperatures has shrunk significantly from a width of more than 40 km before 1990 to around 20 km after 2000. We hypothesize on possible invasion/expansion routes along alpine valleys, dwell on distribution patterns in relation to climate, and outline future research needs as the incursion of R. completa into Switzerland; and, more recently, other European countries, such as Germany, Austria, France and Slovenia, represent an example of alien species that settle first in the Mediterranean Basin and from there become invasive by crossing the Alps. 3aJuglans regia 3aRhagoletis completa 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acold 3aecological invasion 3agrowing season 3ahibernation 3aintroduced species 3aparasitoids 3aspring 3atemperature 3avalleys 3awalnuts 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aIntroduced Species 2aJuglansxparasitology 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTephritidae 3aAlps region 3aAustria 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aMexico 3aMidwestern United States 3aSlovenia 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland1 aGuillén, L.1 aRull, J.1 aHöhn, H.1 aFrey, J.1 aGraf, B.1 aSamietz, J.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2011 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.451-465dCABI Pubx0007-48537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853110000103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001200164245016400176300001600340500002400356520144100380650001701821650001901838650001501857650001401872650001301886650001801899650003001917650001201947650003201959650002801991650002302019650005802042650001402100650005702114651001002171651001002181651002502191700001402216700001702230700001602247700001402263700001502277773010302292852000902395856008502404655001202489IND4460690920221116141346.0110804s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446069092DNAL7 a213295502pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853110000832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, D.10aFurther insights into the strange role of bacterial endosymbionts in whitefly, Bemisia tabaci: Comparison of secondary symbionts from biotypes B and Q in China  ap. 477-486.  aIncludes references  aThe percentage infection of secondary symbionts (SS) (Wolbachia, Arsenophonus, Rickettsia, Hamiltonella, Fritschea and Cardinium) in the exotic Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) invaders, commonly known as biotypes B and Q from China, were determined by PCR. In total, 373 biotype B and 1830 biotype Q individuals were screened for the presence of SS. Biotype B was more abundant than biotype Q from 2005 to 2006, and biotype Q was more abundant from 2007 to 2009. Each of the SS, with the exception of Fritschea, was detected in both biotypes B and Q; Fritschea was found in none of the samples examined. For biotype B, the percentage infection of Hamiltonella was the highest (92.0%) followed by Rickettsia (70.2%). For biotype Q, the percentage infection of Hamiltonella was again the highest (73.3%). Arsenophonus was the least common of the SS observed in both biotypes B and Q. The percentage infection of Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Hamiltonella in biotype B was each significantly higher than in biotype Q, whereas the percentage infection of Cardinium in biotype B was significantly lower than in biotype Q. The percentage infection of SS in biotypes B and Q varied from year to year over the period 2005-2009. Furthermore, within biotype Q, two distinct subgroups were identified which differ from each other in terms of their SS complement. We discuss these results in the light of the potentially influential factors and roles of the SS. 3aArsenophonus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aRickettsia 3aWolbachia 3abiotypes 3aendosymbionts 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aHemipteraxmicrobiology 2aIntroduced Species 2aRickettsiaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aSymbiosis 2aWolbachiaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aChina 0aChina 0aMediterranean Region1 aGao, C.S.1 aDe Barro, P.1 aZhang, Y.J.1 aWan, F.H.1 aKhan, I.A.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2011 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.477-486dCABI Pubx0007-48537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853110000833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02180naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001400136245008300150300001800233500002400251500001500275520121900290650002201509650001601531650001501547650001501562650001801577653002401595700002201619700002301641700002001664773011001684852000901794856003901803655001201842IND4419339020221116141413.0090417e20090430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441933902DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.72612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi10aInfluence of soil moisture hysteresis on the functioning of capillary barriers  ap. 1369-1375.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevious experimental studies of capillary barriers have identified highly hysteretic soil moisture retention characteristics in the materials used. In this study, numerical modelling is used to analyse the role of soil moisture hysteresis in capillary barrier functioning. Comparisons between published experimental results and model simulations indicate that soil moisture hysteresis was a necessary inclusion in the modelling approach to adequately reproduce pore water pressure distributions and the timing of breakthrough occurrences. Under hypothetical intermittent infiltration and evaporation conditions, the predicted volumetric water content in the moisture retention layer was significantly different for hysteretic and non-hysteretic models. The hysteresis effect was found to be dependent on the nature of infiltration-evaporation cycling, although the predicted volume of flow through the hysteretic barrier was lower than that of the non-hysteretic case, regardless of the nature of the cyclic upper boundary conditions. For practical engineering designs, where the water leakage through the barrier is the primary concern, the inclusion of soil moisture hysteresis in numerical modelling is needed. 3asimulation models 3aevaporation 3ahysteresis 3asoil water 3awater content 0amathematical models1 aWerner, Adrian D.1 aAviyanto, Raden F.1 aHutson, John L.0 tHydrological processes.g2009 Apr. 30, v. 23, no. 9 p.1369-1375dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7261 7aarticle02716naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245009700134300001600231500002400247520161800271650001801889650001301907650002201920650002001942650001001962650001301972650001401985650001101999650001602010650001402026650001402040650001302054650003702067700002002104700002502124700002402149700002302173773011302196852000902309655001202318IND4417337120221116141546.0090306e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441733712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernroitner, Margit10aOccurrence, phylogeny, structure, and function of catalases and peroxidases in cyanobacteria  ap. 421-438.  aIncludes references  aCyanobacteria have evolved ~3x10⁹ years ago from ancient phototrophic microorganisms that already lived on our planet Earth. By opening the era of an aerobic, oxygen-containing biosphere, they are the true pacemakers of geological and biological evolution. Cyanobacteria must have been among the first organisms to elaborate mechanisms for the detoxification of partially reduced oxygen species including (hydrogen) peroxide. Since there is still an suprising lack of knowledge on the type, role, and mechanism(s) of peroxide-degrading enzymes in these bacteria, all 44 fully or partially sequenced genomes for haem and non-haem catalases and peroxidases have been critically analysed based on well known structure-function relationships of the corresponding oxidoreductases. It is demonstrated that H₂O₂-dismutating enzymes are mainly represented by bifunctional (haem) catalase-peroxidases and (binuclear) manganese catalases, with the latter being almost exclusively found in diazotrophic species. Several strains even lack a gene that encodes an enzyme with catalase activity. Two groups of peroxidases are found. Genes encoding putative (primordial) haem peroxidases (with homology to corresponding mammalian enzymes) and vanadium-containing iodoperoxidases are found only in a few species, whereas genes encoding peroxiredoxins (1-Cys, 2-Cys, type II, and Q-type) are ubiquitous in cyanobacteria. In addition, ~70% contain NADPH-dependent glutathione peroxidase-like proteins. The occurrence and phylogeny of these enzymes is discussed, as well as the present knowledge of their physiological role(s). 3aCyanobacteria 3abacteria 3abiological clocks 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahydrogen 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3aperoxidases 3aperoxides 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3astructure-activity relationships1 aZamocky, Marcel1 aFurtmüller, Paul G.1 aPeschek, Günter A.1 aObinger, Christian0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 Feb., v. 60, no. 2 p.421-438dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245005600197300001600253500002400269520091200293650001701205650001201222650001901234650002001253650001201273650002101285650001001306650001001316650001201326650001101338650000901349650003701358650001701395650002301412650002701435650002801462650003601490700001901526700002301545773010101568852000901669856005501678655001201733IND4378356820221116141610.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437835682DNAL7 a164997062pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02808.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittingham, Linda A.10aRepeatability of extra-pair mating in tree swallows  ap. 841-849.  aIncludes references  aModels of sexual selection assume that female mating preferences are heritable and, thus, repeatable for individual females across multiple mating episodes. Previous studies of the repeatability of female preference have examined individuals in captivity and focused presumably on social mate choice. However, extra-pair mating is widespread and can also influence sexual selection. We examined the repeatability of extra-pair mating in a wild population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) by experimentally inducing females to lay two clutches in rapid succession within the same season. We found that the proportion of extra-pair young and the number of extra-pair sires were highly repeatable for individual females. However, the repeatability of specific extra-pair sires was low. We suggest that this unusual pattern of mating may be due to females maximizing the heterozygosity of their offspring. 3aHirundinidae 3afemales 3aheterozygosity 3amating behavior 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3asires 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aReproduction 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSwallowsxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aDunn, Peter O.1 aStapleton, Mary K.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.841-849dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02808.x 7aarticle03396naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245013400171300001800305500002400323500001500347520154300362650002201905650001401927650001301941650001201954650000901966650001401975650001801989650001002007650001402017650001702031650002502048650000902073650001302082650001302095650001302108650002602121650002202147650001502169650003802184650001602222650003302238650004202271650005102313650001702364650004902381653001002430700001702440700001602457700001802473700001502491700001302506700001702519700001902536773011602555852000902671856007802680655001202758IND4398681120221116141524.0071209e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439868112DNAL7 a180570472pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm2312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jing10aShort, direct repeats (SDRs)-mediated post-transcriptional processing of a transcription factor gene OsVP1 in rice (Oryza sativa)  ap. 3811-3817.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe various degrees of preharvest sprouting occurring in hybrid rice is a limiting factor in the propagation and production of hybrid rice seeds. The phenotype of sprouted rice is very similar to that of the maize (Zea mays) seed-specific mutation viviparous 1. VP1 has been shown to be a transcription factor essential for seed maturation and dormancy induction. In this study, numerous truncated transcripts of OsVP1 resulting from an unusual post-transcriptional processing, were detected in four rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars. The observed events took place at a region spanning exons 1 to 5, and led to a variety of deletions that resulted in the loss of functional domain and frame-shifts with premature termination by introducing a stop codon. Various proportions of the transcripts expressed in both immature and mature embryos were observed to be incorrectly processed and associated with the genetic variation of preharvest sprouting rates among various rice varieties. In sprouting-susceptible rice cultivars, G46B and HeiB, many more incorrectly processed OsVP1 transcripts were expressed in immature than in mature embryos, indicating that the unusual post-transcriptional processing of the OsVP1 gene was developmentally regulated. In addition, comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated the presence of paired short direct repeats (SDRs) at the junctions of the unusual excision sites in exons of OsVP1 gene. Site selection for the deletion of exon materials was altered along with the genotypes and developmental stages. 3asequence analysis 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3arice 3aphenotype 3aseed dormancy 3aseeds 3asprouting 3aOryza sativa 3adevelopmental stages 3acorn 3amutation 3aexcision 3agenotype 3atranscription factors 3agenetic variation 3astop codon 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGermination 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptionalxgenetics 2aTime Factors 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenes1 aNiu, Xiangli1 aWang, Yuguo1 aRen, Guangjun1 aZhuo, Ting1 aYang, Yi1 aLu, Bao-Rong1 aLiu, Yongsheng0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Oct., v. 58, no. 13 p.3811-3817dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm2313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02126naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245008900169300001600258500002400274520129100298650001401589650001401603650001201617650001101629650001101640773013101651852000901782856005701791655001201848IND4460578820221116141221.0110729e197210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446057882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1972.tb02279.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPAGE, C.N.13aAn interpretation of the morphology and evolution of the cone and shoot of Equisetum  ap. 359-397.  aIncludes references  aEvidence is presented from new observations in morphological, anatomical and numerical fields which supports the view that in Equisetum the units of which the vegetative and fertile axes are composed are serially homologous throughout the shoot. Though greatly different in their modern morphology, these differences can be accounted for by the evolutionary specialization of each from a once common type of unit. The structure of the primitive unit is most closely approached today by that of the fertile axis of Equisetum, especially in the construction of its vascular system. A relationship also exists between the appendages borne from the units of each of the two axes--the leaves and sporangiophores. The evidence, however, fails to support the widely held notion that sporangiophore and leaf are wholly homologous. Instead, only part of the Equisetum sporangiophore (the stalk plus the upper half of its peltate head) is homologous with the modern leaf. Based on this interpretation, a new schematic sequence of evolutionary stages is simultaneously proposed for both the axes and appendages of the type seen in Equisetum. Evidence from the fossil record, as well as from the structure of living Equisetum, is cited in support of the outline of evolutionary morphology proposed. 3aEquisetum 3aevolution 3afossils 3aleaves 3ashoots0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1972 Oct., v. 65, no. 4 p.359-397dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw38588x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1972.tb02279.x 7aarticle02483naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011300178300001600291500002400307520118000331650002501511650001801536650001701554650001001571650001301581650001201594650005101606650001201657650001201669650001301681650001401694650002001708650001101728650003701739650001401776700002201790700002101812700002001833700002301853773009701876852000901973856005501982655001202037IND4384105220221116141324.0061007e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438410522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02863.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaiwongsar, Suraphon14aThe protein kinase genes MAP3K ε 1 and MAP3K ε 2 are required for pollen viability in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 193-205.  aIncludes references  aWe have used reverse-genetic analysis to investigate the function of MAP3K ε 1 and MAP3K ε 2, a pair of closely related Arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode protein kinases. Plants homozygous for either map3k ε 1 or map3k ε 2 displayed no apparent mutant phenotype, whereas the double-mutant combination caused pollen lethality. Transmission of the double-mutant combination through the female gametophyte was normal. Tetrad analysis performed using the Arabidopsis quartet mutation demonstrated that the pollen-lethal phenotype segregated at meiosis with the map3k ε 1;map3k ε 2 genotype. We used transmission electron microscopy to determine that double-mutant pollen grains develop plasma membrane irregularities following pollen mitosis I. Analysis of the subcellular localization of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP):MAP3Kε1 fusion protein using confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation indicated that a substantial portion of the MAP3Kε1 present in Arabidopsis cells is localized to the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results suggest that MAP3Kε1 is required for the normal functioning of the plasma membrane in developing Arabidopsis pollen. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3afractionation 3agametophytes 3agenes 3agenotype 3ameiosis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3amitosis 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3apollen 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviability1 aOtegui, Marisa S.1 aJester, Peter J.1 aMonson, Sean S.1 aKrysan, Patrick J.0 tplant journal.g2006 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.193-205dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02863.x 7aarticle03610naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002000167245011500187300001800302500002400320520210200344650003302446650001802479650001102497650001502508650002602523650001702549650002402566650001102590650002002601650001202621650001102633650001902644650001102663650002102674650002002695650001902715650001902734650001902753651001002772700001902782700001502801773009702816852000902913856008902922930003303011945002503044946001103069655001203080IND4421664820221116141436.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aH0001 aWang, Quan-Ying10aMicrobial and enzyme properties of apple orchard soil as affected by long-term application of copper fungicide  ap. 1504-1509.  aIncludes references  aCopper-based fungicides have been applied in apple orchards for a long time, which has resulted in increasing soil Cu concentration. However, the microbial and enzyme properties of the orchard soils remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term application of Cu-based fungicides on soil microbial (microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), C mineralization, and specific respiration rate) and enzyme (urease, acid phosphatase, and invertase activities) properties in apple orchards. Soil samples studied were collected from apple orchards 5, 15, 20, 30, and 45 years old, and one adjacent forest soil as for reference. The mean Cu concentrations of orchard soils significantly increased with increasing orchard ages ranging from 21.8 to 141 mg kg-1, and the CaCl2-extractable soil Cu concentrations varied from 0.00 to 4.26 mg kg-1. The soil mean Cmic values varied from 43.6 to 116 mg kg-1 in the orchard soils, and were lower than the value of the reference soil (144 mg kg-1). The ratio of soil Cmic to total organic C (Corg) increased from 8.10 to 18.3 mg Cmic g-1 Corg with decreasing orchard ages, and was 26.1 mg Cmic g-1 Corg for the reference soil. A significant correlation was observed between total- or CaCl2-extractable soil Cu and soil Cmic or Cmic/Corg, suggesting that the soil Cu was responsible for the significant reductions in Cmic and Cmic/Corg. The three enzyme activity assays also showed the similar phenomena, and declined with the increasing orchard ages. The mean soil C mineralization rates were elevated from 110 to 150 mg CO2-C kg-1 soil d-1 compared with the reference soil (80 mg CO2-C kg-1 soil d-1), and the mean specific respiration rate of the reference soil (0.63 mg CO2-C mg-1 biomass C d-1) was significantly smaller than the orchard soils from 1.19 to 3.55 mg CO2-C mg-1 biomass C d-1. The soil C mineralization rate and the specific respiration rate can be well explained by the CaCl2-extractable soil Cu. Thus, the long-term application of copper-based fungicides has shown adverse effects on soil microbial and enzyme properties. 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aorchard soils 3acopper 3afungicides 3apesticide application 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3aapples 3aMalus domestica 3abiomass 3acarbon 3amineralization 3aurease 3aacid phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3acarbon dioxide 3aagroecosystems 3asoil pollution 3aChina1 aZhou, Dong-Mei1 aCang, Long0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2009 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1504-1509dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03509naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011300144300001600257520161800273650001601891650002001907650001401927650002601941650003501967650001302002650001202015650001002027650002302037650002202060650001102082650002302093650000902116650002402125650001202149650002502161650003302186650003402219650002202253650003102275650002502306650004002331650003002371650002402401650002602425650000902451650000902460650001702469653002402486653002302510653001602533700002002549700002002569700002102589700001702610700001602627700001702643773010902660852000902769930003302778945001302811946001102824655001202835IND2045474920221116141241.0950407s1994    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204547492DNAL7 a79604932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisbona, F.10aEffects of type of dietary fat and cholecalciferol on magnesium absorption in rats with intestinal resection  ap. 135-143.  aWe studied the effect of type of dietary fat and supplementation with cholecalciferol on magnesium absorption in the duodenum, jejunum and proximal colon in rats with resection of 50% of the distal small intestine. Magnesium transport against the concentration gradient was found to occur in all three intestinal segments, although transport increased significantly only in the proximal colon of intestinally resected rats fed a diet supplemented with cholecalciferol at a rate of 0.425 mg/kg diet and mixture of equal parts of medium chain triglycerides, sunflower oil and olive oil as the source of dietary fat (diet B), in comparison with magnesium absorption in control rats subjected to intestinal transection and fed diet B, and in resected rats fed a diet without cholecalciferol supplementation and in which olive oil was the sole source of dietary fat (diet A). Magnesium absorption due to active and passive transport together, was greater in resected than in transected rats in all three intestinal segments, although the difference was significant only in the jejunum (the segment closest to the anastomosis), because of the greater increase in mucosal mass in resected animals. When the three intestinal segments were compared, magnesium absorption in favour of and against the concentration gradient in the proximal colon was significantly greater than in the duodenum or the jejunum, in resected and transected animals fed diet A or diet B. These findings show that the colon is the segment that most efficiently absorbs magnesium in rats with intestinal resection, especially when diet B is given. 3adietary fat 3acholecalciferol 3amagnesium 3aintestinal absorption 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aduodenum 3ajejunum 3acolon 3aexperimental diets 3aintestinal mucosa 3aweight 3anutrient transport 3arats 3adietary supplements 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aBiological Transport, Active 2aCholecalciferolxpharmacology 2aColonxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIntestine, Smallxsurgery 2aJejunumxmetabolism 2aMagnesiumxmetabolism 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0aintestine resection 0amineral absorption 0atransection1 aAlferez, M.J.M.1 aBarrionuevo, M.1 aLopez-Aliaga, I.1 aPallares, I.1 aHartiti, S.1 aCampos, M.S.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1994, v. 64, no. 2 p.135-143x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02905naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014300144300001400287500001500301520092400316650001201240650001001252650000801262650001601270650001001286650001201296650001301308650001301321650001501334650002501349650001301374650002401387650002001411650001401431650002501445650000901470650002201479650007701501650003201578650006301610650001901673650004701692650002001739650001101759650001101770650000901781650004401790650004701834650001701881650005901898653001601957653001901973653001401992700001702006700001602023700001902039773010702058852000902165930003302174945001302207946001102220655001202231IND2164207120221116141343.0980922s1998    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216420712DNAL7 a95030462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheiler, R.10aElevated PTH levels in hypovitaminosis D are more rapidly suppressed by the administration of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 than by vitamin D3  ap. 36-41.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To assess markers of bone metabolism in two groups of inpatients with hypovitaminosis D and elevated PTH levels receiving two different vitamin D medications.

Conclusion: The use of both forms of vitamin D supplementation appears to be useful for patients with hypovitaminosis D, elevated PTH levels and high telopeptide excretion. 3aelderly 3aurine 3amen 3ablood serum 3awomen 3acalcium 3apeptides 3acollagen 3acalcitriol 3avitamin deficiencies 3apatients 3adietary supplements 3acholecalciferol 3aexcretion 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCalcitriolxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aCalciumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aCohort Studies 2aCollagenxdrug effectsxmetabolismxurine. 2aCollagen Type I 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aParathyroid Hormonexbloodxmetabolism. 2aPeptidesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxurine. 2aTime Factors 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxbloodxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 0aparathyroid 0an-telopeptides 0avitamin D1 aBischoff, H.1 aTyndall, A.1 aStahelin, H.B.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1998, v. 68, no. 1 p.36-41x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03251naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245017700145300001600322520155100338650001501889650002401904650001601928650002401944650002601968650001701994650001802011650002102029650001002050650000802060650002302068650001302091650001502104650002502119650001002144650004102154650003102195650001102226650001102237650002802248650003202276650000902308650001602317650008902333650003502422653001402457700001902471700002002490773010902510852000902619930003302628945001302661946001102674655001202685IND2058141820221116141313.0970701s1996    sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205814182DNAL7 a88439912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZempleni, J.14aThe identification and kinetics of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin (7-hydroxymethylriboflavin) in blood plasma from humans following oral administration of riboflavin supplements  ap. 151-157.  aFollowing the administration of different oral (20, 40, 60mg) and intravenous (11.6 mg) doses of riboflavin to healthy humans and female patients with liver cirrhosis (oral 40-mg dose), 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin (7-hydroxymethylriboflavin) was identified in blood plasma by fluorescence after high-performance liquid and thin-layer chromatographies, and by its absorbance spectrum. The apparent first-order absorption rate constant of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin was 1.2 per hour in healthy subjects. Plasma peak concentrations of 40nmol/l in males and 20nmol/l in females (p<0.01) were achieved within two hours. Peak concentrations and areas under the plasma curves (smaller in females, p < 0.01) of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin were 5 to 16% of those observed for riboflavin. Healthy females showed an approximately 2.5-foldfaster disposition of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin from plasma than males (p<0.01). Correction of peak concentrations and areas under the plasma curves by the rate constants of disposition led to the finding of approximately equal amounts of 70 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin released into plasma by both sexes (p > 0.05). No significant influence of different oral riboflavin doses on 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin kinetics was found (p > 0.05). Liver cirrhosis had no significant effect on the amount of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin released into blood plasma (p > 0.05). However, the failure to detect this metabolite following intravenous riboflavin administration indicates a substantial influence of gastrointestinal- or liver-passage. 3ariboflavin 3avitamin supplements 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3aintravenous injection 3ablood plasma 3adose response 3apharmacokinetics 3awomen 3amen 3agender differences 3apatients 2aAbsorption 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aLiver Cirrhosisxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRiboflavinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0acirrhosis1 aGalloway, J.R.1 aMcCormick, D.B.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1996, v. 66, no. 2 p.151-157x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03539naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002400158245012100182300001800303500002400321500001500345520215600360650002702516650001902543650001802562650002402580650002702604650001602631650001702647650001202664650001202676650002302688650002702711650001802738651001902756653002402775700001802799773009702817852000902914856008902923930003303012945002503045946001103070655001203081IND4421662920221116141501.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aAciego Pietri, J.C.10aSubstrate inputs and pH as factors controlling microbial biomass, activity and community structure in an arable soil  ap. 1396-1405.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOur aim was to determine whether the smaller biomasses generally found in low pH compared to high pH arable soils under similar management are due principally to the decreased inputs of substrate or whether some factor(s) associated with pH are also important. This was tested in a soil incubation experiment using wheat straw as substrate and soils of different pHs (8.09, 6.61, 4.65 and 4.17). Microbial biomass ninhydrin-N, and microbial community structure evaluated by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), were measured at 0 (control soil only), 5, 25 and 50 days and CO2 evolution up to 100 days. Straw addition increased biomass ninhydrin-N, CO2 evolution and total PLFA concentrations at all soil pH values. The positive effect of straw addition on biomass ninhydrin-N was less in soils of pH 4.17 and 4.65. Similarly total PLFA concentrations were smallest at the lowest pH. This indicated that there is a direct pH effect as well as effects related to different substrate availabilities on microbial biomass and community structure. In the control soils, the fatty acids 16:1ω5, 16:1ω7c, 18:1ω7c&9t and i17:0 had significant and positive linear relationships with soil pH. In contrast, the fatty acids i15:0, a15:0, i16:0 and br17:0, 16:02OH, 18:2ω6,9, 17:0, 19:0, 17:0c9,10 and 19:0c9,10 were greatest in control soils at the lowest pHs. In soils given straw, the fatty acids 16:1ω5, 16:1ω7c, 15:0 and 18:0 had significant and positive linear relationships with pH, but the concentration of the monounsaturated 18:1ω9 PLFA decreased at the highest pHs. The PLFA profiles indicative of Gram-positive bacteria were more abundant than Gram-negative ones at the lowest pH in control soils, but in soils given straw these trends were reversed. In contrast, straw addition changed the microbial community structures least at pH 6.61. The ratio: [fungal PLFA 18:2w6,9]/[total PLFAs indicative of bacteria] indicated that fungal PLFAs were more dominant in the microbial communities of the lowest pH soil. In summary, this work shows that soil pH has marked effects on microbial biomass, community structure, and response to substrate addition. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3afatty acid composition 3awheat straw 3aarable soils 3asoil pH 3abiomass 3amicrobial activity 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aphospholipids 3aUnited Kingdom 0asoil microorganisms1 aBrookes, P.C.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2009 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1396-1405dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090811b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04016naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245016600185300001800351500002400369500001500393520229900408650002902707650001502736650001902751650002402770650001502794650001902809650002002828650001702848650002502865650002902890650001902919650001202938650001502950650001702965650002002982650001903002650002503021651001103046653002403057653002403081653001903105700001903124700001803143700001303161773009703174852000903271856008903280930003303369945002503402946001103427655001203438IND4421663220221116141447.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ5001 aYao, Huaiying10aInteractions between N fertilization, grass clipping addition and pH in turf ecosystems: Implications for soil enzyme activities and organic matter decomposition  ap. 1425-1432.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTurf has been acknowledged as an important ecosystem with potential for soil C sequestration. As a major process dictating soil C storage, organic matter decomposition has received little attention in turf systems. Given that soil enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions are the rate limiting steps of organic matter decomposition, we examined the activities of oxidative and hydrolytic soil enzymes and their relations with soluble organic compounds and soil C and N mineralization in two turf chronosequences with contrasting soil pH and in response to N fertilization and grass clipping addition. In comparison with turf ecosystems under acidic soil, phenol oxidase activity was about two-fold greater in turf ecosystems under alkaline soil and positively correlated to about two-fold differences in soluble phenolics and dissolved organic C between alkaline and acidic soils. However, the activities of hydrolytic enzymes including cellulase, chitinase, and glucosidase were lower in alkaline soil. It appears that the high concentration of soluble phenolics inhibited the activities of hydrolytic enzymes that in turn limited the decomposition of dissolved organic C and resulted in its accumulation in alkaline soil. Nitrogen mineralization was comparable between alkaline and acidic soils, but CO2 evolution was about two-fold greater in alkaline soil, possibly due to considerable abiotic carbonate dissolution. We observed that mineral N input at 60 mg N kg-1 soil had very minor negative effects on the activities of both phenol oxidase and hydrolytic enzymes. Grass clipping addition did not affect the activity of phenol oxidase, but increased the activities of soil chitinase, cellulase, glucosidase, and glucosaminidase by up to 20% and also soluble phenolics in soil by about 10%. Our results suggest that soil phenol oxidase might regulate the activities of hydrolytic soil enzymes via its control on soluble phenolics and function as an 'enzymatic latch' to hold soil organic C in highly managed turf ecosystems. While soil pH is important to affect phenol oxidase activity and therefore decomposition, management practices, i.e., N fertilization and grass clipping addition may indirectly affect the decomposition through enhancing turfgrass productivity and thus soil C input. 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3acarbonates 3amineralization 3asoil organic carbon 3aacid soils 3alawns and turf 3aturf management 3asoil enzymes 3acarbon sequestration 3adissolved organic carbon 3abiodegradation 3asoil pH 3aecosystems 3aturf grasses 3aenzyme activity 3aalkaline soils 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNevada 0amineral fertilizers 0asoil organic matter 0agrass clipping1 aBowman, Daniel1 aRufty, Thomas1 aShi, Wei0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2009 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1425-1432dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20090811b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245009000185300001800275500002400293520200200317650001602319650002002335650002402355650001902379650002102398650001302419650001202432650002402444650001202468650002202480650001502502650002602517650002702543651002002570700001802590773009702608852000902705856008902714930003302803945002502836946001102861655001202872IND4421664320221116141531.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ7001 aDuong, T.T.T.10aFrequent addition of wheat straw residues to soil enhances carbon mineralization rate  ap. 1475-1482.  aIncludes references  aIn many ecosystems, residues are added frequently to soil, in the form of root turnover and litter fall. However, in most studies on residue decomposition, residues are added once and there are few studies that have investigated the effect of frequent residue addition on C mineralization and N dynamics. To close this knowledge gap, we mixed mature wheat residue (C/N 122) into soil at a total rate of 2% w/w once at the start (R1x), every 16 days (R4x), every 8 days (R8x) or every 4 days (R16x). Un-amended soil served as control. All treatments were mixed every 4 days. Soil respiration was measured continuously over the 80-day incubation. Inorganic N, K2SO4-extractable C and N, chloroform-labile C and N (as an estimate of microbial biomass C and N), soil pH and microbial community composition were assessed every 16 days. Increasing frequency of residue addition increased C mineralization per g residue. Compared to R1x, cumulative respiration per g residue at the end of the incubation (day 80) was increased by 57, 82 and 92% in R4x, R8x and R16x, respectively. The largest differences in soil respiration per g residue occurred in the first 30 days. Despite large increases in cumulative respiration, frequent residue addition did not affect inorganic N or K2SO4-extractable N concentrations, chloroform-labile C and N or soil pH. Compared to the control, all residue treatments resulted in increases in chloroform-labile C and N and soil pH but decreased inorganic and K2SO4-extractable N. Microbial community composition was affected by residue addition, however there were no consistent differences among residue treatments. It is concluded that experiments with single residue additions may underestimate residue decomposition rates in the field. The increased C mineralization caused by frequent residue additions does not appear to be due to an increased microbial biomass or changes in microbial community composition, but rather to increased C mineralization per unit biomass. 3awheat straw 3asoil amendments 3asoil organic carbon 3amineralization 3asoil respiration 3anitrogen 3abiomass 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pH 3apotassium sulfate 3aextraction 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aimmobilization in soil 3aSouth Australia1 aMarschner, P.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2009 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1475-1482dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090811b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002400167245012400191300001800315500002400333500001500357520122400372650001501596650002201611650001801633650001201651650003001663650001901693650003001712650003301742650001501775650002701790650002701817650002201844650002401866651001001890653002401900653002401924700003401948700002501982773009702007852000902104856008902113930003302202945002502235946001102260655001202271IND4421664120221116141507.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF8311 aSavazzini, Federica10aImpact of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma atroviride SC1 on soil microbial communities of a vineyard in northern Italy  ap. 1457-1465.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe fungus Trichoderma atroviride SC1 is an experimental biocontrol agent (BCA) that is active against the fungus Armillaria mellea. Following the application of Trichoderma to the surface soil of a vineyard, we used a highly specific real-time PCR, previously validated for the analysis of soil microcosms, to monitor the populations of this fungus at different soil depths over several months. The quantification obtained using this molecular method was highly correlated with laboratory assays of colony-forming units. The native communities of bacteria and fungi in the soil were analyzed using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), and transient changes were observed following the application of T. atroviride SC1 conidia. A principal component of variance analysis demonstrated that the introduction of T. atroviride SC1 had an effect on the soil microflora during the first two weeks following inoculation. However, at later dates, environmental conditions had a higher influence on the surveyed communities than the BCA application, as confirmed through the use of the Shannon index of biodiversity. Soil depth had a strong influence on the composition and biodiversity of fungal communities. 3asoil fungi 3aArmillaria mellea 3asoil bacteria 3aconidia 3abiological control agents 3avineyard soils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil depth 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aTrichoderma atroviride 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation dynamics 3aItaly 0aHypocrea atroviride 0asoil microorganisms1 aLonga, Claudia Maria Oliveira1 aPertot, I.q(Ilaria)0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2009 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1457-1465dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.03.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090811b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02810naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002500137245009500162300001800257500002400275500001500299520155500314650001801869650001701887650001301904650001501917650001901932650004301951650001701994650002602011650002802037650001102065650001402076650003902090650001402129650001102143650002302154653001902177773010602196852000902302856007702311655001202388IND4471365020221116141506.0130827s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447136502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf030005q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Charles R.10aAlkylperoxyl Radical Scavenging Activity of Red Leaf Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) Phenolics  ap. 4589-4595.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAlthough lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA > DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the dietary benefits of leaf lettuce. 3aleaf extracts 3aleaf lettuce 3acyanidin 3aabsorbance 3aLactuca sativa 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3aenvironmental factors 3afree radical scavengers 3aesters 3aoxidation 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aquercetin 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 0aphytochemicals0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 July 30, v. 51, no. 16 p.4589-4595x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf030005q3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245014700153300001600300500002400316520154000340650001301880650001301893650002001906650001201926650001101938650000901949650001301958650001201971650001101983650001601994650001602010650001302026651001602039700002002055700002102075700001702096700001802113700001902131773008802150852000902238856003802247655001202285IND4416555720221116141516.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441655572DNAL7 a10.1071/WR060742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewman, Jamie10aEstimates of productivity and detection probabilities of breeding attempts in the sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), a burrow-nesting petrel  ap. 159-168.  aIncludes references  aMonitoring of breeding success in burrow-nesting seabirds is problematic, owing to the difficulties of detecting occupants in complex burrow systems. We summarise 6 years of monitoring the breeding success of sooty shearwater (tītī, muttonbird, Puffinus griseus) on two southern New Zealand islands, The Snares and Whenua Hou, with a portable infrared camera system. Breeding attempts were monitored three times during the breeding season, i.e. egg laying, hatching and fledging. Overall breeding success was calculated in two stages. First, we estimated breeding success for each island-site-year combination with a model that allowed for imperfect detection of an egg or chick and accounted for the proportion of the breeding season that was covered by monitoring. The resulting estimates for each island were then analysed with a linear model, to provide a single estimate for that island. Breeding success was found to be highly variable and non-synchronous between islands, with the average proportion of eggs successfully fledging on The Snares (0.35, 0.20-0.52; mean and 95% creditable interval) being considerably lower and more variable than that on Whenua Hou (0.76, 0.70-0.82). Probability of detecting a breeding attempt was higher on The Snares whereas correcting for the proportion of the season monitored had a variable effect, reducing The Snares and Whenua Hou estimates by 27% and 7% respectively. The implications of these findings with respect to the demographic modelling of burrow-nesting species are discussed. 3aPuffinus 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aburrows 3achicks 3aeggs 3ahatching 3aislands 3amodels 3aoviposition 3aprobability 3aseabirds 3aNew Zealand1 aFletcher, David1 aMøller, Henrik.1 aBragg, Corey1 aScott, Darren1 aMcKechnie, Sam0 tWildlife research.g2009, v. 36, no. 2 p.159-168dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR06074 7aarticle02307naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245008300180300001600263500002400279520116100303650002001464650002001484650001701504650000901521650003001530650001201560650002601572650003301598650001101631650002001642650001901662650002001681650002501701651001301726773012101739852000901860856004001869655001201909IND4461188420221116141458.0110805e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446118842DNAL7 a207178982pmid7 a10.1002/zoo.203382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashaw, Meredith J.10aConsistency of captive giraffe behavior under two different management regimes  ap. 371-378.  aIncludes references  aLong-term animal behavior studies are sometimes conducted at a single site, leading to questions about whether effects are limited to animals in the same environment. Our ability to make general conclusions about behavior is improved when we can identify behaviors that are consistent across a range of environments. To extend Veasey and colleagues' ([1996b] Anim Welf 5:139-153) study, I compared not only activity budgets but also social behavior of an all-female group of giraffe at The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore (MZiB) to those previously observed in breeding groups at The San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park (SDZWAP; Bashaw et al. [2007] J Comp Psychol 121:46-53). Morning activity budgets and the maintenance of social relationships were consistent across groups. MZiB female giraffe interacted more frequently and the identity of animals that formed the strongest relationships was less predictable than at SDZWAP. Results support earlier findings that captive giraffe maintain social relationships and suggest that studies of giraffe social relationships and activity are generalizable across a range of captive conditions.

Sodium ‘exclusion' is a major physiological mechanism for salt tolerance in a wheat-tall wheatgrass amphiploid, and a large proportion (~50%) for reduced Na⁺ accumulation in the flag leaf, as compared to wheat, was earlier shown to be contributed by genetic effects from substitution of chromosome 3E from tall wheatgrass for wheat chromosomes 3A and 3D. Homoeologous recombination between 3E and wheat chromosomes 3A and 3D was induced using the ph1b mutant, and putative recombinants were identified as having SSR markers specific for tall wheatgrass loci. As many as 14 recombinants with smaller segments of tall wheatgrass chromatin were identified and low-resolution breakpoint analysis was achieved using wheat SSR loci. Seven recombinants were identified to have leaf Na⁺ concentrations similar to those in 3E(3A) or 3E(3D) substitution lines, when grown in 200 mM NaCl in nutrient solution. Phenotypic analysis identified recombinants with introgressions at the distal end on the long arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes being responsible for Na⁺ ‘exclusion'. A total of 55 wheat SSR markers mapped to the long arm of homoeologous group 3 markers by genetic and deletion bin mapping were used for high resolution of wheat-tall wheatgrass chromosomal breakpoints in selected recombinants. Molecular marker analysis and genomic in situ hybridisation confirmed the 524-568 recombinant line as containing the smallest introgression of tall wheatgrass chromatin on the distal end of the long arm of wheat chromosome 3A and identified this line as suitable for developing wheat germplasm with Na⁺ ‘exclusion'. 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3achromatin 3achromosome substitution 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ain situ hybridization 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anutrient solutions 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asubstitution lines 3awheat 3awild relatives 2aChromatinxgenetics 2aChromosome Breakpoints 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxmetabolism 2aGene Deletion 2aGenetic Markers 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aKaryotyping 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSalinity 2aSodiumxphysiology 2aTriticumxgenetics1 aMirzaghaderi, Ghader1 aWalker, Esther1 aColmer, Timothy D.1 aFrancki, Michael G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2009 Nov., v. 119, no. 7 p.1313-1323dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-009-1136-9 7aarticle04147naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004600133040001800179072000900197072000900206100002200215245008900237300001400326500002400340500001500364506007600379520164100455506003702096650002202133650001802155650002202173650001102195650001602206650002302222650002002245650001402265650001402279650002002293650002202313650001502335650001802350650001602368650001202384650002702396650003602423650001402459650004502473650004202518650001102560650003902571650002002610650002202630650002002652650003202672650000902704650001402713650003302727650002902760650005202789650002702841650002402868650004302892650002902935653001502964653003802979700001703017700002403034773010703058852000903165856009603174930003303270945002503303946001303328655001203341IND4421415120221207064920.0090605e20090701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141512DNAL7 a193244012pmid7 aPMC26927562pmcid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL2001 aWalker, Angela M.10aExpression of bovine interferon-tau variants according to sex and age of conceptuses  ap. 44-53.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterferon-tau (IFNT), which plays a major role in maternal recognition of pregnancy in cattle, is transcribed from multiple genes. Moreover, there are at least 12 cDNA variants, many presumably allelic. Although the IFNT locus is autosomal, Day 8 female blastocysts produced approximately twice as much antiviral activity as males. The questions addressed here are whether male and female blastocysts differed in the kind and number of IFNT they expressed, and whether this pattern changed over development. Day 8, in vitro-produced blastocysts were bisected, and one half of each was sexed by PCR. Demi-embryos (n=64) were grouped according to whether they were male or female, to provide two pools of each sex. Individual cDNA were sequenced after RT-PCR amplification and shot-gun cloning to provide comparisons between male and female blastocysts, elongating conceptuses of various developmental ages (Days 14-19), and a female trophoblast cell line (CT-1). A total of 376 cDNA clones were sequenced. Six additional cDNA were identified, in addition to the forms described earlier. There were no differences between male and female blastocysts (P=0.54), and between blastocysts and a trophoblast model system (CT-1 cells; P=0.24) in the IFNT transcripts expressed, indicating that sexual dimorphism wass not correlated with particular IFNT variants. There were differences in variant frequencies (P<0.001) among conceptuses of different age, although two, representing boIFN1a and boIFN3c, predominated throughout development.

To date, however, no information is available on the persistence of protozoan communities in these environments across consecutive rearing cycles and how it is affected by farm- and habitat-specific characteristics and management strategies. We therefore investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of free-living protozoa in three habitats (pipeline, water, and miscellaneous samples) in three commercial poultry houses across three rearing cycles by using the molecular fingerprinting technique denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our study provides strong evidence for the long-term (ca. 6-month) persistence of protozoa in broiler houses across consecutive rearing cycles. Various free-living protozoa (flagellates, ciliates, and amoebae), including known vectors of bacterial pathogens, were observed during the down periods in between rearing cycles. In addition, multivariate analysis and variation partitioning showed that the protozoan community structure in the broiler houses showed almost no change across rearing cycles and remained highly habitat and farm specific. Unlike in natural environments, protozoan communities inside broiler houses are therefore not seasonal. Our results imply that currently used biosecurity measures (cleaning and disinfection) applied during the down periods are not effective against many protozoans and therefore cannot prevent potential cross-contamination of bacterial pathogens via free-living protozoa between rearing cycles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmoeba 3aCiliophora 3abiosecurity 3acleaning 3acommunity structure 3across contamination 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adisinfection 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ahabitats 3amultivariate analysis 3apathogens 3apipelines 3apoultry 3apoultry housing 3arearing1 aHouf, Kurt1 aVerstraete, Tine1 aVaerewijck, Mario1 aSabbe, Koen0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.1763-1769dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01756-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03653naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002900184245012900213300001800342500002400360500001500384520219300399650001402592650002002606650002002626650002902646650001902675650002402694650001502718650001602733650001502749650002102764651001902785653001502804700002102819700002102840700002502861773010702886852000902993856008803002930003303090945002503123946001103148655001203159IND4421410620221116141348.0090605e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aM001 0aM310 0aX3301 aSemeniuk, Christina A.D.10aHematological differences between stingrays at tourist and non-visited sites suggest physiological costs of wildlife tourism  ap. 1818-1829.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWildlife tourism alters the environmental conditions in which the focal animal lives, and it is therefore necessary to assess the ability of the animal to adjust to and persist in these novel conditions if the industry is to be sustainable. Here, we report on the physiological responses of southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) which are the focus of intense marine provisioning-tourism in the Cayman Islands. Using stingrays from non-tourist sites about Grand Cayman as a basis for comparison, we show in this natural experiment that tourist-exposed stingrays exhibit hematological changes indicative of physiological costs of wildlife tourism. The novel conditions with which the stingrays must interact include non-natural food, higher injury rates (from boats, conspecifics and predators), and higher parasite loads (from crowding conditions). As a result of this year-round environment, stingrays display sub-optimal health: lower hematocrit, total serum protein concentrations, and oxidative stress (i.e., lower total antioxidant capacity combined with higher total oxidative status). Moreover, they show evidence of attenuation of the defense system: for tourist stingrays only, animals possessing both injuries and high parasite loads also exhibit lowest leukocrit, serum proteins and antioxidant potential, as well as differing proportions of differential leukocytes indicative of suppression (lymphocytes and heterophils) and down-regulation (eosinophils), thus suggesting that the physiological changes of tourist stingrays are in partial response to these stressors. While survival- and reproduction- quantification was not possible in this long-lived marine species, the physiological measures -situated within ecological context, indicate that the long-term health and survival of tourist stingrays have a significant probability of being affected. Consequently, management of the tourism attraction is essential. The indicators chosen in this study reflect general health indices and defense capabilities used across taxa, and represent a tradeoff between ease of collection/analysis and interpretation so that managers can continue the research for monitoring purposes. 3aparasites 3aMyliobatiformes 3aanimal injuries 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ablood proteins 3awildlife management 3ahematocrit 3aeosinophils 3aecotourism 3aoxidative stress 3aCayman Islands 0aleukocytes1 aBourgeon, Sophie1 aSmith, Sylvia L.1 aRothley, Kristina D.0 tBiological conservation.g2009 Aug., v. 142, no. 8 p.1818-1829dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2009.03.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245012000184300001800304500002400322520087400346650002101220650001701241650002201258650000901280650001701289650001501306650001301321650001801334650003201352650003001384650002701414650002201441650003701463650003101500650001701531650003701548650002501585650002301610650003501633650001701668700001901685700001201704700002201716700002001738773009901758852000901857856005301866655001201919IND4418992920221116141302.0090410e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441899292DNAL7 a192685752pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.01.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xiang10aEnhancement of erythromycin A production with feeding available nitrogen sources in erythromycin biosynthesis phase  ap. 3358-3365.  aIncludes references  aEffects of feeding different available nitrogen sources from 80h in erythromycin biosynthesis phase on the erythromycin A (Er-A) production were investigated in 50l fermenter.

This study determined carbon allocation coefficients in grain, straw, roots, and rhizodeposits for important oilseed and pulse crops in comparison with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under low-water (rainfall only) and high-water (rainfall plus irrigation) conditions. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)], and three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.)], along with a wheat control were tested in Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2006 and 2007. Crops were grown in 15-cm diameter, 100-cm long metal lysimeters pushed into the field of medium-textured Aridic Haploboroll with the soil structure in lysimeters undisturbed. Root mass in the 0-100cm depth was greater (P <0.01) under irrigation than that under rainfall for wheat (126% greater), flax (54% greater), and mustard (14% greater); there was no difference for dry pea; and was lower (P <0.01) under irrigation for chickpea (-16%) and lentil (-35%). Straw-to-root ratio averaged 4.90 under rainfall conditions and 6.22 under irrigation; the ratio differed among crop species only under rainfall conditions where the ratios for wheat (6.33), dry pea (5.35) and mustard (5.00) were greater than the ratios for canola, chickpea, and lentil. The relative C allocation coefficients in grain (R g), straw (R s), roots in the 0-100cm depth (R r), and rhizodeposits (R e), expressed as estimated C input from each plant part in proportion to total C, varied among crop species. On average, the allocation coefficient for pulse crops (R g:R s:R r:R e) was 0.24:0.46:0.18:0.12 under low-water, and 0.31:0.47:0.14:0.09 under high-water conditions. For oilseeds, the corresponding values were 0.17:0.58:0.15:0.10 for low-water, and 0.19:0.56:0.15:0.10 for high-water conditions. These C allocation coefficients in oilseeds and pulses should provide modellers with essential tools in quantifying C dynamics and soil C sequestration for agricultural systems involving broadleaved crop species. 3asoil organic carbon 3aBrassica napus 3aPisum sativum 3aCicer arietinum 3aLens culinaris 3alentils 3ainterspecific variation 3apeas 3aBrassica juncea 3amustard seed 3aTriticum aestivum 3acanola 3aLinum usitatissimum 3acrop residues 3achickpeas 3adryland farming 3airrigated farming 3adry matter partitioning 3aroot systems 3aspring wheat 3aSaskatchewan 0aspecies differences 0amustard products1 aCampbell, C.A.1 aJanzen, H.H.1 aLemke, R.L.1 aBasnyat, P.1 aMcDonald, C.L.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 Aug., v. 132, no. 3-4 p.290-297dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090723b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03105naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245007500157300001800232500001900250500002400269520166600293650003901959650002101998650001202019650001702031650001702048650002302065650001502088650002002103650002802123650002102151650003502172650001502207650001202222650001702234650002002251650002602271700001802297700002102315700002002336700002102356700002002377700001802397773010902415852000902524856007802533655001202611IND4430087420221116141543.0091218e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443008742DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcp1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun Jung10aMetabolic Engineering of Lignan Biosynthesis in Forsythia Cell Culture  ap. 2200-2209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aLignans are a large class of secondary metabolites in plants, with numerous biological effects in mammals, including antitumor and antioxidant activities. Sesamin, the most abundant furofuran-class lignan in sesame seeds (Sesamum plants), is produced by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP81Q1 from the precursor lignan, pinoresinol. In contrast, Forsythia plants produce dibenzylbutyrolactone-class lignans, such as matairesinol, from pinoresinol via the catalysis of pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase (PLR) and secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase. Here we present the engineering of lignan biosynthesis in Forsythia cell suspension cultures for the development of an efficient production method of beneficial lignans. A suspension cell culture prepared from leaves of Forsythia koreana produced lignans, mainly pinoresinol and matairesinol glucosides, at levels comparable with that obtained from the leaves. In an attempt to increase the pinoresinol content in Forsythia, we generated a transgenic cell line overexpressing an RNA interference (RNAi) construct of PLR (PLR-RNAi). Down-regulation of PLR expression led to a complete loss of matairesinol and an accumulation of approximately 20-fold pinoresinol in its glucoside form in comparison with the non-transformant. Moreover, the Forsythia transgenic cells co-expressing CYP81Q1 and PLR-RNAi exhibited production of sesamin as well as accumulation of pinoresinol glucoside. These data suggest Forsythia cell suspension to be a promising tool for the engineering of lignan production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on transgenic production of an exogenous lignan in a plant species. 3aForsythia viridissima var. koreana 3aRNA interference 3aSesamum 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acell lines 3acell physiology 3acell suspension culture 3acytochrome P-450 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglucosides 3alignans 3amatairesinol 3aoxidoreductases 3asecondary metabolites1 aOno, Eiichiro1 aMorimoto, Kinuyo1 aYamagaki, Tohru1 aOkazawa, Atsushi1 aKobayashi, Akio1 aSatake, Honoo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2009 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.2200-2209dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcp1563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04355naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100001400193245014400207300001500351500002400366500001500390520186000405650002302265650002302288650001102311650002802322650001802350650002002368650002802388650002002416650003402436650001902470650001902489650001202508650001402520650001202534650002502546650005602571650003402627650001402661650003402675650001802709650007202727650004202799650001102841650002602852650004302878650004402921650002202965650003002987650002603017650002003043650002303063653003203086653004903118653002503167700001503192700001803207700001503225700001403240700001703254700001803271773010803289852000903397856009603406930003303502945002503535946001303560655001203573IND4421415720221116141446.0090605e20090701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141572DNAL7 a193490702pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL2101 aGregg, K.10aExperimental risk assessment of bovine viral diarrhea virus transmission via in vitro embryo production using somatic cell nucleus transfer  ap. 99-110.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive risk assessment on infectious disease transmission in the system of in vitro embryo production via somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT) technology using bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a model. The risks of BVDV transmission in each step of the SCNT embryo production procedure, from donor cells to preimplantation SCNT embryo culture, were carefully examined using a sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The identified primary source of BVDV transmission in SCNT embryo production was donor cell infection, most likely caused by contaminated fetal bovine serum in the culture medium. The risk of disease transmission through contaminated oocytes from an abattoir was relatively low, and it can be greatly minimized by cumulus cell removal and adequate oocyte washing procedures. Of the 200 cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) and more than 1500 cumulus cell-free oocyte (CFO) samples collected from multiple sources over a course of 7 months, only 2.5% of the COCs were BVDV positive, and all of the CFOs (100%) were BVDV negative. To evaluate the risk of BVDV introduction during in vitro SCNT embryo culture, 324 SCNT embryos were produced from 18 different cell lines using oocytes from 26 different batches collected over a course of 9 months. The embryos were cultured in vitro for 7 days and then tested for BVDV. All of the 324 SCNT embryos (100%) were negative, indicating that the embryo culture system is virtually risk-free for BVDV transmission. Based on these results, a standard operational protocol (SOP) for SCNT embryo production was proposed to greatly minimize the risk of BVDV transmission through the SCNT embryo production system. This SOP could be a starting point to produce a SCNT system that is virtually risk-free for disease transmission in general. 3avirus transmission 3adisease prevalence 3acattle 3amicrobial contamination 3asomatic cells 3arisk assessment 3anuclear transplantation 3aembryo (animal) 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3arisk reduction 3aembryo culture 3aoocytes 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxvirology 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasextransmission 2aCattlexembryologyxvirology. 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Organismxveterinary 2aCulture Media 2aDiarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFetal Bloodxvirology 2aFibroblastsxultrastructurexvirology. 2aNuclear Transfer Techniquesxveterinary 2aOocytesxvirology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Viralxchemistry 2aRisk Assessment 2aSequence Alignment 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0asomatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT) embryos 0adonor cell infection1 aChen, S.H.1 aSadeghieh, S.1 aGuerra, T.1 aXiang, T.1 aMeredith, J.1 aPolejaeva, I.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 July 1, v. 72, no. 1 p.99-110dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090622b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/22  aOther US 7aarticle03981naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174072000900183100002200192245018000214300001600394500002400410500001500434520232900449650002002778650002102798650001302819650002102832650001302853650002102866650002702887650001602914650001802930650002002948650002002968650002802988650001803016653002203034653002203056653002603078700002103104700002203125700001503147773010003162852000903262856008703271930003303358945002503391946001103416655001203427IND4421416620221116141224.0090605e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2009.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ710 0aJ700 0aJ200 0aW000 0aF5001 aKong, Angela Y.Y.10aTransitioning from standard to minimum tillage: Trade-offs between soil organic matter stabilization, nitrous oxide emissions, and N availability in irrigated cropping systems  ap. 256-262.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFew studies address nutrient cycling during the transition period (e.g., 1-4 years following conversion) from standard to some form of conservation tillage. This study compares the influence of minimum versus standard tillage on changes in soil nitrogen (N) stabilization, nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions, short-term N cycling, and crop N use efficiency 1 year after tillage conversion in conventional (i.e., synthetic fertilizer-N only), low-input (i.e., alternating annual synthetic fertilizer- and cover crop-N), and organic (i.e., manure- and cover crop-N) irrigated, maize-tomato systems in California. To understand the mechanisms governing N cycling in these systems, we traced ¹⁵N-labeled fertilizer/cover crop into the maize grain, whole soil, and three soil fractions: macroaggregates (>250μm), microaggregates (53-250μm) and silt-and-clay (<53μm). We found a cropping system effect on soil Nnew (i.e., N derived from ¹⁵N-fertilizer or -¹⁵N-cover crop), with 173kgNnew ha⁻¹ in the conventional system compared to 71.6 and 69.2kgNnew ha⁻¹ in the low-input and organic systems, respectively. In the conventional system, more Nnew was found in the microaggregate and silt-and-clay fractions, whereas, the Nnew of the organic and low-input systems resided mainly in the macroaggregates. Even though no effect of tillage was found on soil aggregation, the minimum tillage systems showed greater soil fraction-Nnew than the standard tillage systems, suggesting greater potential for N stabilization under minimum tillage. Grain-Nnew was also higher in the minimum versus standard tillage systems. Nevertheless, minimum tillage led to the greatest N₂O emissions (39.5gN₂O-Nha⁻¹ day⁻¹) from the conventional cropping system, where N turnover was already the fastest among the cropping systems. In contrast, minimum tillage combined with the low-input system (which received the least Nha⁻¹) produced intermediate N₂O emissions, soil N stabilization, and crop N use efficiency. Although total soil N did not change after 1 year of conversion from standard to minimum tillage, our use of stable isotopes permitted the early detection of interactive effects between tillage regimes and cropping systems that determine the trade-offs among N stabilization, N₂O emissions, and N availability. 3aminimum tillage 3agreenhouse gases 3aZea mays 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3acropping systems 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3agrain yield 3agas emissions 3asoil aggregates 3astable isotopes 3anutrient use efficiency 3anitrous oxide 0atransition period 0atillage intensity 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aFonte, Steven J.1 avan Kessel, Chris1 aSix, Johan0 tSoil & tillage research.g2009 July, v. 104, no. 2 p.256-262dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2009.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03915naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100002300165245013600188300001600324500002400340520243900364650002402803650002502827650002402852650002002876650001702896650002502913650002002938650001902958650003102977650002603008650001703034650001203051651001003063651002503073700002503098700002603123700001903149773010003168852000903268856008703277930003303364945002503397946001103422655001203433IND4421417120221116141313.0090605e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2009.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ7101 aMelero, Sebastiana10aConservation tillage: Short- and long-term effects on soil carbon fractions and enzymatic activities under Mediterranean conditions  ap. 292-298.  aIncludes references  aShort- and long-term field experiments are necessary to provide important information about how soil carbon sequestration is affected by soil tillage system; such systems can also be useful for developing sustainable crop production systems. In this study, we evaluated the short- and long-term effects of conservation tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon fractions and biological properties in a sandy clay loam soil. Both trials consisted of rainfed crop rotation systems (cereal-sunflower-legumes) located in semi-arid SW Spain. In both trials, results were compared to those obtained using traditional tillage (TT). Soil samples were taken in flowering and after harvesting of a pea crop and collected at three depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20cm). The soil organic carbon fractions were measured by the determination of total organic carbon (TOC), active carbon (AC) and water soluble carbon (WSC). Biological status was evaluated by the measurement of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzymatic activities [dehydrogenase activity (DHA), o-diphenol oxidase activity (DphOx), and β-glucosidase activity (β-glu)]. The contents of AC and MBC in the long-term trial and contents of AC in the short-term trial were higher for CT than TT at 0-5cm depth for both sampling periods. Furthermore, DHA and β-glucosidase values in the July sampling were higher in the topsoil under conservation management in both trials (short- and long-term). The parameters studied tended to decrease as depth increased for both tillage system (TT and CT) and in both trials with the exception of the DphOx values, which tended to be higher at deeper layers. Values of DHA and β-glu presented high correlation coefficients (r from 0.338 to 0.751, p <=0.01) with AC, WSC and TOC values in the long-term trial. However, there was no correlation between either TOC or MBC and the other parameters in the short-term trial. In general, only stratification ratios of AC were higher in CT than in TT in both trials. The results of this study showed that AC content was the most sensitive and reliable indicator for assessing the impact of different soil management on soil quality in the two experiments (short- and long-term). Conservation management in dryland farming systems improved the quality of soil under our conditions, especially at the surface layers, by enhancing its storage of organic matter and its biological properties, mainly to long-term. 3asoil organic carbon 3aconservation tillage 3asoil microorganisms 3aenzyme activity 3asoil enzymes 3acarbon sequestration 3adryland farming 3asemiarid soils 3asoil biological properties 3aMediterranean climate 3asoil quality 3atopsoil 3aSpain 3aMediterranean region1 aLópez-Garrido, Rosa1 aMurillo, José Manuel1 aMoreno, Félix0 tSoil & tillage research.g2009 July, v. 104, no. 2 p.292-298dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2009.04.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090608b20090703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02032naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100001900174245009800193300001600291500002400307500001500331520075000346650002801096650002001124650001701144650002001161650001501181650004101196650001401237653001001251700001601261700001801277700001301295700001301308773010001321852000901421856008701430930003301517945002501550946001101575655001201586IND4421417520221116141350.0090605e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2009.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aJ100 0aN2001 aMcKenzie, B.M.10aSoil compaction by uniaxial loading and the survival of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa  ap. 320-323.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEarthworms are the major component of the soil fauna in temperate agro-ecosystems.

While greater loads (up to 800kPa) over longer exposure times (up to 60s) decreased survival; even under the most severe test conditions 33% of earthworms survived. Our results suggest that decreased earthworm populations in compacted soil are not due to uniaxial loading alone, but may be the result of shearing the soil during loading or from changes to the soil properties. 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3acompacted soils 3ashear stress 3asoil compaction 3aearthworms 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3amortality 0aloads1 aKühner, S.1 aMacKenzie, K.1 aPeth, S.1 aHorn, R.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2009 July, v. 104, no. 2 p.320-323dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2009.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090608b20090703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04368naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002300182245015600205300001600361500002400377500001500401520255400416650001202970650002902982650001303011650002503024650002703049650002103076650001903097650002603116650002303142650002303165650001403188650001903202650002203221650002203243650001503265650001203280651002203292653002303314653001803337653001503355653002403370653001703394653002903411653002003440700002203460773010803482852000903590856008603599930003303685945002503718946001103743655001203754IND4421417720221116141243.0090605e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aF300 0aE110 0aJ8001 aProber, Suzanne M.10aEnhancing biodiversity persistence in intensively used agricultural landscapes: A synthesis of 30 years of research in the Western Australian wheatbelt  ap. 173-191.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMeeting the global challenge to conserve biodiversity in intensively used agricultural landscapes is dependent on understanding and overcoming the limits to persistence of constituent species and ecological communities. This review synthesizes nearly 30 years of ecological research towards enhancing biodiversity persistence in the Western Australian (WA) wheatbelt, a 14millionha intensively used agricultural region within a global biodiversity hotspot. Outcomes for a range of taxonomic groups and ecological processes are integrated at a range of scales, and evaluated in the context of agricultural landscapes worldwide. Impacts of six major anthropogenic causes of biodiversity decline in the WA wheatbelt (vegetation clearing, livestock grazing, exotic species introductions, soil cultivation and fertilization, and altered fire management) are discussed, and associated with changes to underlying ecological processes that continue to limit biodiversity persistence even after primary interventions have ceased. At the general level, these limits reflect changes to ubiquitous drivers of species diversity and community composition that are observed in agricultural landscapes worldwide. On the other hand, the unique features of the WA wheatbelt, including the ancient landscapes and low nutrient status of its soils, the lack of large native predators and ungulate grazers, and its relatively recent development for agriculture, contribute to differences among limits to biodiversity persistence across regions. Indicators and thresholds associated with these limits are identified, and practical options for enhancing biodiversity persistence are evaluated. To conclude, we acknowledge that biodiversity outcomes in the WA wheatbelt are constrained by the sheer extent of intervention required, and propose four key directions through which ecological research might best improve the efficiency of on-ground conservation investments in agricultural landscapes: (1) stronger scientific engagement in active adaptive management to close 'general-local knowledge gaps'; (2) representation of species guilds with respect to landscape parameters as a framework for integrating studies of optimal landscape configurations; (3) introduction of the concept of 'conservation intensification' for focusing development and implementation of restoration strategies; and (4) greater application of the concepts of ecological resistance and resilience to the search for integrated and innovative restoration solutions, especially under climate change. 3agrazing 3aanthropogenic activities 3aland use 3afunctional diversity 3afertilizer application 3aland restoration 3aagroecosystems 3aagricultural research 3aecosystem services 3aintroduced species 3alivestock 3aclimate change 3aspecies diversity 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3atillage 3aWestern Australia 0aliterature reviews 0aland clearing 0aecosystems 0aadaptive management 0abiodiversity 0aenvironmental protection 0aland management1 aSmith, F.

In the untreated samples, the thermal stability, free SH contents and surface hydrophobicity were different. The differences seemed to be closely related to the differences in extent of aggregation and/or tertiary and secondary conformational structures among proteins. The heating resulted in extensive denaturation of the protein, significant decreases in free SH groups and increases in surface hydrophobicity, but to a varying extent, depending on the type of protein isolates. The protein solubility and emulsifying activities were significantly improved by the heating. The tertiary and secondary structures of these proteins were also to a various extent affected. The conformational structures of proteins in RPI were most flexible, and susceptible to the heating, while the proteins in KPI were most heat-stable in structures. The results clearly indicated close relationships between functional properties of these vicilin-rich protein isolates and their conformational structures. 3athermal stability 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprotein isolates 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3ahydrophobicity 3aheat treatment 3ainterspecific variation 3ared beans 3amung beans 3acultivars 3afood processing quality 3aprotein aggregates 3avicilin 3asulfhydryl groups 3aemulsifying properties 3asolubility 3aVigna radiata var. radiata 3akidney beans 3aprotein tertiary structure 0aspecies differences 0astructure function relationships 0aphysicochemical properties 0afunctional properties1 aSun, Xin1 aYin, Shou-Wei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1771-1778dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.03.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090723b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02084naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009300164300001600257500001900273500002400292520118700316650001501503650002101518650000901539650001001548651001401558700002101572700001801593773010201611852000901713856004801722655001201770IND4437443720221116141237.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443744372DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078100301272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozanov, A.

The lander is equipped with bottom chambers, sensors of environmental characteristics, and samplers, allowing fluxes of chemical elements through the water-bed interface to be determined directly. Bottom sediments were represented by organogenous silts containing hydrogen sulfide. The high activity of diagenetic processes resulted in a higher consumption of O₂ by sediments (the flux from the bottom water was 130 mM/(m²/day), high fluxes of biogenic elements (P, Si,) and metals (Mn, Fe). At the same time, fluxes across the water-bed interface were evaluated based on the difference between concentrations of these elements in the near-bed and silt water (Fick's law). The obtained data demonstrate the priority of direct measurements of fluxes (lander) over the calculation method. The first application of the lander suggests the need for methodological improvements both of engineering character and in chemical-analytical support. 3aautomation 3ahydrogen sulfide 3asilt 3awater 3aBlack Sea1 aVershinin, A.

This approach is based on enzyme theory and is often favored due to its simplicity and its requirement by regulatory agencies. Here, linear and nonlinear regression approaches to modeling first-order decay are compared. Composite residual plots of many soil degradation data sets are presented on a normalized scale. These plots illustrate the general error structure for the data and are useful for detecting common mis-specifications of the models. Results indicate that a nonlinear regression approach to modeling first-order decay of compounds in soil more accurately describes most data sets when compared with a linear approach. Specifically, the observed error structure does not support the broad use of a logarithmic transformation to stabilize the variance. In addition, models generated using the linear approach generally exhibit more dramatic systematic deviations from the observations as compared with models generated using the nonlinear approach. The analysis methods described here may be useful for comparing alternative models in this and other research areas. 3adata collection 3amodels 3apest control 3asoil 3asoil degradation1 aScherer, Peter N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 July 30, v. 51, no. 16 p.4722-4726x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034135a3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02990naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245011000152300001800262500002400280520162900304650001901933650002601952650002701978650002002005650001402025650001302039650001402052650002302066650002502089650003002114650001502144650002002159650001902179650001802198650001902216650001602235650002102251650001102272650001002283700001902293700001602312773010602328852000902434856007702443655001202520IND4471365320221116141400.0130827s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447136532DNAL7 a10.1021/jf026010w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hanwen10aPhytotoxic Effects of Wheat Extracts on a Herbicide-Resistant Biotype of Annual Ryegrass (Lolium rigidum)  ap. 4610-4616.  aIncludes references  aThirty-nine wheat accessions were used to evaluate their extract phytotoxicity against annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.). Aqueous extracts of wheat shoot residues significantly inhibited the germination and root growth of a biotype of annual ryegrass resistant to herbicides of acetyl CoA carboxylase inhibitors (group A), acetolactate synthase inhibitors (B), photosystem II inhibitors (C), and tubulin formation inhibitors (D). The germination of the herbicide resistant (HR) biotype was inhibited by 3−100%, depending upon the wheat accession. The phytotoxic effects on ryegrass root growth ranged from 12% stimulation to 100% inhibition, compared to a control. The germination and root growth of a herbicide-susceptible (HS) biotype of annual ryegrass were also inhibited by the wheat extracts, with germination inhibited by 4−100%, and root growth by 19−100%. Bioassays with two known wheat allelochemicals showed that p-coumaric acid and propionic acid significantly inhibited the growth of both HR and HS biotypes of annual ryegrass. The two compounds completely inhibited the root growth of HR ryegrass at concentrations greater than 5.0 mM. In comparison with p-coumaric acid, propionic acid was more inhibitory to seed germination, shoot, and root growth of both ryegrass biotypes. The root growth of the HR biotype was more sensitive when exposed to wheat extracts, to p-coumaric acid, and to propionic acid. The results suggest that residues of certain wheat cultivars with strong allelopathic potential could provide a nonherbicidal alternative for the management of herbicide-resistant weed species. 3aLolium rigidum 3aacetolactate synthase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aallelochemicals 3abioassays 3abiotypes 3acultivars 3agrowth retardation 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aherbicides 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphotosystem II 3aphytotoxicity 3apropionic acid 3aroot growth 3aseed germination 3ashoots 3awheat1 aPratley, James1 aHaig, Terry0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 July 30, v. 51, no. 16 p.4610-4616x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf026010w3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01662naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245010200155300001800257500002400275520069200299650002600991650004901017650002801066650001801094650002101112700001801133700001701151773010601168852000901274856007701283655001201360IND4471365520221116141337.0130827s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447136552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf034039+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Pyo-Jam10aFree Radical Scavenging Activity of Chitooligosaccharides by Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometry  ap. 4624-4627.  aIncludes references  aThe radical scavenging effects of chitooligosaccharides (COSs) on hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, alkyl radical, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical were investigated using a spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) method and compared with the ESR signal intensity.

Except for the control group, the feed for three other groups contained 2.0, 5.0, and 8.0% red mold rice (monacolin K concentrations were 0.0145, 0.035, and 0.056%, respectively). The experiment lasted 6 weeks. During this period, egg weight and egg production were recorded every day, and cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL in serum were measured weekly as well. The result showed that the cholesterol in eggs produced by experimental groups was lower than that of the control group (0%, 194.14 ± 8.30; 2%, 167.17 ± 4.34; 5%, 168.93 ± 9.38; 8%, 183.02 ± 7.63 mg/egg; p < 0.05), and the triglyceride (0%, 1494 ± 178; 2%, 1280 ± 174; 5%, 1189 ± 248; 8%, 1381 ± 218 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and LDL levels (0%, 36.81 ± 5.53; 2%, 32.25 ± 7.93; 5%, 30.06 ± 4.39; 8%, 28.81 ± 4.16 mg/dL; p < 0.05) were also significantly lowered in the experimental groups. However, the HDL level did not show significant change for either control or experimental groups (0%, 36.06 ± 3.96; 2%, 36.25 ± 5.39; 5%, 33.13 ± 3.68; 8%, 31.44 ± 4.29 mg/dL; p > 0.05). Besides, the addition of red mold rice also helps to inhibit production of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum lipid oxidation (0%, 27.42 ± 0.53; 2%, 25.62 ± 0.76; 5%, 24.35 ± 0.59; 8%, 23.63 ± 0.48 μM; p < 0.05). 3aMonascus 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alaying hens 3alipid peroxidation 3alovastatin 3alow density lipoprotein 3arice 3asecondary metabolites1 aPan, Tzu-Ming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 July 30, v. 51, no. 16 p.4824-4829x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034296e3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03692naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002500167245010300192300001800295500002400313520171200337650003302049650004302082650002702125650001502152650001502167650000902182650002302191650001402214650002002228650001902248650001002267650001902277650001802296650002402314650001502338650001602353650000902369650002002378650001802398650001702416650001602433650001902449650002102468650002802489650003302517650002202550650003102572650004902603650001602652650002302668650003002691650002002721650003702741650001902778651001802797651001802815773010002833852000902933856008802942655001203030IND4471424920221116141408.0130828s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447142492DNAL7 a237262072pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-4242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaffner, Donald W.10aUtilization of mathematical models to manage risk of holding cold food without temperature control  ap. 1085-1094.  aIncludes references  aThis document describes the development of a tool to manage the risk of the transportation of cold food without temperature control. The tool uses predictions from ComBase predictor and builds on the 2009 U.S. Food and Drug Administration Model Food Code and supporting scientific data in the Food Code annex. I selected Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes as the organisms for risk management. Salmonella spp. were selected because they are associated with a wide variety of foods and grow rapidly at temperatures >17°C. L. monocytogenes was selected because it is frequently present in the food processing environment, it was used in the original analysis contained in the Food Code Annex, and it grows relatively rapidly at temperatures <17°C. The suitability of a variety of growth models under changing temperature conditions is largely supported by the published literature. The ComBase predictions under static temperature conditions were validated using 148 ComBase database observations for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in real foods. The times and temperature changes encompassed by ComBase Predictor models for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes are consistent with published data on consumer food transport to the home from the grocery store and on representative foods from a wholesale cash and carry food service supplier collected as part of this project. The resulting model-based tool will be a useful aid to risk managers and customers of wholesale cash and carry food service suppliers, as well as to anyone interested in assessing and managing the risks posed by holding cold foods out of temperature control in supermarkets, delis, restaurants, cafeterias, and homes. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aFood and Drug Administration Food Code 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3acafeterias 3acold 3aconsumers (people) 3adatabases 3afood processing 3afood transport 3afoods 3agrocery stores 3agrowth models 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3arestaurants 3arisk 3arisk management 3arisk managers 3asupermarkets 3atemperature 3atransportation 2aCold Temperature 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aMathematics 2aModels, Biological 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Assessment 2aSalmonellaxgrowth & development 2aTransportation 3aUnited States 0aUnited States0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 June, v. 76, no. 6 p.1085-1094wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-4243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03770naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001700167245011700184300001800301500002400319520168900343650002302032650001502055650001202070650002302082650003002105650001602135650000902151650001502160650001002175650001402185650001002199650002602209650001302235650001902248650001702267650001102284650001202295650001302307650001202320650001402332650001502346650002002361650002202381650005002403650002702453650005802480650004502538650002202583650002202605650002702627650002702654700002002681700001902701700002302720700002102743700002102764700001902785700001802804700001602822700002502838773010002863852000902963856008802972655001203060IND4471424620131018000000.0130828s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447142462DNAL7 a237262042pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-4362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosada, L.J.10aIdentification of Aspergillus flavus isolates as potential biocontrol agents of aflatoxin contamination in crops  ap. 1051-1055.  aIncludes references  aAspergillus flavus, a haploid organism found worldwide in a variety of crops, including maize, cottonseed, almond, pistachio, and peanut, causes substantial and recurrent worldwide economic liabilities. This filamentous fungus produces aflatoxins (AFLs) B1 and B2, which are among the most carcinogenic compounds from nature, acutely hepatotoxic and immunosuppressive. Recent efforts to reduce AFL contamination in crops have focused on the use of nonaflatoxigenic A. flavus strains as biological control agents. Such agents are applied to soil to competitively exclude native AFL strains from crops and thereby reduce AFL contamination. Because the possibility of genetic recombination in A. flavus could influence the stability of biocontrol strains with the production of novel AFL phenotypes, this article assesses the diversity of vegetative compatibility reactions in isolates of A. flavus to identify heterokaryon self-incompatible (HSI) strains among nonaflatoxigenic isolates, which would be used as biological controls of AFL contamination in crops. Nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutants were recovered from 25 A. flavus isolates, and based on vegetative complementation between nit mutants and on the microscopic examination of the number of hyphal fusions, five nonaflatoxigenic (6, 7, 9 to 11) and two nontoxigenic (8 and 12) isolates of A. flavus were phenotypically characterized as HSI. Because the number of hyphal fusions is reduced in HSI strains, impairing both heterokaryon formation and the genetic exchanges with aflatoxigenic strains, the HSI isolates characterized here, especially isolates 8 and 12, are potential agents for reducing AFL contamination in crops. 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxins 3aalmonds 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acarcinogens 3acorn 3acottonseed 3acrops 3aeconomics 3afungi 3agenetic recombination 3ahaploidy 3ahepatotoxicity 3aheterokaryon 3ahyphae 3amutants 3anitrates 3apeanuts 3aphenotype 3apistachios 3areducing agents 3atoxigenic strains 2aAflatoxinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aArachisxmicrobiology. 2aAspergillus flavusxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aZea maysxmicrobiology1 aSant'anna, J.R.1 aFranco, C.C.S.1 aEsquissato, G.N.M.1 aSantos, P.A.S.R.1 aYajima, J.P.R.S.1 aFerreira, F.D.1 aMachinski, M.1 aCorrêa, B.1 aCastro-Prado, M.A.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 June, v. 76, no. 6 p.1051-1055wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-4363Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02408naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245005900172300001600231500002400247520131500271650000901586650002201595650002101617650001701638650001601655650001201671650001601683650002101699650002801720650001001748700002401758700001901782700002201801773011601823852000901939856008601948655001202034IND4471373220221116141521.0130827s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447137322DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.2003.223.1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSennello, Kathleen A.10aSystolic blood pressure in cats with diabetes mellitus  ap. 198-201.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To determine the prevalence of systemic hypertension in cats with diabetes mellitus and establish ranges for echocardiographic variables in diabetic cats. Design—Prospective study. Animals—14 cats with diabetes mellitus and 19 healthy control cats. Procedure—Systolic blood pressure was measured indirectly with a noninvasive Doppler technique. Ophthalmic and echocardiographic examinations were performed, and urine protein concentration was measured. Cats were considered to have hypertension if they had systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and at least 1 other clinical abnormality typically associated with hypertension (eg, hypertensive retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, or proteinuria). Results—None of the diabetic or control cats had systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg. One diabetic cat had left ventricular hypertrophy, but systolic blood pressure was 174 mm Hg. None of the cats had evidence of hypertensive retinopathy or proteinuria. Mean values for echocardiographic variables for the diabetic cats were not significantly different from published values for healthy cats. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results suggest that hypertension does not occur or occurs in only a small percentage of cats with diabetes mellitus.

This mandatory requirement has resulted in a continuous adaptation and development of analytical procedures. The aim of this study was to develop a method for semiquantitative screening of polychlorinated biphenyls in fish for human consumption. According to the Commission Decision 657/2002/CE, the detection capability, the precision, the selectivity-specificity, and applicability-ruggedness-stability were determined to validate the method. Moreover, trueness was verified. This procedure resulted in rapid execution, which allowed immediate and effective intervention by the local health authorities to protect the health of consumers. Finally, the procedure has been recognized by the Italian accrediting body, ACCREDIA. 3afish 3afisheries 3afoods 3ahumans 3alaws and regulations 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3ascreening 2aAnimals 2aCalibration 2aDioxinsxisolation & purification 2aFishes 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aLaboratoriesxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandards. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxisolation & purification 2aSeafoodxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aEurope1 aRusso, R.1 aAmbrosio, L.1 aEsposito, M.1 aSeverino, L.0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 June, v. 76, no. 6 p.1017-1020wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-4843Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03834naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245009500189300001600284500002400300520191700324650000802241650003202249650002802281650003302309650002202342650002902364650001902393650002002412650002202432650000902454650001802463650001002481650002502491650002702516650002802543650003002571650001202601650002002613650001202633650004402645650002402689650001102713650002802724650002502752650006702777650006702844650002302911650003002934650003202964700001902996700001303015700002003028773010803048852000903156856005503165655001203220IND4449196520221116141424.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919652DNAL7 a213065902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01231.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerihun, M.A.10aImmunohistochemical and Taqman real-time PCR detection of mycobacterial infections in fish  ap. 235-246.  aIncludes references  aReal-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were developed to detect fish mycobacterial infections at the genus level, based on the RNA polymerase β subunit (rpoB) gene and polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium rabbit serum, respectively. The PCR assay positively identified a number of pathogenic mycobacteria including Mycobacterium abscessus, M. avium ssp. avium, M. bohemicum, M. chelonae ssp. chelonae, M. farcinogenes, M. flavescens, M. fortuitum ssp. fortuitum, M. gastri, M. gordonae, M. immunogenicum, M. malmoense, M. marinum, M. montefiorense, M. phlei, M. phocaicum, M. pseudoshottsii, M. salmoniphilum, M. senegalense, M. shottsii, M. smegmatis, M. szulgi and M. wolinskyi. A detection limit equivalent to 10² cfu g⁻¹ was registered for M. salmoniphilum-infected fish tissue. The IHC precisely localized both free and intracellular mycobacteria in tissues and detected mycobacterial infections down to 10² cfu g⁻¹ tissue. Both assays were found to be more sensitive than Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, where the detection limit was below 8 × 10³ cfu g⁻¹ tissue. Although specificity testing of the real-time PCR against a panel of non-Mycobacterium spp. revealed a degree of cross-reaction against pure DNA extracted from Nocardia seriolae and Rhodococcus erythropolis, no cross-reactions were identified (by either real-time PCR or IHC) on testing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues confirmed to be infected with these bacteria. The broad applicability of both assays was confirmed by analysis of FFPE tissues from a range of fish species infected with diverse Mycobacterium spp. The results indicate that both assays, alone or in combination, constitute sensitive tools for initial, rapid diagnosis of mycobacteriosis in fish. This should in turn allow rapid application of more specific studies, i.e. culture based, to identify the specific Mycobacterium sp. involved. 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aMycobacterium abscessus 3aMycobacterium intracellulare 3aNocardia seriolae 3aRhodococcus erythropolis 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adisease detection 3afish 3afish diseases 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amycobacterial diseases 3apathogen identification 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3atissue analysis 2aAnimals 2aFish Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aFisheriesxmethods. 2aFishes 2aFormaldehydexchemistry 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMycobacteriumxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aMycobacterium Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aParaffin Embedding 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aHjortaas, M.J.1 aFalk, K.1 aColquhoun, D.J.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2011 Mar., v. 34, no. 3 p.235-246dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01231.x 7aarticle02946naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009500173520165800268592002801926650001801954650001601972650001501988650002002003650001702023650001502040650002402055650000902079650001602088651000902104653002102113653002802134653002602162653001902188653004302207653002702250700001802277700002102295773011302316856008602429852000902515655001202524IND60688414620221118040441.0200523e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068841462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhani, Ida Kalate13aAn ensemble multi-step-ahead forecasting system for fine particulate matter in urban areas  aIn recent years, growing air pollution has become a significant issue due to its detrimental effects on the environment and different living organisms. Providing accurate and reliable forecasts of air quality over a long future horizon is an effective way to mitigate health risks. In this paper, the problem of urban PM2.5 forecasts for several days ahead is considered. An ensemble multi-step-ahead forecasting system is introduced for this problem, which combines different multi-step-ahead strategies (including single-output and multi-output approaches). The proposed hybrid framework consists of three parts. In the first part, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique is combined with a prediction tool and multi-step-ahead strategies. Boosting idea is considered in the second part of the algorithm. Finally, the stacked ensemble of boosted hybrid structures is developed to provide the final multi-step-ahead forecasts. Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR), and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) are employed as the prediction tools in the proposed hybrid framework. Through real PM2.5 data examples from Mashhad, Iran, the proposed ensemble model is investigated for 1-day-ahead to 10-days-ahead. The results reveal the effectiveness of the ensemble model in comparison with the multi-step-ahead strategies in all time-steps. The proposed model with LSSVR prediction tool shows the smallest mean RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 7.810, 5.562, and 18.104% over all time-steps, and RMSE improvement rates of more than 35% compared to simply combining different multi-step-ahead strategies with LSSVR approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aalgorithms 3aneural networks 3aparticulates 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aurban areas 3aIran 0aMulti-step-ahead 0aFine particulate matter 0aLong-term forecasting 0aNeural network 0aLeast square support vector regression 0aLong short-term memory1 aSalari, Majid1 aShadman, Alireza0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.120983-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012200163520140600285592002801691650001501719650001101734650001901745650001401764650001201778650001101790650002201801650001701823650001101840650001301851650001101864650002401875650001401899650001701913651001001930653003601940653002501976653001602001653001502017653001202032700002102044773011302065856008602178852000902264655001202273IND60688415720221118040327.0200523e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068841572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lin10aIntegrated optimization of railway freight operation planning and pricing based on carbon emission reduction policies  aCargo transportation is one of the major sources of carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions from inland freight, one way is to encourage rail transportation instead of truck transportation. In this paper, a new approach combining railway operation management, revenue management, and policy formulation is proposed to increase the market share of railway freight and reduce carbon emissions. Through the integrated optimization of operation planning and pricing, the competitiveness of railway freight services is improved. The carbon tax policy acting on the demand-side can affect consigners’ choice behavior. The low-carbon subsidy policy acting on the supply-side can encourage rail transport. Then a bi-level multi-objective model is proposed to achieve the trade-off among the three stakeholders (the government, rail service operators, and consigners). The complexity of the bi-level multi-objective problem motivates the development of a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the Descent algorithm based on sensitivity analysis (SAB). Through a real case based on a rail service network with nine nodes in China, the rationality of the proposed methodology is verified. The results show that the approach proposed can achieve a 39.27% modal shift (MS) from road to rail, as well as a 37.09% carbon emission reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aemissions 3afreight 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarket share 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprices 3arail transportation 3arailroads 3astakeholders 3aChina 0aRail freight operation planning 0aRail freight pricing 0aModal shift 0aCarbon tax 0aSubsidy1 aZhang, Xiaoqiang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121316-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017700167500002200344520191100366592002802277650001502305650001002320650001302330650001002343650002902353650000902382650001702391650002702408650001502435650002002450650001102470650001402481650001102495650001802506650001702524650001702541650001802558651001002576651001802586653001002604653002002614653002902634653003302663653002402696700001902720700001702739700001802756700001602774700001802790700001702808700001602825700001202841700001902853773009402872856008502966852000903051655001203060IND60662890820221120115445.0190906e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1131322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haohan10aOccurrence, spatial-temporal distribution and ecological risks of pharmaceuticals and personal care products response to water diversion across the rivers in Nanjing, China  aPre-press version  aWater diversion projects have been continuously used to alleviate water quality issues that arise during urbanization. However, studies about whether it has possible effects on the status of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are limited. In this study, the occurrence trends and spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of 50 PPCPs were investigated in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments in Nanjing urban rivers under the background of the water diversion project from the Yangtze River to the Qinhuai River. In the four field campaigns that were embarked on April to July 2018, a total of 40, 38 and 24 PPCPs were detected in surface water, SPM and sediments, respectively, with overall concentrations of 138–1990 ng/L, 3214–33701 ng/g and 12.1–109 ng/g dry weight (dw) among nine sampling sites. The excessive concentration of caffeine (20.6–905 ng/L) may be evidence of the direct discharge of untreated sewage and an obvious indicator of the overall concentrations of PPCPs. The PPCPs contamination levels in surface water were increased along with the direction of the water diversion in urban runoff, and decreased by 8–31% due to the increase in volume attributable to the water diversion. The distribution coefficients (Kd) of pollutants in the SPM-water phases (3.0–5.6 L/kg) were two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sediment-water phases (0.3–3.3 L/kg). And the positive correlations between their log Kow and SPM-water log Kd values indicated SPM was the important carrier determining the fate of organic UV filters. Furthermore, the results of ecological risk assessment demonstrated that although the increase in the volume of water caused by the water diversion reduced the overall ecological risks of PPCPs in urban rivers, the current contamination level still represents high risks to algae and fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aalgae 3acaffeine 3adrugs 3aenvironmental assessment 3afish 3aparticulates 3apersonal care products 3apollutants 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3asurface water 3aurban runoff 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aPPCPs 0aWater diversion 0aWater quality variations 0aDistribution characteristics 0aEnvironmental risks1 aLü, Guanghua,1 aYan, Zhenhua1 aLiu, Jianchao1 aDong, Huike1 aJiang, Runren1 aZhou, Ranran1 aZhang, Peng1 aSun, Yu1 aNkoom, Matthew0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Aug. 27, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1131323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169520152800294592002801822650001501850650002301865650001701888650001901905650002001924650002201944650000901966650001301975650001101988650001101999650001502010650002502025653002602050653003002076653001902106653002602125653001502151700001602166700001702182700001602199700001502215700001302230700001302243773011302256856008602369852000902455655001202464IND60688417520221118040532.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068841752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Guilong10aCalcined electroplating sludge as a novel bifunctional material for removing Ni(II)-citrate in electroplating wastewater  aElectroplating sludge as the hazardous waste produced from the electroplating wastewater treatment plants, is also precious resources of various transition metals. In this study, the novel calcined electroplating sludge (CES) was prepared via facile calcination and subsequently used as an effective bifunctional material for removing Ni(II)-citrate in electroplating wastewater. The CES displayed a high removal efficiency of Ni(II)-citrate in the CES/H₂O₂ system via oxidative degradation of complex compounds and adsorptive removal of Ni²⁺. The high removal efficiency could be ascribed to the excellent catalysis and adsorption ability of the CES. The Fe and Cu oxides in the CES were considered as reactive components for the activation of H₂O₂ to degrade the complex compound, while the oxygen-containing functional groups on the CES surfaces were responsible for the adsorption of Ni²⁺. Various parameters affecting Ni(II)-citrate in the electroplating wastewater removal efficiency were tested. With the addition of 50 mmol/L H₂O₂ and 1.5 g/L CES, 87% of the total nickel could be removed within 50 min when the total nickel concentration in the Ni(II)-citrate containing electroplating wastewater was 283 mg/L. This study provides a new method for the treatment of electroplating wastewater containing nickel-organic complexes by the electroplating sludge wastes. This technology can reduce the treatment cost of electroplating wastewater and achieve the concept of disposal waste with waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalytic activity 3acupric oxide 3aelectroplating 3ahazardous waste 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amoieties 3anickel 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aElectroplating sludge 0aElectroplating wastewater 0aNi(II)-Citrate 0aOxidative degradation 0aAdsorption1 aDeng, Shubo1 aLiu, Fenglei1 aQi, Chengdu1 aTao, Liyan1 aLi, Tong1 aYu, Gang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121416-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010000167520111700267592002801384650002001412650001501432650002001447650001401467650001801481650001101499650002501510650002601535650001601561650001901577650001901596650002101615650001901636651001001655653002201665653001101687653001901698700001801717700001601735700001901751700001501770700001601785700001501801700001501816773011301831856008601944852000902030655001202039IND60688417720221118040433.0200523e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068841772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chang10aAssessment of site contaminated soil remediation based on an input output life cycle assessment  aSoil pollution is expanding, and soil remediation projects are underway around the world.

In this study, the input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) method is used to quantify the environmental, social, and economic impacts of four soil remediation schemes based on three soil remediation techniques (in situ encapsulation (ISE), ex situ thermal desorption (ESTD), and in situ thermal desorption (ISTD)) in an industrial contaminated area of China. The evaluation results showed that the ISE technology was the technology with the lowest cost and the best environmental impact, but it is only suitable for deep contaminated soils. ISTD was the best technique for a comprehensive evaluation. ISE + ESTD were the most suitable alternatives for a project. These evaluation methods will allow soil remediation decision makers to make informed choices. Soil remediation projects can be optimized by selecting appropriate energy sources and reducing NOX and SO₂ emissions from natural gas supplies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adesorption 3aeconomic impact 3aemissions 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle assessment 3anatural gas 3apolluted soils 3asoil pollution 3asoil remediation 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aContaminated land 0aIO-LCA 0aSustainability1 aZhang, Xuemei1 aChen, Jiaao1 aChen, Fangyuan1 aLi, Jiahao1 aChen, Yuchi1 aHou, Haobo1 aShi, Feng,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121422-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245019300181300001600374520179100390592002802181650001902209650001602228650002802244650002002272650001502292650002102307650002002328650002002348650001702368650001402385650004302399650001702442650001902459650002402478650001702502650001602519651001702535653001602552653001302568653001602581653001102597653001702608653003202625653000802657653001002665653000802675653000802683700002102691773010202712856008502814852000902899655001202908IND60662892420221120115427.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2019.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammouda, Sahar A.

It is hypothesized that diabetes pathogenesis is linked to complex metabolic abnormalities involving homocysteine (HCY) pathways and affecting B12, folate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. This study was conducted to determine the associations between serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and HCY in pregnant women with normal glycemic control, diabetes, or prediabetes. This cross-sectional study included 1159 healthy first-trimester pregnant women who were randomly selected from antenatal clinics in 2 hospitals and 21 health care centers across Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Data collected included clinical history and blood sample analyses for serum folate, vitamin B12, TSH, HCY, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C). Participants were classified with normal A1C (<5.7%), prediabetes (≥5.7 and <6.5%), or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes (≥6.5%). Results revealed that 79.5% of the participants had normal A1C levels, whereas 19.3% and 1.21% had A1C levels in prediabetic and diabetic ranges, respectively. Serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate were lower in prediabetes subjects than in participants with normal A1C concentrations, whereas serum concentrations of TSH and HCY were significantly higher. There was a strong negative correlation among the concentrations of A1C, vitamin B12, and folate, whereas positive correlations among A1C, TSH, and HCY were reported. Regression analysis identified TSH as having the strongest impact on A1C concentrations. These complex metabolic changes that occur at the prediabetic stage that involve TSH, HCY, folate, and vitamin B12 might direct research on diabetes prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3adata collection 3afolic acid 3aglycemic control 3aglycohemoglobin 3ahealth services 3ahomocysteine 3ahospitals 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogenesis 3apregnant women 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3avitamin B12 3aSaudi Arabia 0aPrediabetes 0aPregnant 0aVitamin B12 0aFolate 0aHomocysteine 0aThyroid-stimulating hormone 0aA1C 0aANOVA 0aHCY 0aTSH1 aMumena, Walaa A.0 tNutrition research.g2019 Dec., v. 72 p.105-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2019.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011900171520107600290592002801366650001301394650002801407650001401435650002201449651001101471651001601482651001801498653002701516653003501543653001901578653002201597653002901619700002001648700001801668700001701686773011401703856008401817852000901901655001201910IND60662892620221120115342.0201104e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.1013432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz-Gerro, Tally10aEnvironmental behavior in three countries: The role of intergenerational transmission and domains of socialization  aThis paper focuses on intergenerational transmission of environmental behavior, i.e., the processes by which environmental behavior is negotiated and shaped within the family. We offer an analysis of two correlates of child environmental behavior: parental environmental behaviors (as intergenerational transmission) and socialization domains (parent-child interactions). Our interest lies in exploring these predictors cross-culturally, and we do so by using national samples of parent-child dyads in Israel, South Korea and the United States (N = 1653 dyads). Findings from OLS regressions suggest that all three realms of children's environmental behavior (sustainable lifestyle, reducing consumption, and reducing impact) have a positive and statistically significant association with the corresponding parental behaviors, but this association is weaker in Korea. Furthermore, socialization to environmental behavior through group participation or reciprocity is more likely to enhance children's environmental behavior, and this association is stronger in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aenvironmental knowledge 3alifestyle 3aparental behavior 3aIsrael 3aSouth Korea 3aUnited States 0aEnvironmental behavior 0aIntergenerational transmission 0aCross-cultural 0aParent-child dyad 0aDomains of socialization1 aGreenspan, Itay1 aHandy, Femida1 aVered, Yaara0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2020 Oct., v. 71 p.101343-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.1013433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245018400174300001600358520172400374592002802098650001702126650002002143650001102163650001102174650001302185650001402198650003002212650002302242650001102265650002002276650001702296650002302313650001602336651001102352653001802363653002502381653001902406653002002425653002002445653002202465700002702487700002102514773010602535856008702641852000902728655001202737IND60545555920221116142755.0160902e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComby, Émeline,10aHow chemical pollution becomes a social problem. Risk communication and assessment through regional newspapers during the management of PCB pollutions of the Rhône River (France)  ap. 100-115.  aThe case study of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) pollutions of the Rhône River (France) offers the possibility of studying criteria for the construction of social problems that result from chemical pollution (2005–2010). We investigated the dynamics of competition that create and define pollution as a social problem and entail its decline. News outlets are crucial for determining how an environmental issue emerges locally or nationally; this study used newspapers to highlight the potential of new outlets as a data source to analyze discourse variability, science-policy-media connections and the hydrosphere. Media coverage was based on a content analysis and textual data analysis of 75 articles. Analytical frameworks such as the Downs Model and the Public Arena Model (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) that consider time and stakeholders were tested to determine how human alteration of the hydrosphere can become a social problem and to analyze different communication strategies held by stakeholders. In terms of management, we described the temporal dynamics of the social problem based on the case study and considered an explanation of the selections. We considered the organization of particular stakeholders who define the social problem from its beginning to end by focusing on their discourses, relationships, decision-making and political choices, and scientific studies. Despite some biases, newspapers are useful for retrospectively evaluating the emergence of a social problem in the public arena by describing it through discourse and then understanding the temporal patterns of information. Despite uncertainties and information flow, decisions are made and science is translated to the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3ahumans 3amodels 3apolitics 3apollution 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk communication 3arivers 3asocial problems 3astakeholders 3atemporal variation 3auncertainty 3aFrance 0aCommunication 0aEnvironmental policy 0aPCB pollutions 0aRisk assessment 0aSocial problems 0aTemporal patterns1 aLe Lay, Yves-François1 aPiégay, Hervé,0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 June 01, v. 482-483 p.100-115dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245018200204520135000386592002801736650001401764650001701778650000901795650001801804650002001822650002401842650001301866650001501879650002301894650001701917650001501934650001901949650001701968650004301985650001902028650003202047650002302079650001002102650001002112650001302122650002102135650001502156650002202171650000902193650001902202653002402221653001602245653002102261653002602282653003702308653000902345653000802354653000802362653000802370653000902378653000902387653000902396653000802405653000802413653001302421653001002434700002002444700001802464700006402482700005702546700002002603700002002623700001702643700001802660700001802678773011202696856008202808852000902890655001202899IND60662893020221120124641.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1107682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarev, Yancho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5830-469710aIn vitro antigenotoxic activity, in silico ADME prediction and protective effects against aflatoxin B1 induced hepatotoxicity in rats of an Erythrina latissima stem bark extract  aStem bark of Erythrina latissima E. Mey (Leguminosae) contains a wide range of prenylated flavonoids able to counteract the genotoxic properties of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁). Thus, the hypothesis was raised that E. latissima stem bark extracts (ELBE) may counteract the in vivo hepatotoxic effects of aflatoxins, contaminants in food and feed. An HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated to determine the level of flavonoid aglycones (11.82%) and glycosides (16.17%). ADME, pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness assessment of major flavonoids of ELBE, using the web tool SwissADME, showed good oral bioavailability. The protective effect of ELBE against AFB₁ induced genotoxicity in the Vitotox assay after metabolic activation was confirmed (IC₅₀ of 44.32 μg/ml), followed by evaluation of its inhibitory effect on hepatotoxicity in rats induced by the same agent. Male Wistar rats were orally treated with ELBE (20 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) or curcumin (500 mg/kg) combined with piperine (20 mg/kg) - positive control, for 8 days prior to AFB₁ exposure (1 mg/kg). The ELBE group showed a decreased activity of ALP and γ-GT compared to the AFB₁ group. Histopathological examination of the liver demonstrated ameliorative effects of ELBE. Thus, ELBE could have a protective effect against hepatotoxins such as AFB₁.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErythrina 3aaflatoxin B1 3abark 3abark extracts 3abioavailability 3acomputer simulation 3acurcumin 3aflavonoids 3afood contamination 3agenotoxicity 3aglycosides 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahepatotoxins 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistopathology 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3amales 3amutagens 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aworld wide web 0aErythrina latissima 0aLeguminosae 0aAntigenotoxicity 0aPrenylated flavonoids 0aIn vivo antihepatotoxic activity 0aADME 0aALP 0aALT 0aAST 0aAFB1 0aDMSO 0aELBE 0aHBD 0aHBA 0aHPLC-DAD 0aγ-GT1 aNaessens, Tania1 aTheunis, Mart1 aElgorashi, Esameldin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2207-306X1 aApers, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7760-08701 aIonkova, Iliana1 aVerschaeve, Luc1 aPieters, Luc1 aHermans, Nina1 aFoubert, Kenn0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Jan., v. 135 p.110768-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1107683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245008700169300001600256520125800272592002801530650001301558650001201571650001601583650002001599650001001619650001401629650001301643650001101656651001101667653001201678653001001690653001601700653001301716653002701729700001501756700001401771773010601785856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60545556020221116142801.0160902e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirlean, N.10aArsenic in groundwater of the Paraiba do Sul delta, Brazil: An atmospheric source?  ap. 148-156.  aHigh concentrations of arsenic (>50μgL−1) have been detected for the first time in groundwater of the wave-dominated Paraiba do Sul delta, Brazil. The deltaic shallow groundwater aquifer is enriched in arsenic fixed by authigenic sulfides. A study of palynomorphs confirmed that aquifer sediments were formed in inter-dune lakes/swamps lately covered by eolian sands. The organic sediments of contemporaneous inter-dune lake/swamp contain very high concentration of As: up to 180mgkg−1 and 163μgL−1 in dry gyttja material and interstitial water, respectively. The As in recent lake/swamp sediments is retained by iron hydroxides in upper and probably by sulfides in lower layers. In the absence of connection of inter-dune lakes/swamps with fluvial currents, the atmospheric input of As could be considered as the principal source in sediments. The calculation demonstrates the possibility of high concentrations of As accumulation in sediments of inter-dune lakes/swamps from atmospheric precipitations within several centuries before they will be covered by eolian sands and turned into shallow aquifer. Considering the commonalities of wave-dominated delta formations, we can predict more prevalent As accumulation in delta plain groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3agroundwater 3airon hydroxides 3alakes 3asediments 3asulfides 3aswamps 3aBrazil 0aArsenic 0aDelta 0aGroundwater 0aSediment 0aAtmospheric deposition1 aBaisch, P.1 aDiniz, D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 June 01, v. 482-483 p.148-156dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013400173300001600307520189300323592002802216650001602244650002302260650002402283650002002307650002102327650001902348650001002367650002902377650002302406650001702429650001602446650001102462650001702473650001502490650001502505650003202520650003302552650005002585650000902635653004602644653002902690653002002719653005902739653002402798700002102822700002102843773010602864856008702970852000903057655001203066IND60545556120221116142650.0160902e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastogi, Tushar10aQualitative environmental risk assessment of photolytic transformation products of iodinated X-ray contrast agent diatrizoic acid  ap. 378-388.  aRecent studies have confirmed that the aquatic ecosystem is being polluted with an unknown cocktail of pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and/or their transformation products (TPs). Although individual chemicals are typically present at low concentrations, they can interact with each other resulting in additive or potentially even synergistic mixture effects. Therefore it is necessary to assess the environmental risk caused by these chemicals. Data on exposure is required for quantitative risk assessment of TPs and/or metabolites. Such data are mostly missing because of the non-availability of TPs and very often metabolites for experimental testing. This study demonstrates the application of different in silico tools for qualitative risk assessment using the example of photodegradation TPs (photo-TPs) of diatrizoic acid (DIAT), which itself is not readily biodegradable. Its photolytic transformation was studied and the photodegradation pathway was established. The aerobic biodegradability of photo-TPs under the conditions of an aquatic environment was assessed using standardized OECD tests. The qualitative risk assessment of DIAT and selected photo-TPs was performed by the PBT approach (i.e. Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity), using experimental biodegradation test assays, applying different QSAR models with several different toxicological endpoints and in silico read-across approaches. The qualitative risk assessment pointed out that the photo-TPs were less persistent compared to DIAT and none of them possessed any bioaccumulation threat. However, a few photo-TPs were predicted to be active for mutagenicity and genotoxicity, which indicate the need for further testing to confirm these predictions. The present study demonstrates that in silico qualitative risk assessment analysis can increase the knowledge space about the environmental fate of TPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3abioaccumulation 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3adrugs 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental fate 3agenotoxicity 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amutagenicity 3aphotolysis 3aprediction 3aqualitative risk assessment 3aquantitative risk assessment 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3arisk 0aQualitative environmental risk assessment 0aIodinated contrast media 0aDiatrizoic acid 0aQuantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) 0aUS EPA PBT profiler1 aLeder, Christoph1 aKümmerer, Klaus0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 June 01, v. 482-483 p.378-388dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01337naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245004600173300001400219520036200233592002800595650002300623650001100646653000700657653000700664653002700671653001800698653003100716700002000747700001700767700002300784773009700807856008600904852000900990655001200999IND60646135320221119210907.0190923e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkovoroda, Rodion10aCost-efficient Performance-Vesting Equity  ap. 37-39.  aWe analyze the incentive effects of the Performance-Vesting Equity (PVE) component of executive pay that is characterized by zero exercise price and performance-contingent vesting.

The methanol extract of C. depressinervosum exhibited good DPPH and NO scavenging effects. The strongest BCB inhibition and FIC effects were shown by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts of both species. Overall, DPPH, FRAP and FIC assays showed strong correlation with TPC. For cytotoxicity, hexane extract of C. depressinervosum possessed the strongest anti-proliferative activities towards SNU-1 cells while the hexane extract of C. buxifolium showed the strongest activity towards LS-174T and K562 cells with the IC50 values ranging from 7 to 17 μg/mL. The purification of plant extracts afforded eight xanthones, ananixanthone (1), caloxanthone B (2), caloxanthone I (3), caloxanthone J (4) xanthochymone B (5), thwaitesixanthone (6), 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7) and dombakinaxanthone (8). All the xanthones, except 1 were reported for the first time from both Calophyllum species. The xanthones were examined for their cytotoxic effect against K562 leukemic cells. Compounds 1 and 2 showed strong cytotoxicity with the IC50 values of 2.96 and 1.23 μg/mL. The molecular binding interaction of 2 was further investigated by performing molecular docking study with promising protein receptor Src kinase.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCalophyllum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abark 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3aenzymes 3aethyl acetate 3ahexane 3ahuman diseases 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3aplant extracts 3axanthones 0aCaloxanthone B 0aK562 cells 0aMolecular docking 0aPhytochemical analysis 0aRadical scavenging activities1 aLian Ee, Gwendoline Cheng1 aIsmail, Intan Safinar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3960-00221 aIbrahim, Zalikha1 aMah, Siau Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0370-48660 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Aug. 30, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1108003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245014200213300001600355520134500371592002801716650002401744650003001768650001501798650002001813650001201833650001901845650001601864650003501880650002201915650001701937650001601954650003001970650001102000650001502011650001902026650002002045650001102065651001902076653001202095653002302107653001602130653000902146653001602155653002602171700002402197700002302221773010602244856008702350852000902437655001202446IND60545556420221116142748.0160902e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neill, Antonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5141-573010aDistribution of arsenic and risk assessment of activities on a golf course fertilised with arsenic-containing Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed  ap. 252-259.  aThe use of seaweed fertilisers in sports green maintenance has become a common practice across the globe due to its image as an “eco-friendly” alternative to chemical fertilisers. The aim of this study was to characterise the risk of human exposure to arsenic (As), via dermal absorption, from golfing activities on a private golf course in the UK, where As contaminated seaweed fertiliser (~100mg/kg d.wt.) is applied. This was fulfilled by, 1) determining As concentrations in shallow soils with GIS geo-statistical analysis, 2) measuring As concentrations from an on-site borehole groundwater well, and (3) developing a risk assessment calculation for golfing activities based on field and questionnaire data. Total As concentrations in shallow soils were less than the UK threshold for domestic soils, however, frequent and sustained dermal contact between site-users and surface soil attributed to a maximum carcinogenic risk value of 2.75×10−4, which is in the upper limit of the acceptable risk range. Arsenic concentrations in underlying groundwater exceeded the WHO's permissible drinking water standard, demonstrating the risk of groundwater contamination following the application of seaweed fertiliser to golf course soils. This is the first risk study on dermal As absorption via the application of a seaweed fertiliser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aWorld Health Organization 3aabsorption 3aacceptable risk 3aarsenic 3adrinking water 3afertilizers 3ageographic information systems 3agolf course soils 3agolf courses 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahumans 3amacroalgae 3aquestionnaires 3arisk assessment 3asports 3aUnited Kingdom 0aArsenic 0aSeaweed fertiliser 0aGolf course 0aSoil 0aGroundwater 0aRisk characterisation1 aSen Gupta, Bhaskar,1 aPhillips, Debra H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 June 01, v. 482-483 p.252-259dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012100171300001600292520094400308592002801252650002701280650001501307650002001322650002101342650001701363650001901380650002101399650001901420650001301439650001401452650001901466653001401485653002801499653001901527653002201546653002901568700001801597700001601615700001201631700001501643700001701658700001601675773010601691856008701797852000901884655001201893IND60545556520221116142738.0160902e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shiqing10aEffect of chlorine dioxide on cyanobacterial cell integrity, toxin degradation and disinfection by-product formation  ap. 208-213.  aBench scale tests were conducted to study the effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) oxidation on cell integrity, toxin degradation and disinfection by-product formation of Microcystis aeruginosa. The simulated cyanobacterial suspension was prepared at a concentration of 1.0×106cells/mL and the cell integrity was measured with flow cytometry. Results indicated that ClO2 can inhibit the photosynthetic capacity of M. aeruginosa cells and almost no integral cells were left after oxidation at a ClO2 dose of 1.0mg/L. The total toxin was degraded more rapidly with the ClO2 dosage increasing from 0.1mg/L to 1.0mg/L. Moreover, the damage on cell structure after oxidation resulted in released intracellular organic matter, which contributed to the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) as disinfection by-products. Therefore, the use of ClO2 as an oxidant for treating algal-rich water should be carefully considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3abyproducts 3acell structures 3achlorine dioxide 3adisinfection 3aflow cytometry 3ahaloacetic acids 3aorganic matter 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aphotosynthesis 0aOxidation 0aPhotosynthetic capacity 0aCell integrity 0aToxin degradation 0aDisinfection by-products1 aShao, Yisheng1 aGao, Naiyun1 aLi, Lei1 aDeng, Jing1 aZhu, Mingqiu1 aZhu, Shumin0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 June 01, v. 482-483 p.208-213dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245016700177300001400344520117000358592002801528650001501556650001401571650001901585650001901604650002201623650001501645650002101660650002301681650001801704650002001722651000901742653002101751653001801772653002001790653001701810653004501827653000901872700002501881700002901906700003001935700003101965700003201996700002902028700003102057700002902088700003102117773008802148856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60662893820221120124844.0191121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina-Santos, Raíssa10aDiversity of astacin-like metalloproteases identified by transcriptomic analysis in Peruvian Loxosceles laeta spider venom and in vitro activity characterization  ap. 81-92.  aLoxosceles spiders are found in almost all countries of South America. In Peru, Loxosceles laeta species is the main responsible for the accidents caused by poisonous animals, being known as “killer spiders”, due to the large number of fatal accidents observed. Astacin-like metalloproteases, named LALPs (Loxosceles astacin-like metalloproteases) are highly expressed in Loxosceles spiders venom gland. These proteases may be involved in hemorrhage and venom spreading, being relevant to the envenoming proccess. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze Peruvian L. laeta venom gland transcripts using bioinformatics tools, focusing on LALPs. A cDNA library from Peruvian L. laeta venom glands was constructed and sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina) sequencer. After assembly, the resulting sequences were annotated, seeking out for similarity with previously described LALPs. Nine possible LALPs isoforms from Peruvian L. laeta venom were identified and the results were validated by in silico and in vitro experiments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular diversity of Loxosceles venom and provide insights about the action of LALPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxosceles 3aaccidents 3abioinformatics 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3ahemorrhage 3ain vitro studies 3ametalloproteinases 3aspider venoms 3atranscriptomics 3aPeru 0aLoxosceles laeta 0aTranscriptome 0aMetalloprotease 0aSpider venom 0aLoxosceles astacin-like metalloproteases 0aLALP1 aGuerra-Duarte, Clara1 ade Almeida Lima, Sabrina1 aCostal-Oliveira, Fernanda1 aAlves de Aquino, Priscilla1 aOliveira do Carmo, Anderson1 aFerreyra, César Bonilla1 aGonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar E.1 aKalapothakis, Evanguedes1 aChávez-Olórtegui, Carlos0 tBiochimie.g2019 Dec., v. 167 p.81-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300001400265520112100279592002801400650001001428650001501438650002201453650001501475650001201490650001901502650001001521650002401531650001301555650001701568650002401585650001701609653002401626653003901650653001901689653003501708700001801743700001601761700009501777773008801872856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60662894020221120115303.0191121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Sanna10aMicroRNA biogenesis, gene silencing mechanisms and role in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer  ap. 12-24.  aMicro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are important class of short regulatory RNA molecules involved in regulation of several essential biological processes. In addition to Dicer and Drosha, over the past few years several other gene products are discovered that regulates miRNA biogenesis pathways. Similarly, various models of molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA mediated gene silencing have been uncovered through which miRNA contribute in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulated miRNA expression has been reported in many cancers manifesting tumor suppressive or oncogenic role.

The instrument design enables measurements of accurate first-principle determinations of rotationally-averaged ion-neutral collision cross sections coupled with high-mass, high-resolution mass measurement capabilities of Orbitrap MS. The inherent duty-cycle mismatch between drift tube IM and Orbitrap MS is alleviated by operating the drift tube in a frequency modulated mode while continuously acquiring mass spectra with the Orbitrap MS. Fourier transform of the resulting time-domain signal, i.e., ion abundances as a function of the modulation frequency, yields a frequency domain spectrum that is then converted (s⁻¹ to s) to IM drift time. This multiplexed approach allows for a duty-cycle of 25% compared to <1% for traditional “pulse-and-wait” IM-ToF-MS. Improvements in mobility and mass resolution of the IM-Orbitrap allows for accurate analysis of intact protein complexes and the possibility of capturing protein dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aequipment design 3aprotein structure 3aspectroscopy 0aIon mobility-mass spectrometry 0aNative mass spectrometry 0aIntact protein complexes 0aProtein-ligand interactions 0aFourier transform-ion mobility 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aPeriodic focusing drift tube ion mobility 0aOrbitrap mass spectrometer 0aIon mobility 0aMembrane protein1 aMcCabe, Jacob W.1 aShirzadeh, Mehdi1 aLaganowsky, Arthur1 aRussell, David H.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2020 Mar., v. 124 p.115533-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245005300170520132800223592002801551650003001579650002401609650001201633650001101645650001801656650003101674650002001705650000901725650002501734650001501759650001401774650001201788650001601800650001101816653002201827653002001849653001901869653002601888653001101914700002301925700001601948700002201964700002101986773009402007856008402101852000902185655001202194IND60662894420221120115354.0200103e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1109542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Caroline10aWinter thermal comfort and health in the elderly  aThere is said to be a strong relationship between low winter fuel consumption and increased cold-related morbidities and mortalities in the elderly. However, no study has so far investigated baseline domestic thermal conditions, energy and health in this demographic - a crucial gap given an ageing population. Hence we examine, for the first time, the validity of current thermal comfort standards and World Health Organisation minimum temperature thresholds in the 65 + demographic, through a longitudinal study of thermal conditions in homes of the elderly. We cover two typical winters using repeated monthly surveys and continuous temperature monitoring in living and bed rooms. Results demonstrate that the widely used ISO7730 model significantly underpredicts comfort in this demographic. We use our data to create a new model for the elderly, with a 40% lower error rate. Using calibrated computer models, we demonstrate that our model predicts a 44% reduction in winter heating demand, compared to the current model. Finally, our data provides little evidence for an association between low indoor temperature and healthcare visits for a variety of morbidities. These results question current assumptions around thermal comfort and health in the elderly, with potential implications for health and energy policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3acomputer simulation 3aelderly 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahealth services 3aheat 3alongitudinal studies 3amonitoring 3amortality 3asurveys 3atemperature 3awinter 0aAgeing population 0aThermal comfort 0aWinter heating 0aTemperature standards 0aHealth1 aNatarajan, Sukumar1 aLiu, Chunde1 aChung, Woong June1 aHerrera, Manolo,0 tEnergy policy.g2019 Nov., v. 134 p.110954-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1109543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006400170300001600234520093200250592002801182650002201210650002201232650002301254650001501277650002401292650001201316650001601328650001701344650001501361650001301376650001401389653002301403653002401426653003101450653002201481653001801503653002701521653002601548653004901574653003301623653004801656653005001704653004901754653004401803653003801847653006701885653003301952653003401985653007402019653006802093700006702161700006302228700002602291700003402317773011302351856008302464852000902547655001202556IND60646136720221119210434.0190923e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGątarek, Paulina10aAnalytical methods used in the study of Parkinson's disease  ap. 292-302.  aParkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, and is the second after Alzheimer's disease. This disease affects mostly older people, but an early onset of Parkinson's disease is observed in people aged 40–50 years. There are numerous theories about the specific causes of PD, but they have not yet been proved. Analytical methods are important in the determination of metabolites in biological samples from PD patients for the potential use as biomarkers of the disease. These biomarkers should allow early detection, precise prognosis or monitoring of disease progression. Metabolic profiling helps to understand the etiology of PD and aids in the development of new treatments.This review presents in a concise way a summary of the current status of the analytical methods used in establishing PD biomarkers, which can lead to a better understanding of the etiology of Parkinson's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aanalytical methods 3abiomarkers 3adisease progression 3aelderly 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aprognosis 0aAnalytical methods 0aParkinson's disease 0aChromatographic techniques 0aMetabolic profile 0aTrace element 0aPD Parkinson's disease 0aGC gas chromatography 0aUPLC ultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aCE capillary electrophoresis 0aNMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aLC-MS liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aHILIC hydrophilic interaction chromatography 0aAAS atomic absorption spectrophotometry 0a8-OHdG 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine 0aRP-HPLC reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 0aECD electrochemical detector 0aTLC thin-layer chromatography 0aLA-ICP-MS laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aICP-AES inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry1 aPawełczyk, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4540-09321 aJastrzębski, Karol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8651-81981 aGłąbiński, Andrzej1 aKałużna-Czaplińska, Joanna0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Sept., v. 118 p.292-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009000176300001600266520124200282592002801524650002401552650001401576650003001590650001101620650001801631653002201649653001801671653001301689653001301702653001401715653000901729700001901738700002101757773010601778856008701884852000901971655001201980IND60545557620221116142657.0170708e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTherezien, Mathieu10aImportance of heterogeneous aggregation for NP fate in natural and engineered systems  ap. 309-318.  aThe growing interest in nanoparticles (NP) is inevitably translating into an increase of their emissions in the environment. On the other hand, the necessary knowledge about the fate and transport of these NPs in the environment remains limited. In particular it is critically important to understand how the interactions of NPs with the particles already present in environmental matrices affect their fate, transport, and eventually persistence in the environment.In this study we present a computer model that expands upon the existing simple homogeneous aggregation models to account for heterogeneous aggregation between NPs and the distribution of natural particles already present in environmental waters. The model follows the concentrations of purely nanoparticle aggregates, purely background particles aggregates, and mixed aggregates, as well as the composition of mixed aggregates. After analytical evaluation, we ran simulations to illustrate the complexity of heterogeneous aggregation and its impact on the fate of NPs.The model predicts that the impact of NP size on their persistence in the environment is accentuated for low affinity between NPs and background particles, and for low background particle concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aemissions 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3ananoparticles 0aHeteroaggregation 0aNanoparticles 0aModeling 0aColloids 0aTransport 0aFate1 aThill, Antoine1 aWiesner, Mark R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 July 01, v. 485-486 p.309-318dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245005300170300001600223520101400239592002801253650002501281650001901306650002401325650001801349650001101367650001801378650001401396650003501410650001601445653002401461653001801485653001501503653002501518653001801543653001601561700002801577700003101605700002301636700002401659700002101683700002401704773011301728856008301841852000901924655001201933IND60646137020221119210544.0190923e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Mohammad10aSupercritical fluid extraction of essential oils  ap. 182-193.  aThe main purpose of this study was to investigate the extraction of essential oils from plants by the supercritical fluid extraction technique.

Evidence from eight EU countries  aDo consumers value the fuel economy of cars? We examine this question taking advantage of the recent introduction of hybrid and battery-electric vehicles, which promise to reduce the use of fossil fuels in road transport, and hence carbon emissions and dependence on oil imports. The price of these vehicles may however create hurdles to their widespread adoption. Automakers claim that these technologies come with higher production costs. Consumers should be willing to pay a price differential for these cars just equal to the savings in fuel costs—unless their utility depends on considerations beyond car quality, performance and fuel economy.We specifically ask three related questions. First, do consumers value fuel economy, even among all-electric and hybrids? Second, do the prices of electric vehicles reflect the so-called “range anxiety”? Third, is there evidence of an all-electric or hybrid “premium” above and beyond the savings in fuel costs made possible by these cars over their conventional counterparts? We answer these questions using detailed data on new cars sold in eight European Union countries from January 2011 to September 2017, combined with gasoline, diesel and electricity prices and taxation information. Using hedonic pricing regressions and careful sample design, we find that, all else the same, more fuel-efficient variants of the same cars do cost more, but either the fuel economy is undercapitalized, or consumers and automakers are assuming a payback period of 2.2–4.6 years. We also find evidence of large all-electric and plug-in hybrid premiums above and beyond the savings in fuel costs, while regular hybrids cars carry a modest premium—one that is comparable to that of diesel cars or other types of technologies. Individuals who purchase all-electric or plug-in hybrids may be motivated by other considerations in addition to fuel costs, or automakers may be setting prices to take advantage of government incentives. We find no evidence that the prices of all-electric cars reflect their battery range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectricity costs 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3agasoline 3aimports 3aoils 3aprices 3aroad transportation 3ataxes 3awillingness to pay 0aValuation of fuel economy 0aHybrid vehicles 0aHedonic pricing 0aEnergy transition 0aL11 0aL62 0aL811 aDi Cosmo, Valeria1 aBigano, Andrea0 tEnergy policy.g2019 Nov., v. 134 p.110978-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1109783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013500174300001600309500001500325520205200340592002802392650001602420650001902436650002802455650001402483650000902497650001802506650002002524650001902544650001702563650001602580650001802596650001402614650002102628650001502649650001802664650001102682650002802693650002402721650001202745650001102757650001102768650001602779650001402795651001602809653001502825653001402840653001902854700002402873700001602897700002502913700002102938773010602959856008703065852000903152655001203161IND60545558120221116142632.0170708e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054555812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevane, Megan L.14aThe impact of major earthquakes and subsequent sewage discharges on the microbial quality of water and sediments in an urban river  ap. 666-680.  a2019-12-06  aA series of large earthquakes struck the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 2010–2011. Major damage sustained by the sewerage infrastructure required direct discharge of up to 38,000m3/day of raw sewage into the Avon River of Christchurch for approximately six months. This allowed evaluation of the relationship between concentrations of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and F-RNA phage) and pathogens (Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) in recreational water and sediment both during and post-cessation of sewage discharges.Giardia was the pathogen found most frequently in river water and sediment, although Campylobacter was found at higher levels in water samples. E. coli levels in water above 550CFU/100mL were associated with increased likelihood of detection of Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, supporting the use of E. coli as a reliable indicator for public health risk. The strength of the correlation of microbial indicators with pathogen detection in water decreased in the following order: E. coli>F-RNA phage>C. perfringens.All the microorganisms assayed in this study could be recovered from sediments. C. perfringens was observed to accumulate in sediments, which may have confounded its usefulness as an indicator of fresh sewage discharge. F-RNA phage, however, did not appear to accumulate in sediment and in conjunction with E. coli, may have potential as an indicator of recent human sewage discharge in freshwater. There is evidence to support the low-level persistence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but not Campylobacter, in river sediments after cessation of sewage discharges. In the event of disturbances of the sediment, it is highly probable that there could be re-mobilisation of microorganisms beyond the sediment–water exchange processes occurring under base flow conditions. Re-suspension events do, therefore, increase the potential risk to human health for those who participate in recreational and work-related activities in the river environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aurban areas 3abacteriophages 3aClostridium perfringens 3asediments 3arisk 3apublic health 3aCryptosporidium 3ainfrastructure 3ahuman health 3aearthquakes 3aCampylobacter 3apathogens 3aEscherichia coli 3afreshwater 3awater quality 3ahumans 3amicrobiological quality 3amicrobial detection 3aGiardia 3arivers 3asewage 3ariver water 3abase flow 3aNew Zealand 0aIndicators 0aPathogens 0amicroorganisms1 aMoriarty, Elaine M.1 aWood, David1 aWebster-Brown, Jenny1 aGilpin, Brent J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 July 01, v. 485-486 p.666-680dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013100170520145600301592002801757650002401785650004401809650002101853650001301874650002001887650001901907650001801926650001101944650002301955650002101978650002201999650001302021650001502034650000902049650000702058650001502065650001902080650001402099650003702113650001702150650001902167650001602186650001602202650000902218651001002227653001802237653001902255653001802274653001902292653003902311653002402350700002102374700002402395700001802419773011802437856008602555852000902641655001202650IND60662895820221120124818.0200228e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1094552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOualha, Meriam10aIdentification and overcome of limitations of weathered oil hydrocarbons bioremediation by an adapted Bacillus sorensis strain  aBecause of the high production of oil and gas in Qatar, the likelihood of oil spill occurrence is most probably susceptible to happen. Contaminated soil treatment is very expensive. Cost effective mechanisms are investigated to treat this threatening issue. For that reason, bioremediation and biotechnology tools are introduced to help accelerate and remove the pollution caused by the contamination process. This paper demonstrated the importance of optimising the treatment conditions to the indigenous bacterial strain to obtain the highest biodegradation efficiency rates. The usage of biopile system technology was used with biostimulation and bioaugmentation processes. The indigenous Bacillus sonorensis (B. sonorensis) D1 bacterium played a crucial role in the biodegradation process when introduced to optimized conditions; carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus (C/N/P) (100/10/1), temperature (37 °C), surfactant tween 80 (0.12% (v/w)), and moisture (10%). Gas chromatography (mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector) (GC- (MS/FID)), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and colony-forming unit (CFU) analyses were performed. The diesel range organics (DRO) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) removal (%) of the weathered oil contaminated soil reached, after 160 days, 39.2% and 32.4% simultaneously when ammonium nitrate was used as a nitrogen source. Whereas urea inhibited the oil degradation process and caused the pH to rise to 9.55.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus sonorensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonium nitrate 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aflame ionization 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolysorbates 3asoil treatment 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3aurea 3aQatar 0aWeathered oil 0aBioremediation 0aBiotechnology 0aBiodegradation 0aBiostimulation and bioaugmentation 0aBacillus sonorensis1 aAl-Kaabi, Nasser1 aAl-Ghouti, Mohammad1 aZouari, Nabil0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 250 p.109455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1094553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013300173520109300306592002801399650001201427650002501439650001901464650002301483650001801506650002201524650002501546650002201571650002501593650002401618650001801642650001901660650000901679650001601688653001201704653001901716653001801735653002801753653001801781653001801799700001801817700002101835700002201856700001901878773011801897856008602015852000902101655001202110IND60662895920221120124655.0200228e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066289592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1094662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumder, Supriya14aThe impact of biochar on soil carbon sequestration: Meta-analytical approach to evaluating environmental and economic advantages  aSoil carbon (SC) is important for food security, ecosystem functioning, and environmental health, especially in light of global climate change. The physico-chemical character of biochar (pyrolyzed crop residue) has been shown to augment SC levels. This review systematically compares the environmental and economic benefits of applying crop residue versus biochar produced from crop residues to soils and the potential implications for SC sequestration. Crop residues enhance the mineralization rate of SC, while biochar can increase or decrease SC depending on the types of biochar/soil and duration. Therefore, converting crop residues to biochar may be more efficient for sequestering SC, but may/may not be more cost-effective. In this review, special emphasis is given to understanding the underlying mechanisms and biogeochemical processes of biochar production, in particular: surface (crystallinity), redox, and ability to control electron transfer reactions. By using meta-analytics, we determined the role of biochar compared to crop residue to enhance the status of organic SC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3acrop residues 3acrystal structure 3aecological footprint 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironmental health 3afinancial economics 3afood security 3amineralization 3asoil 3asoil carbon 0aBiochar 0aCarbon storage 0aCrop residues 0aGreenhouse gas emission 0aSequestration 0aMeta-analysis1 aNeogi, Surama1 aDutta, Tanushree1 aPowel, Michael A.1 aBanik, Pabitra0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 250 p.109466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1094663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009000171520132500261592002801586650002001614650002101634650001801655650001501673650001401688650002801702650001401730650001301744650002901757650001001786650001301796653003001809653002001839653001601859653001601875653001801891653001501909700002301924700002501947773010301972856008602075852000902161655001202170IND60646138320221119210826.0190719e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Farhan R.10aAcute and long-term toxicity of micronized car tire wear particles to Hyalella azteca  aEcotoxicological studies relating to tire wear particles (TWP) have focussed, up until very recently, almost entirely on the released leachate. Little is known about the toxicology effects of TWP dispersed in freshwater. In the present small-scale study we exposed Hyallela azteca to TWP dispersed in water with the aim of (i) determining the potential acute and chronic impacts of TWP exposure (ii) challenging the prevailing idea that tire leachate is the primary causative agent of tire-related toxicity. H. azteca were shown to indescriminately ingest TWP with a gut retention time of 24–48 h. Acute (48 h) TWP exposure followed an expected concentration-response curve from which an LC50 of 3426 ± 172 particles mL−1 was determined, but leachate exposure did not conform to a sigmoidal concentration-response pattern and therefore an LC50 was not derivable. However, toxicity profiles of TWP and leachate appeared to be sufficiently different as to suggest a dissimilar mechanism of toxicity. Mortality, reproductive output (neonate production) and net growth were all significantly impacted at the higher exposure concentrations (500–2000 particles mL−1) following 21 days exposure. Our study demonstrates that TWP exposure elicits short-term and longer-term toxicity on a key freshwater organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyalella azteca 3adigestive system 3aecotoxicology 3afreshwater 3aleachates 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aneonates 3areproductive performance 3atires 3atoxicity 0aTWP (tire wear particles) 0aTread particles 0aTire rubber 0aMicrorubber 0aTire leachate 0aFreshwater1 aHalle, Louise Lynn1 aPalmqvist, Annemette0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 Aug., v. 213 p.105216-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013400160500001900294520145100313592002801764650001801792650002301810650001701833650001001850650001401860650001201874650001701886650003201903650002401935650001601959650002401975650000901999650002102008650001602029650001102045650001302056650001402069650001602083650002302099650001102122650001102133650001802144650001602162700002402178700002002202773011902222856007302341852000902414655001202423IND60735315020221120180236.0210423e20210408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531502DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPander, Joachim 10aIntegration of Constructed Floodplain Ponds into Nature-Like Fish Passes Supports Fish Diversity in a Heavily Modified Water Body  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFish passes facilitate fish movement in fragmented river systems, yet they can also provide important habitat functions. This study investigated the fish community composition of different constructed habitat types (fluvial habitats, floodplain ponds) within fish passes in relation to habitat characteristics in order to deduce recommendations for fish-friendly designs of such structures. Fish community structures within passes differed significantly from those in the main river, comprising a high number of rheophilic species in fluvial habitats (Thymallus thymallus, Hucho hucho, Salmo trutta, Cottus gobio, Chondrostoma nasus, and Barbus barbus), and of stagnophilic species in floodplain ponds (Rhodeus amarus, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Misgurnus bipartitus, and Tinca tinca). During summer, floodplain ponds also provided important juvenile habitats for the target species C. nasus and B. barbus. Differences between the two habitat types in fish abundance were mostly explained by differences in macrophyte coverage, gravel, boulders, temperature, and current speed. The findings of this study stress the important habitat functions of fish passes. They also suggest that integration of diverse habitat structures, especially of currently hardly considered constructed floodplain ponds into fish passes, can greatly enhance their fish communities and contribute to the restoration of several declining target species of conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbus barbus 3aChondrostoma nasus 3aCottus gobio 3aHucho 3aMisgurnus 3aRhodeus 3aSalmo trutta 3aScardinius erythrophthalmus 3aThymallus thymallus 3aTinca tinca 3acommunity structure 3afish 3afish communities 3afloodplains 3agravel 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amacrophytes 3arheophilic species 3arivers 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature1 aNagel, Christoffer 1 aGeist, Juergen 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 08, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012900161500001900290520176500309592002802074650001302102650003102115650001002146650002702156650001602183650002202199650002702221650001002248651002202258700002302280700002102303700002202324700002002346700002502366773011902391856007302510852000902583655001202592IND60735315220221120180412.0210423e20210408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531522DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSbrocca, Claudia 10aHabitat-Diversity Relations between Sessile Macrobenthos and Benthic Copepods in the Rocky Shores of a Marine Protected Area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn rocky shore systems, sessile macrobenthic assemblages may act as “ecosystem engineers” for many smaller benthic organisms. Thus, the influence of macrobenthic coverage on the diversity and assemblage structure of the harpacticoid copepod fauna was investigated in the rocky shores of a Marine Protect Area (MPA) in the Ligurian Sea (NW, Mediterranean Sea). Two sampling sites were investigated in two seasons at three different depths on both sub-vertical and inclined reefs. A total of 61 species of copepods mainly represented by Miraciidae, Laophontidae, Longipediidae and Thalestridae were found. The complex micro-topography of these substrata provided a wide variety of niches for many species with different lifestyles that suggests the important role of rocky shores to ensure the functioning of coastal ecosystems. The harpacticoid assemblage structure seemed mainly influenced by season and depth. The temporal spread observed is likely one of the underlying mechanisms of niche segregation that allows many species to co-occur in this specific environment along with a subordinate spatial segregation corresponding to the depth gradient. The results seem to support the hypothesis that the different species composition of the “ecosystem engineer” (and consequently its structure changes) are relevant in structuring the copepod assemblages. The comparison with previous data on general meiofauna underlines that higher surrogacy of the taxonomic identification could be used to study rocky shore communities, but the rich diversity that these systems host can only be understood at the lower taxonomic levels. The same holds for future evaluations of impact of environmental changes (including MPA regulations) on meiofaunal assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aecological differentiation 3afauna 3amarine protected areas 3amicrorelief 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies identification 3awater 3aMediterranean Sea1 aDe Troch, Marleen 1 aLosi, Valentina 1 aGrassi, Eleonora 1 aBalsamo, Maria 1 aSemprucci, Federica 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 08, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010000159500001900259520129400278592002801572650002601600650002001626650001801646650001001664650001801674700002201692700001701714700002001731773011901751856007301870852000901943655001201952IND60735315320221120180339.0210423e20210408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531532DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xianglai 10aEnvironmental Hydraulics in the New Millennium: Historical Evolution and Recent Research Trends  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnvironmental Hydraulics (EH) is the scientific study of environmental water flows and their related transport and transformation processes in natural water systems. This review provides some remarks about the historical development of EH throughout three different paradigms or ages, namely, the Public Health Age, the Water Quality Age, and finally the Integrated Environmental Hydraulics Age. We further evaluate how EH research has changed in the last 20 years through a bibliometric analysis of the proceedings of the International Symposium on Environmental Hydraulics (ISEH) and Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFMC) journal articles conducted using Citespace and Leximancer. Authors and affiliations are analyzed to identify patterns of collaboration, followed by an analysis of the temporal evolution of the EFMC impact index as well as its highly-cited articles. Finally, the major EH topics are identified with a comparison between the topics extracted from the two different sources. As the EH field is becoming rapidly global, some topics were confirmed to have attracted more interest in EH such as Flow Condition, Numerical Modelling, Experimental Measurements. It is hoped that our findings could provide a reference for students, academics, and policy-makers related to EH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3afluid mechanics 3apublic health 3awater 3awater quality1 aGualtieri, Carlo 1 aLiu, Haifei 1 aShao, Dongdong 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 08, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013300155300001800288500001900306500002000325520157800345592002801923596006401951596007302015596007302088596007002161650002602231650001502257650000902272650002902281650001802310650001802328650001502346650001702361650002902378650001702407700001902424700005502443700006402498700005602562773013302618856007302751852000902824655001202833IND60733845920221119142627.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073384592DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.148582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeath, N.L.10aAntimicrobial activity of enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin against the urogenital pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Ureaplasma spp  ap. 1546-1551.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To determine the antimicrobial activity of enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Ureaplasma spp. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Burkholderia polyketide antibiotics enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin were tested against 14 N. gonorrhoeae and 10 Ureaplasma spp. isolates including multidrug‐resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates WHO V, WHO X and WHO Z as well as macrolide, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin‐resistant ureaplasmas. Susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae was carried out by agar dilution, whereas broth micro‐dilution and growth kinetic assays were used for Ureaplasma spp. The MIC range for enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin against N. gonorrhoeae was 0·015–0·06 mg l⁻¹ and 1–2 mg l⁻¹ respectively. The presence of resistance to front line antibiotics had no effect on MIC values. The MIC range for enacyloxin IIa against Ureaplasma spp. was 4–32 mg l⁻¹ with a clear dose‐dependent effect when observed using a growth kinetic assay. Gladiolin had no antimicrobial activity on Ureaplasma spp. at 32 mg l⁻¹ and limited impact on growth kinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Enacyloxin IIa and gladiolin antibiotics have antimicrobial activity against a range of antibiotic susceptible and resistant N. gonorrhoeae and Ureaplasma isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights the potential for a new class of antimicrobial against pathogens in which limited antibiotics are available. Development of these compounds warrants further investigation in the face of emerging extensively drug‐resistant strains.  aPublisher supplied data  aLSBF R2‐004cWelsh Government Life Sciences Bridging Fund  aBB/L021692/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/S007652/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cResearch and Innovation Services, Cardiff Metropolitan University 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aUreaplasma 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3adose response 3agrowth models 3amacrolides 3amicrobiology 3amultiple drug resistance 3atetracycline1 aRowlands, R.S.1 aWebster, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9530-78351 aMahenthiralingam, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9014-37901 aBeeton, M.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6292-07720 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 May, v. 130, no. 5 p.1546-1551dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.148583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245010300159300001800262500000900280500001500289520166500304592002801969650002201997650003202019650002202051650001702073650001002090650002702100653002402127653002602151653001102177700002002188700002202208700002002230700002802250773012002278852000902398856007702407655001202484IND4409223520221120125541.0191126e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440922352DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2007.01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchröder, Tom10aEffect of Local Soil Hydraulic Conductivity Drop Using a Three-Dimensional Root Water Uptake Model  ap. 1089-1098.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aThe coupling of soil and root water fluxes at the plant scale is a particularly challenging task. Numerical three-dimensional plant-scale models exist that consider these soil–root interactions. The influence of the hydraulic conductivity drop at the microscopic scale and especially the effect on root water uptake is not yet assessed in such models. In this study, an analytical approach describing the hydraulic conductivity drop from the bulk soil to the soil–root interface for a three-dimensional plant-scale model was derived and validated by numerical means. With these tools, quantification of the local hydraulic conductivity drop with time was possible. Furthermore, the effect of the hydraulic conductivity drop on the time occurrence of plant stress was evaluated. Root water uptake was assessed, with and without considering the hydraulic conductivity drop around single roots in a three-dimensional plant-scale model in terms of total water uptake at the root collar under different soil and root properties. It was shown that the total root water uptake was strongly affected, especially under conditions where the radial root hydraulic conductivity, which regulates root water uptake, was larger than the soil hydraulic conductivity, which regulates water flow in the soil. These findings were backed up by numerical validation of the model using mesh refinement. Incorporation of the hydraulic conductivity drop around individual roots in a three-dimensional plant-scale model can solve problems with greater accuracy for larger grid resolutions, and with smaller computational times, than not considering the hydraulic conductivity drop.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3aspatial variation 3awater uptake 3aroots 3ahydraulic conductivity 0amathematical models 0aplant-water relations 0aplants1 aJavaux, Mathieu1 aVanderborght, Jan1 aKörfgen, Bernd1 aVereecken, H.q(Harry),0 tVadose zone journal.g2008 Aug., v. 7, no. 3 p.1089-1098dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2007.01143Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03194naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245017900153300001800332500001900350500002000369520166000389592002802049596003902077596003302116596003402149650002102183650002802204650001502232650001802247650001702265650001702282650001402299650001302313650001402326650002202340650002502362650002602387650003702413700001802450700005302468773013302521856007302654852000902727655001202736IND60733846920221119142348.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073384692DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.148862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaran, S.10aEnhanced expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli by co‐expression with Vibrio parahaemolyticus CsgG, a pore‐forming protein of the curli biogenesis pathway  ap. 1611-1629.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To test whether engineered nanopores on the outer membrane (OM) of Escherichia coli can increase expression of heterologous proteins by making additional nutrients available to the host. METHODS AND RESULTS: Outer membrane nanopores were generated by expressing recombinant Vibrio parahaemolyticus CsgG (rVpCsgG), which spontaneously assembles into a pore‐forming channel on the OM, allowing spontaneous diffusion of small chemical entities from the exterior. Protein expression was probed using a reporter protein, sfGFP, expressed on a second compatible plasmid. OM pore formation was shown by acquired erythromycin sensitivity in cells transformed with rVpCsgG, influx of propidium iodide as well as by surface localization of recombinant CsgG by immunogold‐labeled transmission electron microscopy. Expression of recombinant CsgG showed increased growth and also enhanced expression of sfGFP in minimal medium and is due to both enhanced transcription as well as translation. Similar enhancement of expression was also observed for a number of different proteins of different origin, sizes and nature. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly demonstrate that engineered nanopores on the OM of E. coli enhance expression of different heterologous proteins in minimal medium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Vibrio parahaemolyticus CsgG β‐nanopore mediated co‐expression strategy to improve recombinant protein expression is fully compatible with other methods of protein expression enhancement, and therefore can be a useful tool in biotechnology particularly for whole‐cell bio‐transformations for production of secondary metabolite.  aPublisher supplied data  cIndian Council of Medical Research  aC600cUniversity of Michigan  aLSR12cUniversity of Michigan 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abiogenesis 3abiotechnology 3aerythromycin 3amicrobiology 3ananopores 3aplasmids 3apropidium 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3asecondary metabolites 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChoudhury, D.1 aDixit, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9761-77680 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 May, v. 130, no. 5 p.1611-1629dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.148863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013100158500001400289520159600303592002801899650001901927650001701946650001701963650001101980650002601991650001902017650002202036650001202058650001302070650001002083650001902093650001502112650001502127650001602142650004302158650001302201650001402214650001302228650002002241650002502261650001002286700002002296700002102316773012002337856007302457852000902530655001202539IND60721831020221118222251.0201224e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183102DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutere, Cyrus 10aFate of Trace Organic Compounds in Hyporheic Zone Sediments of Contrasting Organic Carbon Content and Impact on the Microbiome  aNAL-light  aThe organic carbon in streambed sediments drives multiple biogeochemical reactions, including the attenuation of organic micropollutants. An attenuation assay using sediment microcosms differing in the initial total organic carbon (TOC) revealed higher microbiome and sorption associated removal efficiencies of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) in the high-TOC compared to the low-TOC sediments. Overall, the combined microbial and sorption associated removal efficiencies of the micropollutants were generally higher than by sorption alone for all compounds tested except propranolol whose removal efficiency was similar via both mechanisms. Quantitative real-time PCR and time-resolved 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that higher bacterial abundance and diversity in the high-TOC sediments correlated with higher microbial removal efficiencies of most TrOCs. The bacterial community in the high-TOC sediment samples remained relatively stable against the stressor effects of TrOC amendment compared to the low-TOC sediment community that was characterized by a decline in the relative abundance of most phyla except Proteobacteria. Bacterial genera that were significantly more abundant in amended relative to unamended sediment samples and thus associated with biodegradation of the TrOCs included Xanthobacter, Hyphomicrobium, Novosphingobium, Reyranella and Terrimonas. The collective results indicated that the TOC content influences the microbial community dynamics and associated biotransformation of TrOCs as well as the sorption potential of the hyporheic zone sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyphomicrobium 3aSphingomonas 3aXanthobacter 3aassays 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3adecline 3adynamics 3agenes 3ahyporheic zone 3amicrobiome 3apollutants 3apropranolol 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3asediments 3asorption 3astream channels 3atotal organic carbon 3awater1 aPosselt, Malte 1 aHorn, Marcus  A.0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008000154300001800234500001900252500002000271520121700291592002801508596004101536596003001577650002901607650002901636650002101665650001101686650001301697650001701710650002301727650001201750650001501762650002501777700005401802700005801856773013301914856007302047852000902120655001202129IND60733848020221119142438.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073384802DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.148952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyani, B.10aHigh abundance of human herpesvirus 8 in wastewater from a large urban area  ap. 1402-1411.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: This study assesses the diversity and abundance of Human Herpesviruses (HHVs) in the influent of an urban wastewater treatment plant using shotgun sequencing, metagenomic analysis and qPCR. METHODS AND RESULTS: Influent wastewater samples were collected from the three interceptors that serve the City of Detroit and Wayne, Macomb and Oakland counties between November 2017 to February 2018. The samples were subjected to a series of processes to concentrate viruses which were further sequenced and amplified using qPCR. All nine types of HHV were detected in wastewater. Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV‐8), known as Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus, which is only prevalent in 5–10% of USA population, was found to be the most abundant followed by HHV‐3 or Varicella‐zoster virus. CONCLUSIONS: The high abundance of HHV‐8 in the Detroit metropolitan area may be attributed to the HIV‐AIDS outbreak that was ongoing in Detroit during the sampling period. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The approach described in this paper can be used to establish a baseline of viruses secreted by the community as a whole. Sudden changes in the baseline would identify changes in community health and immunity.  aPublisher supplied data  a1752773cNational Science Foundation  cMichigan State University 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 8 3acommunity health 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ametagenomics 3ametropolitan areas 3asarcoma 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aMcCall, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7516-83911 aXagoraraki, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8173-430X0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 May, v. 130, no. 5 p.1402-1411dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.148953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245015600165500001900321520115300340592002801493650001501521650001201536650001801548650001101566650001801577650001601595650001401611650001201625650003101637650001001668650002001678700002601698700003101724700003701755700001801792773011901810856007301929852000902002655001202011IND60735318420221120180355.0210423e20210411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531842DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlharbi, Wafa  Nazzal10aExtraction of Organic Volatile Pollutants in Over-Saturated Water by Pervaporation Technique Using a Poly (Dimethylsiloxane)-Based Sealer as a Membrane  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSILICONE1200 is an inexpensive domestic poly (dimethylsiloxane)-based sealer that was used in this study to remove volatile organic compounds from over-saturated water using the pervaporation technique. A series of volatile organic liquid compounds representing an important part of polluting organic products released every day in water were chosen for this study. These products were alkyl halides (chloroform), aromatics (toluene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (heptanes), ketones and aldehydes (butanone), and organosulfides (thiophene). The mass transfer of these compounds and their mixtures through the SILICONE1200 membrane was assessed to predict the results of the separation process. The results indicate that the mechanism of diffusion obeyed a Fickian model. Different parameters affecting the pervaporation results, such as the membrane thickness, stirring rate, and temperature, were examined to determine the optimal conditions in terms of the total flux and selectivity. The optimized parameters were then applied to the separation of an organic mixture from polluted water using the dynamic pervaporation process with promising results.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroform 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apervaporation 3atemperature 3athiophene 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater 3awater pollution1 aSaeed, Waseem  Sharaf1 aAlwarthan, Abdulrahman  A.1 aBadjah-Hadj-Ahmed, Ahmed  Yacine1 aAouak, Taieb 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 11, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245015200165500001900317520120100336592002801537650002501565650001201590650001901602650002401621650001201645650001001657650002301667651003701690700002801727700002101755700002001776773011901796856007301915852000901988655001201997IND60735318520221120180454.0210423e20210411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531852DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Redal, Ruben 10aWillingness to Pay for Improved Operations and Maintenance Services of Gravity-Fed Water Schemes in Idjwi Island (Democratic Republic of the Congo)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping understanding of the economic value that communities ascribe to improved operations and maintenance (O&M) services has emerged as a key factor in achieving financial sustainability for rural water systems. The present study elicits household willingness to pay (WTP) for improved O&M services in eight gravity-fed water schemes in Idjwi Island (Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC). A contingent valuation survey was implemented through an open-ended format questionnaire to 1105 heads of household and a log-linear regression model was employed to assess the factors influencing higher values. Findings show an average willingness to pay of 327 Congolese Francs (CDF) per month and 36 CDF per bucket. Results also indicate a significant WTP differential among studied schemes. The analysis of the conditioning factors reveals that the level of excludability, the participation in management meetings and the time employed in fetching water from an improved source are contingent with their WTP. The findings of this study are important for development agents trying to establish acceptable, affordable and practicable tariffs that help finance reliable rural water systems in Idjwi.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3afinance 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awater 3awillingness to pay 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aArana-Landín, Germán 1 aLandeta, Beñat 1 aLarumbe, Jaime 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 11, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245010600203300001800309500002000327520155300347592002801900596003201928596004301960596003902003596007902042596001702121596006402138596003802202596002902240650002202269650001202291650001302303650002902316650001902345650001102364650001102375700005902386700006602445700005802511700005802569700005802627700007102685700006302756773012502819856007902944852000903023655001203032IND60733849320221119142649.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073384932DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.133242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeller, Rasmus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6583-692312aA reference‐free approach to analyse RADseq data using standard next generation sequencing toolkits  ap. 1085-1097.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGenotyping‐by‐sequencing methods such as RADseq are popular for generating genomic and population‐scale data sets from a diverse range of organisms. These often lack a usable reference genome, restricting users to RADseq specific software for processing. However, these come with limitations compared to generic next generation sequencing (NGS) toolkits. Here, we describe and test a simple pipeline for reference‐free RADseq data processing that blends de novo elements from STACKS with the full suite of state‐of‐the art NGS tools. Specifically, we use the de novo RADseq assembly employed by STACKS to create a catalogue of RAD loci that serves as a reference for read mapping, variant calling and site filters. Using RADseq data from 28 zebra sequenced to ~8x depth‐of‐coverage we evaluate our approach by comparing the site frequency spectra (SFS) to those from alternative pipelines. Most pipelines yielded similar SFS at 8x depth, but only a genotype likelihood based pipeline performed similarly at low sequencing depth (2–4x). We compared the RADseq SFS with medium‐depth (~13x) shotgun sequencing of eight overlapping samples, revealing that the RADseq SFS was persistently slightly skewed towards rare and invariant alleles. Using simulations and human data we confirm that this is expected when there is allelic dropout (AD) in the RADseq data. AD in the RADseq data caused a heterozygosity deficit of ~16%, which dropped to ~5% after filtering AD. Hence, AD was the most important source of bias in our RADseq data.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐10‐LABX‐41cLabex  aANR‐11‐IDEX‐545 0002‐02cLabex  aR215‐2015‐4174cLundbeckfonden  aCEBA, ref. 548 ANR‐10‐LABX‐25‐01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  cLIA BEEG‐B  aSFRH/BD/64875/2009cFundacao para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  a5094cEuropean Science Foundation  aVKR023447cVillum Fonden 3acomputer software 3aecology 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3azebras1 aNursyifa, Casia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7803-96641 aGarcia‐Erill, Genís1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3150-17081 aSalmona, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1950-58051 aChikhi, Lounes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1140-07181 aMeisner, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9540-66731 aKorneliussen, Thorfinn Sand1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7576-53801 aAlbrechtsen, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7306-031X0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.1085-1097dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.133243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245010800207300001800315500002000333520135300353592002801706596010101734596004801835596007201883596003601955596005801991596004202049650001302091650001402104650001702118650001502135650001302150650001102163650001302174650002202187650001602209700005802225700005902283700006302342700005902405700005802464773012502522856007902647852000902726655001202735IND60733849520221119141917.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073384952DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.133222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernette, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4784-960514aThe Ocean barcode atlas: A web service to explore the biodiversity and biogeography of marine organisms  ap. 1347-1358.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Ocean Barcode Atlas (OBA) is a user friendly web service designed for biologists who wish to explore the biodiversity and biogeography of marine organisms locked in otherwise difficult to mine planetary scale DNA metabarcode data sets. Using just a web browser, a comprehensive picture of the diversity of a taxon or a barcode sequence is visualized graphically on world maps and interactive charts. Interactive results panels allow dynamic threshold adjustments and the display of diversity results in their environmental context measured at the time of sampling (temperature, oxygen, latitude, etc). Ecological analyses such as alpha and beta‐diversity plots are produced via publication quality vector graphics representations. Currently, the Ocean Barcode Altas is deployed online with the (i) Tara Oceans eukaryotic 18S‐V9 rDNA metabarcodes; (ii) Tara Oceans 16S/18S rRNA ₘᵢTags; and (iii) 16S‐V4 V5 metabarcodes collected during the Malaspina‐2010 expedition. Additional prokaryotic or eukaryotic plankton barcode data sets will be added upon availability, given they provide the required complement of barcodes (including raw reads to compute barcode abundance) associated with their contextual environmental variables.

It became an invasive species after being introduced to North America and Europe as a pest control agent. Though two genome assemblies for this insect have been previously reported, a high‐quality genome assembly at the chromosome level is still not available. Here, we obtained a new chromosome‐level genome assembly of H. axyridis by combining various sequencing technologies, namely Illumina short reads, PacBio long reads, 10X Genomics and Hi‐C. The chromosome‐level genome assembly is 423 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 45.92 Mb. Using Hi‐C data 1,897 scaffolds were anchored to eight chromosomes. A total of 730,068 repeat sequences were identified, making up 51.2% of the assembled genome. After masking these repeat sequences, we annotated 22,810 protein‐encoding genes. The X chromosome and Y‐linked scaffolds were also identified by resequencing male and female genomes and calculating the male to female coverage ratios. Two gene families associated with environmental adaptation, odorant receptor and cytochrome P450, were analysed and showed no obvious expansion in H. axyridis. We successfully constructed a putative biosynthesis pathway of harmonine, a defence compound in the haemolymph of H. axyridis, which is a key factor for H. axyridis strong immunity. The chromosome‐level genome assembly of H. axyridis is a helpful resource for studies of beetle biology and invasive biology.  aPublisher supplied data  aQNJJ201725cYouth Scientific Research Funds of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a2016YFC1200602cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2017YFC1200602cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2017YFD0201000cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2018YFD0200402cNational Key Research and Development Program  aLZ18C060001cZhejiang Science Foundation of China 3aHarmonia axyridis 3abiosynthesis 3acytochrome P-450 3afemales 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3ahemolymph 3aimmunity 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3amales 3anatural enemies 3aodorant receptors 3apest control 3apesticides 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aMei, Yang1 aChen, Xu1 aChen, Xi1 aXiao, Da1 aHe, Kang1 aLi, Qiang1 aWu, Mengmeng1 aWang, Su1 aZhang, Fan1 aLi, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8410-52500 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.1318-1332dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.133423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245011800210300001800328500002000346520152100366592002801887596003401915650001801949650002201967650001701989650002202006650002302028650001002051650001502061650002802076650002302104700005802127700001802185700007002203700005702273700006102330773012502391856007902516852000902595655001202604IND60733850120221119140859.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385012DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.133292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstensmo, Eva Lena F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6215-316614aThe influence of intraspecific sequence variation during DNA metabarcoding: A case study of eleven fungal species  ap. 1141-1148.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDNA metabarcoding has become a powerful approach for analysing complex communities from environmental samples, but there are still methodological challenges limiting its full potential. While conserved DNA markers, like 16S and 18S, often are not able to discriminate among closely related species, other more variable markers – like the fungal ITS region, may include considerable intraspecific variation, which can lead to oversplitting of species during DNA metabarcoding analyses. Here we assessed the effects of intraspecific sequence variation in DNA metabarcoding by analysing local populations of eleven fungal species. We investigated the allelic diversity of ITS2 haplotypes using both Sanger sequencing and high throughput sequencing (HTS) coupled with error correction with the software dada2. All the eleven species, except one, included some level of intraspecific variation in the ITS2 region. Overall, we observed a high correspondence between haplotypes generated by Sanger sequencing and HTS, with the exception of a few additional haplotypes detected using either approach. These extra haplotypes, typically occurring in low frequencies, were probably due to PCR and sequencing errors or intragenomic variation in the rDNA region. The presence of intraspecific (and possibly intragenomic) variation in ITS2 suggest that haplotypes (or ASVs) should not be used as basic units in ITS‐based fungal community analyses, but an extra clustering step is needed to approach species‐level resolution.  aPublisher supplied data  a254746cNorges Forskningsråd 3aDNA barcoding 3aallelic variation 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahaplotypes 3aintraspecific variation 3asequence diversity1 aMaurice, Sundy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5376-09811 aMorgado, Luis1 aMartin‐Sanchez, Pedro M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2674-86501 aSkrede, Inger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1113-74031 aKauserud, Håvard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2780-60900 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.1141-1148dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.133293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007900160500001400239520132600253592002801579650001901607650001701626650001901643650002701662650001801689650001501707650001001722650002101732650001601753651001201769651001201781651001101793651001301804700002701817773012001844856007301964852000902037655001202046IND60721833620221118222535.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183362DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomczyk, Paweł 10aChallenges in the Development of Hydropower in Selected European Countries  aNAL-light  aHydropower in Europe is playing an increasingly important role as a renewable source of energy. Its share of the final energy consumption varies from country to country, posing different challenges in each. The European Union member states are obliged, according to energy policy, to increase the share of renewable energy. This article presents the challenges related to the development of hydropower in four countries with different shares of domestic electricity production from hydropower plants: Albania (100% share in 2019), Slovenia (25.7%), Poland (1.1%), and Estonia (0.3%). Particular attention is paid to the issues of rational management of water resources in connection to Europe’s energy policy. As a result of the case study analysis, the challenges in the development of hydropower are identified, as well as ways to solve them. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of social, economic, environmental and climate change factors on the development of hydropower was conducted. At present, whether the assumed goals of the European Union’s energy policy will be achieved is impossible to determine for the whole of Europe. Achieving these goals will be possible only after individual countries prepare comprehensive reports on the topics of renewable energy sources, including hydropower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3aobjectives 3awater 3awater management 3awater power 3aAlbania 3aEstonia 3aPoland 3aSlovenia1 aWiatkowski, Mirosław 0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156500001400268520179000282592002802072650002602100650002002126650002002146650001202166650001402178650000902192650001102201650001602212650001502228650001602243650001002259650002102269650001502290651001802305651002802323651001002351651002802361700002102389773012002410856007302530852000902603655001202612IND60721833720221118222620.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183372DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezak, Nejc 10aChanges in the Compound Drought and Extreme Heat Occurrence in the 1961–2018 Period at the European Scale  aNAL-light  aCompound extreme weather events can cause large economic damage and endanger human lives. Therefore, identification of changes in such compound event frequency and magnitude is important information that could be useful for decision makers and practitioners in water management and agriculture sector. This is especially the case for dry hazards that can be significantly influenced by the increasing air temperature and can have significant impact on water availability and consumption as well as on agricultural production. This study investigated changes in the compound occurrence of drought and extreme heat at the European scale using Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses (UERRA) regional reanalysis data for the 1961–2018 period. The effective drought index (EDI) and the air temperature percentile threshold were used for the identification of the compound events at the catchment scale where entire Europe was divided into more than 4000 catchments. The results revealed multiple hotspots of compound drought and extreme heat events such as parts of Western Europe, Italy, Balkan Peninsula and Northern and Eastern Europe. At the continental scale, no uniform trend pattern could be detected. However, multiple areas with either positive or negative changes were identified. A positive change was characteristic for parts of Western Europe, Italy, Balkan Peninsula, etc. In these cases, the trend was mostly driven by the decreasing total precipitation trend and was not directly affected by the increasing air temperature trend. Areas with negative changes include parts of Northern and Eastern Europe and British Isles. In these cases, the detected trend was mostly driven by an increasing total precipitation trend. However, local drivers could be different.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aair temperature 3adecision making 3adrought 3afrequency 3aheat 3ahumans 3ainformation 3aoccurrence 3auncertainty 3awater 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aBritish Isles 3aEastern European region 3aItaly 3aWestern European region1 aMikoš, Matjaž,0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009800163300001800261500002000279520166000299592002801959596005901987596005902046596005902105596005502164596005502219650002302274650002102297650001702318650001702335650001402352650001202366650001402378650001202392650001302404650001202417650001002429650001202439650001002451650002202461700002202483700001902505700002102524700001402545700002002559700006102579773012502640856007902765852000902844655001202853IND60733850320221119140713.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385032DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.133282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Yu‐Xuan10aChromosome‐level assembly of the brown planthopper genome with a characterized Y chromosome  ap. 1287-1298.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHundreds of insect genome sequences have been reported; however, most sequencing projects have not determined the sex chromosomes, and no Y chromosomes from a heterometabolous insect have been identified and characterized to date. The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is the most economically damaging pest to rice and is also an ideal research subject for paddy ecology and functional genomics. We previously assembled a draft female genome mainly using second‐generation sequencing technologies, with a contig N50 of only 24 kb, due to the large size and excessive repetitive regions in the N. lugens genome. Here, we utilize third‐generation sequencing technologies and Hi‐C data to generate a high‐quality male N. lugens assembly with a contig N50 of 1.01 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 69.96 Mb and more than 95.6% of the assembled bases located on 16 chromosomes. Fourteen autosomes and two sex chromosomes (X + Y) were identified, filling in the gap related to the Y chromosome in heterometabolous insects. A total of 18,021 protein‐coding genes and 6423 long‐noncoding RNAs were predicted with full‐length cDNA sequencing data. All 315 of the Y chromosome genes (Y‐genes) were derived from autosomal and X‐chromosome duplications. Large‐scale RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted against the N. lugens Y‐genes, demonstrating that 7 Y‐genes were essential for normal BPH development or male organ development, suggesting the importance of Y‐genes. The first identified Y chromosome in heterometabolous insects will help gain more insight into sex determination, fertility and chromosome evolution.  aPublisher supplied data  a31630057cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31871954cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31900361cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018M642453cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2019T120523cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aRNA interference 3aX chromosome 3aY chromosome 3aautosomes 3aecology 3aevolution 3afemales 3agenomics 3ainsects 3amales 3apaddies 3apests 3asex determination1 aZhang, Hou‐Hong1 aLi, Dan‐Ting1 aZhuo, Ji‐Chong1 aShen, Yan1 aHu, Qing‐Ling1 aZhang, Chuan‐Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7784-11880 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.1287-1298dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.133283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00974naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006000158500002900218520013500247592002800382650002200410650001100432650002100443650001000464650002100474773011900495856007300614852000900687655001200696IND60735319920221120184844.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073531992DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrote, Luis 10aWater Resources Management Models for Policy Assessment  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aWater resources management models support a variety of research applications, including the assessment of water availability [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aresearch support 3awater 3awater management0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245009700162300001800259500000900277500001500286520191900301592002802220650002202248650002302270650001702293650002502310650002902335650002602364650001502390650001702405650001002422650002202432653002402454773012002478852000902598856007702607655001202684IND4409224520221120115509.0191126e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440922452DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2007.01192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenk, H. Jochen14aThe Shallowest Possible Water Extraction Profile: A Null Model for Global Root Distributions  ap. 1119-1124.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aThe factors that shape vertical root distributions in different soils and under different climates and vegetation are poorly understood. This makes it difficult to parameterize root profiles in vegetation-, hydrology, biogeochemistry-, or global circulation models. Recently, it has been proposed that vertical root distributions in the vadose zone could be predicted from soil water infiltration and extraction patterns as a function of climatic variability, soil, and vegetation characteristics. A number of ecological factors favor shallow over deep roots, suggesting that root profiles of plant communities may tend to be as shallow as possible and as deep as needed to fulfill evapotranspirational demands. To test this hypothesis, a stochastic, one-dimensional soil water infiltration and extraction model (SWIEM) was developed that simulates soil water infiltration through 600 discrete soil layers to a depth of 6 m. Water input is simulated in Monte Carlo fashion based on site-specific long-term precipitation data. Water extraction proceeds from the top down, with extraction depths determined by potential evapotranspiration (PET) and the vertical distribution of soil water. The resulting shallowest possible water extraction profile was tested against nine measured root profiles from long-term ecological research sites in different biomes. Two other approaches, based on mean root distributions for biomes and an empirical regression model, were also compared to the observed root distributions. Soil water extraction patterns predicted by the SWIEM model matched observed vertical root distributions better than the other two approaches. These findings show that vertical root distributions in different biomes tend to approach the shallowest possible shape, thereby creating a useful null model for future research on root distributions and a promising tool for parameterization of global models.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3aroot systems 3aspatial distribution 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aplant-water relations 3asoil water 3awater uptake 3aroots 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models0 tVadose zone journal.g2008 Aug., v. 7, no. 3 p.1119-1124dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2007.01193Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03566naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245012600198300001800324500002000342520150900362592002801871596007201899596011101971596005502082596005902137596005902196596005902255596005902314650000902373650002002382650001602402650001502418650001202433650001402445650001002459650002002469650002902489650001002518650001002528700005902538700005102597700001902648700005702667700005502724700005602779773012502835856007902960852000903039655001203048IND60733850920221119140714.0210413e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385092DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.133192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Bin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0272-325612aA large genome with chromosome‐scale assembly sheds light on the evolutionary success of a true toad (Bufo gargarizans)  ap. 1256-1273.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present a high‐quality genome assembly for the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and explore the evolution of several large gene families in amphibians. With a large genome assembly size of 4.55 Gb, the chromosome‐scale assembly includes 747 scaffolds with an N50 of 539.8 Mb and 1.79% gaps. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) constitute a high proportion of the genome and their expansion is a key contributor to the inflated genome size in this species. This is very different from other small amphibian genomes, but similar to that of the enormous axolotl genome. The genome retains a large number of duplicated genes, with tandem (TD) and proximal duplications (PD) the predominant mode of duplication. A total of 122 gene families have undergone significant expansion and were mainly enriched in sensory perception of smell and bitter taste. The CYP2C subfamily, which plays an important role in metabolic detoxification, specifically expanded via TD and PD in the Asiatic toad and the cane toad (true toads). Most of Na⁺/K⁺‐ATPase genes experienced accelerated evolution along Bufonid lineages and two amino acid sites involving toad‐toxin resistance were found to experience positive selection. We also revealed a dynamic evolution of olfactory and vomeronasal receptor gene families which was likely driven by the water‐to‐land transition. The high‐quality genome of the Asiatic toad will provide a solid foundation to understand the genetic basis of its many biological processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a400479cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a2019–2023cBiodiversity Survey, Monitoring and Assessment Project of Ministry of Ecology and Environment  a18YYJC0171cSichuan Science and Technology Program  a31572245cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31600104cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31729003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31872220cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBufo 3aRhinella marina 3aamino acids 3abitterness 3aecology 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3ametabolic detoxification 3asmell 3atoads1 aJiang, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1051-77971 aWu, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9883-40911 aChen, Xiaohong1 aSong, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6146-33811 aLiao, Wenbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5303-41141 aFu, Jinzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4168-507X0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.1256-1273dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.133193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245012900172500001400301520131700315592002801632650002901660650001501689650002801704650001501732650002401747650001801771650001601789650001401805650001001819650001501829650001101844650001001855700003101865700003301896700002901929773012001958856007302078852000902151655001202160IND60721834420221118222517.0201224e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183442DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Carlos  E.

Considering the combination of the high volume of toxicological and ecotoxicological data produced and the application of artificial intelligence algorithms from the last few years, not only can higher mechanistic interpretability be reached with new in silico models, but also a potential increase in predictivity in hazard assessments and the identification of new potential biomarkers can be achieved. The current paper aims to discuss some potential challenges and ways of integrating in silico models and AOPs to predict toxicological effects and to set and relate new biomarkers for defined purposes. With the use of the AOP framework to organize the ecotoxicological, toxicological, and structural data generated from in chemico, in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo, and population studies, it is expected that the generated biological and chemical construct will improve its application, establishing a knowledge platform to set and relate new biomarkers by key event relationships (KERs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse outcome pathways 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abiomarkers 3acomputer simulation 3aecotoxicology 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3apaper 3apopulation 3avolume 3awater1 aMiranda, Raul  Ghiraldelli1 aOliveira, Danielle Palma de,1 aDorta, Daniel Junqueira,0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 17, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245010200166500001900268520135600287592002801643650002401671650002101695650001601716650001501732650002001747650001901767650001301786650002401799650001901823650001001842650002001852650002001872650001501892651001301907700002001920700002701940700002001967700001701987700002202004700002202026700001902048700002902067773011902096856007302215852000902288655001202297IND60735320720221118035944.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073532072DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamil, Muhammad  Ahmad10aExperimental Investigations of a Solar Water Treatment System for Remote Desert Areas of Pakistan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPakistan is among the countries that have already crossed the water scarcity line, and the situation is worsened due to the recent pandemic. This is because the major budget of the country is shifted to primary healthcare activities from other development projects that included water treatment and transportation infrastructure. Consequently, water-borne diseases have increased drastically in the past few months. Therefore, there is a dire need to address this issue on a priority basis to ameliorate the worsening situation. One possible solution is to shift the focus/load from mega-projects that require a plethora of resources, money, and time to small domestic-scale systems for water treatment. For this purpose, domestic-scale solar stills are designed, fabricated, and tested in one of the harshest climatic condition areas of Pakistan, Rahim Yar Khan. A comprehensive overview of the regional climatology, including wind speed, solar potential, and ambient temperature is presented for the whole year. The analysis shows that the proposed system can adequately resolve the drinking water problems of deprived areas of Pakistan. The average water productivity of 1.5 L/d/m² is achieved with a total investment of PKR 3000 (<$20). This real site testing data will serve as a guideline for similar system design in other arid areas globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatology 3aguidelines 3ahealth services 3ainfrastructure 3apandemic 3asystems engineering 3atransportation 3awater 3awater shortages 3awater treatment 3awind speed 3aPakistan1 aYaqoob, Haseeb 1 aFarooq, Muhammad  Umar1 aTeoh, Yew  Heng1 aXu, Ben  Bin1 aMahkamov, Khamid 1 aSultan, Muhammad 1 aNg, Kim Choon,1 aShahzad, Muhammad  Wakil0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014400161500001900305520136700324592002801691650002101719650001201740650001101752650002401763650001301787650001301800650001601813650002201829650001001851651001701861700002501878700002101903700002001924773011901944856007302063852000902136655001202145IND60735320920221118035849.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073532092DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavičić, Mišo 10aPopulation Characteristics of the European Lobster, Homarus gammarus in the Adriatic Sea: Implications for Sustainable Fisheries Management  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe European lobster, Homarus gammarus, was sampled from September 2016 to August 2017, using pots and gillnets in the Eastern Adriatic Sea. Official landings were also analyzed (2008–2020). The majority of landings were from the Northern Adriatic and showed an increase of 18.5% over the study period. Results revealed an extremely low catch rate that fluctuated significantly by season. Dominance by specimens in the size classes of 90–110 mm carapace length (CL) was observed. Experimental design revealed spatial heterogeneity, with larger individuals caught further from the coast (>3 nm) and undersized specimens caught near the coast (<3 nm). With increasing CL and total length (TL), an increase in weight was higher in males than females. TL and abdomen width (AW) increased linearly with CL and were more pronounced in females. At 80 mm CL, females started to develop secondary sex characteristics with wider AW than males. The results suggest that the modern legal framework is appropriate for lobster fisheries and a longer fishing season is not advisable, despite a positive catch trend in the northern part of the sea. Additional efforts are desirable to reduce fishing pressure in the coastal part. The morphometric relationships could reveal population characteristics required as inputs in stock assessment analysis for effective management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus gammarus 3aabdomen 3acoasts 3aexperimental design 3agillnets 3alobsters 3amorphometry 3aspatial variation 3awater 3aAdriatic Sea1 aMatić-Skoko, Sanja 1 aVrdoljak, Dario 1 aVujević, Ante 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010300153500001900256520168500275592002801960650002401988650001202012650001102024650001102035650001102046650002402057650001202081650001002093650002302103650002002126650002502146651001002171700001202181700001902193700001502212700001802227700002102245700002002266773011902286856007302405852000902478655001202487IND60735321020221118035913.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073532102DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Bing 10aPricing Strategy for Residential Water in Drought Years. Application to the City of Tianjin, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn drought years, most residents fail to improve water use efficiency due to residential water supply normally being prioritized in many regions, which makes other low-priority industrial water users suffer more from water shortage. This paper proposes a Pricing Strategy for Residential Water (PSRW), a water tariff that changes on annual time scale, based on the scarcity value of water resources, aiming to promote residential water conservation and reallocate water resources across the residential and industrial sectors during droughts. An optimization model to maximize the total benefit of residents and industrial sectors is introduced based on marginal benefit and price elasticity. The water shortage of industrial sectors is used to reflect the scarcity of water resources, and the lowest water supply standard for households and the maximum proportion of household water fee expenditure (HWFE) to household disposable income (HDI) are used to ensure the residents’ acceptability to price raising. It shows an “S-type” relationship between the optimal price raising coefficient and industrial water shortage, and two turning points are found in the curve, which are the starting and stopping points of price raising. The appearance of starting point depends on the non-negative net benefit, and the stopping point is affected by the factors that represent the residents’ acceptability to price raising. The application to Tianjin, a city in northern China with the rapid growth of population and economy but scarce water resources, shows PSRW is a potential means to improve water efficiency and optimize water resource allocation in water scarcity situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademand elasticities 3adrought 3aincome 3amodels 3aprices 3aresource allocation 3atariffs 3awater 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aLi, Yu 1 aChu, Jinggang 1 aDing, Wei 1 aFu, Guangtao 1 aLeng, Xiangyang 1 aYang, Tiantian 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008800164500001400252520182000266592002802086650002402114650001302138650001302151650002202164650001502186650001602201650002002217650001102237650001502248650000902263650001102272650001102283650002302294650001602317650001102333650001802344650001702362650001602379650001502395651001202410651001802422773012002440856007302560852000902633655001202642IND60721835720221118051833.0201224e20201218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183572DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtloff, Charles R.,10aWater Engineering at Precolumbian AD 600–1100 Tiwanaku’s Urban Center (Bolivia)  aNAL-light  aThe pre-Columbian World Heritage site of Tiwanaku (AD 600–1100) located in highland altiplano Bolivia is shown to have a unique urban water supply system with many advanced hydraulic and hydrological features. By use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of the city water system, new revelations as to the complexity of the water system are brought forward. The water system consists of a perimeter drainage channel surrounding the ceremonial center of the city. A network of surface canals and subterranean channels connected to the perimeter drainage channel are supplied by multiple canals from a rainfall collection reservoir. The perimeter drainage channel provides rapid draining of rainy season rainfall runoff together with aquifer drainage of intercepted rainfall; water collected in the perimeter drainage channel is then directed to the Tiwanaku River then on to Lake Titicaca. During the dry season aquifer drainage continues into the perimeter drainage channel; additional water is directed into the drainage channel from a recently discovered, reservoir connected M channel. Two subterranean channels beneath the ceremonial center were supplied by M channel water delivered into the perimeter drainage channel that served to remove waste from the ceremonial center structures conveyed to the nearby Tiwanaku River. From control of the water supply to/from the perimeter drainage channel during wet and dry seasonal changes, stabilization of the deep groundwater level was achieved—this resulted in the stabilization of monumental ceremonial structure’s foundations, a continuous water supply to inner city agricultural zones, water pools for urban use and health benefits for the city population through moisture level reduction in city ceremonial and secular urban housing structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural zoning 3aaquifers 3adrainage 3adrainage channels 3adry season 3aengineering 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3apopulation 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3aseasonal variation 3aurban areas 3awastes 3awater content 3awater supply 3awater table 3awet season 3aBolivia 3aLake Titicaca0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006300157500001400220520132600234592002801560650001701588650001701605650001701622650001201639650001901651650001901670650001801689650001701707650002001724650000901744650001801753650002001771650001701791650001101808650001401819650001201833650002001845700002301865700002601888700001901914700001901933700002201952773012001974856007302094852000902167655001202176IND60721835820221118052023.0201224e20201218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183582DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingbo 10aProduced Water Desalination via Pervaporative Distillation  aNAL-light  aHerein, we report on the performance of a hybrid organic-ceramic hydrophilic pervaporation membrane applied in a vacuum membrane distillation operating mode to desalinate laboratory prepared saline waters and a hypersaline water modeled after a real oil and gas produced water. The rational for performing “pervaporative distillation” is that highly contaminated waters like produced water, reverse osmosis concentrates and industrial have high potential to foul and scale membranes, and for traditional porous membrane distillation membranes they can suffer pore-wetting and complete salt passage. In most of these processes, the hard to treat feed water is commonly softened and filtered prior to a desalination process. This study evaluates pervaporative distillation performance treating: (1) NaCl solutions from 10 to 240 g/L at crossflow Reynolds numbers from 300 to 4800 and feed-temperatures from 60 to 85 °C and (2) a real produced water composition chemically softened to reduce its high-scale forming mineral content. The pervaporative distillation process proved highly-effective at desalting all feed streams, consistently delivering <10 mg/L of dissolved solids in product water under all operating condition tested with reasonably high permeate fluxes (up to 23 LMH) at optimized operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcentrates 3adesalination 3adistillation 3ahybrids 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrophilicity 3ahypersalinity 3alaboratories 3amineral content 3aoils 3apervaporation 3areverse osmosis 3asaline water 3asolids 3asolutions 3astreams 3awater pollution1 aTanuwidjaja, Dian 1 aBhattacharjee, Subir 1 aEdalat, Arian 1 aJassby, David 1 aHoek, Eric  M.

We use the leave-one-out cross-validation approach to assess the performance of the methods. Second, we evaluate the influence of the density of measurement points over the interpolation error for the cited methods. Third, we assess the performance of drainage systems and their impacts on crop productivity as a result of cumulative rainfall. Results along with practical considerations show that TPS is the best interpolator for WTD and this superiority is maintained and further demonstrated through a sensitivity analysis of the methods to spatial sampling density, i.e., partitioning the data into subsets of 25, 50, and 75% of the dataset. However, the random approach for selecting these subsets shows an unexpected result; that is, the interpolation methods exhibit a higher performance in terms of the Pearson correlation (r) for the 25% data subset at Farm B. Meanwhile, the cumulative precipitation over a three-day period, the maximum time required to return the soil matric potential to the optimal value after a major rainfall event, had a steady influence on WTD and thus crop productivity in the studied farms. This influence is more apparent for Farm A, but a rather random effect is noted for Farm B. This study presents a water-management-based strategy that mitigates the supplementary cost and effort for sensor deployment in water table monitoring for cranberry production. It is therefore of practical interest to cranberry growers and decision-makers who aim to maximize yields through water-management-oriented strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acorrelation 3acranberries 3adata collection 3adecision making 3adensity 3adepth 3adrainage systems 3aexhibitions 3afarms 3agrowers 3akriging 3ameasurement 3amonitoring 3apaper 3arain 3asampling 3asoil matric potential 3aspatial variation 3asubsurface irrigation 3awater 3awater table 3awells 3ayields 3aQuebec1 aGumiere, Silvio  Jose1 aLafond, Jonathan  A.1 aGumiere, Thiago 1 aGallichand, Jacques 1 aRousseau, Alain  N.0 tWater.g2020 Nov. 26, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121233223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002700117024003000144040001800174100001700192245012800209300001800337520128400355592002801639596000901667650001401676650001901690650002001709650003001729650001301759650001401772650001101786650001501797650002401812650001601836700002101852700002201873700002201895773014401917856011402061856007302175961000902248852000902257655001202266IND60733853220221119140549.0220901e20140313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385322DNAL7 a10113/73385322hdl7 a10.1021/jp500258h2doi7 a10.1021/jp500258h2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Manoj10aCriegee Intermediate Reaction with CO: Mechanism, Barriers, Conformer-Dependence, and Implications for Ozonolysis Chemistry  ap. 1887-1894.  aDensity functional theory and transition state theory rate constant calculations have been performed to gain insight into the bimolecular reaction of the Criegee intermediate (CI) with carbon monoxide (CO) that is proposed to be important in both atmospheric and industrial chemistry. A new mechanism is suggested in which the CI acts as an oxidant by transferring an oxygen atom to the CO, resulting in the formation of a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone depending upon the CI) and carbon dioxide. Fourteen different CIs, including ones resulting from biogenic ozonolysis, are considered. Consistent with previous reports for other CI bimolecular reactions, the anti conformers are found to react faster than the syn conformers. However, this can be attributed to steric effects and not hyperconjugation as generally invoked. The oxidation reaction is slow, with barrier heights between 6.3 and 14.7 kcal/mol and estimated reaction rate constants 6-12 orders-of-magnitude smaller than previously reported literature estimates. The reaction is thus expected to be unimportant in the context of tropospheric oxidation chemistry. However, the reaction mechanism suggests that CO could be exploited in ozonolysis to selectively obtain industrially important carbonyl compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA 3aaldehydes 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adensity functional theory 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozonolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3atroposphere1 aBusch, Daryle H.1 aSubramaniam, Bala1 aThompson, Ward H.0 tJournal of Physical Chemistry A.g2014 Mar. 13, v. 118, no. 10 p.1887-1894dAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)wJournal:23359x1520-52157nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73385323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp500258h3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011300162500001400275520113700289592002801426650001101454650001501465650001501480650001201495650001601507650002701523650002101550650001501571650001101586650001401597650001601611650001901627650001601646650001401662650001001676650001301686650001801699650001501717650002501732700002101757700003301778773012001811856007301931852000902004655001202013IND60721836420221118051940.0201224e20201219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183642DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngosto, José  M.10aRemoval of Diclofenac in Wastewater Using Biosorption and Advanced Oxidation Techniques: Comparative Results  aNAL-light  aWastewater treatment is a topic of primary interest with regard to the environment. Diclofenac is a common analgesic drug often detected in wastewater and surface water. In this paper, three commonly available agrifood waste types (artichoke agrowaste, olive-mill residues, and citrus waste) were reused as sorbents of diclofenac present in aqueous effluents. Citrus-waste biomass for a dose of 2 g·L⁻¹ allowed for removing 99.7% of diclofenac present in the initial sample, with a sorption capacity of 9 mg of adsorbed diclofenac for each gram of used biomass. The respective values obtained for olive-mill residues and artichoke agrowaste were around 4.15 mg·g⁻¹. Advanced oxidation processes with UV/H₂O₂ and UV/HOCl were shown to be effective treatments for the elimination of diclofenac. A significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD; 40–48%) was also achieved with these oxidation treatments. Despite the lesser effectiveness of the sorption process, it should be considered that the reuse and valorization of these lignocellulosic agrifood residues would facilitate the fostering of a circular economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aanalgesics 3aartichokes 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3achemical oxygen demand 3acircular economy 3adiclofenac 3adosage 3aeffluents 3aenvironment 3alignocellulose 3amethodology 3aoxidation 3apaper 3asorbents 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aRoca, María J.,1 aFernández-López, José  A.0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 19, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016100158500001900319520131600338592002801654650001701682650002501699650002301724650002501747650001701772650001801789650001601807650002501823650001701848650001501865650002201880650002301902650000901925650002001934650001701954650002701971650001901998650001502017650001002032651001002042651001102052700002202063700002202085700002102107700002302128700002402151700002602175773011902201856007302320852000902393655001202402IND60735322720221118035710.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073532272DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicata, Mario 10aTreatment of Combined Dairy and Domestic Wastewater with Constructed Wetland System in Sicily (Italy). Pollutant Removal Efficiency and Effect of Vegetation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDairy wastewater (DWW) contains large amounts of mineral and organic compounds, which can accumulate in soil and water causing serious environmental pollution. A constructed wetland (CW) is a sustainable technology for the treatment of DWW in small-medium sized farms. This paper reports a two-year study on the performance of a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow system for DWW treatment in Sicily (Italy). The CW system covered a total surface area of 100 m² and treated approximately 6 m³ per day of wastewater produced by a small dairy farm, subsequent to biological treatment. Removal efficiency (RE) of the system was calculated. The biomass production of two emergent macrophytes was determined and the effect of plant growth on organic pollutant RE was recorded. All DWW parameters showed significant differences between inlet and outlet. For BOD₅ and COD, RE values were 76.00% and 62.00%, respectively. RE for total nitrogen (50.70%) was lower than that of organic compounds. RE levels of microbiological parameters were found to be higher than 80.00%. Giant reed produced greater biomass than umbrella sedge. A seasonal variation in RE of organic pollutants was recorded due to plant growth rate Our findings highlight the efficient use of a CW system for DWW treatment in dairy-cattle farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3abiological treatment 3abiomass production 3aconstructed wetlands 3adairy cattle 3adairy farming 3amacrophytes 3amunicipal wastewater 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3asubsurface flow 3asurface area 3asustainable technology 3atotal nitrogen 3avegetation 3awater 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aRuggeri, Roberto 1 aIacuzzi, Nicolò 1 aVirga, Giuseppe 1 aFarruggia, Davide 1 aRossini, Francesco 1 aTuttolomondo, Teresa 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002700117024003000144040001800174100001700192245006300209300001800272520116500290592002801455596000901483650001801492650002301510650003001533650002301563650001301586650002101599700002101620700002201641700002201663773014401685856011401829856007301943961000902016852000902025655001202034IND60733853520221119140228.0220901e20140710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385352DNAL7 a10113/73385352hdl7 a10.1021/jp50374692doi7 a10.1021/jp50374692chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Manoj10aOrganic Acids Tunably Catalyze Carbonic Acid Decomposition  ap. 5020-5028.  aDensity functional theory calculations predict that the gas-phase decomposition of carbonic acid, a high-energy, 1,3-hydrogen atom transfer reaction, can be catalyzed by a monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid, including carbonic acid itself. Carboxylic acids are found to be more effective catalysts than water. Among the carboxylic acids, the monocarboxylic acids outperform the dicarboxylic ones wherein the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond hampers the hydrogen transfer. Further, the calculations reveal a direct correlation between the catalytic activity of a monocarboxylic acid and its pKa, in contrast to prior assumptions about carboxylic-acid-catalyzed hydrogen-transfer reactions. The catalytic efficacy of a dicarboxylic acid, on the other hand, is significantly affected by the strength of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Transition-state theory estimates indicate that effective rate constants for the acid-catalyzed decomposition are four orders-of-magnitude larger than those for the water-catalyzed reaction. These results offer new insights into the determinants of general acid catalysis with potentially broad implications.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA 3acarbonic acid 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3adicarboxylic acids 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding1 aBusch, Daryle H.1 aSubramaniam, Bala1 aThompson, Ward H.0 tJournal of Physical Chemistry A.g2014 July 10, v. 118, no. 27 p.5020-5028dAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)wJournal:23359x1520-52157nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73385353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp50374693Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002700117024003000144040001800174100001700192245011600209300002000325506007600345506003100421506002800452506005600480520148700536592002802023596004702051506003702098650002902135650002402164650001702188650001902205650001702224650001302241650002002254650002402274650002402298650002302322650001702345650001602362700002402378700002302402700002202425700002102447773014702468856011402615856007302729961000902802852000902811655001202820IND60733853720221215142844.0220901e20140925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385372DNAL7 a10113/73385372hdl7 a10.1021/jp504755a2doi7 a10.1021/jp504755a2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZane, Andrew10aSpectroscopic Evaluation of the Nucleation and Growth for Microwave-Assisted CdSe/CdS/ZnS Quantum Dot Synthesis  ap. 22258-22267.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Chemical Society (ACS) License Information  aUse of microwave radiation to speed up the synthesis of CdSe-based quantum dots (QDs) in aqueous media is of practical interest and is the focus of this study. However, such microwave methods usually lead to low quantum yield (QY) QDs as compared to the conventional organic-based synthesis. By coupling the microwave oven with a fluorometer via a fiber optic cable, the fluorescence spectra during the QD evolution were obtained. Using the composition Cd4:Se1:Zn4:MPA20 (MPA = 3-mercaptopropionic acid), several stages of QD growth including development of CdSe nuclei, followed sequentially by CdS and then ZnS deposition were noted. The temperature of the microwave reaction between 130 and 155 °C led to QDs with similar QYs (17–19%), with the lower temperature taking longer to reach the optimal yield. The nucleation step was carried out at temperatures varying from 0 to 100 °C followed by growth in the microwave oven. With increasing temperature of nucleation, there was a red-shift in emission maximum, varying from 549 to 574 nm, with comparable QY, thus providing a route for QD size control in the microwave process. There was a profound effect of light illumination on the nucleated state prior to microwave treatment. Using light illumination, QDs with a QY of 40–41% were reproducibly obtained. With such optimized QDs, both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of QD uptake into intestinal epithelial cells at 0.8–8 nM concentration were readily observed.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3-mercaptopropionic acid 3aconfocal microscopy 3afiber optics 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3alighting 3amicrowave ovens 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum dots 3atemperature1 aMcCracken, Christie1 aKnight, Deborah A.1 aWaldman, W.

P.10aPhysical Modeling of LNAPL Source Zone Remediation by Air Sparging  ap. 413-422.  aepub  aThe mass removal behavior of pooled light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) by air sparging was investigated using one-dimensional and two-dimensional physical model experiments. The effects of flow rate, flow interruption, nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) saturation, and soil heterogeneity were examined. At the beginning of air sparging, a higher initial mass removal rate was achieved under near-equilibrium condition but was limited to the volatilization of NAPL that is in direct contact with air channels. At the later stage of air injection, the mass partitioning from NAPL phase to gaseous phase became rate limited. In terms of final amount of mass removed, there was a negligible effect of air injection flow rate within the range examined. Results from two-dimensional soil tank experiments revealed that fractional mass removal was extremely sensitive to subsurface heterogeneity. About 90% fractional mass removal was achieved in a case where NAPL was trapped in a coarse sand lens surrounded by a finer soil matrix. However, when NAPL was trapped in a fine sand lens in coarser sand matrix, the injected air channels diverted away from the entrapped NAPL due to the presence of the low-permeability sand lens, and the fractional mass removal decreased to less than 50%. Flow interruption can be used to enhance the mass removal of LNAPLs entrapped around the water table by air sparging and soil vapor extraction. However, the fractional mass removal rate became zero at a threshold NAPL saturation beyond which NAPL could not be removed by air sparging even after many interruption cycles. Results indicate the necessity of incorporating a rate-limited mass transfer model into the NAPL-gas mass transfer model. The mass transfer rate should be a function of NAPL saturation and the threshold value determined by experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3atoluene 3aair sparging 3aphysical models 3asoil water movement 3asoil heterogeneity 3asand 3asoil vapor extraction 3avolatilization1 aSoga, K.1 aKawabata, J.0 tVadose zone journal.g2007 May, v. 6, no. 2 p.413-422dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2006.00473Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03330naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017400161500001900335520216500354592002802519650001302547650002802560650001802588650001802606650000902624650001002633650002002643700002002663700002202683700002002705700002102725700002102746773011902767856007302886852000902959655001202968IND60735323420221118035737.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073532342DNAL7 a10.3390/w130810942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Emily  S.10aMethods, Protocols, Guidance and Standards for Performance Evaluation for Point-of-Use Water Treatment Technologies: History, Current Status, Future Needs and Directions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is estimated that 780 million people do not have access to improved drinking water sources and approximately 2 billion people use fecally contaminated drinking water. Effective point-of-use water treatment systems (POU) can provide water with sufficiently reduced concentrations of pathogenic enteric microorganisms to not pose significant health risks to consumers. Household water treatment (HWT) systems utilize various technologies that physically remove and/or inactivate pathogens. A limited number of governmental and other institutional entities have developed testing protocols to evaluate the performance of POU water treatment systems. Such testing protocols are essential to documenting effective performance because inferior and ineffective POU treatment technologies are thought to be in widespread use. This critical review examines specific practices, procedures and specification of widely available POU system evaluation protocols. Testing protocols should provide standardized and detailed instructions yet be sufficiently flexible to deal with different treatment technologies, test microbe priorities and choices, testing facility capabilities and public health needs. Appropriate infectivity or culture assays should be used to quantify test enteric bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites, or other appropriate surrogates or substitutes for them, although processes based on physical removal can be tested by methods that detect microbes as particles. Recommendations include further research of stock microbe production and handling methods to consistently yield test microbes in a realistic state of aggregation and, in the case of bacteria, appropriately physiologically stressed. Bacterial quantification methods should address the phenomenon of bacterial injury and repair in order to maximally recover those that are culturable and potentially infectious. It is only with harmonized national and international testing protocols and performance targets that independent and unbiased testing can be done to assure consumers that POU treatment technologies are able to produce water of high microbial quality and low health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3amicrobiological quality 3apathogenicity 3apublic health 3arisk 3awater 3awater treatment1 aBeetsch, Nikki 1 aWait, Douglas  A.1 aOza, Hemali  H.1 aRonnie, Nirmala 1 aSobsey, Mark D.,0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130810943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008800159500001400247520171800261592002801979650001302007650001302020650001402033650001202047650000902059650001902068650001502087650001502102650001302117650001602130650001102146650001602157650001602173650001002189650002002199650001502219651002802234651001102262700002202273700002402295773012002319856007302439852000902512655001202521IND60721837220221119001747.0201224e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183722DNAL7 a10.3390/w121235752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlach, Vojtech 10aChanging Low Flow and Streamflow Drought Seasonality in Central European Headwaters  aNAL-light  aIn the context of the ongoing climate warming in Europe, the seasonality and magnitudes of low flows and streamflow droughts are expected to change in the future. Increasing temperature and evaporation rates, stagnating precipitation amounts and decreasing snow cover will probably further intensify the summer streamflow deficits. This study analyzed the long-term variability and seasonality of low flows and streamflow droughts in fifteen headwater catchments of three regions within Central Europe. To quantify the changes in the low flow regime of selected catchments during the 1968–2019 period, we applied the R package lfstat for computing the seasonality ratio (SR), the seasonality index (SI), mean annual minima, as well as for the detection of streamflow drought events along with deficit volumes. Trend analysis of summer minimum discharges was performed using the Mann–Kendall test. Our results showed a substantial increase in the proportion of summer low flows during the analyzed period, accompanied with an apparent shift in the average date of low flow occurrence towards the start of the year. The most pronounced seasonality shifts were found predominantly in catchments with the mean altitude 800–1000 m.a.s.l. in all study regions. In contrast, the regime of low flows in catchments with terrain above 1000 m.a.s.l. remained nearly stable throughout the 1968–2019 period. Moreover, the analysis of mean summer minimum discharges indicated a much-diversified pattern in behavior of long-term trends than it might have been expected. The findings of this study may help identify the potentially most vulnerable near-natural headwater catchments facing worsening summer water scarcity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abehavior 3adetection 3adrought 3aflow 3aglobal warming 3alandscapes 3aoccurrence 3asnowpack 3astream flow 3asummer 3atemperature 3avariability 3awater 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aCentral European region 3aEurope1 aLedvinka, Ondrej 1 aMatouskova, Milada 0 tWater.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121235753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015000158500001400308520170600322592002802028650001702056650001202073650001902085650002002104650001102124650001402135650001202149650001502161650001402176650001602190650002102206650001902227650001102246650001502257650001302272650001502285650000902300650001302309650001802322650001602340650001902356650001902375650001502394651001202409700002902421773012002450856007302570852000902643655001202652IND60721837320221118222710.0201224e20201126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072183732DNAL7 a10.3390/w121233242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMielby, Susie 10aHydrogeological Studies Integrating the Climate, Freshwater Cycle, and Catchment Geography for the Benefit of Urban Resilience and Sustainability  aNAL-light  aToday, there is an increasing need to understand how to link the management of the surface and subsurface to avoid disasters in many urban areas and/or reduce the likelihood of future risks. There is a need for thorough investigation of subsurface processes. This investigation should entail an analysis of water security, flood risks, and drought hazards in urban areas that may affect long-term sustainability and the ability to recover from disturbance, e.g., a capacity for resilience. In this context, as part of this analysis, potential biophysical and hydro-meteorological hazards need to be studied and subdivided according to geological, hydrogeological, man-made, and climatic origin, and by their characteristic temporal scales and site specific characteristics. The introduction of adaptive design and resilience in urban and suburban planning and management requires a shift towards more organic, adaptive, and flexible design and management strategies. This leads to the use of a complex cross-disciplinary methodology. We consider data collation, modelling, and monitoring designed to fit typical urban situations and complexity. Furthermore, implementation of strategic planning, decision-making to manage the consequences of future infrastructure and constructions are considered. The case studies presented are experiences from different hydrogeological studies performed in Odense, Denmark. Rising population and densification is affecting Odense, and there is risk of raised seawater level, groundwater, and surface-water flooding. The anthropogenic modification of subsurface structures and increased climate changes enhance the risk of hazards and the risk of coinciding impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3adesign 3adisasters 3adrought 3afreshwater 3ageography 3agroundwater 3ahydrometeorology 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3apopulation 3arisk 3aseawater 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awater analysis 3awater security 3awatersheds 3aDenmark1 aHenriksen, Hans  Jørgen0 tWater.g2020 Nov. 26, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121233243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003000117024003300147040001800180100001700198245012100215506007600336506003100412506002800443506005700471520173700528592002802265596000902293506003702302650001302339650001202352650001502364650001302379650001802392650001302410650001302423650001202436650001002448651001802458651001302476700002202489700002202511700002502533700002102558700002002579700002402599700002602623700002302649773014602672856011402818856007602932961001603008852000903024655001203033IND60733854920221215142336.0220901e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385492DNAL7 a10113/73385492hdl7 a10.1029/2011jg0017402doi7 a10.1029/2011jg0017402chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, D.

We studied 10 headwater catchments in the northeastern United States across a gradient of N deposition (5.4 − 9.4 kg ha(−1) yr(−1)) to determine if soil nitrification rates could explain differences in stream water NO(3−) export. Average annual export of two years (October 2002 through September 2004) varied from 0.1 kg NO(3−)‐N ha)−1) yr(−1) at Cone Pond watershed in New Hampshire to 5.1 kg ha(−1) yr(−1) at Buck Creek South in the western Adirondack Mountains of New York. Potential net nitrification rates and relative nitrification (fraction of inorganic N as NO(3−)) were measured in Oa or A soil horizons at 21–130 sampling points throughout each watershed. Stream NO(3−) export was positively related to nitrification rates (r2 = 0.34, p = 0.04) and the relative nitrification (r2 = 0.37, p = 0.04). These relationships were much improved by restricting consideration to the 6 watersheds with a higher number of rate measurements (59–130) taken in transects parallel to the streams (r2 of 0.84 and 0.70 for the nitrification rate and relative nitrification, respectively). Potential nitrification rates were also a better predictor of NO(3−) export when data were limited to either the 6 sampling points closest to the watershed outlet (r2 = 0.75) or sampling points <250 m from the watershed outlet (r2 = 0.68). The basal area of conifer species at the sampling plots was negatively related to NO(3−)export. These spatial relationships found here suggest a strong influence of near‐stream and near‐watershed‐outlet soils on measured stream NO(3−) export.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconifers 3aexports 3ageophysics 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3astreams 3awater 3aNew Hampshire 3aNew York1 aShanley, James B.1 aCampbell, John L.1 aLawrence, Gregory B.1 aBailey, Scott W.1 aLikens, Gene E.1 aWemple, Beverley C.1 aFredriksen, Guinevere1 aJamison, Austin E.0 tJournal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences.g2012 Mar., v. 117, no.

Most soil hydraulic properties are difficult to measure and therefore have to be estimated in most cases. Efficient methods for estimating soil hydraulic properties are lacking for tropical soils. This study examines and uses easy-to-measure soil properties together with terrain attributes in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ₛ), one of the key soil hydraulic properties for two pilot sites in the Volta basin of Ghana. It was observed that good data distribution, range, and amounts are prerequisites for good ANN estimation and, therefore, data preprocessing is important for ANN. With adequate and sensitive data, ANN can be used to estimate K ₛ, using soil properties such as sand, silt, and clay content, bulk density, and organic carbon. Although the inclusion of terrain parameters can improve the estimation of K ₛ using ANN, they cannot be relied on as the sole input parameters as they yield poor results for the scale considered in this study. The source of training data was found to significantly influence the topsoil K ₛ, but the subsoil was not sensitive to training data source.  aPublisher supplied data 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aestimation 3aneural networks 3atropical soils 3asoil texture 3asand fraction 3asilt fraction 3aclay fraction 3abulk density 3asoil organic carbon 3atopsoil 3asubsoil 3aGhana1 aPark, S.

Infection with CoVs typically presents as mild to severe respiratory or enteric disease, but CoVs have the potential to cause significant morbidity or mortality in highly susceptible age groups. CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans. Similar to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have been devastating to commercial animal production over the past century, including infectious bronchitis virus in poultry and bovine CoV, as well as the emergence and reemergence of multiple CoVs in swine including transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. These naturally occurring animal CoV infections provide important examples for understanding CoV disease as many animal CoVs have complex pathogenesis similar to SARS-CoV-2 and can shed light on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We provide an overview and update regarding selected existing animal CoVs and their primary host species, diseases caused by CoVs, how CoVs jump species, whether these CoVs pose an outbreak risk or risk to humans, and how we can mitigate these risks.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture (USDA; Award Number 2015-67015-23067, 2015) and USDA Agricultural Research Service (Award Number 58-3625-4-087, 2014).

The goals of this study were to develop an IHC protocol for myogenin and MyoD1, evaluate myogenin and MyoD1 labeling in canine RMS, and report clinical outcomes. Sixteen cases of possible RMS were retrospectively evaluated. A diagnosis of RMS was confirmed in 13 cases based on histological features and immunolabeling for myogenin and MyoD1, with the aid of electron microscopy in 2 cases. Desmin was negative in 3 cases of RMS. Two cases were of the sclerosing variant. The median age of dogs with RMS was 7.2 years. Anatomic tumor locations included previously reported sites such as bladder, larynx, heart, and orbit, as well as other locations typical of soft tissue sarcomas. Survival ranged from 47 to 1480 days for 5 dogs with available data. This study demonstrated that MyoD1 and myogenin should be included with desmin as part of a diagnostic IHC panel for canine RMS. Utilization of these antibodies to improve the accuracy of canine RMS diagnosis will ultimately allow for better characterization of the biological behavior and clinical outcomes of this disease, providing the groundwork for future comparative investigations in canine RMS.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: DPR is supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) award numbers: K01OD022982 and L30 TR002126.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3abladder 3adesmin 3adogs 3aelectron microscopy 3aheart 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alarynx 3amyogenin 3atissues 0arhabdomyosarcoma 0amuscle 0asurgical pathology1 aByer, Brittney J.1 aRoyer, Suzanne1 aKeller, Charles1 aNagai-Singer, Margaret A.1 aRegan, Daniel P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3148-13321 aSeguin, B.q(Bernard),0 tVeterinary pathology.g2021 May, v. 58, no. 3 p.516-526dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858209881463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003000117024003300147040001800180100002300198245014600221506007600367506003100443506002800474506005700502520165700559592002802216596000902244596000902253506003702262650002502299650001802324650003302342650001502375650001902390650001802409650002202427650002302449650002102472650001502493650001302508650002402521650001702545650001502562650003902577650002102616650002602637650001502663700001602678700002202694700002302716700002202739700002302761773008102784856011402865856007702979961001303056852000903069655001203078IND60733855920221215142346.0220901e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073385592DNAL7 a10113/73385592hdl7 a10.1029/2017wr0215672doi7 a10.1029/2017wr0215672chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, David G.10aSeasonal Wetness, Soil Organic Carbon, and Fire Influence Soil Hydrological Properties and Water Repellency in a Sagebrush‐Steppe Ecosystem  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU) License Information  aPrescribed fire is an important tool for rangeland management in sage‐steppe ecosystems, yet the long‐term effects of this practice on soil hydraulic properties are not well known. We explore interactions among site geomorphology, soil organic carbon (SOC) soil N, soil water repellency (SWR), and plant community type on infiltration properties before fire and 8 years thereafter in a semiarid research watershed. The objective was to assess the sustainability of rangeland burning in sage‐steppe ecosystems. Many types of measurements were made in three plant communities to identify how differences in soil hydraulic properties are related to differences in plant cover and soil texture and to determine relationships among SOC, SWR, soil water contact angle, and infiltration properties. Measurements were made on transects in burned and unburned catchments. We found that severity and occurrence of surface SWR were substantially reduced 8 years after a fire within the area originally covered with mountain big sagebrush, where the fire intensity was greatest. Surface SWR was lowest in the sparsely vegetated low sagebrush, where SOC was also lowest. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kh) increased in each vegetation type over the 8‐year period after burning and was not directly related to SWR. Spatial variability in Kh was primarily controlled by soil texture, whereas differences in sorptivity (S) were controlled by SWR and aridity. SOC is not well correlated to soil surface SWR. The decadal scale changes in Kh and associations between S and site characteristics indicate forms of resilience to fire across a moisture gradient.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemisia tridentata 3acontact angle 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3afire intensity 3ageomorphology 3aplant communities 3aprescribed burning 3arange management 3arangelands 3aresearch 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3avegetation types 3awater repellent soils 3awatersheds1 aCheng, Yang1 aSeyfried, Mark S.1 aMadsen, Matthew D.1 aJohnson, Chris E.1 aWilliams, C.

The exogenous treatment with SAM leads to increased actinorhodin production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). In this study, mutants from different stages of the AfsK-AfsR signal transduction cascade were used to test the possible target of SAM. SAM had no significant effect on actinorhodin production in afsK, afsR, afsS, or actII-open reading frame 4 (ORF4) mutant. This confirms that afsK plays a critical role in delivering the signal generated by exogenous SAM. The afsK-pHJL-KN mutant did not respond to SAM, suggesting the involvement of the C-terminal of AfsK in binding with SAM. SAM increased the in vitro autophosphorylation of kinase AfsK in a dose-dependent manner, and also abolished the effect of decreased actinorhodin production by a Ser/Thr kinase inhibitor, K252a. In sum, our results suggest that SAM activates actinorhodin biosynthesis in S. coelicolor M130 by increasing the phosphorylation of protein kinase AfsK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3adose response 3amutants 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asignal transduction 0aS-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) 0aactinorhodin 0aautophosphorylation 0aserine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase1 aCHENG, Jinhua1 aYANG, Seung Hwan1 aMENG, Lingzhu1 aPALANIYANDI, Sasikumar Arunachalam1 aZHAO, Xin-Qing1 aSUH, Joo-Won0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2011 May 23, v. 75, no. 5 p.910-913dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1008733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300001600294500001400310520042400324592002800748650002100776650001800797650002100815650001800836650001900854650003600873650001200909650001200921653002000933653002500953653001000978700002100988700001801009700002501027773018201052856007401234852000901308655001201317IND60692133820221117080040.0200502e20110523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069213382DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1008842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMORIGUCHI, Ryo10aReduction of Plant-Specific Arabinogalactan-Type O-Glycosylation by Treating Tobacco Plants with Ferrous Chelator 2,2′-Dipyridyl  ap. 994-996.  aNAL-light  aPlant specific O-glycosylation of proteins includes the attachment of arabinogalactan to hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues.

For the study, total number of 182 patients with FMF disease were enrolled and screening of a panel of genes , called “fever panel” which comprises 17 genes, was performed. The most common mutations in MEFV gene were homozygous M694V missense mutation (4.3%) and R202Q missense mutation (4.9%). The most common heterozygous mutations were R202Q (26.5%), M694V (25.9%) and E148Q (11.9%). Compound heterozygous and homozygous mutations were also detected. Also, different types of mutations were identified in NOD2, CARD14, NLRP12, NLRP3, NLRP7, IL1RN, LPIN2, TNFRSF1A, MVK and PSTPIP1 genes. Two novel missense variations in the MEFV gene, Gln34Pro and Ile247Val, which have not been previously reported in the databases, were identified. Also, Thr91Ile missense variation in the NOD2 gene, Gly461Cys missense variation in NLRP3 and Tyr732Stop nonsense variation in LPIN2 were firstly identified. The results of the current study suggest that in addition to the MEFV gene which has an important roles in FMF, molecular screening of other genes related to other autoinflammatory diseases might provide support in suspected cases and provide detailed information about the course of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3afamilial Mediterranean fever 3afever 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3amissense mutation 3apatients 3ascreening 0aFMF 0aFever panel 0aMEFV 0aNext-generation sequencing1 aMercan, Ridvan1 aArslan, Ahmet1 aTozkir, Hilmi0 tGenomics.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.2755-2762dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016000167520169000327592002802017650001802045650001802063650001602081650001302097650002702110650001802137650002502155650001702180650001102197650002102208650001002229650002302239650000902262650004302271650003802314650002102352653000902373653000902382653001402391700002402405700002002429700002602449700002102475700002002496700002202516700002002538700001702558773010302575856008202678852000902760655001202769IND60688400620221118040055.0200607e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPompili, Simona10aLong-term abuse of a high-carbohydrate diet is as harmful as a high-fat diet for development and progression of liver injury in a mouse model of NAFLD/NASH  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common liver disease globally. It is caused by a complex network of factors, including diet. The hallmark of NAFLD is the benign accumulation of triacylglycerols, however, this condition may worsen into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Currently, no therapies are available, and diet modifications are the only strategy. Although there is increasing evidence emerging about how an abuse of carbohydrates could be involved in the progression of liver injury, a comprehensive understanding of the damage induced by an enriched carbohydrate diet is still far from complete. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (LF-HCD) with high-fat (HFD) and standard (SD) diets in a nutritional mouse model of NAFLD/NASH.Histologic, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed.The results showed that the prolonged abuse of both LF-HCDs and HFDs induced a significant increase in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis scores compared with SD. At the same time, both LF-HCDs and HFDs led to significant increases in the expression of the molecules involved in the progression of NAFLD that we assessed (perilipin, CD68, TGF-β1, CTGF, leptin, leptin receptor, and α-SMA).The present study highlighted that the simple substitution of fats with carbohydrates is not a proper strategy to prevent or mitigate the progression of NAFLD/NASH. Further studies are required to define the best nutritional strategy to prevent NAFLD and its related metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acarbohydrates 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3ahigh fat diet 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3aleptin receptors 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atriacylglycerols 0aDiet 0aNASH 0aSteatosis1 aVetuschi, Antonella1 aGaudio, Eugenio1 aTessitore, Alessandra1 aCapelli, Roberta1 aAlesse, Edoardo1 aLatella, Giovanni1 aSferra, Roberta1 aOnori, Paolo0 tNutrition.g2020 July,  Aug., v. 75-76 p.110782-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008700158300001600245500001400261520095600275592002801231650002201259650000801281650003201289650001501321650001901336650001801355650002001373650002901393653001801422653001901440700002401459700001701483700002301500700002001523700002401543700001401567773018201581856007401763852000901837655001201846IND60692135120221117080158.0200502e20110523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069213512DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1009212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYEE, Lii Mien14aThe Genome of Bacillus subtilis Phage SP10: A Comparative Analysis with Phage SPO1  ap. 944-952.  aNAL-light  aA nucleotide sequence of the whole genome of Bacillus subtilis phage SP10 was determined. It was composed of 143,986 bp with 236 putative open reading frames (ORFs). Sixty-five of 236 predicted ORFs showed high similarity to that of SPO1, and the genome organizations of the two phages were similar to each other. SP10 belongs to the Myoviridae family, for which the well-studied phage SPO1 is the representative phage. Hence, we compared SP10 to SPO1. The SP10 genome DNA showed different sensitivity to restriction enzymes than SPO1, due to differences in base modification. According to transcriptional analysis, the gene expression of regulatory network of SP10 was similar to SPO1. It was observed that RNA polymerase containing sigma-A was inactive in directing the host genes but active in directing the phage genes. It appeared that the association of sigma-A with the core enzyme complex of RNA polymerase was strengthened during development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aMyoviridae 3abacteriophages 3abiotechnology 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 0abacteriophage 0aRNA polymerase1 aMatsumoto, Takashi,1 aYANO, Koichi1 aMatsuoka, Satoshi,1 aSADAIE, Yoshito1 aYOSHIKAWA, Hirofumi1 aASAI, Kei0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2011 May 23, v. 75, no. 5 p.944-952dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1009213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300002000268520149900288592002801787650002301815650001101838650001401849650001501863650001601878700001801894700001601912700001701928700002001945700001801965773014201983856007402125852000902199655001202208IND60618786620221119144254.0181030e20180814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061878662DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta05636f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Kangrong10aAchieving high-performance thick-film perovskite solar cells with electron transporting Bingel fullerenes  ap. 15495-15503.  aTwo Bingel fullerenes, PCP and MCM, as electron transporting materials (ETMs) have been developed for achieving thick-film perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with efficiencies beyond 19% with a planar absorber layer over 1 micrometer. Almost no PVSCs have exhibited PCEs above 18% with a 1 micrometer planar layer before, owing to the excess perovskite defects deteriorating charge extraction and the performance of thick-film based devices. Benefiting from the nearly identical optoelectronic properties of two ETMs stemming from tailored chemical structures, the studies on them allow us to unveil the fact that subtle molecular interaction (anion–π and Lewis acid–base) between ETMs and perovskites strongly affects the charge extraction at the heterointerface, which in turn influences the device hysteresis and performance. Particularly, weak Lewis base–acid O–Pb²⁺ interaction between MCM and the perovskite helps passivate the trap-states at the interface, resulting in a smooth electron extraction and reduced device hysteresis (the average hysteresis index (HI) of 0.03 ± 0.01). However, the strong N–Pb²⁺ coordination induces misalignment of the energy levels at the perovskite/PCP heterojunction, causing electron accumulation at the junction, and hence the large HI (0.17 ± 0.05) in devices. This work provides new insights into the charge extraction at the perovskite/organic interface and the possible molecular interaction from organics to cure perovskite defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3afullerene 3ahysteresis 3asolar cells1 aChen, Jiehuan1 aJu, Huanxin1 aDing, Feizhi1 aChen, Hongzheng1 aLi, Chang-Zhi0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Aug. 14, v. 6, no. 32 p.15495-15503dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta05636f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014300160300002000303520035400323592002800677650002400705650001600729650001200745650001000757650001700767650001700784700001300801700001600814700001600830700001500846700001600861700001900877700001800896700001500914773014200929856007401071852000901145655001201154IND60618786720221119144101.0181030e20180828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061878672DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta05637d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xiang-Bing10aDirect synthesis of sulfide capped CdS and CdS/ZnS colloidal nanocrystals for efficient hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation  ap. 16328-16332.  aCdS and CdS/ZnS colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) capped with inorganic sulfide (S²⁻) ligands were directly synthesized with no aid of organic ligands in water.

Ten female goats with two newborn kids each were randomly divided into the immunized group and negative control group; The novel oral somatostatin (SS) DNA vaccine (fused to tPA signal peptide and CpG adjuvant) and empty vector bacteria were orally administered to these groups, respectively, at weeks 0, 3, and 6 of the study period. Blood samples were collected before primary immunization and at weeks 6 and 9 after primary immunization. The specific anti-SS antibody titers in the immunized group were significantly higher than that in the negative control group (P < 0.05). Serum SS concentration was significantly lower, whereas growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) concentrations were significantly higher in the immunized group compared with those in the negative control group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the weight of the kids and the milk protein and lactose contents of the goats were significantly higher in the immunized group than those in the negative control group at week 6 of lactation (P < 0.05). The study revealed that the novel oral SS DNA vaccine can increase serum GH and PRL levels and effectively promote goat lactation and milk composition. This finding indicated a correlation between the effect of SS-14 DNA vaccine treatment and the roles of GH and PRL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3aimmunization 3alactation 3alactose 3amilk proteins 3anannygoats 3aneonates 3aoral administration 3aprolactin 3arecombinant vaccines 3asignal peptide 3asomatostatin 3asomatotropin 3at-plasminogen activator 0aDNA vaccine 0aMilk composition 0aGoat1 aNa, Risu1 aJiang, Xunping1 aWu, Jiayuan1 aHan, Yuqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6859-26421 aZeng, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4698-838X1 aE., Guangxin1 aLiang, Aixin1 aYang, Liguo1 aZhao, Yongju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9256-88561 aHuang, Yongfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0885-38200 tSmall ruminant research.g2020 June, v. 187 p.106107-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015200158300002000310520173300330592002802063650001702091650001302108650001202121650001402133650001402147650002302161650001302184650001902197650002402216650001402240650002402254650001802278650001502296650002202311650001402333650001302347700001602360700001602376700002002392700001802412773014202430856007402572852000902646655001202655IND60618787220221119145421.0181030e20180814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061878722DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta05705b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Baohua10aTunable CoFe-based active sites on 3D heteroatom doped graphene aerogel electrocatalysts via annealing gas regulation for efficient water splitting  ap. 15728-15737.  aMost electrocatalysts are only efficiently active for either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their intrinsic catalytic activity. It is necessary to combine these electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Unfortunately, these catalysts are usually synthesized by using completely different routes and reactant precursors, which increase the cost of manufacture with tedious procedures. Herein, we demonstrate a versatile gas-regulated strategy for the preparation of two kinds of graphene-based electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively, by using the same procedure with the same precursor. Specifically, the hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide solution in the presence of thiourea and desirable metal ions leads to the formation of a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel. The subsequent pyrolysis is efficient in regulating the active sites for the OER and HER, respectively, by adjusting the gas atmosphere. The N₂-regulated formation of CoFeO@N/S-rGO (CoFe₂O₄ encapsulated 3D N, S-doped rGO aerogel) results in good catalytic performance for the OER while the formation of CoFe@N-rGO (amorphous bimetallic CoFe encapsulated 3D N-doped rGO aerogel) in NH₃ results in good HER catalytic performance. The combination of CoFe@N-rGO with CoFeO@N/S-rGO for overall water splitting in alkaline solution exhibits good catalytic activity to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at a low potential of 1.63 V with outstanding stability for 100 h, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Therefore, our gas-regulated strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaerogels 3aammonia 3aannealing 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen production 3amanufacturing 3ametal ions 3aoxygen production 3apyrolysis 3athiourea1 aWang, Haixu1 aZuo, Zhuang1 aWang, Huaisheng1 aZhang, Jintao0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Aug. 14, v. 6, no. 32 p.15728-15737dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta05705b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011200174300001600286520242900302592002802731650001602759650001802775650001102793650001302804650001302817650000802830650002402838650001302862650001002875650001202885650002502897650001102922650001602933650001802949650000902967650001102976650001502987650001203002650001803014650001403032651001803046653001303064653001603077653001803093653001303111653001303124653001603137700002503153773010203178856008703280852000903367655001203376IND60545541720221121174139.0160902e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDueker, M. Elias10aAeration remediation of a polluted waterway increases near-surface coarse and culturable microbial aerosols  ap. 184-189.  aAeration remediation is currently used in polluted urban waterways to increase oxygen levels in the water column. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that the bursting of bubbles at water surfaces introduced by aeration, or other surface disturbances, can transfer viable bacteria to the air. In heavily sewage-polluted waterways these water-originated bacterial aerosols may pose as a health risk to recreators in small boats or residents inhabiting the shoreline. Nonetheless, few studies have explored aerosols above active aeration remediation projects in waterways or investigated how bacterial aerosols change with vertical distance from aeration activities. This study, conducted at the Newtown Creek superfund site in Brooklyn, NY, USA, measured coarse aerosol particles and culturable bacteria in near-surface air above waters undergoing aeration remediation. Regardless of aeration operation culturable bacterial fallout was greater near-surface (0.6m above water) than previously-reported measurements made at 2.5m. Molecular analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from isolated bacteria demonstrates that water and air shared a large number of bacterial genera and that the genera present in the near-surface aerosols (0.6m) contained water-associated Vibrio and Caulobacter, which were not present at 2.5m, despite the smaller sequence library size from the near-surface. Also, the near-surface microbial assemblage had significantly greater association with sequences detected previously in aquatic environments compared to the 2.5m library. We found compelling evidence that aeration activity contributed to this vertical gradient in bacterial aerosol concentrations and identity. Similar to results from 2.5m, concentrations of near-surface respirable coarse aerosols (<10 um) increased significantly when aeration was occurring. Culturable bacterial aerosol fallout was also greater near-surface when the aerator was on compared to simultaneous measurements made at 2.5m. Furthermore, when the aerator was operating, the near-surface bacterial aerosol assemblage was statistically more similar to water assemblages than when the aerator was off. These findings highlight the potential for aeration remediation to increase exposure to viable bacterial aerosols in recreators (e.g. kayakers), a problem of greater concern where surface water is heavily polluted with sewage, as in Newtown Creek.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaulobacter 3aDNA libraries 3aVibrio 3aaeration 3aaerosols 3aair 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3aboats 3abubbles 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxygen 3aremediation 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asewage 3ashorelines 3astreams 3asurface water 3awaterways 3aUnited States 0aAeration 0aRemediation 0aWater quality 0aAerosols 0aBacteria 0aAir quality1 aO'Mullan, Gregory D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 478 p.184-189dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009500177300001600272520199600288592002802284650001302312650002002325650002502345650002202370650001002392650001402402650002302416650001002439650002202449650002702471650001802498650001102516650001302527650001302540650001502553650002502568650001602593651001702609651001802626653003702644653004402681653001702725653001602742700002802758700001402786700002202800700001302822700002202835773010202857856008702959852000903046655001203055IND60545541820221121174201.0160902e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlidina, Mazahirali14aThe occurrence of emerging trace organic chemicals in wastewater effluents in Saudi Arabia  ap. 152-162.  aEmerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) released into the environment via discharge of wastewater effluents have been detected in rivers and lakes worldwide, raising concerns due to their potential persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation. This study provides the first reconnaissance of TOrC occurrence in wastewater effluents within Saudi Arabia. Four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs 1–4) located in Western Saudi Arabia were sampled hourly over twelve-hour periods, for a total of six sampling events. All samples were analyzed for a wide range of TOrC encompassing pharmaceuticals, personal care products and household chemicals. Treatment and capacities of the plants varied from non-nitrifying to full biological nutrient removal providing a representative cross section of different types of plants operational within the country. A comparison of TOrC occurrence in effluents in Saudi Arabia with respective effluent qualities in the United States revealed similar levels for most TOrC. Overall, the occurrence of TOrC was higher at two of the plants. The higher TOrC concentrations at WWTP 1 are likely due to the non-nitrifying biological treatment process. The unique TOrC occurrence observed in the WWTP 3 effluent was unlike any other plant and was attributed to the influence of a large number of international visitors in its sewershed. The occurrence of TOrC in this plant was not expected to be representative of the occurrence elsewhere in the country. Bimodal diurnal variation expected for a range of TOrC was not observed, though some hourly variation in TOrC loading was noted for WWTP 3. Since water reclamation and reuse have received increasing interest in Saudi Arabia within the last few years, results from this study provide a good foundation in deciding whether advanced treatment is necessary to attenuate TOrC deemed to be of concern in effluents, or if natural treatment such as managed aquifer recharge provides sufficient protection to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abioaccumulation 3abiological treatment 3adiurnal variation 3adrugs 3aeffluents 3ahousehold products 3alakes 3aorganic compounds 3apersonal care products 3apublic health 3arivers 3atourists 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 3aSaudi Arabia 3aUnited States 0aEmerging trace organic chemicals 0aLiquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry 0aSaudi Arabia 0aWater reuse1 aHoppe-Jones, Christiane1 aYoon, Min1 aHamadeh, Ahmed F.1 aLi, Dong1 aDrewes, Jörg E.,0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 478 p.152-162dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010300170300001600273520190000289592002802189650001502217650001302232650000802245650001102253650001602264650002002280650001002300650001102310650001602321650001602337650000902353650000902362650001602371651001002387653002802397653002202425653001702447653002002464700001802484700001502502700001602517700001602533700001502549700001702564700001802581700001902599773010502618856008702723852000902810655001202819IND60545542220221120053004.0160902e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiyuan10aBlack carbon aerosol characterization in a remote area of Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, western China  ap. 151-158.  aThe concentrations, size distributions, and mixing states of refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols were measured with a ground-based Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), and aerosol absorption was measured with an Aethalometer at Qinghai Lake (QHL), a rural area in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau of China in October 2011. The area was not pristine, with an average rBC mass concentration of 0.36μgSTP-m−3 during the two-week campaign period. The rBC concentration peaked at night and reached the minimal in the afternoon. This diurnal cycle of concentration is negatively correlated with the mixed layer depth and ventilation. When air masses from the west of QHL were sampled in late afternoon to early evening, the average rBC concentration of 0.21μgSTP-m−3 was observed, representing the rBC level in a larger Tibetan Plateau region because of the highest mixed layer depth. A lognormal primary mode with mass median diameter (MMD) of ~175nm, and a small secondary lognormal mode with MMD of 470–500nm of rBC were observed. Relative reduction in the secondary mode during a snow event supports recent work that suggested size dependent removal of rBC by precipitation. About 50% of the observed rBC cores were identified as thickly coated by non-BC material. A comparison of the Aethalometer and SP2 measurements suggests that non-BC species significantly affect the Aethalometer measurements in this region. A scaling factor for the Aethalometer data at a wavelength of 880nm is therefore calculated based on the measurements, which may be used to correct other Aethalometer datasets collected in this region for a more accurate estimate of the rBC loading. The results present here significantly improve our understanding of the characteristics of rBC aerosol in the less studied Tibetan Plateau region and further highlight the size dependent removal of BC via precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aair 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3alakes 3amixing 3aphotometers 3arural areas 3asnow 3asoot 3awavelengths 3aChina 0aRefractory black carbon 0aSize distribution 0aMixing state 0aTibetan Plateau1 aSchwarz, J.P.1 aCao, Junji1 aGao, Rushan1 aFahey, D.W.1 aHu, Tafeng1 aHuang, R.-J.1 aHan, Yongming1 aShen, Zhenxing0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 01, v. 479-480 p.151-158dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015700175300001600332520201200348592002802360650001802388650001902406650001802425650001902443650001602462650000902478650001202487650001802499650001902517650001302536653001302549653001702562653002002579653001002599653001202609653002002621700002202641700002402663700001902687700009802706700002202804700002002826773011502846856008602961852000903047655001203056IND60662879120221119052943.0191121e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066287912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanick, Jared F.10aOptimizing design parameters of a peptide targeted liposomal nanoparticle in an in vivo multiple myeloma disease model after initial evaluation in vitro  ap. 190-200.  aDespite ligand-targeted liposomes long garnering interest as drug delivery vehicles for cancer therapeutics, inconsistency in successful outcomes have hindered their translation into the clinic. This is in part due to discrepancies between in vitro design evaluations and final in vivo outcomes. By employing a multifaceted synthetic strategy to prepare peptide-targeted nanoparticles of high purity, reproducibility, and with precisely controlled quantity of functionalities, we systematically evaluated the individual roles that peptide-linker length, peptide hydrophilicity, peptide density, and nanoparticle size play on cancer cell uptake and tumor targeting both in vitro and in vivo, and how the results correlated and contrasted. These parameters were analyzed using a VLA-4-targeted liposome system in a multiple myeloma mouse xenograft model to evaluate in vivo biodistribution and tumor cell uptake. The results showed that using in vitro models to optimize targeted-nanoparticles for maximum cellular uptake was helpful in narrowing down the particle characteristics. However, in vitro optimization fell short of achieving enhanced results in animal models, rather had negative consequences for in vivo targeting. This outcome is not surprising considering that the receptor being targeted is also present on healthy lymphocytes and increasing targeting peptide valency on particle surfaces results in an increase in non-selective, off-target binding to healthy cells. Hence, further optimization using in vivo models was absolutely necessary, through which we were able to increase the uptake of peptide-targeted liposomes by cancerous cells overexpressing VLA-4 to 15-fold over that of non-targeted liposomes in vivo. The results highlighted the importance of creating a comprehensive understanding of the effect of each liposome design parameter on multifactorial biological endpoints including both in vitro and in vivo in determining the therapeutic potential of peptide-targeted liposomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3adisease models 3adrug carriers 3ahydrophilicity 3alymphocytes 3amice 3amyeloma 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 0aLiposome 0aNanoparticle 0aLigand-targeted 0aVLA-4 0aPeptide 0aBiodistribution1 aOmstead, David T.1 aAshley, Jonathan D.1 aDeak, Peter E.1 aMustafaoglu, Nur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-9399 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-93991 aKiziltepe, Tanyel1 aBilgicer, Basar0 tJournal of controlled release.g2019 Oct., v. 311-312 p.190-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245012400212520133200336592002801668650002401696650001901720650001201739650001401751650001301765650001301778650001601791650001401807650001701821650001901838650001701857650000901874650001401883650001301897650002001910650001601930650001901946653002401965653002701989653001902016653001502035653002402050653001402074700002002088700005302108700001902161700002202180700001802202700007202220773010602292856008702398852000902485655001202494IND60688404020221118040004.0210624e20200705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1247052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajuli, Sanjiv1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6837-274910aSurface properties of cellulose nanocrystal stabilized crude oil emulsions and their effect on petroleum biodegradation  aCrude oil biodegradation was improved after increasing the oil/water interfacial area via emulsification with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and no added surfactants. The extent of biodegradation of C15-C20 aliphatic hydrocarbons by Serratia marcescens after 5 days of incubation was increased from 1 to 12% to 6–19 %. Surface and physicochemical properties such as water salinity, presence of divalent ions and CNC concentration affect the extent of biodegradation due to their influence in emulsion stability. Stable oil in water (O/W) emulsions containing 5 v/v % crude oil and 95 v/v % brine were prepared with CNC at concentrations from 0.4 to 1.0 wt % in American Petroleum Institute (API) brine, synthetic seawater, and NaCl solutions. Creaming rate and droplet coalescence of emulsions were measured to study the impact of CNC concentration, divalent cations and ionic strength on emulsion stability. Results show a greater extent of droplet coalescence at CNC concentrations higher than 0.8 wt % for emulsions prepared in API. Coalescence was significant in API brine (ionic strength, I = 1.9 M); however, it was minimal in SSW (I = 0.65 M) and in NaCl solutions of the same ionic strength. Furthermore, no coalescence was observed in NaCl solutions at ionic strengths of 0.32, 0.65, 0.95, and 1.9 M.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia marcescens 3abiodegradation 3acations 3acellulose 3acreaming 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3ahydrocarbons 3aionic strength 3ananocrystals 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3asurfactants 3awater salinity 0aPickering emulsions 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aBiodegradation 0aAdsorption 0aInterfacial tension 0aCrude oil1 aAlazzam, Omayma1 aWang, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3686-42921 aMota, Linda C.1 aAdhikari, Sangeet1 aWicks, Dariel1 aUreña-Benavides, Esteban E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5525-488X0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 July 05, v. 596 p.124705-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1247053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245006900180500001400249520145600263592002801719650001901747650001901766650001501785650001001800650001201810650001601822650001701838650001501855650001901870650001501889650001601904650001601920650002501936653001401961653001301975653001001988700002301998700003702021700002002058773009802078856008702176852000902263655001202272IND60662880320221121195845.0200614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.1102502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFullana-Pericàs, Mateu14aThe influence of grafting on crops’ photosynthetic performance  aNAL-light  aIn a near scenario of climate change where stress-derived limitations on crops' yield by affecting plant gas-exchange are expected, grafting may become a cheap and easy technique to improve crops photosynthetic performance and water-use efficiency. Inconsistent data of the effect of rootstocks over gas-exchange can be found in literature, being necessary an integrative analysis of the effect of grafting over photosynthetic parameters. With this aim, we present a compilation of the effect of graft on the net CO₂ assimilation rate (AN) and other photosynthetic parameters across different species with agronomic interest. No differences were observed in any photosynthetic parameter between non-grafted and self-grafted plants under non-stress conditions. However, differences were found depending on the used rootstock, particularly for the intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEᵢ). We observed that variations in AN induced by rootstocks were related to changes in both diffusive and biochemical parameters. Under drought or salt stress, different photosynthetic performances were observed depending on the rootstock, although the high variability among studies promted to remarkable results. Overall, we observed that grafting can be a useful technique to improve plant photosynthetic performance, and therefore, crop yield and WUE, and that the rootstock selection for a target environment is determinant for the variations in photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adrought 3aenvironment 3agas exchange 3aliterature 3aphotosynthesis 3arootstocks 3asalt stress 3avariability 3awater use efficiency 0aRootstock 0aSalinity 0aScion1 aConesa, Miquel À.1 aPérez-Alfocea, F.q(Francisco),1 aGalmés, Jeroni0 tPlant science.g2020 June, v. 295 p.110250-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.1102503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016500171520154900336592002801885650001701913650002101930650004401951650002001995650002602015650002902041650002602070650002002096650002102116650002102137650001502158650001702173650002402190650001802214650001902232650001402251650001902265650001602284650001702300650001802317650001902335650001002354650000702364650001702371650002102388650003702409650002502446650003702471653001702508653001702525653001802542653001502560653001802575700002102593700002002614700006102634700001702695700005502712773010602767856008702873852000902960655001202969IND60688404620221118035957.0210624e20200705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1247322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUppal, Shivani10aEffect of benzyl isothiocyanate encapsulated biocompatible nanoemulsion prepared via ultrasonication on microbial strains and breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231  aBenzyl Isothiocyanate (BITC), a nutraceutical belonging to the mustard family exhibits excellent antitumor and antimicrobial properties. Despite its prodigious potential, the lacuna in the practical application is due to hydrophobicity, high volatility, receded bioavailability, and acute odor. Owing to the entrenched advantages of the nanostructured colloidal systems, a new rhamnolipid based nanoemulsion was synthesized employing the heating-stirring-sonication method using GRAS ingredients to overcome the shortcomings of BITC. The nanoemulsion has been optimized to exhibit good long-term stability in a salt solution (50–200 mM) and at different pH conditions. The physicochemical properties were assessed using DLS, TEM, UV–vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Hemolysis and biocompatibility studies validated the bio-safety of the engineered nano-wagon. The system demonstrated high entrapment efficiency along with a sustained release. MTT assay performed indicated increased cytotoxicity of BITC NEm against MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells as compared to BITC alone. Qualitative and quantitative cell uptake studies performed using confocal spectroscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, validated that BITC was completely encapsulated in the nanocarrier and the formulation acted as an efficient and compatible carrier. Furthermore, the antibacterial assay of BITC loaded nanoemulsion showed promising results against strains of E. coli and S. aureus proving it to be a safe alternative for overcoming the pressure of resistant strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGRAS substances 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abenzyl isothiocyanate 3abioavailability 3abiocompatibility 3abreast neoplasms 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3aencapsulation 3aflow cytometry 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3ananocarriers 3ananoemulsions 3aneoplasm cells 3aodors 3apH 3arhamnolipids 3atoxicity testing 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aNanoemulsion 0aSonochemical 0aAntimicrobial 0aMDA MB 231 0aBiocompatible1 aSharma, Pratibha1 aRajendra Kumar,1 aKaur, Khushwinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6678-18051 aBhatia, Alka1 aMehta, S.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7140-69000 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 July 05, v. 596 p.124732-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1247323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007700176500001400253520093000267592002801197650002501225650001901250650001501269650001701284650001401301650001001315650002201325650001301347650002401360650002001384650002601404653003101430653000801461653001601469653001401485700002301499773009801522856008701620852000901707655001201716IND60662880520221121195834.0200128e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.1102512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallmark, H.

Research into the evolution of CRFs as sub-group members of the larger APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) family has yielded interesting and useful insights related to the functional roles of CRFs in plants. Recent studies of CRFs suggest that these transcription factors are a lot more than just a group of cytokinin related genes and play important roles in both plant development and environmental stress response. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the roles of CRFs beyond cytokinin, in reproductive development and abiotic stress response, as well as to other environmental cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabiotic stress 3acytokinins 3aembryophytes 3aevolution 3agenes 3aplant development 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranscription factors 0aCytokinin Response Factors 0aCRF 0aDevelopment 0aCytokinin1 aRashotte, Aaron M.0 tPlant science.g2019 Dec., v. 289 p.110251-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.1102513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009900175300001400274520133800288592002801626650000901654650001901663650001901682650001201701650002301713650002001736650001501756650003701771650002301808650001601831650001201847650001501859651001101874651001801885653001501903653000801918653001301926653002401939700002201963700003401985700001802019700002602037700002002063700002502083700002102108773010302129856008702232852000902319655001202328IND60545544020221123001038.0160902e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Karine O.10aAssessment of nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in PM1 near an area of heavy-duty traffic  ap. 57-65.  aThe objective of this research was to evaluate nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) associated with ultrafine airborne particles (PM1) in areas affected by vehicles in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre (MAPA), RS, Brazil. Extraction, isolation/derivatization, and subsequently gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC/ECD) were the techniques used to extract and determine NPAHs (1-nitronaphthalene, 2-nitrofluorene,3-nitrofluoranthene,1-nitropyrene, and 6-nitrochrysene) associated with PM1 Airborne particles (PM1) were collected using PTFE filters in a PM162M automatic sampler. The analytical method was validated by the Standard Reference Material – SRM 1649b – from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). The results were consistent with the certified values. 3-NFlt and 6-NChr reached highest concentrations of 0.047ng·m−3 and 0.0284ng·m−3, respectively, in Sapucaia do Sul and Canoas. Seasonal variation showed higher NPAH concentrations in cold days. The NPAHs associated with PM1 were correlated with the pollutants nitrogen oxides and NPAHs with meteorological variables: temperature and wind speed. The results indicated that vehicles with diesel engines were influential. This was confirmed by the study of the ratios NPAHs/PAHs, 1-NPyr/Pyr, and 6-NChr/Chr.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aderivatization 3adiesel engines 3afilters 3agas chromatography 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atraffic 3awind speed 3aBrazil 3aUnited States 0aNitro-PAHs 0aPM1 0aGC–ECD 0aAir particulate SRM1 aTeixeira, Elba C.1 aAgudelo-Castañeda, Dayana M.1 aBraga, Marcel1 aAlabarse, Priscila G.1 aWiegand, Flavio1 aKautzmann, Rubens M.1 aSilva, Luis F.O.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 01, v. 479-480 p.57-65dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245010600181500002200287520170700309592002802016650001002044650001202054650001102066650001502077650001502092650001302107650001702120650001502137650002102152650001102173650001902184650001402203650002402217650002102241650001002262650001902272650001702291651001102308653001902319653002302338653001802361700002802379700002702407700002102434700003302455700002302488700001902511700003002530773009702560856009002657852000902747655001202756IND60662880720221120165751.0190906e20190821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.1036432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeandro Souza, Franco10aImpervious surface and heterogeneity are opposite drivers to maintain bird richness in a Cerrado city  aPre-press version  aAssessing the influences of habitat structure on bird richness and functional groups can assist planning and management of urban conservation strategies. Here we analyzed how the urbanization of a city from central-west Brazil (Campo Grande) affects a Cerrado hotspot bird community by focusing on richness of bird feeding groups (frugivore, nectarivore, granivore, omnivore and insectivore). We sampled birds in 61 hexagons (16 ha each one) along an urbanization gradient. For each response variable (richness of bird feeding group) we used five predictor variables: impervious surface, sdNDVI, number of trees, edifices, and houses. To assess the effects of urbanization on bird species richness, we fitted multiple regression models and used Akaike’s information criterion for small samples to assess model performance. Impervious surface was the main driver of bird richness. The explanation of most plausible models for each response variable ranged from 20 to 51% of richness variability. Overall richness was negatively affected by impervious surface and positively influenced by number of houses and sdNDVI, a proxy of heterogeneity in our study area. The number of trees did not influence plant specialists and granivores, but the number of houses and sdNdvi did. Insectivore and omnivore richness were only affected by impervious surface. Campo Grande city mimics aspects of the Cerrado heterogeneity, such as bird community, which is characterized by species tolerant of high levels of disturbances. Our findings give support to urban planning initiatives that optimize patch dynamics and heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, as being appropriate for cities within Cerrado landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acerrado 3acities 3afrugivores 3agranivores 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3alandscapes 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anectar feeding 3aomnivores 3aregression analysis 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 0abird community 0aurban biodiversity 0aurban ecology1 aValente-Neto, Francisco1 aSevero-Neto, Francisco1 aBueno, Berinaldo1 aManoel Ochoa-Quintero, José1 aRicardo Laps, Rudi1 aBolzan, Fábio1 ade Oliveira Roque, Fábio0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2019 Aug. 21, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.1036433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245011100179500002200290520179700312592002802109650002302137650002202160650002002182650002202202650001202224650001502236650001302251650002202264650001002286650001702296651001202313700001502325773009802340856009002438852000902528655001202537IND60662881020221120155910.0190906e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.1036522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonney, Mitchell T.10aAttributing drivers to spatio-temporal changes in tree density across a suburbanizing landscape since 1944  aPre-press version  aUrban expansion, especially suburbanization, represents a major social, economic and environmental shift that has escalated since the mid-1900s in North America. Suburban development leads to corresponding changes in the treed environment of urban-rural fringes. It is important to understand where, when and why trees change in response to development over many decades, but this is difficult since long-term data are scarce. We used 70+ years (1944-2017) of leaf-off aerial photographs, often representing the only long-term landscape record, to quantify and map spatio-temporal changes in tree density through the entirety of the agricultural-suburban transitional period. Photo-interpretation of individual tree locations, along with recording observable drivers of change, was completed across six different modern landscapes in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that tree density often recovers, or even increases, post-development. There are differences between landscapes, but most tree density gains are associated with forest expansion and tree planting, while most losses are associated with building and road construction. The influence of these drivers, along with the temporal trajectory of tree density changes, are shaped by a landscape’s socioecological legacy and the length, scope and intensity of development (as decided by decision makers). Processes include initial tree losses followed by recovery from tree planting, and forest succession in abandoned fields after land purchase and nearby development. We assert that the spatio-temporal changes in tree density and related drivers quantified here can be generalized to gain knowledge on how tree density and distribution across agricultural landscapes will change under different development scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aagricultural land 3adecision making 3aforest succession 3aforests 3alandscapes 3aplanting 3aroad construction 3atrees 3aurbanization 3aOntario1 aHe, Yuhong0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2019 Sept. 02, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.1036523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010500170500002200275520239300297592002802690650001802718650002202736650002402758650001102782650001202793650001202805650001302817650001002830650000902840650001702849650001802866650001102884650001902895650001202914650001302926650002202939650001502961650001102976651001902987651002603006651001803032653002103050653001803071653003603089700002303125700001603148700002103164700002303185700002303208700002003231700002203251773008203273856008703355852000903442655001203451IND60662881320221120155831.0190906e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.1068552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslan, Andres10aResolving time-space histories of Late Cenozoic bedrock incision along the Upper Colorado River, USA  aPre-press version  aThe upper Colorado River basin drains the western slope of the Rocky Mountains province of North America and hosts a rich record of fluvial terraces and volcanic deposits that provide an archive of bedrock river incision since the Late Miocene. Here we present new geochronology from fluvial deposits and associated volcanic units using multiple methods (luminescence, cosmogenic-burial, 40Ar/39Ar basalt and detrital sanidine, and U/Pb detrital zircon) to reconstruct a detailed record of bedrock incision in the upper Colorado River over timescales ranging from Miocene to Late Pleistocene. Late Miocene (ca. 11–8 Ma) basalt flows perched 800–1700 m above the Colorado River, and the oldest known ancestral Colorado River deposits preserved beneath basalt flows on Grand Mesa, provide the basis for average, long-term (~107 yr) incision rates. Rates range from ~110–160 m/Ma between Grand Junction (downstream) and Glenwood Canyon (upstream), with rates decreasing upvalley. Intermediate-scale (~105–106 yr) incision rates are ~200–320 m/m.y. over the past 1–3 Ma, and these rates are faster than the average over the past 8–11 Ma. Short-term (<100 ka) bedrock incision rates are highly variable, and range from ~250–725 m/m.y. The large variation in rates is interpreted to reflect the inherently unsteady nature of climate-driven incision when measured over time intervals (103–104 yr) that are shorter than the duration of ~100 ky climate cycles. Finally, episodes of anomalously rapid (~2000–3700 m/m.y.) short-term bedrock incision appear to be the consequence of stream piracy and drainage reorganization and are confined to specific reaches of the system. Collectively, these data provide a substantially refined picture of the history of incision through space and time that is consistent with headward erosion of the Colorado River into the uplifting flanks of the Rocky Mountains since at least the Late Miocene. We argue that the long-term pace of incision is not completely accounted for by isostatic rebound in response to exhumation, and that ongoing differential uplift driven by mantle buoyancy sets the background rates of fluvial incision (100–150 m/m.y.). Pulses of more rapid incision are a consequence of non-steady incision related to climatically-driven changes in erosion efficiency and/or drainage reorganization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aargon (noble gases) 3abasalt 3abedrock 3aclimate 3adrainage 3ahosts 3alead 3aluminescence 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3aspace and time 3astreams 3aterraces 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3azircon 3aColorado River 3aRocky Mountain region 3aUnited States 0aBedrock incision 0aMantle uplift 0aDetrital sanidine geochronology1 aKarlstrom, Karl E.1 aKirby, Eric1 aHeizler, Matt T.1 aGranger, Darryl E.1 aFeathers, James K.1 aHanson, Paul R.1 aMahan, Shannon A.0 tGeomorphology.g2019 Aug. 27, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.1068553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014700170520148000317592002801797650002801825650001801853650001001871650001901881650001301900650001301913650001301926650001901939650001401958650001501972650002501987650001602012650002302028650001302051653002202064653001402086653001702100653002202117653002002139700001602159700001802175773010602193856008702299852000902386655001202395IND60688406020221122082442.0200824e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1248022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Tierong10aPreparation and biological properties of collagen/nano-hydroxyapatite composite nanofibers based on ordered nano-hydroxyapatite ceramic fibers  aMan-made materials are easily available, processed and modified during bone defect repairing, without worrying about potential infections, immunological incompatibility, sterility, or donor site morbidity. Collagen(Col)/nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) composite nanofibers based on ordered nHA ceramic fibers was prepared by sintering electrostatic spinning PVP/HA composite fibers followed by impregnation with collagen solution. Without requiring strict control of temperature or humidity, this method prevented nHA aggregation during the sintering process and reduced the use of costly Col as compared with direct electrospinning. The composite nanofiber membrane with bone-like components and structures has a great potential for application in bone tissue engineering. And the method implement easily.. The mineralization and degradation characteristics of the nanofiber biocomposite are beneficial for the bone conductivity and MSCs growth and metabolism. Protein adsorption of Col/HA nanofiber biocomposite is outstanding. There is no significant difference in cells viability between the experiment group and the control group, and Col/HA nanofibers biocomposite has weak cytotoxicity to MSCs. Overall, the approach successfully prepared Col/HA nanofibers biocomposite at common electrospinning environment with uniformly distributed high content nHA, low Col concentration and less Col consumption, all of which make it an excellent choice for the bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiocomposites 3abones 3acell viability 3aceramics 3acollagen 3ahumidity 3amineralization 3amorbidity 3ananofibers 3apsychological stress 3atemperature 3atissue engineering 3atoxicity 0aPVP/HA nanofibers 0aSintering 0aImpregnation 0aCol/HA nanofibers 0aBicompatibility1 aZhang, Heng1 aXing, Hongyun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 602 p.124802-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1248023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04590naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012300179500002200302520282900324592002803153650002003181650001303201650001303214650001903227650001903246650002903265650001203294650001303306650001003319650002703329650002303356650004303379650001603422650001803438650002003456650001003476650002403486653002203510653002503532653002403557653003103581700002403612700002103636700002303657700002103680700002003701700002603721700002303747700002103770700002203791773010403813856008603917852000904003655001204012IND60662881720221120165742.0190923e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.1035512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Alexandra Marie10aChlorinated ethene plume evolution after source thermal remediation: Determination of degradation rates and mechanisms  aPre-press version  aThe extent, mechanism(s), and rate of chlorinated ethene degradation in a large tetrachloroethene (PCE) plume were investigated in an extensive sampling campaign. Multiple lines of evidence for this degradation were explored, including compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), dual C-Cl isotope analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis targeting the genera Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas and the genes vcrA, bvcA, and cerA. A decade prior to this sampling campaign, the plume source was thermally remediated by steam injection. This released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that stimulated microbial activity and created reduced conditions within the plume. Based on an inclusive analysis of minor and major sampling campaigns since the initial site characterization, it was estimated that reduced conditions peaked 4 years after the remediation event. At the time of this study, 11 years after the remediation event, the redox conditions in the aquifer are returning to their original state. However, the DOC released from the remediated source zone matches levels measured 3 years prior and plume conditions are still suitable for biotic reductive dechlorination. Dehalococcoides spp., Dehalogenimonas spp., and vcrA, bvcA, and cerA reductive dehalogenase genes were detected close to the source, and suggest that complete, biotic PCE degradation occurs here. Further downgradient, qPCR analysis and enriched δ13C values for cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) suggest that cDCE is biodegraded in a sulfate-reducing zone in the plume. In the most downgradient portion of the plume, lower levels of specific degraders supported by dual C-Cl analysis indicate that the biodegradation occurs in combination with abiotic degradation. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing shows that organizational taxonomic units known to contain organohalide-respiring bacteria are relatively abundant throughout the plume. Hydraulic conductivity testing was also conducted, and local degradation rates for PCE and cDCE were determined at various locations throughout the plume. PCE degradation rates from sampling campaigns after the thermal remediation event range from 0.11 to 0.35 yr−1. PCE and cDCE degradation rates from the second to the third sampling campaigns ranged from 0.08 to 0.10 yr−1 and 0.01 to 0.07 yr−1, respectively. This is consistent with cDCE as the dominant daughter product in the majority of the plume and cDCE degradation as the time-limiting step. The extensive temporal and spatial analysis allowed for tracking the evolution of the plume and the lasting impact of the source remediation and illustrates that the multiple lines of evidence approach is essential to elucidate the primary degradation mechanisms in a plume of such size and complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalococcoides 3aaquifers 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3adechlorination 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenzymes 3aethylene 3agenes 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amicrobial activity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aremediation 3aribosomal RNA 3astable isotopes 3asteam 3atetrachloroethylene 0aMolecular biology 0aDehalogenimonas spp. 0aAbiotic degradation 0aMultiple lines of evidence1 aOttosen, Cecilie B.1 aMaillard, Julien1 aHolliger, Christof1 aJohansen, Anders1 aBrabæk, Lærke1 aKristensen, Inge Lise1 aZimmermann, Jeremy1 aHunkeler, Daniel1 aBroholm, Mette M.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2019 Aug. 30, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2019.1035513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014400171300001600315520188900331592002802220650000802248650001102256650001502267650001402282650001402296650002002310650001702330650001402347650001902361650001602380653001902396653002502415653001702440653002502457653002002482653001602502700002402518700002002542700005502562700001902617700002102636773010502657856008702762852000902849655001202858IND60545545120221122230752.0160902e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPateraki, St.10aAssessment of PM2.5 and PM1 chemical profile in a multiple-impacted Mediterranean urban area: Origin, sources and meteorological dependence  ap. 210-220.  aAirborne particulate matter in the PM2.5 and PM1 size ranges has been sampled at three sites within the Mediterranean urban area of the Athens Basin, representing background, roadside-industrialized and coastal background locations. With the principal aim to identify the sources and discriminate the contribution of the regional input versus the local one, simultaneous chemical characterization with respect to carbonaceous and ionic species was also carried out on the collected samples. In general, the average recorded values were within the Mediterranean concentration range. The constant prevalence of the ionic mass (52%–79%) over one of the carbonaceous, being combined with the occurrence of its maximum rates at the coastal background environment (74%–79% and 73%–77% for PM2.5 and PM1, respectively) leads to the hypothesis that the fine PM pollution in the basin, especially for the remote locations, is evidently governed by the external intrusion. Even at the polluted atmosphere of the roadside-industrialized environment, the PM mass was regionally originated, with the corresponding input reaching up to 87% (northward flow). Applying factor analysis on the PM2.5 database it came obvious that the sources which were responsible for the configured PM burden were not fully differentiated not only between the different types of environment but also between the exceedances and the clean air events. The contribution of the secondary, marine and combustion processes was constant at all the stations of the network, while a continuous input of crustal particles characterized both the roadside-industrialized and the coastal atmosphere. Finally, the episodic values show a general common signal of secondary mixed ΡΜ emissions, high influence of both regional and local pollution spikes, confirming the earlier findings for the significance of transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abasins 3acombustion 3adatabases 3aemissions 3afactor analysis 3aparticulates 3apollution 3atransportation 3aurban areas 0aFine particles 0aChemical composition 0aMass closure 0aRegional/local input 0aFactor analysis 0aMeteorology1 aAsimakopoulos, D.N.1 aBougiatioti, A.1 aMaggos, Th.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1193-44021 aVasilakos, Ch.1 aMihalopoulos, N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 01, v. 479-480 p.210-220dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016200169300001600331520155300347592002801900650001301928650001701941650001501958650001001973650001601983650002101999650001102020650002602031650001302057650001102070650001302081650001902094650001202113650001802125651002002143653002602163653004402189653001802233653002102251700001702272700001502289773010502304856008702409852000902496655001202505IND60545545220221122230714.0160902e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenció, A.10aRiver–aquifer interactions and their relationship to stygofauna assemblages: A case study of the Gwydir River alluvial aquifer (New South Wales, Australia)  ap. 292-305.  aIn contrast to surface water ecosystems, groundwater ecosystems are usually considered to have relatively stable conditions and physically inert environments. However, many groundwater ecosystems undergo substantial changes through space and time, related to fluxes in groundwater flow, exchange and nutrient imports.In this study we used hydrochemical data to: 1) determine the different hydrogeological conditions in an alluvial system, the shallow Gwydir River alluvial aquifer (located in Northern New South Wales, Australia); and 2) analyze the relationship between hydrochemical conditions and the composition of stygofauna assemblages in the aquifer.Using hydrochemical modeling and multivariate analyses, four main hydrogeological situations were defined as occurring in the aquifer. Bores were classified as having either a high, low or no influence from or exchange with the river. The latter group was further subdivided into those of low and high salinity.Further analysis combining the biological and hydrochemical data identified two main groups of samples. The first group was composed mainly of samples related to the aquifer groundwater which had higher richness and abundance of fauna compared to samples in the second group which was comprised of samples affected by stream water leakage and samples related to the highest salinities. These results suggest that more stable conditions (mainly related to steadier groundwater head levels) and lower nitrate concentrations promoted a more diverse and abundant stygofauna community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3afauna 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrates 3arivers 3asalinity 3aspace and time 3astreams 3asurface water 3aNew South Wales 0aGroundwater ecosystem 0aSurface water–groundwater interaction 0aHuman impacts 0aAlluvial aquifer1 aKorbel, K.L.1 aHose, G.C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 01, v. 479-480 p.292-305dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245019500173520114600368592002801514650002201542650001301564650001801577650001201595650001201607650000801619650001201627650002401639650001001663653002001673653001101693653001201704653001601716700002401732773009501756856008401851852000901935655001201944IND60662882120221121235043.0200318e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2019.1044242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrankel, Leslie Ann14aThe moderating role of parent gender on the relationship between restrictive feeding and a child's self–regulation in eating: Results from mother-only samples may not apply to both parents  aSelf-regulation in eating is increasingly becoming an area of interest especially in child obesity and development literature and prevention. This study aims to examine differences in the impact of overtly restrictive feeding practices across mothers and fathers on child's self-regulation in eating. A moderated multiple regression model was run to test the moderating effect of gender on the relationship between overtly restrictive feeding practices and self-regulation. A simple slope analysis was then used to probe the interaction term between overt restriction in feeding and gender. Results from a moderation analysis indicate parental gender to be a significant factor affecting the relationship between overtly restrictive feeding and a child's self-regulation in eating. On probing the interaction, the simple slope was negative and significant when gender was female meaning that women's use of overt restriction negatively impacts children's ability to self-regulate in eating compared to men. Feeding studies often generalize findings from mother-only samples to all parents but these results provide evidence against doing so.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aeating habits 3afathers 3afemales 3amen 3amothers 3aregression analysis 3awomen 0aSelf-regulation 0aEating 0aFeeding 0aRestriction1 aKuno, Caroline Bena0 tAppetite.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 143 p.104424-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1044243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009900177300001600276520170800292592002802000650001602028650002502044650001902069650002702088650002002115650002302135650001302158650002902171650001502200650002102215650001302236650002102249651001602270653002102286653001602307653001302323653001802336653000902354700002002363773010502383856008702488852000902575655001202584IND60545545520221123000953.0160902e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, Prakash10aDissipation of sulfamethoxazole in pasture soils as affected by soil and environmental factors  ap. 284-291.  aThe dissipation of sulfamethoxazole (SMO) antibiotic in three different soils was investigated through laboratory incubation studies. The experiments were conducted under different incubation conditions such as initial chemical concentration, soil depth, temperature, and with sterilisation. The results indicate that SMO dissipated rapidly in New Zealand pasture soils, and the 50% dissipation times (DT50) in Hamilton, Te Kowhai and Horotiu soils under non-sterile conditions were 9.24, 4.3 and 13.33days respectively. During the incubation period for each sampling event the soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and the variation in microbial community were monitored thorough phospholipid fatty acid extraction analysis (PLFA). The DHA data correlated well with the dissipation rate constants of SMO antibiotic, an increase in the DHA activity resulted in faster antibiotic dissipation. The PLFA analysis was indicative of higher bacterial presence as compared to fungal community, highlighting the type of microbial community responsible for dissipation. The results indicate that with increasing soil depth, SMO dissipation in soil was slower (except for Horotiu) while with increase in temperature the antibiotic loss was faster, and was noticeable in all the soils. Both the degree of biological activity and the temperature of the soil influenced overall SMO dissipation. SMO is not likely to persist more than 5–6months in all three soils suggesting that natural biodegradation may be sufficient for the removal of these contaminants from the soil. Its dissipation in sterile soils indicated abiotic factors such as strong sorption onto soil components to play a role in the dissipation of SMO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradation 3achemical concentration 3aedaphic factors 3afungal communities 3apastures 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil depth 3asoil temperature 3asorption 3asulfamethoxazole 3aNew Zealand 0aSulfamethoxazole 0aDissipation 0aKinetics 0aDehydrogenase 0aPLFA1 aSarmah, Ajit K.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 01, v. 479-480 p.284-291dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245008500211500001400296500002200310520158200332592002801914650001501942650003001957650001501987650001102002650002202013650001202035650000902047650001502056650000902071650001102080650001502091650001302106650001802119650002302137650001702160650002102177650001202198650001702210650001602227650001602243653003802259653001402297653003202311653002402343653002502367653002802392700001602420700002102436700002302457700006502480700002702545700002002572700006202592773010002654856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60662882820221121235022.0190906e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066288282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharaf, Omar Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8621-252710aUltrastable Plasmonic Nanofluids in Optimized Direct Absorption Solar Collectors  aNAL-light  aPre-press version  aNanofluids used in low-flux direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs) typically encounter critical stability issues due to long-term storage, elevated temperatures, high particle concentrations, and fouling from free surfactants. Here, we developed ultrastable nanofluids, and their properties were used to computationally optimize DASC designs. Broadband photothermal absorption was achieved using citrate- (CIT-) and polyethylene glycol-coated (PEG-) gold nanoparticles, circumventing the need for free surfactants. The nanofluids were subjected to long-term ambient storage, high particle concentrations, and incremental heating to analyze their stability and utility in DASCs. Electrosteric stabilization (PEG+CIT) provided superior colloidal stability and more consistent optical properties; chemical and colloidal stability was verified for 16 months, the longest demonstration of stable nanofluids under ambient storage in the solar literature. Optical measurements of the stabilized solar nanofluids were fed into a DASC optimization model. A constrained generalized pattern search (GPS) algorithm simultaneously maximized collector thermal power gain and minimized nanoparticle mass loading, while maintaining a collector temperature-gain target. Ultimately, by simultaneously developing ultrastable solar nanofluids, minimizing nanoparticle loading requirements, and maximizing collector thermal power gain, the outcomes from this study are considered a significant step towards deploying efficient and reliable low-flux, nanofluid-based DASCs in field applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3adesign 3aenergy conversion 3afouling 3aheat 3aliterature 3amass 3amodels 3ananofluids 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3apolyethylene 3asolar collectors 3astorage 3astorage time 3asurfactants 3atemperature 0adirect absorption solar collector 0ananofluid 0aelectrosteric stabilization 0aglobal optimization 0adispersion stability 0aplasmonic nanoparticles1 aRizk, Nahla1 aJoshi, Chakra P.1 aAbi Jaoudé, Maguy1 aAl-Khateeb, Ashraf N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4651-14901 aKyritsis, Dimitrios C.1 aAbu-Nada, Eiyad1 aMartin, Matthew N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6323-40960 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Aug. 28, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014900173520144700322592002801769650002501797650001501822650002301837650002001860650001701880650002701897650001501924650001201939650001501951650001701966650001601983650001801999650001702017650002202034650002102056650001702077653002302094653004202117653002602159653002402185700001502209700001502224700001602239700001302255700005502268773010302323856008702426852000902513655001202522IND60688407420221120031413.0200523e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1109842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuangfu, Xiaoxia10aSynthesis of water soluble CuGaS2/ZnS quantum dots for ultrasensitive fluorescent detection of alkaline phosphatase based on inner filter effect  aDeveloping monitoring technique for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is crucial due to the important role it plays in living cells. Here, a kind of biocompatible glutathione-modified CuGaS₂/ZnS quantum dots (GSH-CGS/ZnS QDs) was used as a fluorescent substance and then fabricated “turn-off” fluorescent biosensor for detection of ALP by help of inner filter effect (IFE). Firstly, we prepared CuGaS₂/ZnS (CGS/ZnS) QDs using solvothermal method and explored the efficient ligand (GSH) exchanges strategy for transferring oil-soluble CGS/ZnS QDs to aqueous phase. More importantly, we also explored the potential biological applications of the nanohybrid QDs. The obtained GSH-CGS/ZnS QDs emitted strong yellow fluorescence with the maximum excitation (400 nm) and emission (601 nm). Then, GSH-CGS/ZnS QDs were mixed with p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) and ALP. PNPP could be hydrolyzed to p-nitrophenol (PNP) by help of catalysis of ALP, and the excitation spectrum of the GSH-CGS/ZnS QDs overlapped well with the absorption spectrum of PNP, so the fluorescence of GSH-CGS/ZnS QDs was initially quenched via the so-called “IFE”. Finally, a novel “turn-off” biosensor for sensitive detection of ALP in the range of 0.05–10 U L ⁻¹(R² = 0.98) with a detection limit of 0.01 U L⁻¹ was successfully obtained. Results indicated that I-III-VI₂ nanocrystals have great potential for their promising biomedical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent substances 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3amonitoring 3ananocrystals 3ananohybrids 3ap-nitrophenol 3aquantum dots 3aspectral analysis 3awater solubility 3azinc sulfide 0aGSH-CuGaS2/ZnS QDs 0aWater solubility and biocompatibility 0aFluorescent detection 0aInner filter effect1 aShen, Yang1 aYang, Anzi1 aLiu, Lixiao1 aLuo, Wen1 aZhao, Wenbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-01250 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 July, v. 191 p.110984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1109843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167300001600258520129400274592002801568650002501596650002801621650001301649650001101662650002301673650001701696650001501713650002201728650001301750651001001763653004101773653002801814653002801842653003401870653002301904653001001927653000901937653000801946653000801954653000901962653000801971653001001979653001001989653000901999653000802008653001102016653000902027653000802036653000902044653000802053653000802061653000802069700001502077700001602092700001802108700001202126700001602138700001702154700001602171773034102187856008502528852000902613655001202622IND60688408220221121023505.0200614e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068840822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Fangyi10aAssociation between mitochondrial DNA haplogroup variation and coronary artery disease  ap. 960-966.  aMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups have been associated with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in European populations. However, the specific mtDNA haplogroups associated with CAD have not been investigated in Chinese populations.Here, we carried out a case–control study including 1036 and 481 CAD patients and 973 and 511 geographically matched asymptomatic control subjects in southern and northern China, respectively. After adjusting for age and gender, our results indicated that mtDNA haplogroups are not associated with the occurrence of CAD and its subcategories, acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary heart disease, in both southern and northern Chinese populations. By focusing on the southern Chinese population, we further revealed that mtDNA haplogroups are not associated with CAD severity.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension are two key driving factors for the development of CAD, nonetheless, we found that the frequencies of the 12 studied mtDNA haplogroups did not differ between patients with and without T2D or hypertension.mtDNA haplogroups are not associated with the occurrence of CAD or its subcategories in Chinese populations. Other factors such as environment and nuclear genetic background may contribute to the occurrence of CAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3acoronary artery disease 3adiabetes 3agender 3agenetic background 3ahypertension 3ametabolism 3amitochondrial DNA 3apatients 3aChina 0aMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup 0aCoronary artery disease 0aAcute coronary syndrome 0aStable coronary heart disease 0aChinese population 0amtDNA 0adNTP 0aCAD 0aACS 0aSCHD 0aT2D 0arRNAs 0atRNAs 0anDNA 0aROS 0amtSNPs 0arCRS 0aPCR 0aRFLP 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aBMI1 aLi, Meinan1 aWang, Junyi1 aLiu, Jiangtao1 aLi, Jin1 aFang, Hezhi1 aLyu, Jianxin1 aShen, Lijun0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2020 June 09, v. 30, no. 6 p.960-966dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03779naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245013500176300001400311520161100325592002801936650002301964650003801987650002002025650002002045650002602065650003002091650000902121650002102130650000902151650002302160650001102183650001202194650001102206650002702217650001202244650001802256650001802274650003002292650001402322650001802336650001902354650001602373651001802389651001102407653000902418653000902427653000902436653001402445653001802459653001802477700002202495700002502517700002302542700001302565700002202578700006002600700001402660700001702674700001902691700001902710700001602729700001702745700005802762700001802820773009902838856008702937852000903024655001203033IND60545547520221120115949.0160902e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054554752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSsebugere, Patrick10aPolychlorinated biphenyls and hexachlorocyclohexanes in sediments and fish species from the Napoleon Gulf of Lake Victoria, Uganda  ap. 55-60.  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were analyzed in surface sediments (<30cm depth) and two fish species: Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The samples were collected from the Napoleon Gulf on the northern shore of Lake Victoria. The analysis was done using a gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer for PCBs and a GC equipped with an electron capture detector for HCHs. Total (Σ) PCBs in the muscles of fish varied widely with mean values ranging from 41 to 670pgg−1 lipid weight (lw). The PCB levels in L. niloticus were significantly greater than those in O. niloticus. The large variability observed in the data was attributed to differences in feeding habits and trophic levels. While O. niloticus is a filter-eating fish species feeding mainly on phytoplankton and zooplankton, L. niloticus have predatory feeding behaviors and prefer a diet of live fish and, therefore, are more prone to bio-accumulate contaminants. The mean PCB concentrations in the sediments varied from 362 to 848pgg−1 dry weight. Variations in PCB levels were observed from one study site to another, this was attributed to the nature and particle size of the sediments. HCH isomers were detected in fish at mean concentrations of up to 45,900pgg−1 lw. The PCB and HCH concentrations were lower than those from previous studies elsewhere in literature and were below the maximum residue limits set by the European Commission and FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, implying that the fish was fit for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aLates niloticus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aWorld Health Organization 3adiet 3afeeding behavior 3afish 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3aisomers 3alipids 3amaximum residue limits 3amuscles 3aparticle size 3aphytoplankton 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asediments 3aspectrometers 3atrophic levels 3azooplankton 3aLake Victoria 3aUganda 0aPCBs 0aHCHs 0aFish 0aSediments 0aNapoleon Gulf 0aLake Victoria1 aSillanpää, Mika1 aKiremire, Bernard T.1 aKasozi, Gabriel N.1 aWang, Pu1 aSojinu, Samuel O.1 aOtieno, Peter O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5364-37611 aZhu, Nali1 aZhu, Chaofei1 aZhang, Haidong1 aShang, Hongtao1 aRen, Daiwei1 aLi, Yingming1 aZhang, Qinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5591-97761 aJiang, Guibin0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 May 15, v. 481 p.55-60dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010300175300001400278520158700292592002801879650002601907650001801933650002401951650002301975653003301998653002302031653002702054653002502081700002302106700001902129773010802148856008702256852000902343655001202352IND60542972320221120065556.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJesionka, Virginie10aTransitioning from proportion of discriminators to a more meaningful measure of sensory difference  ap. 77-82.  aA commonly used approach for quantifying effect sizes in sensory difference testing is the so-called “Proportion of Discriminators” or “Proportion of Distinguishers” model. Such effect sizes are quantified by determining the proportion of discriminators in the population via a transformation of the proportion of correct responses in the difference test. This model has intuitive appeal as it promises researchers the ability to gauge the meaningfulness of results – experiments that yield a high Proportion of Discriminators are supposed to reflect meaningful sensory differences.Despite the intuitive appeal of this approach, in this article we highlight that the Proportion of Discriminators model has several limitations and, in fact, does not actually have many of the properties that a measure of underlying effect size should have. Moreover we show that these limitations can lead to important errors – as a result we conclude that the Proportion of Discriminators model not be used.As an alternative, we recommend Thurstonian analysis, and we show how Thurstonian analysis offers many of the intuitive properties that Proportion of Discriminators lacks. Nonetheless, communication challenges remain, especially between researchers and management. To address these challenges we provide suggestions and tables to help guide the transition away from Proportion of Discriminators towards a Thurstonian perspective. This transition, once complete, will reward sensory researchers with more reliable and meaningful information from their difference testing programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3alinear models 3aproduct development 3asensory evaluation 0aProportion of discriminators 0aDifference testing 0aDiscrimination testing 0aThurstonian analysis1 aRousseau, Benoît,1 aEnnis, John M.0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Mar., v. 32 p.77-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245003200165300001600197520090400213592002801117650001101145650002501156653002501181653002001206653002001226653001401246773012101260856008201381852000901463655001201472IND60607537520221122094823.0180731e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060753752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelef, Amit12aA Gini-based unit root test  ap. 763-772.  aA Gini-based statistical test for a unit root is suggested. This test is based on the well-known Dickey–Fuller test, where the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is replaced by the semi-parametric Gini regression in modeling the AR process. A residual-based bootstrap is used to find critical values. The Gini methodology is a rank-based methodology that takes into account both the variate values and the ranks. Therefore, it provides robust estimators that are rank-based, while avoiding loss of information. Furthermore, the Gini methodology relies on first-order moment assumptions, which validates its use for a wide range of distributions. Simulation results validate the Gini-based test and indicate its superiority in some design settings in comparison to other available procedures. The Gini-based test opens the door for further developments such as a Gini-based cointegration test.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 0aTime series analysis 0aUnit root tests 0aGini regression 0aBootstrap0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Aug., v. 100 p.763-772dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014400171300001600315520153700331592002801868650002701896650002501923650001301948650002701961650001301988650001602001650002802017650001002045650001502055650002502070650001402095650001402109650001802123650002202141650000902163650001502172650002002187651001302207700002502220700002502245700002402270700002502294700002202319773010802341856008102449852000902530655001202539IND60519411120221121044448.0160428e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051941112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-015-1170-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaraihom, Siraprapa10aFirst report of a tropical Lysobacter enzymogenes producing bifunctional endoglucanase activity towards carboxymethylcellulose and chitosan  ap. 907-919.  aIn the past, Lysobacter spp. were found only in temperate and sub-tropical zones. In order to assess the existence of Lysobacter spp. in tropical environments, samples were collected from grass-covered soil in Thailand. Among several bacteria obtained, isolate 521 (NCCB 100553) was identified as Lysobacter enzymogenes based on morphology and physiological tests along with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Phenotypic characteristic variations of L. enzymogenes 521 with respect to the most studied strain from temperate regions, L. enzymogenes C3, were observed. The growth rate, carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and chitosanase activity of L. enzymogenes 521 were clearly higher than those of L. enzymogenes C3. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the endoglucanase derived were deduced from draft genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the endoglucanase gene and multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence illustrated that the endoglucanase (Cel8A) from L. enzymogenes 521 displayed homology to family 8 glycoside hydrolases (GHF-8), and was found to be similar to the bifunctional endoglucanase (Cel8A) from Lysobacter sp. IB-9374. Bifunctional CMCase and chitosanase activities of a purified endoglucanase with a mass of 41 kDa from L. enzymogenes 521 were revealed by zymogram analysis. This is the first report on the phenotypical characteristics, the endoglucanase with bifunctional CMCase and chitosanase activities, and the endoglucanase gene, from L. enzymogenes from a tropical environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLysobacter enzymogenes 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3achitosanase 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agenes 3aglycosides 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 3aThailand1 aKobayashi, Donald Y.1 aLotrakul, Pongtharin1 aPrasongsuk, Sehanat1 aEveleigh, Douglas E.1 aPunnapayak, Hunsa0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2016 June, v. 66, no. 2 p.907-919dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-015-1170-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011900174300001600293520200400309592002802313650002602341650001302367650001702380650001902397650001202416650001902428650001902447650001402466650001902480650001402499650001602513653001902529653002602548653001702574653002502591700002402616700001902640700002402659700002002683700002202703700001502725700001802740700002202758700002302780700001802803700001702821773008802838856008602926852000903012655001203021IND60089197620221120063034.0160903e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008919762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodayari, Arezoo10aIntercomparison of the capabilities of simplified climate models to project the effects of aviation CO2 on climate  ap. 321-328.  aThis study evaluates the capabilities of the carbon cycle and energy balance treatments relative to the effect of aviation CO2 emissions on climate in several existing simplified climate models (SCMs) that are either being used or could be used for evaluating the effects of aviation on climate. Since these models are used in policy-related analyses, it is important that the capabilities of such models represent the state of understanding of the science. We compare the Aviation Environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) Impacts climate model, two models used at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo (CICERO-1 and CICERO-2), the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) model as described in Jain et al. (1994), the simple Linear Climate response model (LinClim) and the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change version 6 (MAGICC6). In this paper we select scenarios to illustrate the behavior of the carbon cycle and energy balance models in these SCMs. This study is not intended to determine the absolute and likely range of the expected climate response in these models but to highlight specific features in model representations of the carbon cycle and energy balance models that need to be carefully considered in studies of aviation effects on climate. These results suggest that carbon cycle models that use linear impulse-response-functions (IRF) in combination with separate equations describing air–sea and air–biosphere exchange of CO2 can account for the dominant nonlinearities in the climate system that would otherwise not have been captured with an IRF alone, and hence, produce a close representation of more complex carbon cycle models. Moreover, results suggest that an energy balance model with a 2-box ocean sub-model and IRF tuned to reproduce the response of coupled Earth system models produces a close representation of the globally-averaged temperature response of more complex energy balance models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aaviation 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aemissions 3aenergy balance 3aequations 3atemperature 0aClimate change 0aSimple climate models 0aCarbon cycle 0aEnergy balance model1 aWuebbles, Donald J.1 aOlsen, Seth C.1 aFuglestvedt, Jan S.1 aBerntsen, Terje1 aLund, Marianne T.1 aWaitz, Ian1 aWolfe, Philip1 aForster, Piers M.1 aMeinshausen, Malte1 aLee, David S.1 aLim, Ling L.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Aug., v. 75 p.321-328dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245005500175500001400230520172100244592002801965650001501993650001502008650002502023650001702048650001802065650002502083650001002108650001902118650002802137650001202165650000902177650002002186650001802206650001102224650001002235650002002245650001402265650001702279650000902296650001702305650003102322650001402353650001402367650002102381650000902402650001302411650001402424650001402438650000902452700002702461700002802488773012302516856007402639852000902713655001202722IND60718975620221119040148.0201126e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071897562DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121133642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaźmierczak-Barańska, Julia 10aNutrition Can Help DNA Repair in the Case of Aging  aNAL-light  aMicronutrients such as vitamins and trace elements are crucial for maintaining the health of all organisms. Micronutrients are involved in every cellular/biochemical process. They play roles in proper heart and brain functioning, influence immunological responses, and antioxidant defense systems. Therefore, prolonged deficiency in one or more micronutrients leads to cardiovascular or neurodegenerative disorders. Keeping micronutrients at adequate levels is especially important for seniors. They are prone to deficiencies due to age-associated functional decline and often to a diet poor in nutrients. Moreover, lack of micronutrients has an indirect impact on the genome. Their low levels reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and therefore inhibit the efficiency of defense against free radicals which can lead to the formation of DNA lesions. The more DNA damage in the genetic material, the faster aging at the cellular level and a higher risk of pathological processes (e.g., carcinogenesis). Supplementation of crucial antioxidative micronutrients such as selenium, zinc, vitamin C, and vitamin E seems to have the potential to positively influence the condition of an aging organism, including minimizing inflammation, enhancing antioxidative defense, and limiting the formation of DNA lesions. In consequence, it may lead to lowering the risk and incidence of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and malnutrition. In this article, we attempt to present the synergistic action of selected antioxidant micronutrients (vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc) for inhibiting oxidative stress and DNA damage, which may impede the process of healthy aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abrain 3acarcinogenesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3adecline 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afree radicals 3agenome 3aheart 3aimmune response 3aincidence 3ainflammation 3alead 3amalnutrition 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anutrients 3aorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3arisk 3aselenium 3asynergism 3avitamin E 3azinc1 aBoguszewska, Karolina 1 aKarwowski, Boleslaw  T.0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121133643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007500166300001600241520114000257592002801397650001101425650001601436650002401452653001401476653002301490653003001513653003201543653003901575653001901614700001801633773012001651856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60607537620221122094130.0180731e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060753762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiuyuetaohua,10aPartially linear transformation cure models for interval-censored data  ap. 257-269.  aThere has been considerable progress in the development of semiparametric transformation models for regression analysis of time-to-event data. However, most of the current work focuses on right-censored data. Significantly less work has been done for interval-censored data, especially when the population contains a nonignorable cured subgroup. A broad and flexible class of semiparametric transformation cure models is proposed for analyzing interval-censored data in the presence of a cure fraction. The proposed modeling approach combines a logistic regression formulation for the probability of cure with a partially linear transformation model for event times of susceptible subjects. The estimation is achieved by using a spline-based sieve maximum likelihood method, which is computationally efficient and leads to estimators with appealing properties such as consistency, asymptotic normality and semiparametric efficiency. Furthermore, a goodness-of-fit test can be constructed for the proposed models based on the sieve likelihood ratio. Simulations and a real data analysis are provided for illustration of the methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 0aCure rate 0aInterval censoring 0aSemiparametric efficiency 0aSieve likelihood ratio test 0aSieve maximum likelihood estimator 0aTransformation1 aXiang, Liming0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Jan., v. 93 p.257-269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245018200175300001600357520168800373592002802061650002102089650002202110650001602132650002302148650001702171650001702188650001702205650003402222650003002256650001702286650003002303650001502333650001002348650001102358650001902369650001202388650001402400650001802414650000902432650001002441650002202451650001102473650001002484651001302494700001902507773010802526856008102634852000902715655001202724IND60519411220221120042031.0160428e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051941122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-015-1140-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKampapongsa, Dudcheewan10aBiodiversity of endophytic actinobacteria from jasmine rice (Oryza sativa L.

KDML 105 and their antimicrobial activity against rice pathogens. Three rice samples were collected from the rice paddy fields in Suvannabhum District, Roi-Et Province, Thailand. Roots, stems, leaves and leaf sheaths were surface-sterilized prior to incubation on four different isolation media at 27 and 37 °C. One hundred and sixteen isolates were obtained. Colony and spore morphology accompanied with 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to identify all the isolates. There were 63 Streptomyces isolates (54.3 %), 50 Microbispora isolates (43 %) and 3 Kineococcus isolates (2 %). All the isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity against rice pathogens; Xanthomonas oryzae KHWK 4.1_UBN_06, Pyricularia grisea 61119, Helminthosporium oryzae DOAC 1570 and Curvularia lunata BCC 15558 by using a dual-culture technique. The results showed that twenty-two and four isolates (18.8 and 3.4 %) showed good activity against X. oryzae KHWK 4.1_UBN_06 and P. grisea 61119, respectively. Most of the active isolates belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Selected isolates which showed good activity against test microorganisms were screened for PKS-I, PKS-II and NRPS genes. None of the isolates contained these functional genes, which revealed that antimicrobial activity did not correlate to these genes. In conclusion, as endophytic actinobacteria from rice can inhibit rice pathogens in vitro they can be further evaluated to select for activity in suppressing pathogens in pot experiments. The effective strains can be further studied for development as biocontrol agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBipolaris oryzae 3aCurvularia lunata 3aKineococcus 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aMicrobispora 3aOryza sativa 3aStreptomyces 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3aanti-infective properties 3abiodiversity 3abiological control agents 3aendophytes 3agenes 3aleaves 3amicroorganisms 3apaddies 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3arice 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3aspores 3astems 3aThailand1 aKaewkla, Onuma0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2016 June, v. 66, no. 2 p.587-595dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-015-1140-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245006700174300001600241520068700257592002800944650001400972650002300986650001501009650002601024651001201050651001601062653003001078653001801108653002801126653003001154700002601184773012101210856008201331852000901413655001201422IND60607537720221122094107.0180731e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060753772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanopoulou, Ekaterini14aThe Fisher effect in the presence of time-varying coefficients  ap. 495-511.  aA resolution of the Fisher effect puzzle in terms of statistical inference is attempted. Motivation stems from empirical evidence of time-varying coefficients in the data generating process of both the interest rates and inflation rates for 19 OECD countries. These time-varying dynamics crucially affect the behaviour of all the co-integration estimators considered, especially in small samples. When employing simulated critical values instead of asymptotic ones, the results provide ample evidence supporting the existence of a long-run Fisher effect in which interest rates move one-to-one with inflation rates in all countries under scrutiny except for Ireland and Switzerland.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainflation 3ainterest (finance) 3amotivation 3astatistical inference 3aIreland 3aSwitzerland 0aCo-integration estimators 0aFisher effect 0aMonte Carlo simulations 0aTime-varying coefficients1 aPantelidis, Theologos0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Aug., v. 100 p.495-511dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001600261520159700277592002801874650001501902650002501917650002101942650002601963650002801989650003002017650002502047650002202072650001202094650001402106650002002120650001002140650001402150650001102164650002402175650001802199650001402217650002402231650001102255653002502266653002402291653001302315653003202328653002102360700001402381700001702395700001902412700001702431700001702448700001802465773011902483856008202602852000902684655001202693IND60533602920221118160707.0190410e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuang10aMolecular characterization and functional analysis of Cactin gene from Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 608-617.  aCactin (Cactus interactor) is a conserved protein which was initially discovered as a novel interactor of Drosophila IkB protein Cactus. Cactin was always characterized as a negative regulator of many different developmental processes, but only found to play an immune role in humans. To better know the immune function of Cactin gene, Litopenaeus vannamei Cactin (LvCactin) was identified and characterized in this study. The full-length cDNA of LvCactin is 3, 150 bp long, with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a Cactin_mid domain in the N-terminus 356–547 residues and a CactinC_cactus domain in the C-terminal 731–855 residues. The LvCactin protein was located in the cytoplasm and LvCactin mRNA was constitutively expressed in healthy L. vannamei, with the highest expression level in the eyestalk. LvCactin could be regulated in hemocytes after lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly I:C, CpG-ODN2006, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenges. Dual-luciferase reporter assays in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells revealed that LvCactin inhibited the promoters of Drosophila and shrimp antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes. Knockdown of LvCactin by RNA interference (RNAi) increased the expression of shrimp AMP genes PEN4, crustin and ALF2 but not Lyz2. However, the mortality rates of LvCactin-knockdown shrimp in response to V. parahaemolyticus or WSSV infections were not significantly different from those of the control group. Taken together, all the results suggested that LvCactin may play a role in innate immune in L. vannamei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aRNA interference 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3acacti and succulents 3acomplementary DNA 3acrustin 3acytoplasm 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahumans 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amortality 3aopen reading frames 3ashrimp 0aLitopenaeus vannamei 0aToll signal pathway 0aLvCactin 0aAntimicrobial peptide genes 0aRNA interference1 aShi, Lili1 aYang, Qi-Hui1 aDong, Xiao-Hui1 aChi, Shu-Yan1 aLiu, Hong-Yu1 aTan, Bei-Ping0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 2 p.608-617dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001600291520185300307592002802160650001202188650001402200650001902214650001202233650001402245650001902259650001102278650001502289650001302304650001002317650001802327650001502345650001402360650001602374650001902390650002502409650000902434650001502443650001202458650001802470651001302488700001702501700001402518700001602532700002002548700001802568700001802586773011802604856008102722852000902803655001202812IND60615528220221117232655.0181011e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061552822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0455-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, S. M.10aEffects of restoration management on the estuarine isopod Cyathura carinata: mediation by trematodes and habitat change  ap. 109-118.  aA restoration programme was introduced in the Mondego Estuary (Portugal) to recover seagrass beds of Zostera noltii endangered by eutrophication. A long-term survey of 10 years was used to assess the development of the processes involved, focusing one of the key species (Cyathura carinata, Isopoda). The mitigation measures implemented since 1998 (nutrient loading reduction, freshwater circulation improvement and seagrass bed protection) enhanced water quality and seagrass recovery, thus preventing the development of macroalgal blooms. C. carinata was resilient to the occurrence of floods and macroalgal blooms, although both events caused dispersion of individuals. This isopod was not much influenced by the changes occurring in the estuary, showing an unalterable population structure during the entire study period. After 1998, its density and biomass became more stable at an inner unvegetated sand flat area, where this isopod was most abundant; its population slightly increased in a bare mud flat at the middle section of the estuary; but it could not establish successfully in a downstream Z. noltii bed, contrarily to other common estuarine species. Apart from other unknown reasons, the disrupted balanced between trematodes and their hosts, caused by the eutrophication processes, may have an important role in the discontinuity of C. carinata at the Z. noltii bed. If the intertidal areas become fully restored to the original seagrass coverage, high prevalence and intensity trematodes may prevent this isopod and other crustaceans from recovering within the intervened areas, by enhancing host mortality and recruitment failure.

Diabetes, frailty, and cognitive dysfunction are closely related to the mechanisms of aging. Insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be common mechanisms shared by frailty and cognitive impairment. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, obesity, vascular factors, physical inactivity, and malnutrition are important risk factors for cognitive impairment and frailty in older adults with diabetes. The impact of nutrients on health outcomes varies with age; thus, shifting diet therapy strategies from the treatment of obesity/metabolic syndrome to frailty prevention may be necessary in patients with diabetes who are over 75 years of age, have frailty or sarcopenia, and experience malnutrition. For the prevention of frailty, optimal energy intake, sufficient protein and vitamin intake, and healthy dietary patterns should be recommended. The treatment of diabetes after middle age should include the awareness of proper glycemic control aimed at extending healthy life expectancy with proper nutrition, exercise, and social connectivity. Nutritional therapy in combination with exercise, optimal glycemic and metabolic control, and social participation/support for frailty prevention can extend healthy life expectancy and maintain quality of life in older adults with diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aage 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adiabetes mellitus 3adiet therapy 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3aglycemic control 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alongevity 3amalnutrition 3ametabolic syndrome 3amitochondria 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3aparticipation (behavior) 3apatients 3aprevalence 3aquality of life 3arisk factors 3asarcopenia1 aOmura, Takuya 1 aToyoshima, Kenji 1 aAraki, Atsushi 0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121133673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245007100209300001600280500001100296506007600307520079000383592002801173506003701201650001401238650003101252650002501283650001701308650002401325650001001349650001601359650002801375650001601403650001201419650001801431650000901449650002101458650001101479650002001490650001501510650001101525700006301536700002201599700003001621700002201651773012101673856008201794852000901876655001201885IND60655936420221207110729.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065593642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-00747-52doi7 aPMC66847952pmcid7 a312097042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHęś, Marzanna10aAloe vera (L.)

When aloe is applied externally, it accelerates the regeneration of the damaged skin. Aloe contains antioxidants, which may increase the shelf-life and nutritional value of food; therefore, it is widely used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industry. An antioxidant activity was shown for leaf’s skin, flowers and gel of aloe. In this work the future of A. vera as effective antioxidants is primarily discussed and expected trends are summarised.

However, the performance of the oxidizer is unstable, leading to overheating or extinction, when methane concentration varies. We propose a new procedure for overcoming this problem, using the heat storage concept. Thus, this issue is addressed by proposing the use of an external sensible heat storage system, added to the regenerative oxidizer, capable of storing the excess of heat released in the oxidizer during rich concentration periods, and using it to heat the feed as needed during lean concentration periods. The performance of the heat storage system has been studied by simulating the behaviour of a regenerative thermal oxidizer designed to operate at 0.25vol.% nominal feed methane concentration. It was found that the regenerative oxidizer, provided with the heat storage system together with a feedback controller that regulates the heat extracted/introduced in the oxidizers can operate satisfactory, dealing with the variations in methane concentration found in ventilations of coal mines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acoal 3acombustion 3aheat 3amethane 3aoxidants 0aVentilation air methane 0aMethane complete combustion 0aUnsteady state reactor 0aReverse flow reactor 0aSensible heat storage 0aFeedback reactor control1 aDíez, Fernando V.1 aOrdóñez, Salvador,0 tApplied energy.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 116 p.322-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.11.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001800157245007100175300001600246500000900262520183600271592002802107650002202135650001402157650001502171650001502186650002502201650002402226650001402250650001902264650002002283650001902303650001102322650000702333650001302340650001102353650001502364650001702379650001002396700001702406700001802423773020702441852000902648856009402657655001202751IND2206920320221118061201.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692032DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaynes, W.

The objective of this study was to measure calcium phosphate mineral solubilities using modern analytical equipment and techniques. Natural and synthetic Ca phosphate minerals (<50 µm) were equilibrated in water and dilute HCl for 6 mo with continuous agitation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify compositions before and after equilibration. Filtered (<0.2 µm) solution aliquots were analyzed for pH and chemistry. Chemical compositions were determined using inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP). Aqueous carbonates were determined from alkalinity titrations after phosphate alkalinity corrections. The chemical speciation model “Soilchem” was used to calculate free ion concentrations and ionic strengths. Ion activity products (IAPs) were determined from free ion concentrations and single ion activity coefficients. Experimental log IAPs of monetite (CaHPO₄) were consistent (−6.60) with published values for brushite (CaHPO₄·2H₂O) suggesting that the IAPs of these minerals are identical. No change in mineralogy during equilibration was revealed by XRD. Experimental log IAPs of synthetic whitlockite (−30.74, β-Ca₃(PO₄)₂) indicated somewhat lower solubility than published values. Log IAPs of synthetic hydroxyapatite (−56.02, Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH) were within the range of published values. Natural samples of whitlockite and fluorapatite did not attain equilibrium due to extraneous siderite (FeCO₃) and silica phases within the samples. A long equilibration time, modern analytical equipment, and a chemical speciation program can yield more reliable solubility data for phosphates and other minerals.

Sampling days were grouped into twelve categories depending on season, air mass origin and temperature. A comprehensive chemical characterisation and mass closure were performed. The particulate matter (PM) mass concentration and composition were shown to be highly dependent on these categories. The highest PM mass concentrations were found on cold winter days, mainly due to compounds of anthropogenic origin. The current annual mean PM mass concentration and composition were calculated using the occurrence frequencies of the categories (weighted mean).Information about future changes of the occurrence frequencies of the categories was deduced from climate models. Assuming that PM concentration and composition within a given category do not change, the annual mean PM mass concentration and composition were calculated for two scenarios (weighted mean, 2071–2100). As a result, it was found that the annual mean PM mass concentration is likely to decrease slightly by 2100, mainly due to a decrease of sulphate and soot mass concentrations. Generally, chemicals originating from anthropogenic emissions (PAHs, trace metals) are estimated to decrease. However, it is concluded that emission reduction measures are still necessary to control urban air quality including PM even if climate change will lead to a certain reduction in PM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aclimate models 3acold 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3ahuman health 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3atemperature 3atrace elements 3aGermany 0aClimate change 0aParticulate matter (PM) 0aUrban aerosol 0aCentral Europe 0aBerner impactor 0aCPI1 aSpindler, Gerald1 aLeise, Silvia1 aMüller, Konrad,1 aIinuma, Yoshiteru1 aZimmermann, Frank1 aMatschullat, Jörg,1 aHerrmann, Hartmut0 tAtmospheric environment.g2013 Aug., v. 75 p.365-373dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.04.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245004800163300001600211500000900227520174000236592002801976650001402004650001302018650001102031650000902042650001802051650001402069650001802083650001802101650001902119650000902138650002402147650001902171650001802190650002402208650001202232650001302244700001902257773013702276856007902413852000902492655001202501IND60668225420221123011646.0191228e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066822542DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2002.43702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRennert, Thilo10aSorption of Iron-Cyanide Complexes in Soils  ap. 437-444.  aepub  aThe Fe-cyanide complexes ferricyanide, [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻, and ferrocyanide, [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, are of an anthropogenic source in soils. As the complexes are largely charged, sorption on the soil matrix is a possible retention mechanism for these anions. To evaluate soil properties controlling Fe-cyanide complex sorption, experiments were performed with 17 uncontaminated soil horizons by a batch technique. Soil organic matter (SOM) was destroyed in six horizons. The experiments were conducted at soil pH, reaction time of 24 h, and an ionic strength of 0.01 (NaNO₃). The affinity of the Fe-cyanide complexes for the soil matrix differed, because 14 samples sorbed higher amounts of ferrocyanide than of ferricyanide. Calculated sorption maxima were quantitatively explained by physical and chemical soil properties using multiple regressions. The regression equations were checked by variance analysis. The regression equations for all samples showed that the sorption of both complexes depended on organic C (Cₒᵣg), clay, and oxalate-extractable Fe (Feₒ). The sorption of the complexes on soils containing <10 g Cₒᵣg kg⁻¹ was governed by pH and clay contents. Clay and oxalate-extractable Al (Alₒ) were the most important properties influencing ferricyanide sorption on samples containing high amounts of Cₒᵣg On the same samples, ferrocyanide sorption was governed by Alₒ Organic matter promotes the sorption of both complexes, especially on Fluvisol samples. Destruction of SOM of these samples minimized the sorption by up to 99%. Therefore organic matter in these soils may have a special affinity for Fe-cyanide complexes possibly because of the reaction between Fe-cyanide N and reactive groups of SOM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFluvisols 3aaluminum 3aanions 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aequations 3aferricyanides 3aferrocyanides 3aionic strength 3airon 3aregression analysis 3asodium nitrate 3asoil horizons 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3avariance1 aMansfeldt, Tim0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 Mar., v. 66, no. 2 p.437-444dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.43703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012800176300001800304520108700322536012101409592002801530650002501558650001001583650001901593650001801612650001101630650001001641650001501651650001001666650001501676650001801691650001601709650000901725650002501734653001101759653000901770653001101779653001701790653002601807700003701833700003001870700003101900773011301931856008602044852000902130655001202139IND60783013620221120101655.0220714e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301362DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2021.18872102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Kátia Silva10aOptimization of foam mat drying for instant coffee processing and its effect on drying kinetics and quality characteristics  ap. 1866-1880.  aThe influence of different contents of maltodextrin and whey protein isolate was investigated in the coffee foam, drying kinetics, sensory acceptance of cappuccinos (added of instant coffee) and solubility, antioxidant capacity, wettability, and moisture content of dried samples. The desirability function was used to define the optimum process condition. Shorter drying times and greater stability were achieved using higher concentrations of whey proteins than maltodextrin for foams. The results analyzed showed significantly higher retention of bioactive components, low moisture and high wettability of powders. The Midilli model was the most appropriate to represent the drying kinetics. The foaming agents contributed to improving the quality characteristics (aroma, taste, and overall impression) of instant coffee (p < 0.05). There was no influence of the foaming agents on the solubility and density of the powders (p > 0.05). The combination of the agents of 1.32% of maltodextrin and 2.64% of whey protein isolate obtained greater overall desirability (0.6503).  aTo the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (CAPES) by granting the scholarship during the research  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3afoams 3ainstant coffee 3amaltodextrins 3amodels 3aodors 3asolubility 3ataste 3atechnology 3awater content 3awettability 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate 0aDrying 0afoam 0acoffee 0amaltodextrin 0adesirability function1 aTeixeira, Luciano José Quintão1 aLucia, Suzana Maria Della1 aSaraiva, Sérgio Henriques0 tDrying technology.g2022 July 12, v. 40, no. 9 p.1866-1880dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2021.18872103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014300176300001600319520113900335592002801474650001501502650001401517650002201531650001601553650001501569650002201584650001701606650002401623650002301647650002601670650001101696650001101707700003001718700001801748700002101766773011801787856008101905852000901986655001201995IND60615528520221117232549.0181011e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061552852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0472-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Legentil, Susanna10aSecondary metabolite and inorganic contents in Cystodytes sp. (Ascidiacea): temporal patterns and association with reproduction and growth  ap. 293-299.  aTemporal variation is one of the least known components of defence production in marine organisms. Here we examined whether there is a predictable temporal pattern in the production of chemical and structural defences by a marine invertebrate. To assess the seasonal variation in chemical defence, we measured ascididemin, the main pyridoacridine alkaloid in the blue Mediterranean morph of the ascidian Cystodytes sp. Structural defence variability was assessed on the basis of colony ash content, as it contains mainly spicules. Ascididemin concentration and the colony ash content displayed an annual cycle, reaching a minimum in spring and peaking in summer. Cross-correlation analyses with existing data on growth and reproduction suggested a significant trade-off between investment in reproduction and the other biological parameters considered (growth, inorganic content and ascididemin concentration). Our results suggest that optimization of resource allocation, probably influenced by biotic interactions and physical factors, shaped the temporal trends observed in secondary metabolite concentration and inorganic content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3aalkaloids 3aaquatic organisms 3aash content 3abiocenosis 3achemical defenses 3areproduction 3aresource allocation 3aseasonal variation 3asecondary metabolites 3aspring 3asummer1 aBontemps-Subielos, Nataly1 aTuron, Xavier1 aBanaigs, Bernard0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 151, no. 1 p.293-299dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0472-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245021600204300001400420520202200434592002802456650001902484650002502503650002502528650003002553650001702583650000902600650001402609650002002623650002002643650001302663650001802676650002902694650001502723650001102738650002502749650001802774651000902792653001902801653002702820653002002847653002502867700002102892700001802913700001902931700002002950700002102970700005902991773011703050856008203167852000903249655001203258IND60533603120221118160427.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhizhong,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4792-602210aDietary administration of Gynura bicolor (Roxb. Willd.) DC water extract enhances immune response and survival rate against Vibrio alginolyticus and white spot syndrome virus in white shrimp Litopeneaus vannamei  ap. 25-33.  aGynura bicolor (Roxb. & Willd.) DC., a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, is originated from the tropical area of Asia. The total hemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory bursts (RBs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and lysozyme activity were examined after white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei had been fed diets containing the water extract of G. bicolor at 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g (kg diet)−1 for 7–28 days. The results indicated that these parameters increased accordingly with the amount of extract and time. THCs of the shrimp fed the G. bicolor diets at 1.0 and 2.0 g (kg diet)−1 were significantly higher than that fed the control diet for 14–28 days. For the shrimp fed the G. bicolor diets at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g (kg diet)−1, the PO, RBs, and lysozyme activities reached the highest levels after 7 days, whereas SOD activity reached the highest levels after 14 days. In a separate experiment, white shrimp L. vannamei fed the diets containing the G. bicolor extract for 28 days were challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus at 3 × 106 cfu shrimp−1 and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) at 1 × 103 copies shrimp−1. The survival rate of the shrimp fed the G. bicolor diets was significantly higher than that of the shrimp fed the control diet at 48–144 h post challenge V. alginolyticus and WSSV. For the shrimp fed the G. bicolor diets at 0.5, 1 and 2 g (kg diet)−1 under challenges of V. alginolyticus and WSSV, their LPS- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) and peroxinectin (PE) mRNA expressions were significantly higher than those of the challenged control shrimp at 12–96 and 24–144 h post-challenge, respectively. We concluded that dietary administration of a G. bicolor extract could enhance the innate immunity within 28 days as evidenced by the increases in immune parameters (PO, RBs, and lysozyme) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD) activities of shrimp to against V. alginolyticus and WSSV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGynura bicolor 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aantioxidants 3adiet 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alysozyme 3amessenger RNA 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aperennials 3ashrimp 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3aAsia 0aGynura bicolor 0aDietary administration 0aImmune response 0aLitopenaeus vannamei1 aChang, Yueh-Ping1 aWang, Jyh-Jye1 aLiu, Chun-Hung1 aWong, Saou-Lien1 aJiang, Chii-Ming1 aHsieh, Shu-Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5972-01120 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.25-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245014000204300001200344506007600356520095200432592002801384506003701412650001301449650002501462650001401487650001101501650001301512650001201525650002401537650001201561650001001573650001401583650001001597650002201607650001501629650001601644650001201660651001001672653001401682653001401696653001501710653001301725700002001738700001801758700001901776773011501795856007901910852000901989655001201998IND60127807220221207095418.0151111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012780722DNAL7 a10.1673/031.012.112012doi7 aPMC36199612pmcid7 a234382112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Shi-Xiang10aLissonota holcocerica Sheng sp.n (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) parasitizing Holcocerus hippophaecolus (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) from China  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper describes Lissonota holcocerica Sheng sp.n.

The adults of L. holcocerica emerge from a cocoon during the daytime, mostly from 09:00 to 14:00 hr, then start calling and mating, mostly from 08:00 to 12:00 hr. Mating lasts from 15 sec to 15 min. The longevity of males is 5.8 ± 2.4 days, whereas for females longevity is 7.6 ± 4.6 days in the field. Nutritional supplements can significantly extend the life span of L. holcocerica. Mated females search for hosts by walking on the base of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Rosales: Elaeagnaceae) stem infested by Ho. hippophaecolus, vibrating their antennae and tapping while searching the stem for oviposition sites. Parasitized cocoons of Ho. hippophaecolus collected in field were half the size of normal ones or even smaller.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCossidae 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aLissonota 3aadults 3aantennae 3acocoons 3adietary supplements 3afemales 3ahosts 3alongevity 3amales 3aoviposition sites 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3awalking 3aChina 0aBanchinae 0abionomics 0aparasitoid 0ataxonomy1 aSheng, Mao-Ling1 aLuo, You-Qing1 aLu, Chang-Kuan0 tJournal of insect science .g2012 Oct., v. 12, no. 112 p.1-7dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.012.112013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001600286500001500302520185000317592002802167650002602195650002602221650001202247650001402259650001702273650002702290650002302317650002502340650002602365650001202391650002302403650002002426650001902446650002102465650002702486650001802513650001202531650001202543650001202555650001302567650001402580650001002594653002002604653002402624653002802648653001702676653002002693653002002713653001802733700001902751700001802770700001602788700001702804700001902821773012702840856008202967852000903049655001203058IND60094722720221122023527.0190329e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009472272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2012.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Mengmeng12aA four-CRD C-type lectin from Chlamys farreri mediating nonself-recognition with broader spectrum and opsonization  ap. 363-369.  a2019-12-06  aC-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins consisting of at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which participate in nonself-recognition and clearance of invaders. In invertebrate, some multidomain C-type lectins have been identified, but their relative functions and binding mechanism are still meager. In the present study, A C-type lectin (CfLec-4) with four CRDs from Chlamys farreri was selected to investigate its possible function in innate immunity. The mRNA expression of CfLec-4 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) after the stimulations of β-glucan, LPS or PGN, and reached the highest expression level at 3, 6, 12h post-stimulation, which was 27.9-, 22.6- or 47.9-fold of that in blank group, respectively. Immunohistochemistry assay with polyclonal antibody specific for CfLec-4 revealed that the endogenous CfLec-4 was mainly located in the hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops. The recombinant CfLec-4 (rCflec-4) could bind LPS, PGN, glucan and mannose in vitro, but could not bind LTA. Furthermore, rCflec-4 displayed a broader bacteria binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum and fungi Pichia pastoris. Meanwhile, rCfLec-4 could significantly (P<0.01) enhance the phagocytosis of hemocytes in vitro. The results clearly suggested that four-CRD containing CfLec-4 not only served as PRR with wider recognition spectrum, but also functioned as an opsonin participating in the clearance of invaders in scallops. It could be inferred that the diversity and complexity of CRDs in C-type lectins endowed these receptors with comprehensive recognition spectrum and multiple immune functions against complex living environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aChlamys 3areceptors 3aphagocytosis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aglucans 3aVibrio anguillarum 3agene expression 3ahepatopancreas 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3amessenger RNA 3amannose 3akidneys 3alectins 3ascallops 3ahemocytes 3afungi 0aChlamys farreri 0aNonself-recognition 0aMicrobe binding ability 0aOpsonization 0aPichia pastoris 0aInnate immunity 0aC-type lectin1 aWang, Lingling1 aYang, Jialong1 aZhang, Huan1 aWang, Leilei1 aSong, Linsheng0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.363-369dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245007900177300001400256500000900270520039600279592002800675650002200703650001200725650000900737650002000746650002000766650001400786650001400800700002100814773014600835856009600981852000901077655001201086IND60668225620221122234730.0191125e195201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066822562DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1952.03615995001600010014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyal, R.

Individual differences between assessors have been identified as one cause for these variations. Much work has been done on modeling these differences and accounting for them through analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the products studied are prone to biological heterogeneity (e.g. fruits, vegetables, cheeses, etc.), variations in the data may be due to assessor differences and/or product heterogeneity. The present paper proposes an approach for quantifying these two sources of variation. For individual differences, an extended version of the assessor model approach is applied. The data set used in the paper is based on sensory evaluations of three apple samples scored by a panel of 19 assessors using seven descriptors in four replicates. The application of the extended assessor model approach to unbalanced data provides more insight into assessor differences and a better test for product differences. These results demonstrate the importance of choosing the right model and taking all potential sources of variation into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aapples 3acheeses 3adata collection 3amodels 3asensory evaluation 3avegetables 0aAssessor model 0aMixed model 0aSample heterogeneity 0aSensory profile 0aVariability1 aBrockhoff, Per Bruun1 aKuznetsova, Alexandra1 aMaître, Isabelle1 aMehinagic, Emira1 aSymoneaux, Ronan0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Mar., v. 32 p.126-131dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245017200157300001600329520152600345592002801871650001501899650001701914650001701931650002501948650001301973650002401986650001202010650001502022650001002037650002102047650002202068650001502090650001802105650002502123650002002148650002002168650001802188650001302206651002102219651001502240700002302255700002302278700002102301700002202322773009502344856007102439852000902510655001202519IND60568903220221123043621.0170520s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056890322DNAL7 a10.1071/IS150452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCesari, Michele10aGenetic diversity and biogeography of the south polar water bear Acutuncus antarcticus (Eutardigrada:Hypsibiidae) – evidence that it is a truly pan-Antarctic species  ap. 635-649.  aAntarctica is an ice-dominated continent and all its terrestrial and freshwater habitats are fragmented, which leads to genetic divergence and, eventually, speciation. Acutuncus antarcticus is the most common Antarctic tardigrade and its cryptobiotic capabilities, small size and parthenogenetic reproduction present a high potential for dispersal and colonisation. Morphological (light and electron microscopy, karyology) and molecular (18S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes) analyses on seven populations of A. antarcticus elucidated the genetic diversity and distribution of this species. All analysed populations were morphologically indistinguishable and made up of diploid females. All specimens presented the same 18S rRNA sequence. In contrast, COI analysis showed higher variability, with most Victoria Land populations presenting up to five different haplotypes. Genetic distances between Victoria Land specimens and those found elsewhere in Antarctica were low, while distances between Dronning Maud Land and specimens from elsewhere were high. Our analyses show that A. antarcticus can still be considered a pan-Antarctic species, although the moderately high genetic diversity within Victoria Land indicates the potential for speciation events. Regions of Victoria Land are considered to have been possible refugia during the last glacial maximum and a current biodiversity hotspot, which the populations of A. antarcticus mirror with a higher diversity than in other regions of Antarctica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTardigrada 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiploidy 3aelectron microscopy 3afemales 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainvertebrates 3anucleotide sequences 3aparthenogenesis 3arefuge habitats 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aMcInnes, Sandra J.1 aBertolani, Roberto1 aRebecchi, Lorena1 aGuidetti, Roberto0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2016, v. 30, no. 6 p.635-649dCSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS150453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013900167300001400306500001400320520114400334592002801478650001501506650001201521650001501533650001701548650001401565650001501579650001201594650002001606650001601626650002401642653001701666653001001683653001401693653001101707653001901718653000801737700002101745773011701766856008001883852000901963655001201972IND60696546920221122234052.0200528e20180319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069654692DNAL7 a10.3897/evolsyst.2.221272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, Lara-Sophie13aAn annotated catalogue of the types of short-horned grasshoppers (Orthoptera, Caelifera) housed in the Zoological Museum Hamburg (ZMH)  ap. 21-30.  aNAL-light  aZoological collections remain the main archive of animal life on earth, especially in times of mass extinctions. The most important animals of these collections are the type specimens, which represent the original reference for a species. While a full digitization of most museum collections currently remains utopic, lists of types are an essential resource for researchers to perform taxonomic revisions. Here, we provide an updated type catalogue of the short-horned grasshoppers (Caelifera) housed in the Zoological Museum of Hamburg (ZMH), now part of the Center for Natural History Hamburg (CeNak). This collection comprises 209 type specimens belonging to 128 species: 65 holotypes, three lectotypes, one syntype and a large number of paratypes. We also list topotypes of two species for reasons of completeness but note that they have no formal status. Overall, types of 13 species were added to the collection since the last catalogues in 1968 and 1977 and several corrections to the last catalogues were made. We provide a full bibliography for these species, aiming to provide a comprehensive taxonomic guide to this collection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3aanimals 3aextinction 3agrasshoppers 3aholotypes 3alectotypes 3amuseums 3anatural history 3aresearchers 3ataxonomic revisions 0abiodiversity 0aCeNak 0aGodeffroy 0amuseum 0atype catalogue 0aZMH1 aHusemann, Martin0 tEvolutionary Systematics.g2018 Mar. 19, v. 2, no. 1 p.21-30dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27337x2535-07307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/evolsyst.2.221273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04138naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017400167300001300341520199600354592002802350650001202378650001602390650002502406650002702431650002702458650001902485650002702504650002202531650002102553650003002574650001602604650001802620650002002638650002002658650001602678650001702694650001102711650001002722650003502732650003002767650001202797650001302809650001302822650001502835650001002850650001302860650004302873650005202916650001402968650001102982650001802993650001703011653002603028653001703054653001203071653001403083653002203097700001703119700002003136700001803156700001703174700001803191773011603209856008203325852000903407655001203416IND60533603420221118160340.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJheng, Yu-Hsuan10aZebrafish fed on recombinant Artemia expressing epinecidin-1 exhibit increased survival and altered expression of immunomodulatory genes upon Vibrio vulnificus infection  ap. 1-15.  aArtemia has been used extensively in aquaculture as fodder for larval fish, shrimp, and shellfish. Epinecidin-1, an antimicrobial peptide, was isolated from grouper (Epinephelus coioides) in 2005. Epinecidin-1 has been previously reported to possess antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species, including Staphylococcus coagulase, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Vibrio vulnificus. In this study, we used electroporation to introduce plasmid DNA encoding a green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-epinecidin-1 fusion protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter into decapsulated Artemia cysts. Optimization of various properties (including cyst weight (0.2 g), plasmid concentration (50 μg/100 μl), and pulse voltage (150 V), length (10 ms), and number (2)) resulted in a hatching rate of 41.15%, a transfection efficiency of 49.81%, and a fluorescence intensity (A.U.) of 47.46. The expression of EGFP-epinecidin-1 was first detected by quantitative RT-PCR at 120 h post-electroporation, and protein was identified by Western blot at the same time. Furthermore, the EGFP-epinecidin-1 protein inhibited V. vulnificus (204) growth, as demonstrated by zone of inhibition studies. Zebrafish fed on transgenic Artemia expressing CMV-gfp-epi combined with commercial fodder were more resistant to infection by V. vulnificus (204): survival rate was enhanced by over 70% at 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection, and bacterial numbers in the liver and intestine were reduced. In addition, feeding of transgenic Artemia to zebrafish affected the immunomodulatory response to V. vulnificus (204) infection; expression of immune-responsive genes, including hepcidin and defbl2, was altered, as shown by qPCR. These findings suggest that feeding transgenic Artemia expressing CMV-gfp-epi to larval fish has antimicrobial effects, without the drawbacks of introducing drug residues or inducing bacterial drug resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aDanio rerio 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-infective properties 3aaquaculture 3adrug residues 3adrug resistance 3aelectroporation 3afish larvae 3afluorescence 3aforage 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3agrouper 3ahatching 3ahepcidin 3aintestines 3aliver 3aplasmids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3asurvival rate 3atransfection 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aEpinecidin-1 0aArtemia 0aZebrafish 0aVibrio vulnificus1 aLee, Lin-Han1 aTing, Chen-Hung1 aPan, Chieh-Yu1 aHui, Cho-Fat1 aChen, Jyh-Yih0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.1-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100003900181245008500220506007600305520148500381592002801866506003701894650001101931650001801942650001401960650001101974650002001985650001502005650001602020650002402036650003002060650002002090650002302110650001202133650002102145651001102166700002402177700002802201700002102229773012202250856007402372852000902446655001202455IND60650676020221207074639.0190710e20181226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065067602DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110100452doi7 aPMC63566512pmcid7 a305877792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarrón-Ponce, Joaquín  Alejandro10aTrends in Ultra-Processed Food Purchases from 1984 to 2016 in Mexican Households  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal trade agreements have shaped the food system in ways that alter the availability, accessibility, affordability, and desirability of ready-to-eat foods. We assessed the time trends of ultra-processed foods purchases in Mexican households from 1984 to 2016. Cross-sectional data from 15 rounds of the National Income and Expenditure Survey (1984, 1989, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) were analyzed. Food and beverage purchases collected in a daily record instrument (over seven days) were classified according to their degree of processing according to the NOVA food framework: (1) Unprocessed or minimally processed foods; (2) processed culinary ingredients; (3) processed foods; and (4) ultra-processed foods. From 1984 to 2016, the total daily energy purchased decreased from 2428.8 to 1875.4 kcal/Adult Equivalent/day, there was a decrease of unprocessed or minimally processed foods (from 69.8% to 61.4% kcal) and processed culinary ingredients (from 14.0% to 9.0% kcal), and an increase of processed foods (from 5.7% to 6.5% kcal) and ultra-processed foods (from 10.5% to 23.1% kcal). Given that ultra-processed foods purchases have doubled in the last three decades and unprocessed or minimally processed foods purchased have gradually declined, future strategies should promote the consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, and discourage ultra-processed foods availability and accessibility in Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aaffordability 3abeverages 3aenergy 3afood purchasing 3ahouseholds 3aingredients 3ainternational trade 3aminimally processed foods 3anational income 3aready-to-eat foods 3asurveys 3atrade agreements 3aMexico1 aTolentino, Lizbeth,1 aHernández-F, Mauricio 1 aBatis, Carolina 0 tNutrients.g2018 Dec. 26, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110100453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170300001400290520156500304592002801869650000901897650001701906650002001923650001101943650002301954650002301977653003502000653002402035653003802059653002002097653003302117700002002150700001802170773010802188856008702296852000902383655001202392IND60542973220221122064933.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, F.S.T.12aA method for panelists’ consistency assessment in sensory evaluations based on the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient  ap. 41-47.  aIn sensory analysis attributes are measured on samples based on human judgment. The ability to detect differences is essential when selecting a panelist, as well as the repeatability in assessments and the agreement among panelists (or reproducibility), which is our definition of panel consistency. Our goal in this paper is to identify an efficient method to compare evaluation profiles from panelists measuring a given sensory attribute on different samples, assessing the panel’s consistency. For that we investigate two methods available in the literature – consonance analysis (Dijksterhuis, 1995), and repeatibility and reproducibility analysis (Rossi, 2001) – and propose a new method, based on the internal consistency test and the calculation of the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (Cronbach, 1951). We tested our proposition using a dataset from a case study in which beef cubes in stew, used as combat ration by the American Army, are characterized by a sensory panel using the Spectrum protocol. Different product formulations based on military specifications yielded eight samples evaluated by nine panelists in quadruplicate. Twenty-four sensory attributes were assessed by the panelists. Results pointed to the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient as best among the methods tested, which is justified threefold: (i) it allows identifying attributes better understood by panelists, (ii) it gives a ranking of panelists according to their consensus with the rest of the panel, and (iii) it is analytically simpler in comparison with other methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ahumans 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 0aCronbach’s alpha coefficient 0aConsonance analysis 0aRepeatability and reproducibility 0aSpectrum method 0aPanel consistency assessment1 aFogliatto, F.S.1 aQannari, E.M.0 tFood quality and preference.g2014 Mar., v. 32 p.41-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245008600205300002000291520180000311592002802111650001102139650002002150650001802170650002202188650002002210700003202230700002402262700006202286700005702348700002602405700006702431700007502498700005802573700006202631773014902693856007702842852000902919655001202928IND60701791520220220000000.0220220e20200624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070179152DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c055252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantana, Andrés G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3568-771410aDissecting the Essential Role of Anomeric β-Triflates in Glycosylation Reactions  ap. 12501-12514.  aGlycosylations promoted by triflate-generating reagents are widespread synthetic methods for the construction of glycosidic scaffolds and glycoconjugates of biological and chemical interest. These processes are thought to proceed with the participation of a plethora of activated high energy intermediates such as the α- and β-glycosyl triflates, or even increasingly unstable glycosyl oxocarbenium-like species, among which only α-glycosyl triflates have been well characterized under representative reaction conditions. Interestingly, the remaining less accessible intermediates, yet to be experimentally described, seem to be particularly relevant in α-selective processes, involving weak acceptors. Herein, we report a detailed analysis of several paradigmatic and illustrative examples of such reactions, employing a combination of chemical, NMR, kinetic and theoretical approaches, culminating in the unprecedented detection and quantification of the true β-glycosyl triflate intermediates within activated donor mixtures. This achievement was further employed as a stepping-stone for the characterization of the triflate anomerization dynamics, which along with the acceptor substitutions, govern the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. The obtained data conclusively show that, even for highly dissociative reactions involving β-close ion pair (β-CIP) species, the formation of the α-glycoside is necessarily preceded by a bimolecular α → β triflate interconversion, which under certain circumstances becomes the rate-limiting step. Overall, our results rule out the prevalence of the Curtin–Hammett fast-exchange assumption for most glycosylations and highlight the distinct reactivity properties of α- and β-glycosyl triflates against neutral and anionic acceptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aglycoconjugates 3aglycosylation 3areaction kinetics 3astereochemistry1 aMontalvillo-Jiménez, Laura1 aDíaz-Casado, Laura1 aCorzana, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5597-81271 aMerino, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2202-34601 aCañada, Francisco J.1 aJiménez-Osés, Gonzalo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0105-43371 aJiménez-Barbero, J.q(Jesús),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5421-85131 aGomez, Ana M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8703-33601 aAsensio, Juan Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7536-52210 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 24, v. 142, no. 28 p.12501-12514dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c055253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04596naa a2201321 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245007000213300001600283506007600299520160500375592002801980506003702008650001802045650002702063650002002090650001302110650001002123650001402133650002002147650001202167650001102179650001802190650001102208650001402219650001302233650002402246650001802270653001402288653001402302653000802316653000802324653000802332653000902340653000802349653000902357653000702366653000702373653000802380653000802388653001002396653001002406653002102416653000802437653000702445653000702452653000902459653000802468653000702476653000802483653000702491653000802498653000802506653000802514653001302522653000802535653000802543653000802551653000802559653000802567653000902575653000902584653000902593653000702602653000802609653001902617653001502636653000802651653000802659653000802667653000802675653001802683653001602701653000902717653001702726653000902743653000902752653000802761653000802769653000702777653000902784653000802793653001002801653000902811653001502820653000902835653000802844653000802852653000802860653000902868653000802877653000802885653000802893653000802901653000902909653001002918653002002928653002302948653001202971653001902983653002503002700001703027773012703044856008203171852000903253655001203262IND60094723020221207123608.0190329e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009472302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2012.10.0042doi7 aPMC35953542pmcid7 a231784082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunaratna, Ramesh T.12aA comprehensive analysis of the Manduca sexta immunotranscriptome  ap. 388-398.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a biochemical model, Manduca sexta has substantially contributed to our knowledge on insect innate immunity. The RNA-Seq approach was implemented in three studies to examine tissue immunotranscriptomes of this species. With the latest and largest focusing on highly regulated process- and tissue-specific genes, we further analyzed the same set of data using BLAST2GO to explore functional aspects of the larval fat body (F) and hemocyte (H) transcriptomes with (I) or without (C) immune challenge. Using immunity-related sequences from other insects, we found 383 homologous contigs and compared them with those discovered based on relative abundance changes. The major overlap of the two lists validated our previous research designed for gene discovery and transcript profiling in organisms lacking sequenced genomes. By concatenating the contigs, we established a repertoire of 232 immunity-related genes encoding proteins for pathogen recognition (16%), signal transduction (53%), microbe killing (13%) and others (18%). We examined their transcript levels along with attribute classifications and detected prominent differences in nine of the 30 level 2 gene ontology (GO) categories. The increase in extracellular proteins (155%) was consistent with the highly induced synthesis of defense molecules (e.g., antimicrobial peptides) in fat body after the immune challenge. We identified most members of the putative Toll, IMD, MAPK-JNK-p38 and JAK-STAT pathways and small changes in their mRNA levels. Together, these findings set the stage for on-going analysis of the M. sexta immunogenome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aManduca sexta 3aantimicrobial peptides 3adata collection 3afat body 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ainnate immunity 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3apathogens 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 0aCF and CH 0aIF and IH 0aAlk 0aAMP 0aANK 0aaPKC 0aARN 0aAtgX 0aBP 0aCC 0aCRD 0aCTL 0aDscam 0aECSIT 0aEGF, NIM and EMI 0aEST 0aFN 0aGO 0aHAIP 0aHem 0aHP 0aIAP 0aIg 0aIKK 0aIMD 0aIML 0aJAK-STAT 0aJNK 0aJra 0aLNF 0aLPS 0aLRR 0aMAPK 0aMASK 0aMEKK 0aMF 0aMLK 0aNFκB and IκB 0aNO and NOS 0aNRN 0aNTF 0aORF 0aPAP 0aPDGF and VEGF 0aPG and PGRP 0aPIAS 0aPO and proPO 0aPOSH 0aPPBP 0aPSP 0aPVR 0aRA 0aRISC 0aROS 0aSH2/3 0aSOCS 0aSP and SPH 0aSUMO 0aTAK 0aTEP 0aTIR 0aTRAF 0aUBC 0aVWD 0aWAP 0aZnF 0aα2M 0aβGRP 0aInsect immunity 0aHemolymph proteins 0aRNA-Seq 0aGene discovery 0aTranscript profiling1 aJiang, Haobo0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.388-398dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010600181300001800287520131700305536013401622592002801756650002601784650002601810650000801836650001901844650001801863650002301881650001501904650001801919653001701937653002201954653002201976653001901998653002102017700003202038700003502070700003402105773011302139856008602252852000902338655001202347IND60783014020221120065932.0220714e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301402DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2021.18944392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Gabriela Saldanha10aMonitoring of the fluidized bed particle drying process by temperature and pressure drop measurements  ap. 1935-1947.  aThis work aimed to monitor the temperature and the pressure drop behaviors in bed during the drying of Persian clover and arrowleaf clover seeds in a fluidized bed. The inlet air temperatures were of 40 °C and 50 °C, with a fixed bed height (Hₗ:Dₗ ratio of 1:1) and fluidization velocity of 2.7 times the minimum. For the temperature and the pressure drop profiles in bed and the standard deviation of pressure drop, all changed significantly during the process in function to solids moisture content, mainly on the transition of the constant rate period to the falling rate period, due to change of the mass transfer mechanisms. In addition, an analysis of pressure measurements in the frequency domain was performed, using the Fast Fourier Transform, and power spectra of distinct characteristics for the two drying periods was obtained, showing that this technique can be a potential alternative for operation drying monitoring.HighlightsTemperature and pressure drop measurements showed great potential for monitoring the particles; Pressure and temperature measurements between of constant and falling rates periods had changed significantly; Standard deviation measures behaved in a similar way to pressure drop; Power spectra became wider and showed a decrease in amplitude during the operation.  aCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium resupinatum 3aTrifolium vesiculosum 3aair 3afluidized beds 3amass transfer 3astandard deviation 3atechnology 3awater content 0aFluidization 0asignal processing 0aspectral analysis 0aPersian clover 0aarrowleaf clover1 aTuchtenhagen, Scarlet Neves1 aPinto, Luiz Antonio de Almeida1 aFelipe, Carlos Alberto Severo0 tDrying technology.g2022 July 12, v. 40, no. 9 p.1935-1947dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2021.18944393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001900157245008300176300001600259500000900275520159100284592002801875650001701903650001101920650003101931650001101962650001801973650002301991650001702014650001802031650001602049650001502065651001902080700001102099773020702110852000902317856009402326655001202420IND2206921420221118061329.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692142DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalling, D. E.10aImproved Models for Estimating Soil Erosion Rates from Cesium-137 Measurements  ap. 611-622.  aepub  aFallout cesium-137 (¹³⁷Cs) measurements have been used in investigations of water-induced soil erosion in a wide range of environments and in many different areas of the world over the past 20 yr. However, the existing calibration procedures commonly used for deriving quantitative estimates of soil redistribution rates from ¹³⁷Cs measurements involve several limitations and uncertainties. Existing approaches to calibration and their associated limitations and uncertainties are briefly reviewed and improved models for converting ¹³⁷Cs measurements to estimates of rates of water- and tillage-induced soil redistribution, applicable to both cultivated and undisturbed soils, are proposed. Results obtained from existing field investigations and laboratory experiments indicate that redistribution of fallout ¹³⁷Cs within the soil profile and across the land surface is influenced by several factors. These include time-dependent fallout input, initial distribution within the surface layer, post-depositional redistribution resulting from mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological processes operating in the soil system and the grain size selectivity associated with soil erosion and sediment transport processes. It is important to consider these factors when deriving estimates of soil redistribution rates using the ¹³⁷Cs technique, and they have been incorporated into the improved models. The use of these models is demonstrated using data from a case study undertaken in a small catchment in Devon, UK, involving both cultivated and undisturbed soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acesium 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3aradionuclides 3asediment transport 3asoil erosion 3asoil profiles 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHe, Q.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1999 Mar., v. 28, no. 2 p.611-622dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020027x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02445naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012100170300001600291520097200307592002801279650002201307650001401329650002201343650001701365650001201382650002501394650001501419650001201434650002401446650001801470650002101488650002501509650001701534650001601551653002601567653003101593653001801624653002201642653002601664700002001690700001701710700001801727700001301745773009801758856008601856852000901942655001201951IND60600367420221119030704.0180703e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060036742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Huadong10aBioconversion of different sizes of microcrystalline cellulose pretreated by microwave irradiation with/without NaOH  ap. 142-148.  aThe process of microwave irradiation (MWI) pretreatment on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) with different sizes with/without NaOH was investigated on the variation of the ratio of degradated solid residue (RDS), particle size, crystallinity index (CrI), crystallite size (Sc) and specific surface area (SSA). High concentration of alkali or high temperature was necessary in dissolving or decomposing the cellulose. Appropriate pretreatment severity eliminated the effects of structural diversities in feedstocks, which led to convergence in the ethanol fermentation. After the reaction proceeded to 120h, the samples could be converted to glucose completely and the highest ethanol yield of the theoretical was 58.91% for all the samples pretreated by the combined treatment of MWI and NaOH. In addition, the statistical analysis implied that when reaction time got to 24h, particle size and pretreatment condition affected much more significant than other factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3amicrowave radiation 3aparticle size 3asodium hydroxide 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMicrowave irradiation 0aMicrocrystalline cellulose 0aParticle size 0aCrystalline index 0aBiomass bioconversion1 aChen, Hongzhang1 aQu, Yongshui1 aLi, Hongqiang1 aXu, Jian0 tApplied energy.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 117 p.142-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001700157245008500174300001600259500000900275500001500284520089200299592002801191650001401219650001301233650001101246650001501257650001501272650001301287650000901300650001201309650000901321650001101330650000701341650001501348650000901363650001701372650001501389653001701404700002201421700002201443700001801465773020701483852000901690856009401699655001201793IND2206920420221118061218.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692042DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreese, Dirk12aA Flow-Through Reactor with an Infinite Sink for Monitoring Desorption Processes  ap. 537-543.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe assessment of elemental release processes in soils are of large interest in soil research. A technique is presented where the advantages of a flow-through reactor are combined with a specific infinite sink. Between the two reactors an electrolyte solution (pH 6) acting as a transport carrier was circulated continuously in a closed-loop setup. To demonstrate the capability of the new technique, phosphate desorption kinetics from different synthetic Fe and Mn hydroxides coated on silica sand were studied. The relative amount of P desorbed increased in the order ferrihydrite (10% of the initially sorbed P) < goethite (20%) << hematite (65%) < Mn dioxide (80%). We suggest that this technique can also be adapted to other issues, for example, desorption of other anions and cations from solid phases (soils and sediments) because the composition of the infinite sink is variable.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3ahematite 3asilica 3ahydroxides 3amonitoring 3agoethite 3airon 3acations 3asoil 3aanions 3apH 3aphosphates 3asand 3aferrihydrite 3adesorption 0aelectrolytes1 aWeidler, Peter G.1 aGrolimund, Daniel1 aSticher, Hans0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1999 Mar., v. 28, no. 2 p.537-543dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020019x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03674naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245015800201300002000359500002900379520196700408592002802375650001402403650001102417650001202428650001102440650001402451650001302465650002002478650002502498700005602523700002202579700002202601700001602623700006002639700001802699700002402717700002302741700001702764700006202781700006002843700006702903773014902970856007603119852000903195655001203204IND60701791720221118160200.0200715e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070179172DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c056502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlade, Tyler J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6751-430310aContrasting SnTe–NaSbTe₂ and SnTe–NaBiTe₂ Thermoelectric Alloys: High Performance Facilitated by Increased Cation Vacancies and Lattice Softening  ap. 12524-12535.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aDefect chemistry is critical to designing high performance thermoelectric materials. In SnTe, the naturally large density of cation vacancies results in excessive hole doping and frustrates the ability to control the thermoelectric properties. Yet, recent work also associates the vacancies with suppressed sound velocities and low lattice thermal conductivity, underscoring the need to understand the interplay between alloying, vacancies, and the transport properties of SnTe. Here, we report solid solutions of SnTe with NaSbTe₂ and NaBiTe₂ (NaSnₘSbTeₘ₊₂ and NaSnₘBiTeₘ₊₂, respectively) and focus on the impact of the ternary alloys on the cation vacancies and thermoelectric properties. We find introduction of NaSbTe₂, but not NaBiTe₂, into SnTe nearly doubles the natural concentration of Sn vacancies. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggest that both NaSbTe₂ and NaBiTe₂ facilitate valence band convergence and simultaneously narrow the band gap. These effects improve the power factors but also make the alloys more prone to detrimental bipolar diffusion. Indeed, the performance of NaSnₘBiTeₘ₊₂ is limited by strong bipolar transport and only exhibits modest maximum ZTs ≈ 0.85 at 900 K. In NaSnₘSbTeₘ₊₂ however, the doubled vacancy concentration raises the charge carrier density and suppresses bipolar diffusion, resulting in superior power factors than those of the Bi-containing analogues. Lastly, NaSbTe₂ incorporation lowers the sound velocity of SnTe to give glasslike lattice thermal conductivities. Facilitated by the favorable impacts of band convergence, vacancy-augmented hole concentration, and lattice softening, NaSnₘSbTeₘ₊₂ reaches high ZT ≈ 1.2 at 800–900 K and a competitive average ZTₐᵥg of 0.7 over 300–873 K. The difference in ZT between two chemically similar compounds underscores the importance of intrinsic defects in engineering high-performance thermoelectrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aalloys 3acations 3adesign 3aengineers 3ajournals 3asolid solutions 3athermal conductivity1 aPal, Koushik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5426-97481 aGrovogui, Jann A.1 aBailey, Trevor P.1 aMale, James1 aKhoury, Jason F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4769-67301 aZhou, Xiuquan1 aChŏng, Tŏg-yŏng,1 aSnyder, G.

In this study, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) goose (g-) and chicken (c-) types of lysozyme were subjected to protein characterisations and tissue expression analyses. Specific bacterial protein inhibitors of g- and c-type lysozymes were employed to discriminate between respective enzyme activities. Blood, gills and liver contained activities exclusive for the g-type lysozyme. Only haematopoietic organs (head kidney and spleen) contained enzyme activities of both g- and c-lysozyme enzymes and c-type activity was not found outside these organs. Gene transcript levels proportional to enzyme activity levels were detected for the g-type lysozyme but not for the c-type. In vitro studies revealed significant induction of c-type gene expression and enzyme activity in macrophages after incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while expression of the g-type lysozyme gene was unaffected. The activity of purified native c-type enzyme was profoundly reduced by divalent cations and displayed low tolerance to monovalent cations, while the native g-type lysozyme was stimulated by monovalent cations and tolerated low concentrations of divalent cations. Activities of both enzymes increased with temperature elevations up to 60°C. The native g-type lysozyme responses to temperature in particular are in apparent conflict to the ones for the recombinant salmon g-lysozyme.Our results imply separate expression regulations and different functions of c- and g-type lysozymes in salmon. LPS-induced expression of c-type lysozyme and broad constitutive tissue distribution of g-type lysozyme in salmon is different from findings in other studied fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abacteria 3abacterial proteins 3ablood 3acations 3achickens 3aenzyme activity 3ageese 3agene expression 3agenes 3agills 3ain vitro studies 3akidneys 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3asalmon 3aspleen 3atemperature 3atissue distribution 0aLysozyme 0aPurification 0aActivity 0aGene expression 0aIvy 0aPliG1 aSeppola, Marit1 aJohansen, Audny1 aØverbø, Kersti1 aCallewaert, Lien1 aVanderkelen, Lise1 aMichiels, Chris W.1 aNilsen, Inge W.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 May, v. 40, no. 1 p.11-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245009100180300001600271500000900287520189800296592002802194650001502222650001202237650001002249650001302259650002102272650001302293650002102306650001202327650002902339650000902368650001302377650001902390650001402409650001102423650001402434650001402448650002102462650001202483650002302495650001202518650001602530700002002546773014702566856009602713852000902809655001202818IND60668226120221122234857.0191125e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066822612DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100030012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLietzke, D.

Aluminum sulfate [Al₂(SO₄)₃ · 18 H₂O] powder was applied at rates of 0.13, 0.26, 0.52, and 1.05 kg m⁻³ (7.5, 15.0, 30.0, and 60.0 g per pot, respectively). Elemental S powder was added at rates of 0.03, 0.06, 0.13, and 0.26 kg m⁻³ (1.9, 3.8, 7.5, and 15.0 g per pot, respectively). Sawdust was incorporated into the soil at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 60 m³ m⁻³ (% by volume). The soil used in this experiment was a previously limed sandy loam surface from a Typic Hapludult with an initial pH of 6.2. On a mass basis, approximately eight times as much Al₂(SO₄)₃·18 H₂O as elemental S was needed to cause a two-unit decrease in soil pH. The acidity produced by S maintained low pH longer than Al₂(SO₄)₃·18 H₂O. Extractable levels of Ca and Mg in the highest acidulent treatments were approximately double that of the controls at the conclusion of the experiment. This is a probable response to lime particles from a previous liming being dissolved by acids. Extractable K, because of destruction of illitic clay minerals, was significantly higher in the S treatments than in the Al₂(SO₄)₃ treatments or controls. Extractable Al levels were greater than the controls only at higher rates of both acidulents. Extractable Al levels at a given pH were higher in the Al₂(SO₄)₃-treated soils than in those treated with S. Destruction of clay minerals, including gibbsite, kaolinite, and hydroxy interlayered vermiculite were evident in the highest S treatment, even though both the Ca/Mg and K/NH₄ cation exchange capacity values increased when compared to the controls. Aluminum sulfate had little effect on clay mineral stability when compared to the controls, and may have increased the heat stability of K saturated hydroxy interlayered vermiculite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludults 3aacidity 3aacids 3aaluminum 3aaluminum sulfate 3aammonium 3aapplication rate 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3agibbsite 3aheat stability 3akaolinite 3aliming 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3asandy loam soils 3asawdust 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3avermiculite1 aPeterson, D.

However, whether coffee or tea improves glucose metabolism remains uncertain. We investigated the effect of coffee and tea on glucose metabolism by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Electronic databases were searched for articles published up 19 February 2017. The primary endpoint was the mean difference in post-intervention fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels between the groups. Of 892 citations screened, 27 studies (1898 participants) were included in our meta-analysis. A network meta-analysis suggested that green tea, but not caffeinated/decaffeinated coffee or black tea, may reduce FBG levels, compared with placebo/water (&minus;2.10 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval (CI), &minus;3.96 to &minus;0.24 mg/dL; p = 0.03; moderate quality of evidence). In a subgroup analysis, the effect of green tea on FBG levels was statistically significant only in studies with a mean age of < 55-years-old or Asian-based studies. The oolong tea group also showed a significant decrease in FBG, but the quality of evidence was very low. In conclusion, green tea consumption might decrease FBG levels, especially in < 55-year-olds or Asian-based populations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablack tea 3ablood glucose 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adecaffeination 3adiabetes 3afasting 3aglucose 3agreen tea 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3aoolong tea 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review1 aGotō, Atsushi,1 aNoma, Hisashi 1 aIso, Hiroyasu 1 aHayashi, Kunihiko 1 aNoda, Mitsuhiko 0 tNutrients.g2018 Dec. 27, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110100483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245008300185300001600268520079400284592002801078650002101106650001001127650000901137650001301146650001401159650001201173650001301185651001701198651000901215653002501224653001801249653001801267653001401285653001701299773010401316856008601420852000901506655001201515IND60783014320221120070028.0220714e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078301432DNAL7 a10.1080/07409710.2022.20898262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo-Escoffié, José Luis10aSize, color, and freshness: Standards and heritage of native potatoes in Peru  ap. 165-184.  aPeru is the center of origin and diversity of more than 3,000 varieties of native potatoes although only a few varieties are typically consumed beyond the Andean region. Drawing on 14 months of ethnographic research, I explore the role of standards of size, quality, and colors as well as documents like invoices in formalizing and mobilizing the potatoes in the market. I argue that these standards and documents together with economic sociability serve as an important strategy to add value to native potatoes from their production in Ayacucho to their distribution in Lima. By keeping the ethnographic eye on the construction and negotiation of those standards, I show the fragility, the risks, the opportunities, and the power relationships that emerge along the native potato chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acenter of origin 3acolor 3aeyes 3afoodways 3afreshness 3amarkets 3apotatoes 3aAndes region 3aPeru 0aEconomic sociability 0afood heritage 0anative potato 0astandards 0asupply chain0 tFood & foodways.g2022 July 3, v. 30, no. 3 p.165-184dRoutledgewJournal:jnl38994x1542-34847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07409710.2022.20898263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014800169300001600317520092500333592002801258650002401286650001501310650001401325650000901339650001401348650001301362650001801375650001401393650001901407650001301426650001001439650002201449651001001471700001801481700002001499773011801519856008101637852000901718655001201727IND60615529220221117232114.0181011e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061552922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0491-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomiyama, Takeshi10aFeeding and growth of juvenile stone flounder in estuaries: generality and the importance of sublethal tissue cropping of benthic invertebrates  ap. 365-376.  aWe investigated the feeding habits and growth of juvenile stone flounder (Platichthys bicoloratus) in several estuarine nurseries in Sendai Bay, Japan. Prey abundance and composition and juvenile diet varied largely among sites. However, polychaete palps (mostly Pseudopolydora kempi) and bivalve siphons (mostly Nuttallia olivacea) were positively selected and frequently consumed by juveniles, indicating the generality of sublethal feeding of juvenile stone flounder in estuarine nurseries. Recent growth rates determined by otolith microstructure analyses were dependent on juvenile body size and water temperature, but independent of juvenile density and food abundance. Growth rates were nearly maximal from March to May, suggesting that food conditions are nearly optimal in these estuarine nurseries. Sublethal tissue cropping of benthic invertebrates is thought to contribute largely to these high growth rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKareius bicoloratus 3aPolychaeta 3abody size 3adiet 3aestuaries 3aflounder 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3amicrostructure 3aotoliths 3apalps 3awater temperature 3aJapan1 aOmori, Michio1 aMinami, Takashi0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 151, no. 1 p.365-376dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0491-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001600157245010000173300001600273500000900289520166300298592002801961650002401989650002102013650001802034650002102052650000902073650001002082650001202092650002902104650001202133650000902145650000902154650001002163651001902173700001802192700001302210773020702223852000902430856009402439655001202533IND2206922620221118061417.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220692262DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamulki, S.10aMethane Emission and Uptake from Soils as Influenced by Excreta Deposition from Grazing Animals  ap. 676-682.  aepub  aThere have been only a few recent field-based measurements to estimate the impact of excreta from grazing animals on methane (CH₄) exchange. We report measurements of CH₄ exchange from cattle dung and urine deposited in a simulated seasonal grazing pattern. Dung and urine samples were deposited on six separate experimental plots at different times of the year to simulate different stages of normal grazing under UK conditions to study the effects of environmental factors on CH₄ exchange rates. During all the experiments, dung pats were the main emitter of CH₄ with an estimated mean daily rate of 0.72 (range 0.21 to1.46) g CH₄-C per cow. Both net emission and consumption of CH₄ from urine patches, however, were observed during the different experiments with a negligible mean daily emission of 0.02 (range −0.05 to 0.15) g CH₄-C per cow. Significant variations were observed between the experiments, despite the similarity of application rates and the composition of the excreta. These variations were mainly due to climatic differences when excreta were deposited: ambient temperature and rainfall were the most important factors. The estimated total annual emission of CH₄ from cattle excreta deposition during the grazing season in the UK ranged between 0.42 and 3.26 (mean = 1.57) kt CH₄-C. Our work confirms other studies that suggest that excreta patches are insignificant sources of CH₄ compared to the rumens of grazing cattle, and that climatic factors have a significant impact on CH₄ emissions.

In particular, Poisson mixtures are popular in this regard, but they are also known to have the boundary problem that causes unstable estimation. A family of shape-restricted distributions known as discrete k-monotone distributions is proposed for species richness estimation. These distributions are in fact also nonparametric mixtures and can thus be fitted rapidly via some algorithms that are made available recently. As shown by empirical studies, as compared with Poisson mixtures, their use avoids the boundary problem and gives more stable and more accurate estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aempirical research 3amodels 3aspecies richness 0aDiscrete k-monotone distribution 0aNonparametric mixture 0aShape-restricted estimation 0aSpecies richness 0aUnconditional maximum likelihood1 aWang, Yong0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Jan., v. 93 p.107-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245010500169300002000274500001900294520184000313592002802153650000802181650001902189650001302208650001702221650001502238700002502253700005602278700001902334700006302353700006202416773014902478856007602627852000902703655001202712IND60701792020221118160134.0200715e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070179202DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b034182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClowsley, Alexander H.10aDetecting Nanoscale Distribution of Protein Pairs by Proximity-Dependent Super-resolution Microscopy  ap. 12069-12078.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInteractions between biomolecules such as proteins underlie most cellular processes. It is crucial to visualize these molecular-interaction complexes directly within the cell, to show precisely where these interactions occur and thus improve our understanding of cellular regulation. Currently available proximity-sensitive assays for in situ imaging of such interactions produce diffraction-limited signals and therefore preclude information on the nanometer-scale distribution of interaction complexes. By contrast, optical super-resolution imaging provides information about molecular distributions with nanometer resolution, which has greatly advanced our understanding of cell biology. However, current co-localization analysis of super-resolution fluorescence imaging is prone to false positive signals as the detection of protein proximity is directly dependent on the local optical resolution. Here we present proximity-dependent PAINT (PD-PAINT), a method for subdiffraction imaging of protein pairs, in which proximity detection is decoupled from optical resolution. Proximity is detected via the highly distance-dependent interaction of two DNA constructs anchored to the target species. Labeled protein pairs are then imaged with high-contrast and nanoscale resolution using the super-resolution approach of DNA-PAINT. The mechanisms underlying the new technique are analyzed by means of coarse-grained molecular simulations and experimentally demonstrated by imaging DNA-origami tiles and epitopes of cardiac proteins in isolated cardiomyocytes. We show that PD-PAINT can be straightforwardly integrated in a multiplexed super-resolution imaging protocol and benefits from advantages of DNA-based super-resolution localization microscopy, such as high specificity, high resolution, and the ability to image quantitatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acardiomyocytes 3aepitopes 3afluorescence 3amicroscopy1 aKaufhold, William T.1 aLutz, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4312-74961 aMeletiou, Anna1 aDi Michele, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-97471 aSoeller, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9302-22030 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 18, v. 142, no. 28 p.12069-12078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b034183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010800159500002900267520118800296592002801484650001101512650002301523650001401546650001701560650001501577650002601592650002401618650002101642650001901663650001301682650001301695650001201708650001701720650001001737700002201747700002701769700002201796700002001818700003701838700002601875700002901901700001801930700002001948700002401968700002201992700002302014700002402037773012802061856007402189852000902263655001202272IND60737121620221121051718.0210514e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073712162DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130917182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Thomas 14aThe Making of a Joint E-Learning Platform for Remote Sensing Education: Experiences and Lessons Learned  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aE-learning is widely used in academic education, and currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing the demand for e-learning resources. This report describes the results achieved and the experiences gained in the Erasmus+ CBHE (Capacity Building in Higher Education) project “Innovation on Remote Sensing Education and Learning (IRSEL)”. European and Asian universities created an innovative open source e-learning platform in the field of remote sensing. Twenty modules tailored to remote sensing study programs at the four Asian partner universities were developed. Principles of remote sensing as well as specific thematic applications are part of the modules, and a knowledge pool of e-learning teaching and learning materials was created. The focus was given to case studies covering a broad range of applications. Piloting with students gave evidence about the usefulness and quality of the developed modules. In particular, teachers and students who tested the modules appreciated the balance of theory and practice. Currently, the modules are being integrated into the curricula of the participating Asian universities. The content will be available to a broader public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aEuropeans 3acase studies 3acurriculum 3aeducational materials 3aelectronic learning 3ahigher education 3aremote sensing 3astudents 3ateachers 3atesting 3auniversities 3awills1 aImmitzer, Markus 1 aMansberger, Reinfried 1 aVuolo, Francesco 1 aMárkus, Béla,1 aWojtaszek, Małgorzata  Verőné1 aFöldváry, Lóránt 1 aSzablowska-Midor, Aneta 1 aKozak, Jacek 1 aOliveira, Ivan 1 avan Lieshout, Arno 1 aVekerdy, Zoltán,1 aNinsawat, Sarawut 1 aMozumder, Chitrini 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130917183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008400164300001800248520095400266592002801220650001201248650001101260650001101271700002801282700001801310773010701328856008101435852000901516655001201525IND60121133320221119012508.0150215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8363-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Kan-Hao10aFirst-principles study of A-site substitution in ferroelectric bismuth titanate  ap. 6363-6372.  aWe employ density functional theory to investigate the effect of A-site rare earth substitution on the point defect formation in bismuth titanate (BIT) in the dilute substitution limit. Despite previous claims that the formation energy of neutral oxygen vacancies in La-substituted BIT (BLT) is higher than in pure BIT, our calculations show that this is only true for four out of the six distinct oxygen sites. Of these four sites, in two the difference is <0.1 eV while in the other two the difference is ~0.25 eV. In the case of +2 charged oxygen vacancies, in only two of the six distinct oxygen sites is the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy higher in BLT than in BIT, where they differ by ~0.14 eV. These results do not support the traditional explanation for the fatigue-free characteristic of BLT, which states that La substitution might avoid the ferroelectric fatigue of BIT by simply suppressing the formation of oxygen vacancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3aenergy 3aoxygen1 aFonseca, Leonardo R.

In 2011, a pilot project was initiated to identify the status of PRRSV in pigs of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal. Out of 98 serum samples, 31 (32 %; 95 % CI 23–42 %) were found positive by ELISA. All positive samples belonged to the type 2 (North American) genotype. Molecular evaluation by real-time PCR however did not yield positive results. At the herd level, seropositivity was associated with a history of abortion and premature birth.

The defined groups included those departments of strategic importance to the State Forests, as well as those which should undertake some additional activities to improve their economic efficiency. The results of the study were used by the State Forest management to define new strategies for individual departments of the State Forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness planning 3aforest management 3amarket economy 3astate forests 3atransportation 0aregional departments of the State Forests 0aeconomic efficiency 0astrategic analysis of departments0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 May 23, v. 72, no. 2 p.145-162dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0015-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245014700202300002000349520157900369592002801948650001101976650002201987650002902009650002102038650001402059650002402073650001302097650002702110650001702137773015402154856008302308852000902391655001202400IND60775851920221119163559.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077585192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18320-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2064-296X14aThe heterogeneous dynamic effect of financial development and environmental regulation on Chinese urban green technology management efficiency  ap. 32032-32053.  aChina is facing the large-scale urbanization and great pressure of energy consumption and environmental protection in the past few decades. In this process, urban green technology management efficiency (GMEC) is of great importance for the future work of greener transformation. Using China’s 286 city-level panel data from 2006 to 2018, this paper proposes a global Malmquist index, PVAR, and panel quantile regression model to explore the heterogeneous dynamic effect of financial development (FIN) and environmental regulation (ER) on GMEC. The results indicate that during 2006–2018, (1) the growth rate of GMEC fluctuated violently, with a change of more than 28%. In addition, there is “one tight and one loose” phenomenon of GMEC. This indicates that there is much room for the improvement of GMEC; (2) in northeast cities, FIN is not conductive to GMEC, but in other regional cities, FIN has dynamic beneficial effect on GMEC. In addition, FIN represents a changing trend of dropping at first to rising afterwards in all regional cities; (3) furthermore, from time angle, ER has the heterogenous dynamic effect on GMEC among regional cities. Specifically, in northeast, eastern, central, and western cities, GMEC has an “M,” “N,” “U,” and “U”-shaped relationship with the level of ER, respectively. From space angle, there is distinct heterogeneous effect of ER on GMEC at different quantiles within regional cities. Therefore, the local government are supposed to establish and implement policies based on regional cities’ characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental protection 3alocal government 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asustainable technology 3aurbanization0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 21 p.32032-32053dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18320-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010500128300001600233500022900249520185900478592002802337650002502365650001702390650003102407650001702438650002402455650003102479651001202510700001302522700001402535700001502549773010902564852000902673939003302682946001302715655001202728IND9000957620221119023031.0181002e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900095762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVEREECKEN, H.10aEstimating the soil moisture retention characteristic from texture, bulk density, and carbon content  ap. 389-403.  aAffiliations: 1Laboratory of Land Management, Univ. of Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, 3030 Leuven (Heverlee), Belgium. 2Laboratory of Statistics, Univ. of Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, 3030 Leuven (Heverlee), Belgium.  aWe sampled the soil horizons of 40 important Belgian soil series, with textures ranging from sand to heavy clay, and measured their moisture retention characteristic (MRC). Of these horizons, the particle-size distribution in nine fractions, the dry bulk density, and the carbon content were determined as well. The Van Genuchten equation (1980), reduced to four parameters on the basis of a model comparison technique, was fitted through the measured MRCs using Marquardtʼs algorithm (1967) for nonlinear parameter estimation. We performed a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis on the optimized parameters of different MRCs to check their relative importance and stability. Principal factor analysis was used to reveal the structure in the data and to examine the relation between MRC parameters and measured soil properties. Regression equations were established between these MRC parameters and measured soil properties. To test the need for detailed information regarding the textural composition of the soil, two information levels were discussed. The first level contains the textural composition in three fractions (sand, silt, and clay) while the second level takes into account the textural composition in nine fractions and two distributional parameters (GMPS, GSD).We concluded that the MRC can be estimated at a reasonable level of accuracy from such simple soil properties as particle-size distribution, dry bulk density, and carbon content. Detailed information on the particle-size distribution results in a better estimation of the parameters describing the shape of the MRC (a, n). The study further shows that for the prospected horizons the Van Genuchten model gives a good description over the entire range of the MRC. In addition it has been shown that the approach is flexible enough to model the MRC for a wide range of textures.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil water retention 3asoil texture 3aparticle size distribution 3abulk density 3asoil organic matter 3aphysicochemical properties 3aBelgium1 aMAES, J.1 aFEYEN, J.1 aDARIUS, P.0 tSoil science.g1989 Dec., v. 148, no. 6 p.389-403dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03495naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015700167300001400324520137400338592002801712650001601740650002001756650002301776650001201799650002201811650001401833650001601847650002001863650003101883650002401914650002301938650001601961650001301977650001401990650001602004650001002020650001602030650001902046650001402065650001102079650002002090650002002110650002902130650002202159653000802181653000802189653000802197653001002205653000802215653000802223653000902231653000802240653000902248653000902257653001202266653001602278653001402294653001402308653003002322653001902352653003902371700001402410700001402424700001402438700001402452700001302466700001802479773011902497856008802616852000902704655001202713IND60639314220221116222645.0190613e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063931422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Gan10aTransgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing MsSNAT enhances salt tolerance via the increase in autophagy, and the reestablishment of redox and ion homeostasis  ap. 20-28.  aWhether or how alfalfa serotonin N-acetyltransferase gene (MsSNAT; a melatonin synthetic gene) enhances salinity tolerance is still elusive. In this report, the wild-type and the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing MsSNAT were adopted. Compared to the wild-type, two transgenic Arabidopsis lines enhanced endogenous melatonin production in response to NaCl stress. Meanwhile, the primary root growth inhibition and chlorophyll degradation caused by NaCl stress were differentially alleviated. These were accompanied with the enhanced autophagy in two transgenic lines, as evidenced by the number of autophagosomes in roots and up-regulated some Autophagy-related (ATG) genes. Redox homeostasis was reestablished, since representative antioxidant genes and corresponding enzymatic activities were intensified in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing alfalfa SNAT, compared to the stressed wild-type. Importantly, NaCl-triggered ion imbalance was differentially abolished in transgenic lines, which was consistent with the transcriptional profiles of representative genes related to ion homeostasis, including sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHX1) and salt overly sensitive1 (SOS1). Collectively, our results revealed that MsSNAT-dependent melatonin enhanced salt tolerance via the increase in autophagy, and reestablishment of redox and ion homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aMedicago sativa 3aacetyltransferases 3aalfalfa 3aantioxidant genes 3aautophagy 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agrowth retardation 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen 3amelatonin 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aserotonin 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asynthetic genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 0aAPX 0aCAT 0aDAB 0aELISA 0aMDC 0aNBT 0aNHX1 0aROS 0aSOS1 0aSNAT 0aAlfalfa 0aArabidopsis 0aAutophagy 0aMelatonin 0aRedox and ion homeostasis 0aSalt tolerance 0aSerotonin N-acetyltransferase gene1 aYu, Xiuli1 aLou, Wang1 aWei, Siqi1 aWang, Ren1 aWan, Qun1 aShen, Wenbiao0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2019 Aug., v. 164 p.20-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300002000274520092400294592002801218650001701246650001101263650001301274650002101287650001701308700001801325700001301343700001701356700001801373700001701391700001601408773012401424856007401548852000901622655001201631IND60640238620221119103607.0190504e20160210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064023862DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra25788c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Liu10aIdentification of 2-subsituted benzothiazole derivatives as triple-functional agents with potential for AD therapy  ap. 17318-17327.  aA novel series of 2-subsituted benzothiazole derivatives as MTDLs were designed and synthesized for AD therapy using pharmacophore-combine strategy. The benzothiazole moiety from ThT and the HPO moiety from deferiprone were connected with vinyl linker to achieve target compounds. The biological evaluation results revealed that the majority of them demonstrated desirable triple functions by interfering with Aβ aggregation, oxidative stress and metal dyshomeostasis simultaneously. The two most attractive compounds 9c and 9i exhibited excellent self-Aβ₁–₄₂ aggregation inhibitory activity, efficient ABTS˙⁺ scavenging activity, potent biometals chelating properties, as well as disaggregation activity against previous formed Aβ₁–₄₂ fibrils. In addition to these advantages, both of them displayed no cytotoxicity to human glioma U251 cells up to 50 μM, thereby meriting further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3aglioma 3amoieties 3aoxidative stress 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Minkui1 aTang, Li1 aWeng, Qinjie1 aShen, Yanhong1 aHu, Yongzhou1 aSheng, Rong0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 10, v. 6, no. 21 p.17318-17327dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra25788c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012300172300001800295520107700313592002801390650004401418650001101462650001401473650001701487650004101504650001701545650002401562650002101586650001601607650001201623650001001635650001601645653001201661653001701673653001101690653000801701653002401709700001701733700005801750700005801808700002201866700001901888700001901907773011901926856008702045852000902132655001202141IND60601882220221120230058.0200621e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060188222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortazar, Maria10aRole of temperature on gasification performance and tar composition in a fountain enhanced conical spouted bed reactor  ap. 1589-1597.  aThe steam gasification of sawdust was carried out in a bench scale plant fitted with a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor and a nonporous draft tube, and using olivine as primary catalyst. The effect temperature (in the 800–900 °C range) had on product distribution (gas, tar and char) and composition was studied. Not only did temperature have a positive effect on the gas yield and carbon conversion, but it also played a crucial role in tar removal, as its concentration fell from 49.2 g Nm⁻³ (on a dry basis) at 800 °C to 6.7 g Nm⁻³ operating at 900 °C. Moreover, temperature also enhanced the hydrogen yield of the gas, recording a value of 7.28 wt% at 900 °C. Regarding tar formation and its evolution pathway, as gasification temperature was increased the tar composition (analyzed by GC/MS, FTIR and simulated distillation techniques) evolved to more stable aromatic compounds (of higher molecular weight), such as naphthalene or fluoranthene, with heterocyclic or light aromatic compounds being almost absent at 900 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3adistillation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasification 3ahydrogen production 3amolecular weight 3anaphthalene 3asawdust 3asteam 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aGasification 0aSyngas 0aTar 0aConical spouted bed1 aAlvarez, Jon1 aLopez, Gartzen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0560-73761 aAmutio, Maider1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5934-10161 aSantamaria, Laura1 aBilbao, Javier1 aOlazar, Martin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 171 p.1589-1597dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001800283520133000301592002801631650001101659650001301670650001201683650003701695700001501732700002001747700002001767700001701787700002101804700001801825773010701843856008101950852000902031655001202040IND60121133820221119012428.0150215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8371-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhlers, F.

We examine the structurally known well-ordered Al–Mg–Si–Cu alloy metastable precipitates along with experimentally observed disordered phases, using high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy. A small set of local geometries is found to fully explain all structures. Density functional theory based calculations have been carried out on a larger set of structures, all fully constructed by the same local geometries. The results reveal that experimentally reported and hypothetical Cu-free phases from the set are practically indistinguishable with regard to formation enthalpy and composition. This strongly supports a connection of the geometries with a bulk phase stabilization principle. We relate our findings to the Si network substructure commonly observed in all Mg–Al–Si(–Cu) metastable precipitates, showing how this structure can be regarded as a direct consequence of the local geometries. Further, our proposed phase stabilization principle clearly rests on the importance of metal-Si interactions. Close links to the Al–Mg–Si precipitation sequence are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aenthalpy 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWenner, S.1 aAndersen, S.

However, a recent theory has challenged this perception by proposing that primeval forests were in fact wood pastures: a mosaic of grassland and forest patches. These forest patches were created mainly by oak and hazel. Grazing by large herbivores, mostly aurochs and tarpan, living at high densities, later replaced by cattle and horses in the agricultural epoc, allowed wood-pasture formation. The regeneration of trees in such conditions was possible thanks to the protective shelter offered by thorny shrubs. Several forest reserves created in Europe, serving as references for primeval forests, have been succeeding without pressure from large herbivores and therefore their character may be different than that of real primeval vegetation. Although some palaeoecological studies suggest that primeval forests had closed-canopies, other analyses indicate that closed canopy forests were interrupted by a remarkably large proportion of more open areas. It is hard to judge what was the true character of primeval forests, but the role of large herbivores in shaping primeval forest structure has been neglected. It is believed that there was a higher proportion of mega-herbivorous mammals in the temperate zone during the late Pleistocene than the proportion presently living in Africa. Given the evidence that large herbivores can effectively determine the openness of African landscapes, their potential to have shaped temperate primeval forests should not be under-estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acattle 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ahorses 3alandscapes 3apaleoecology 3apastures 3ashrubs 3atemperate zones 3atrees 3awood 3aAfrica 3aEurope 0aprimeval forests 0aforest structure 0awood pasture 0alarge herbivores0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 May 23, v. 72, no. 2 p.183-190dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0018-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013500162520187000297592002802167650001502195650002202210650001202232650001902244650002102263650000902284650001502293650002602308650002502334650002102359650001702380650002502397650001302422650000902435650001602444650002502460653001202485653001802497653002102515653001602536653002902552700001802581700001702599700002002616700001702636700001602653700001702669773010802686856008202794852000902876655001202885IND60777851020221120134943.0220614e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077785102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1085742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zihan10aPlastic film mulch combined with adding biochar improved soil carbon budget, carbon footprint, and maize yield in a rainfed region  aPlastic film mulch is used widely in rainfed areas to increase crop yields, and the addition of biochar to soil has been proposed as an effective measure for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Comprehensive analysis is required to assess the effects of plastic film mulching combined with adding biochar on the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), greenhouse gas emissions, and water use efficiency (WUE) in farmland ecosystems. Therefore, we tested the following six treatments in a three-year (2018–2020) field trial: no mulching or added biochar (NM); biochar applied at 4.5 t ha–¹ without mulching; biochar applied at 9.0 t ha–¹ without mulching; plastic film mulch without biochar application (PM); biochar applied at 4.5 t ha–¹ with plastic film mulching; and biochar applied at 9.0 t ha–¹ with plastic film mulching (PMH). The results showed that plastic film mulching improved the maize yield (20.22%), greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂: 22.57%; N₂O: 17.58%), NGWP (net global warming potential; 15.19%), and CF (carbon footprint; 13.97%), but the effect on NECB did not differ significantly from that under NM (P > 0.05). Compared with PM, PMH reduced the CO₂ (3.24%) and N₂O (26.44%) emissions, increased the absorption of CH₄ by 65.55%, and significantly increased NECB. Under PMH, the maize yield, WUEg (water use efficiency of grain), and PUEg (precipitation use efficiency of grain), increased by 6.40%, 10.14%, and 6.92%, respectively, whereas the NGWP, GHGI (greenhouse gas intensity), and yield-scaled CF decreased. Therefore, PMH simultaneously improved the productivity, production efficiency (WUE, PUE, and yield-scaled CF) and soil carbon budget in rainfed farmland, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and thus it is a possible sustainable management method for farmland in rainfed areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagricultural land 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acorn 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3aglobal carbon budget 3agreenhouse gases 3aplastic film 3aplastic film mulches 3aresearch 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3awater use efficiency 0aBiochar 0aCarbon budget 0aCarbon footprint 0aMaize yield 0aGreenhouse gas emissions1 aWang, Bingfan1 aLi, Zhaoyang1 aHuang, Fangyuan1 aZhao, Chenxu1 aZhang, Peng1 aJia, ZhiKuan0 tField crops research.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 284 p.108574-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1085743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013600158300001800294520139900312592002801711650001101739650000901750650002401759650001601783650001201799650001001811650001101821650002501832650000701857650001901864650001901883700002101902700001601923700001401939773014301953856007502096852000902171655001202180IND60772120220221119234509.0220331e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077212022DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta00352j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Hui-Li10aAcid–base resistant ligand-modified molybdenum–sulfur clusters with enhanced photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution  ap. 7138-7145.  aStudying the active sites associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in molecular detail is challenging, but critical to the development of a high-performance catalyst for the generation of H₂, a carbon-free fuel derived from water. We report a well-defined molecule, Moᴵⱽ₃S₇(MBTZ)₃Br (MoS-MBTZ, where MBTZ = 2-mercaptobenzothiazole), which has a triangular fragment of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂). MoS-MBTZ displays excellent acid–base stability and survives for at least one month in solution at pH 1–14. Notably, the complex exhibits superior activity as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the HER, producing H₂ at a rate of 101.81 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹, which is 16.3 and 188.5 times that of the organic ligand-free cluster (NEt₄)₂Moᴵⱽ₃S₇Br₆ (MoS-Br) and commercial MoS₂ under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), respectively. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that the edge and even the face sites of S atoms of the trimeric Mo–S units are activated significantly by coordination with MBTZ, as a result of the effect of MBTZ on the energy band structure and the facilitated separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. This work provides a structurally precise model with which to explore the impact of an organic ligand on the photocatalytic HER activity and to reveal the structure–property relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aface 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3aligands 3alight 3amodels 3amolybdenum disulfide 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts1 aZhao, Jian-Qiang1 aZhang, Jian1 aLin, Qipu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 10, no. 13 p.7138-7145dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta00352j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245014000183300001800323520163600341592002801977650001202005650001802017650001902035650001602054650002502070650001102095650001502106650001702121650002902138650000902167650001302176650002402189650001102213650001302224650001602237650001802253653002302271653001602294653002002310653002002330700002102350700002102371700003002392773011902422856008702541852000902628655001202637IND60601882320221120230209.0200621e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060188232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDetchusananard, Thanaphorn10aBiomass gasification integrated with CO2 capture processes for high-purity hydrogen production: Process performance and energy analysis  ap. 1560-1572.  aThe performance of an integrated biomass gasification and CO₂ capture process to produce H₂-rich gas satisfying a PEMFC specification is investigated. Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO₂ sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H₂ concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 °C. For the integrated process, the H₂ concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 °C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO₂ is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO₂, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H₂ production increase as the CO₂/C ratio increases, whereas the CO₂ emission shows the opposite trend. The maximum exergy efficiency of 69.65%, based on the hydrogen production and the heat generation, is achieved at CO₂/C and CaO/C ratios of 0.6 and 4.48, respectively. At this condition, a specific emission of CO₂ of 4.4 g CO2 - eqMJ- 1 and an energy conversion efficiency of 88.09% are achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3afeedstocks 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3asorbents 3atemperature 3awood residues 0aSteam gasification 0aCO2 capture 0aEnergy analysis 0aExergy analysis1 aIm-orb, Karittha1 aPonpesh, Pimporn1 aArpornwichanop, Amornchai0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 171 p.1560-1572dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176300001600278520135600294592002801650650002101678650001501699650001301714650001901727650002401746650000901770650002201779650000901801650001101810650002101821650001401842653003901856653001401895653001901909653003101928700002301959700002301982700002202005700002202027773012702049856008502176852000902261655001202270IND60478099620221120155841.0160109e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047809962DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2015.11084342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyittah, Michael K.10aSuitability of Two Methods for Determination of Point of Zero Charge (PZC) of Adsorbents in Soils  ap. 101-111.  aThe points of zero charge (PZC) of manganese oxide (MnO ₂), titanium dioxide (TiO ₂), aluminum (Al) laterite, ferruginous (Fe) laterite, aluminum oxide (Al ₂O ₃), and a commercial activated carbon sample (AC001) were determined using acid-base potentiometric (PT) and mass titration (MT). The MT technique has been used extensively for carbonaceous materials but less for soils. In addition, little work has been done on the PZC of these metal oxides and carbon materials under similar experimental conditions concurrently. Our aim is to buttress the ease of MT usage over PT in routine laboratory analysis. The experimental PZC measured by acid-base potentiometric and mass titrations respectively were 4.97 and 4.11 for MnO ₂; 5.38 and 5.74 for TiO ₂; 4.19 and 4.08 for Al laterite; and 4.45 and 4.10 for Fe laterite. For Al ₂O ₃ and activated carbon, mass titration gave 7.53 and 8.41 respectively. Calculated standard deviations between the means of PT and MT were less than 1, and Student’s t-test at 95% confidence interval (CI) gave a P value of 0.135, suggesting that there is no significant difference between PT and MT and buttressing the reliability of the experimental procedures. In routine laboratory work, mass titration should be preferred for PZC measurement of (hydr)oxides and soil materials because it saves time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aconfidence interval 3airon 3amanganese dioxide 3asoil 3at-test 3atitanium dioxide 3atitration 0aAcid-base potentiometric titration 0aadsorbent 0amass titration 0apoint of zero charge (PZC)1 aTsyawo, Francis W.1 aKumah, Kingsley K.1 aStanley, Craig D.1 aRechcigl, Jack E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 47, no. 1 p.101-111dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2015.11084343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010000166520148600266592002801752650001501780650001501795650002001810650001701830650000701847650001101854650001401865650001701879650001601896650001501912650001301927651001001940653002001950653002501970653001201995653003202007700001602039700001502055700001702070700001702087700001602104773011302120856008602233852000902319655001202328IND60749717820221122005310.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074971782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jian10aUtilization of dredged river sediments to synthesize zeolite for Cd(II) removal from wastewater  aResource utilization of dredged sediments has been an urgent issue in recent years in China. To solve this problem, an approach of zeolite synthesized by dredged sediment was proposed for the first time in this study. Then the optimum conditions for sediment-based zeolite (SZ) synthesis and its adsorption performance of aqueous Cd (Ⅱ) were investigated. The results showed that the optimal parameters of SZ synthesis were 3–6 mol/L HCl as the extracting agent, a NaOH/RM ratio of 1.4:1–2.1:1, and 80–100 °C and 12–24 h as the crystallization temperature and reaction time. The specific surface area of the SZ (516.36 m²/g) was much larger than that of the initial sediment (9.51 m²/g), while the adsorption equilibrium of Cd (Ⅱ) by SZ could be achieved within 120 min. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacity was 206.64 mg/g at the optimal condition of pH = 5.0 and a SZ concentration of 1.5 g/L. In addition, ion exchange between Cd(II) and Na⁺ was demonstrated to be the predominant mechanism for Cd(II) adsorption by SZ. Other functional groups including –OH or –CH on the surface of the SZ could combine with Cd(II) to form complexes to remove Cd(II) as well. Furthermore, the SZ was successfully regenerated in this work. The findings confirmed that SZ could be reused as an effective adsorbent for the treatment of Cd(II)-polluted wastewater, which could provide a new and feasible approach to the resource utilization of dredged sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acrystallization 3aion exchange 3apH 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awastewater 3azeolites 3aChina 0aRiver sediments 0aResource utilization 0aZeolite 0aCadmium-polluted wastewater1 aHuang, Rong1 aOuyang, He1 aYu, Guangwei1 aLiang, Yuhai1 aZheng, Qian0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128861-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012100166300001100287520145400298592002801752596011301780650001701893650002801910650001901938650001901957650002801976650001602004650001502020650002202035650001102057650001002068650004502078650002002123650002402143650002202167650001302189650001502202650000902217650002102226650002202247650001102269700001402280700001702294700001702311700001702328700001602345700001202361700001802373700001702391700001802408700001402426700005602440773009302496856008302589852000902672655001202681IND60719165520221121200900.0211117e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071916552DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-020-00390-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yangxuan10aProteomic Analysis of Rice Subjected to Low Light Stress and Overexpression of OsGAPB Increases the Stress Tolerance  ap. 30.  aBACKGROUND: Light provides the energy for photosynthesis and determines plant morphogenesis and development. Low light compromises photosynthetic efficiency and leads to crop yield loss. It remains unknown how rice responds to low light stress at a proteomic level. RESULTS: In this study, the quantitative proteomic analysis with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was used and 1221 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified from wild type rice plants grown in control or low light condition (17% light intensity of control), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of DEPs indicated low light remarkably affects the abundance of chloroplastic proteins. Specifically, the proteins involved in carbon fixation (Calvin cycle), electron transport, and ATPase complex are severely downregulated under low light. Furthermore, overexpression of the downregulated gene encoding rice β subunit of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPB), an enzyme in Calvin cycle, significantly increased the CO₂ assimilation rate, chlorophyll content and fresh weight under low light conditions but have no obvious effect on rice growth and development under control light. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that low light stress on vegetative stage of rice inhibits photosynthesis possibly by decreasing the photosynthetic proteins and OsGAPB gene is a good candidate for manipulating rice tolerance to low light stress.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0100201cNational Key Research and Development Program “Seven Crop Breeding” key project of China 3aCalvin cycle 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abioinformatics 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3achlorophyll 3acrop yield 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3alight intensity 3aplant morphogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arice 3astress tolerance 3avegetative growth 3aweight1 aPan, Ting1 aTang, Yuying1 aZhuang, Yong1 aLiu, Zhijian1 aLi, Penghui1 aLi, Hui1 aHuang, Weizao1 aTu, Shengbin1 aRen, Guangjun1 aWang, Tao1 aWang, Songhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7822-769X0 tRice.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.30-30dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-020-00390-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100006500143245013500208520146400343592002801807596008501835596009101920650002502011650002102036650002202057650001402079650002602093650002802119650001802147650002302165650001602188650002902204650001202233650001102245650002202256650001502278650002202293650001902315650001302334650001402347650001802361650001402379650002202393651001102415653002602426653001902452653001302471653002802484653002702512700003802539700003302577773012102610856007702731852000902808655001202817IND60673400520221118073307.0191018e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067340052DNAL7 a10.1093/femsle/fny2022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalaviz Silva, Lucio,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8220-631410aBacillus and Virgibacillus strains isolated from three Mexican coasts antagonize Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus  aThis study identified marine microorganisms from Mexican coasts that had antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which are known worldwide to be food-poisoning agents. Representative specimens of algae, saline sediment, crustaceans and mollusks were collected. Of the 42 tested strains, 15 inhibited these pathogens. Bacillus and Virgibacillus strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The strains with the highest inhibitory activity against S. aureus were PCRS1-07 (B. aerius), BLCG-05 and GUO-01 (B. pumilus). The strains GUHC-04, BLCG-05, GUHC-03 (B. altitudinis) and BLBSe-05 (B. oryzicola) showed higher antimicrobial activity against V. parahaemolyticus. Biofilm production by all strains was moderate, but B. altitudinis produced a stronger biofilm. This is the first study to isolate B. aerius, B. oryzicola, B. safensis, B. boroniphilus, B. altitudinis and V. senegalensis from marine ecosystems in Mexico as well as the first study to report their inhibitory effects against both S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus. Bioactivity of spent media from the antagonistic strains cultured as biofilm also demonstrated high antimicrobial activity. The active compounds of the antagonists are currently being studied and tested. Marine ecosystems have the highest bacterial diversity associated with invertebrates and seaweed; however, this bacterial diversity has not been well-studied on Mexican coasts.  aPublisher supplied data  aSA170-15cPrograma de Apoyo a la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, UANL  a3157cMicrobiota from marine ecosystems and their role as antagonist against pathogens 3aBacillus altitudinis 3aBacillus pumilus 3aBacillus safensis 3aCrustacea 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVirgibacillus 3aactive ingredients 3aantagonists 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3acoasts 3afoodborne illness 3amacroalgae 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroorganisms 3amolluscs 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3aMexico 0amarine microorganisms 0aMexican coasts 0aBacillus 0a16S rRNA gene sequences 0aantimicrobial activity1 aIracheta-Villarreal, Jesús Mario1 aMolina Garza, Zinnia Judith,0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 365, no. 19dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50329x1574-69687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny2023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008000166300002000246500001100266520102700277592002801304596006301332596006301395596006501458650002101523650001801544650002001562650001401582650001301596650000901609650001701618650002201635700001501657700001601672700002101688700001401709700001501723700001701738773015401755856008301909852000901992655001202001IND60775852620221119163449.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077585262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18619-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongshan10aPathways of soil N2O uptake, consumption, and its driving factors: a review  ap. 30850-30864.  aReview  aNitrous oxide (N₂O) is an important greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in atmospheric photochemical reactions and contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion. Soils are the main sources of N₂O emissions. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that soil is not only a source but also a sink of N₂O uptake and consumption. N₂O emissions at the soil surface are the result of gross N₂O production, uptake, and consumption, which are co-occurring processes. Soil N₂O uptake and consumption are complex biological processes, and their mechanisms are still worth an in-depth systematic study. This paper aimed to systematically address the current research progress on soil N₂O uptake and consumption. Based on a bibliometric perspective, this study has highlighted the pathways of soil N₂O uptake and consumption and their driving factors and measurement techniques. This systematic review of N₂O uptake and consumption will help to further understand N transformations and soil N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771330cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019R1025-1cthe Public Welfare Project of Fujian Province  a101832020CX216cGraduate Innovation Fund of Jilin University 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrous oxide 3aozone depletion 3apollution 3aresearch 3asoil 3astratosphere 3asystematic review1 aLi, Yuefen1 aPan, Baobao1 aZheng, Xiangzhou1 aYu, Juhua1 aDing, Hong1 aZhang, Yushu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 21 p.30850-30864dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18619-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018800171520129400359592002801653650002301681650002201704650001201726650002201738650002401760650001701784650001401801650001101815650001401826650001101840650001801851650001601869650001001885650000901895653002201904700001901926700002301945773011301968856008602081852000902167655001202176IND60749718020221120201317.0211009e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074971802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, F.D.10aEvaluation of the corrosion inhibitory effect of the ecofriendily additive of Terminalia Catappa leaf extract added to soybean oil biodiesel in contact with zinc and carbon steel 1020  aNatural antioxidants have been studied and is know to bring characteristics such as sustainability and environmental compatibility to the process. The tropical almond (Terminalia catappa) leaf extract was used as antioxidant additive to the soybean oil biodiesel in order to verify the improvement of its corrosive property in contact with zinc and carbon steel 1020. Gravimetric test according to ASTM G1-03 and G31 standards was used at room temperature for 2520 h and 60 °C for 1440 h. The morphology of the metal plates was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Dispersive Energy Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction and the biodiesel through acidity index, Fourier Transformed Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy. At the end of the tests the carbon steel 1020 suffered no corrosion. However, for zinc mild corrosion was observed at room temperature and accentuated at 60 °C (efficiency of inhibition of 78.41% and 8.15%, respectively; increase activation energy in 31%). Interesting result is that at room temperature a greenish protective layer was observed in the region exposed to fuel from antioxidant components present in the plant for both metals. The results of this work indicate that the plant extract can be used as an anticorrosive additive in the two conditions studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTerminalia catappa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidants 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3aleaf extracts 3asoybean oil 3asteel 3azinc 0aCarbon steel 10201 aFerreira, L.M.1 ada Silva, M.L.C.P.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 321 p.128863-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100007200152245011000224300001800334520146400352592002801816650002001844650001301864650001201877650001901889650001101908650001701919650001901936650001401955700002301969773011901992856008702111852000902198655001202207IND60601882720221120230100.0200621e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060188272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamatellou, Antiopi-Malvina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8108-011510aExperimental investigation of energy harvesting from swirling flows using a piezoelectric film transducer  ap. 1405-1415.  aThis paper presents the results of energy harvesting experiments with piezoelectric film transducers placed in swirling air flow. The turbulent flow was created by a centrifugal fan –swirler plate arrangement. The air flow field created had a Reynolds number of 15,000–130,000 and a swirl number of 0.3–0.4. The mounting mode of the piezoelectric film transducer allows for varying the position and orientation of the piezoelectric transducer to optimize energy harvesting. First, the output of the piezo-film was monitored by an oscilloscope. Static pressure was concurrently measured using a fast piezo-resistive pressure sensor. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was performed to the output signals in order to understand the interaction of the piezo-film with the turbulent eddies. The mechanical vibration modes were recorded by a camera. Finally, a voltage rectifying circuit board was connected to the piezo-film transducer and the voltage output was monitored in various fan frequencies. The average power output was monitored by measuring the voltage across a load resistance. A configuration of the piezo-film with a rectangular plastic attachment was also tested in order to decrease the eigenfrequency of the piezo-film. The longer piezo-film demonstrated shorter harvesting time cycle and thus increased power output. The optimum performance of the harvester was achieved at the lower mean flow velocities and reached the levels of 3 μW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aair flow 3acameras 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aharvest date 3aturbulent flow 3avibration1 aKalfas, Anestis I.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 171 p.1405-1415dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011400171300001800285520125500303592002801558650002101586650001301607650001301620650001801633650001101651650001101662650001901673650001801692650003301710650002501743650002201768700001501790773010701805856008101912852000901993655001202002IND60121134620221118035451.0150215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8332-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi-Moghadam, B.10aEffect of processing parameters on the structure and multi-functional performance of epoxy/GNP-nanocomposites  ap. 6180-6190.  aGraphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are recently developed nanoparticles that are formed by stacks of short disk-like layers of graphite. They cost considerably less than their carbon nanotubes (CNTs) counterparts, and can be potentially used to generate multi-functional material systems. However, there are significant number of structural differences between GNPs and CNTs. It is therefore timely to review and optimize the current processing techniques used for generating GNP-nanocomposites. In this research, a scalable shear mixing approach (i.e., a three-roll mill) is utilized for achieving uniform dispersion of different fractions of GNPs in an epoxy resin. Then, the stiffness, electrical and thermal conductivity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the resulting nanocomposites were evaluated. The as-processed nanocomposites exhibited significant improvement in their thermal properties, but a moderate increase in stiffness. The electrical percolation threshold of the nanocomposite occurred at higher concentration of GNP than that predicted by the available micromechanical models. This is attributed to the change in size of GNPs, which occurs as a result of manufacturing process, as observed by scanning electron microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal conductivity 3athermal expansion1 aTaheri, F.0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Sept., v. 49, no. 18 p.6180-6190dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8332-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001400267520116100281592002801442650002001470650001301490650000901503650001201512650001101524650001701535650001001552653001501562653001801577653002801595653003301623653002001656700001401676700001601690700001701706773010001723856008401823852000901907655001201916IND60653658920221122043054.0190718e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065365892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBambauer, F.10aTransient DEM-CFD simulation of solid and fluid flow in a three dimensional blast furnace model  ap. 53-64.  aA numerical investigation of gas and solid flow as well as the liquid accumulation in a scaled Blast Furnace (BF) model was carried out using the discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This three dimensional simulation considers the interaction of the solid flow of a layered burden column with the counter flowing process gas. The influence of the cohesive zone is modeled by a material dependent permeability, the molten iron and the slag are considered as one additional liquid phase in the hearth. The method used is compared with a two dimensional numerical slot model presented in former publications by Zhou et al. and then applied to a different three dimensional setup. The comparison of the models exhibits considerable differences concerning the general multiphase flow behaviour. Moreover, it is shown that three dimensional models are required to correctly resolve the actual spatial flow structure and its influence on the shape of the coke free region in the hearth. Finally, the three dimensional model is used to show the influence of the liquid discharge on the stress distribution along the walls.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3afurnaces 3airon 3aliquids 3amodels 3apermeability 3aslags 0aIronmaking 0aBlast furnace 0aDiscrete element method 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aMultiphase flow1 aWirtz, S.1 aScherer, V.1 aBartusch, H.0 tPowder technology.g2018 July 01, v. 334 p.53-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001800267500001500285520176200300592002802062650000902090650001302099650002202112650001102134650002102145650001102166650002302177650001402200650000902214650002202223650001302245650001902258650002802277650001602305650001502321650001502336650001502351653000902366700001602375773010702391856008102498852000902579655001202588IND60121134720221118035445.0150215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012113472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8333-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWołowicz, A.10aAdsorption characteristics of noble metals on the strongly basic anion exchanger Purolite A-400TL  ap. 6191-6202.  a2019-12-04  aIon exchange is an alternative process for uptake of noble metals from aqueous solutions.

Initial Pd(II) concentration (100–1000 mg/L), beads size (0.425–0.85 mm), rate of phases mixing (0–180 rpm), and temperatures (ambient, 313 K) were taken into account during the Pd(II) sorption process. Moreover, the column flow adsorption study was carried out, and the breakthrough curves were obtained for Pd(II) ions. The equilibrium, kinetic, desorption, and ion-exchange resin reuse studies were carried out. The experimental results showed that Purolite A-400TL—the strongly basic anion-exchange resin could be used effectively for the removal of noble metal ions from the aqueous medium. The kinetics of sorption process is fast and the resin could be reused without reduction of capacity (three cycles of sorption–desorption, the reduction of capacity is smaller than 1 %). The column studies indicated that in the dilute acidic solution (0.1 M HCl) the working anion exchange capacity is high (0.0685 mg/cm³) in comparison with the other SBA resins examined under the same experimental conditions, e.g., Amberlite IRA-458 (0.0510 mg/cm³), Amberlyst A-29 (0.0490 mg/cm³), Dowex MSA-1 (0.0616 mg/cm³), Dowex MSA-2 (0.0563 mg/cm³), Varion ADM (0.0480 mg/cm³), and Varion ATM (0.0490 mg/cm³) etc. The highest % of Pd(II) desorption was obtained using thiourea, acidic thiourea, sodium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide as eluting agents (%D1 was in the range of 23.9–46.9 mg/g).  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3aplatinum 3aaqueous solutions 3amixing 3asodium hydroxide 3aresins 3aammonium hydroxide 3apalladium 3agels 3ahydrochloric acid 3athiourea 3aanion exchange 3aanion exchange capacity 3atemperature 3ametal ions 3adesorption 3aadsorption 0aions1 aHubicki, Z.0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Sept., v. 49, no. 18 p.6191-6202dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8333-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245009100201300002000292506007600312520077100388592002801159506003701187650000801224650003301232650000801265650003201273650001301305650002301318650003601341650002001377650002101397700001901418700001901437700001601456700001701472700001701489773012401506856007401630852000901704655001201713IND60640239520221207071651.0190504e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064023952DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra25809j2doi7 aPMC56355652pmcid7 a290570712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoviello, G.

Researchers have attempted to improve predictions of nonparticipation by modifying the parameters of the demand distribution. This study departs from previous approaches by explicitly incorporating nonparticipation into the behavioral model. The choice to participate is described by a distribution of preferences combined with a choke price on individual demands to distinguish participants from nonparticipants. The model is found to accurately predict nonparticipation and the size of the user group.  aPublisher supplied data 3arecreation 3aprices 3aconsumer demand 3aconsumer preferences 3aeconometric models 3aprediction 3aSouth Carolina0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2008 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.186-196dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2007.01040.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04182naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245007600186300001300262520242100275592002802696650001502724650001302739650002602752650002202778650001502800650001602815650001902831650002302850650002602873650003002899650001802929650002302947650002102970650001802991650001503009650002703024650001103051650001503062650001103077650001503088650002403103650000903127650002003136651001103156653001003167653002103177653001803198653001903216653002903235653003203264700001803296700002003314700003103334773010603365856008803471852000903559655001203568IND60639315120221116223322.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063931512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Hoz, Camino Fernández10aClimate change induced range shifts in seaweeds distributions in Europe  ap. 1-11.  aThere are evidences of how climate change is affecting seaweeds distribution and the ecosystems services they provide. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies.Five species (Saccorhiza polyschides, Gelidium spinosum, Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata) in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040–2069) and the long term (2070–2099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range) and ecological realism.Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities.The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal) and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCystoseira 3aGelidium 3aPelvetia canaliculata 3aSargassum muticum 3aalgorithms 3aaquaculture 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrodynamics 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amarine protected areas 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aniches 3aprediction 3aresource allocation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aEurope 0aAlgae 0aEcological niche 0aGlobal change 0aMarine ecology 0aPhysiological thresholds 0aSpecies distribution models1 aRamos, Elvira1 aPuente, Araceli1 aJuanes, J.

Anthocyanin and nonanthocyanin flavonoids were quantitated by UHPLC-DAD-MS and proanthocyanidins by normal-phase HPLC. On a dry weight basis, anthocyanins were mainly cyanidin-3-galactoside, highest in black aronia (3.4–14.8 mg/g) and lowest in red aronia (0.5–0.8 mg/g) as cyandin-3-galactoside equivalents. Berries from ‘Viking’ and the red accession UC021 had substantially more proanthocyanidins than the other accessions, with 3.3 and 3.8 mg catechin equiv/g, respectively. Chlorogenic acids and quercetin glycosides were most abundant in purple UC047 berries, at 17.3 and 1.3 mg/g, respectively. In contrast to anthocyanin content, total phenol values were highest in berries from red and purple accessions and attributed to phenolic acid and proanthocyanin content. Thus, red, purple, and black aronia berries are rich sources of polyphenols with various levels of polyphenol classes.  aPublisher supplied data  cState of Connecticut Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004818  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAronia arbutifolia 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aAronia prunifolia 3aanthocyanins 3acatechin 3acoumaric acids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenol 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquercetin 3asmall fruits 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCoumaric Acidsxanalysis 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFruitxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aPhotiniaxchemistry 2aProanthocyanidinsxanalysis 0achokeberry 0aaronia 0apolyphenol 0aflavonoid 0aproanthocyanidin 0aanthocyanin 0aquercetin 0achlorogenic acid1 aConnolly, Bryan

Large mammal herbivory is one of the most important factors shaping species composition, structure and function in temperate forest ecosystems. Furthermore, deer and wild boars are a cause of serious economic losses for forestry and agriculture, despite being a group of great interest to the public. The assessment of population size in forest habitats is a hot issue for both scientists and wildlife managers. Although there is an extensive literature on census methods and techniques, no agreement has been reached on a universally-applicable method for census of all species and conditions, fulfilling the criteria of being easy-to apply, cheap, precise and accurate. However, the implementation of some new methods (e.g. thermal imaging) seem to be very promising, but still need to be tested under closed canopy conditions in forest habitats. Ecological indicators that allow changes in the abundance of the animals to be monitored together with ecosystem properties may become an alternative resource for wildlife management, or at least can supplement wildlife census.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adeer 3afinancial economics 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest habitats 3aforestry 3aherbivores 3aimage analysis 3amanagers 3apopulation size 3ascientists 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate forests 3atemperate zones 3awild boars 3awildlife 3awildlife management 0awildlife census 0aecological indicators0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 Aug. 17, v. 72, no. 3 p.253-265dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0025-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007200170300001600242520124800258592002801506650002401534650001601558650001701574650001101591650001701602650003301619650003701652650001901689653001601708653001401724653001101738653001901749653001801768700002001786773011901806856008601925852000902011655001202020IND60602468120221118054558.0180711e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060246812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolkova, Olga14aThe unique features and ultrastructure of the Vinca minor L. intine  ap. 179-183.  aCytochemical techniques, LM, SEM and TEM have been used to characterize the structure and nature of the Vinca minor intine. Mature pollen grains of angiosperms are usually characterized by a thick intine in the aperture areas, whilst in the interapertural areas the intine is thin. V. minor pollen is organized unusually and is an exception to this rule. It is 3-colporate, with a psilate surface and interapertural depressions in the center of each mesocolpia. The intine is thinner in the areas of apertures and interapertural depressions. The sporoderm has special paired thickenings, one on both sides of each aperture. These thickenings are formed by the intine and traversed by tubular protein-containing components. The intine thickenings with protein inclusions in the interapertural areas have been reported for Vinca rosea and were interpreted as the sites of pollen tube formation. Our experiments on germination of V. minor pollen have shown that pollen tubes are always formed in the apertural areas. These sites of pollen tubes formation are marked by β-glucans associated with the inner intine layer of apertures (Calcofluor White positive). The accumulation of protein components does not always indicate the germination zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aVinca minor 3abeta-glucans 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aVinca minor 0aSporoderm 0aIntine 0aUltrastructure 0aCytochemistry1 aSeverova, Elena0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2015 Oct., v. 221 p.179-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001600293520053100309592002800840650001800868650001200886650001200898650003000910650001400940653001800954653001800972653002400990653002701014653002501041773009301066856008101159852000901240655001201249IND60481190620160822000000.0160203e20110817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048119062DNAL7 a10.2478/v10111-011-0027-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaliszewski, Adam10aPolicy instruments for provision of public goods - review of selected topics based on an example of forest conservation  ap. 273-283.  aThe four main categories of measures taken by the state for the provision of public goods are illustrated using the example of forest conservation.

Numerous practical examples are given for each category. The article concludes that optimal forest conservation policy needs to be based on a mix of different instruments and institutional arrangements.  aPublisher supplied data 3afiscal policy 3aforests 3amarkets 3apublic services and goods 3asubsidies 0aforest policy 0aexternalities 0apublic intervention 0aconservation contracts 0aforest certification0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 Aug. 17, v. 72, no. 3 p.273-283dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0027-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245015100206300001100357506007600368520232800444592002802772506003702800650001902837650002502856650001702881650001202898650002502910650001402935650001702949650002302966650002002989650001503009650001903024650001403043650002503057650001303082650001603095700001703111700001703128700001703145700001803162700001603180700001403196773011803210856008203328852000903410655001203419IND60591134120221207124145.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059113412DNAL7 a295639682pmid7 aPMC58510662pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-018-1065-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiao-Man10aDevelopment of a cooperative two-factor adaptive-evolution method to enhance lipid production and prevent lipid peroxidation in Schizochytrium sp.  ap. 65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Schizochytrium sp. is a marine microalga with great potential as a promising sustainable source of lipids rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This organism’s lipid accumulation machinery can be induced by various stress conditions, but this stress induction usually comes at the expense of lower biomass in industrial fermentations. Moreover, oxidative damage induced by various environmental stresses can result in the peroxidation of lipids, and especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, which causes unstable DHA production, but is often ignored in fermentation processes. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new production strains that not only have a high DHA production capacity, but also possess strong antioxidant defenses. RESULTS: Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is an effective method for the development of beneficial phenotypes in industrial microorganisms. Here, a novel cooperative two-factor ALE strategy based on concomitant low temperature and high salinity was applied to improve the production capacity of Schizochytrium sp. Low-temperature conditions were used to improve the DHA content, and high salinity was applied to stimulate lipid accumulation and enhance the antioxidative defense systems of Schizochytrium sp. After 30 adaptation cycles, a maximal cell dry weight of 126.4 g/L and DHA yield of 38.12 g/L were obtained in the endpoint strain ALE-TF30, which was 27.42 and 57.52% higher than parental strain, respectively. Moreover, the fact that ALE-TF30 had the lowest concentrations of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde among all strains indicated that lipid peroxidation was greatly suppressed by the evolutionary process. Accordingly, the ALE-TF30 strain exhibited an overall increase of gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and polyketide synthases compared to the parental strain. CONCLUSION: This study provides important clues on how to overcome the negative effects of lipid peroxidation on DHA production in Schizochytrium sp. Taken together, the cooperative two-factor ALE process can not only increase the accumulation of lipids rich in DHA, but also prevent the loss of produced lipid caused by lipid peroxidation. The strategy proposed here may provide a new and alternative direction for the industrial cultivation of oil-producing microalgae.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchizochytrium 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aevolution 3afermentation 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amicroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3apolyketide synthases 3asalinity 3atemperature1 aRen, Lu-Jing1 aBi, Zhi-Qian1 aJi, Xiao-Jun1 aZhao, Quan-Yu1 aJiang, Ling1 aHuang, He0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.65-65dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1065-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009300164300002000257500001100277520156200288592002801850650001101878650001301889650002601902650001201928650001901940650001401959650002501973650001701998650001002015650001002025650002902035650001502064650001302079650001302092650001402105650001602119650001402135650001302149650003602162700002702198700002002225700001902245700003102264700001802295700002102313700002102334700002102355700002502376700002902401700002502430700001902455700002102474700001902495773015402514856008302668852000902751655001202760IND60775853620221119163419.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077585362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18754-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRauf, Abdur10aComprehensive review on naringenin and naringin polyphenols as a potent anticancer agent  ap. 31025-31041.  aReview  aThough the incidence of several cancers in Western societies is regulated wisely, some cancers such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancer are currently rising in many low- and middle-income countries due to increased risk factors triggered by societal and development problems. Surgery, chemotherapy, hormone, radiation, and targeted therapies are examples of traditional cancer treatment approaches. However, multiple short- and long-term adverse effects may also significantly affect patient prognosis depending on treatment-associated clinical factors. More and more research has been carried out to find new therapeutic agents in natural products, among which the bioactive compounds derived from plants have been increasingly studied. Naringin and naringenin are abundantly found in citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruits. A variety of cell signaling pathways mediates their anti-carcinogenic properties. Naringin and naringenin were also documented to overcome multidrug resistance, one of the major challenges to clinical practice due to multiple defense mechanisms in cancer. The effective parameters underlying the anticancer effects of naringenin and naringin include GSK3β inactivation, suppression of the gene and protein activation of NF-kB and COX-2, JAK2/STAT3 downregulation, downregulation of intracellular adhesion molecules-1, upregulation of Notch1 and tyrocite-specific genes, and activation of p38/MAPK and caspase-3. Thus, this review outlines the potential of naringin and naringenin in managing different types of cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aadhesion 3aantineoplastic agents 3abreasts 3acancer therapy 3acaspase-3 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrug therapy 3agenes 3alungs 3amultiple drug resistance 3anaringenin 3anaringin 3apatients 3apollution 3apolyphenols 3aprognosis 3aresearch 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aShariati, Mohammad Ali1 aImran, Muhammad1 aBashir, Kashif1 aK̲h̲ān, Shāhid ʻAlī,1 aMitra, Saikat1 aEmran, Talha Bin1 aBadalova, Kamala1 aUddin, Md.

Three complete and one incomplete cycles of elk population size were identified. The duration of these cycles was 13-15 years and the mean amplitude of fluctuations was about 6.2 thousand individuals. A maximum population size of about 18 thousand individuals was recorded in 1973, although the actual size is thought to be about 5 thousand individuals more than this. The increase in population size never exceeded 30% of the total population, with the mean increase being 9.4±1.5%. The harvest did not exceed 15% of the population, and was on the average 4.8±0.6%. Commercial harvesting and poaching of elks has led to imbalances in the age and sex structure of the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aelks 3aharvesting 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3aUkraine 0awild game 0amoose population dynamics 0aCanis lupus0 tLeśne prace badawcze =.g2011 Aug. 17, v. 72, no. 3 p.285-288dVersitax2082-89267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10111-011-0028-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245018000216520164300396592002802039650002102067650002602088650001702114650001502131650001602146650002202162650004302184650001102227650002602238650003702264650002102301650002002322650002402342653002702366653001002393653002102403653002202424653002202446700006702468700002102535700001602556700001902572700001802591700002302609700002202632700002102654773012102675856008302796852000902879655001202888IND60777852120221118233659.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077785212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1040202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondampati, Kasturi Devi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5632-246110aPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Study of Ampicillin-Cloxacillin Combination in Indian Thoroughbred Horses (Equus caballus) and Safety Evaluation of the Computed Dosage Regimen  aThe pharmacokinetics of ampicillin-cloxacillin, given as single intravenously dose of 10 mg.kg⁻¹ (5 mg.kg⁻¹ of ampicillin plus 5 mg.kg⁻¹ of cloxacillin) was examined in clinically presented Indian thoroughbred horses (n = 6) in order to design appropriate dosing strategies. Drug concentrations in plasma were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ampicillin-cloxacillin against quality control strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, grown in Muller Hinton Broth, were determined by broth microdilution method. For ampicillin, area under plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) was 15.2 ± 0.54 µg.h.ml⁻¹, mean residence time (MRT) was 1.33 ± 0.06 h and clearance (Cl) was 0.33 ± 0.01 L.h⁻¹.kg⁻¹. For cloxacillin, AUC was 18.0 ± 0.9 µg.h.ml⁻¹, MRT was 1.28 ± 0.02 h and Cl was 0.28 ± 0.01 L.h⁻¹.kg⁻¹. MIC of ampicillin-cloxacillin combination against E. coli and S. aureus was determined to be 0.4 µg.ml⁻¹. PK-PD integration indicated that to maintain %T > MIC value 50% for bacteria with MIC ≤ 0.4 µg.ml⁻¹, an appropriate intravenous dosage regimen of ampicillin-cloxacillin combination in horses would be 15 mg.kg⁻¹ (i.e. 7.5 mg.kg⁻¹ of ampicillin plus 7.5 mg.kg⁻¹ of cloxacillin), to be repeated at 12 h intervals. Safety profile of the recommended regimen did not significantly alter any of the 16 biochemical or haematological parameters studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aThoroughbred 3aampicillin 3acloxacillin 3acomputer software 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apharmacokinetics 3aquality control 3aveterinary medicine 0aAmpicillin-cloxacillin 0aHorse 0aPharmacokinetics 0aPK-PD integration 0aSafety evaluation1 aSaini, Simrat Pal Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9765-50431 aSidhu, Pritam K.1 aAnand, Arun1 aKumar, Deepesh1 aBeesam, Srinu1 aBedi, Jasbir Singh1 aRājadīpa Kaura,1 aBhardwaj, Rajesh0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 Aug., v. 115 p.104020-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1040203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010900171300001800280520139000298592002801688650002901716650001701745650001001762650001001772650003701782650001501819650001601834650001501850700002101865700002601886700002601912700002801938700002401966700002001990773014602010856008102156852000902237655001202246IND60510660220221119004004.0160225e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051066022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4570-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas Gupta, Nandita,10aThermal co-reduction approach to vary size of silver nanoparticle: its microbial and cellular toxicology  ap. 4149-4163.  aIn recent years, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of food, agriculture and pharmaceuticals mainly due to its antibacterial activity. AgNPs have also been reported to possess toxic behavior. The toxicological behavior of nanomaterials largely depends on its size and shape which ultimately depend on synthetic protocol. A systematic and detailed analysis for size variation of AgNP by thermal co-reduction approach and its efficacy toward microbial and cellular toxicological behavior is presented here. With the focus to explore the size-dependent toxicological variation, two different-sized NPs have been synthesized, i.e., 60 nm (Ag60) and 85 nm (Ag85). A detailed microbial toxicological evaluation has been performed by analyzing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ), growth kinetics (GrK), and death kinetics (DeK). Comparative cytotoxicological behavior was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. It has been concluded by this study that the size of AgNPs can be varied, by varying the concentration of reactants and temperature called as “thermal co-reduction” approach, which is one of the suitable approaches to meet the same. Also, the smaller AgNP has shown more microbial and cellular toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adrugs 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ananosilver 3atemperature 3atoxicology1 aRanjan, Shivendu1 aRajendran, Bhavapriya1 aManickam, Venkatraman1 aRamalingam, Chidambaram1 aAvadhani, Ganesh S.1 aKumar, Ashutosh0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Mar., v. 23, no. 5 p.4149-4163dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4570-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245007700181300002000258500001100278520083900289592002801128596002701156596002401183596002001207650001601227650001401243650002101257650001701278650001601295650002001311650001301331650001401344650001501358650001401373650001401387650001701401650001901418650002201437650001401459650001301473650002501486700002901511700001901540700002101559700002601580700001901606700001901625700007101644773015401715856008301869852000901952655001201961IND60775853720221119163632.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077585372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19024-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubio-Gutierrez, Juan Carlos10aOverview of Traditional and Environmental Factors Related to Bone Health  ap. 31042-31058.  aReview  aBone mass in adulthood depends on growth and mineralization acquired during childhood and adolescence. It is well known that these stages of life are crucial for bone development, where genetic, nutritional, hormonal, and lifestyle factors play a significant role. Bone loss is normally a natural and slow process that begins years later after the peak bone mass is achieved and continues throughout the lifespan. Lifestyle choices in childhood and adolescence such as minimal physical activity, excessive caffeine or carbonated beverages intake, malnutrition, cigarette use, or high alcohol consumption and other factors like environmental pollutants can also negatively affect bone health and accelerate the bone loss process. The aim of this work is an overview of risk factors associated with inadequate bone health in early life.  aPublisher supplied data  a315696cConacyt-ANUIES  aM20SSP01cECOS Nord  a701988cConacyt 3aadolescence 3aadulthood 3aalcohol drinking 3abone density 3abone health 3abone resorption 3acaffeine 3achildhood 3acigarettes 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3amalnutrition 3amineralization 3aphysical activity 3apollution 3aresearch 3askeletal development1 aMendez-Hernández, Pablo1 aGuéguen, Yann1 aGalichon, Pierre1 aTamayo-Ortiz, Marcela1 aHaupt, Karsten1 aMedeiros, Mara1 aBarbier, Olivier Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0378-36750 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 21 p.31042-31058dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19024-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009300166300001100259520113300270592002801403596008001431596003401511650001001545650001001555650003501565650001601600650001601616650001701632650000901649650001601658650001901674650001101693650001801704650002001722700001501742700001701757700001601774700001601790700001701806700001601823700002101839700001601860700005801876773009301934856008302027852000902110655001202119IND60719166420221120212348.0211117e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071916642DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-020-00405-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yinxiao10aOverexpression of the Transcription Factor Gene OsSTAP1 Increases Salt Tolerance in Rice  ap. 50.  aBACKGROUND: High soil salinity can cause significant losses in rice productivity worldwide, mainly because salt inhibits plant growth and reduces grain yield. To cope with environmental changes, plants have evolved several adaptive mechanisms that involve the regulation of many stress-responsive genes. RESULTS: In this study, we identified OsSTAP1, which encodes an AP2/ERF-type transcription factor, was rapidly induced by ABA, ACC, salt, cold, and PEG treatments. OsSTAP1 is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells. Compared with wild type, transgenic lines overexpressing OsSTAP1 exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress with higher SOD, POD, and CAT activities, and lower Na⁺/K⁺ ratios in the shoots. In addition, many other stress-responsive genes, including other ERF- and peroxidase-encoding genes, were upregulated in the OsSTAP1-overexpression lines. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that OsSTAP1 functions as an AP2/ERF transcriptional activator, and plays a positive role in salt tolerance by decreasing the Na⁺/K⁺ ratio and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100904cKey Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong  a31971928cMajor Research Plan 3acells 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agrain yield 3ahomeostasis 3aplant growth 3arice 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asoil salinity 3atransactivators1 aWang, Juan1 aZhao, Xiuqin1 aYang, Sheng1 aHuang, Liyu1 aDu, Fengping1 aLi, Zhikang1 aZhao, Xiangqiang1 aFu, Binying1 aWang, Wensheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8842-34320 tRice.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.50-50dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-020-00405-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011800162500001400280520142200294592002801716650001401744650002001758650001201778650000901790650001601799650001601815650002601831650001401857650001801871650001401889650002501903650001201928650001501940650000901955650001601964650001501980650002401995700002302019700002102042700002202063773012302085856007402208852000902282655001202291IND60718973820221119034238.0201126e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071897382DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121133492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Hannah  Yang10aDiet Quality and Food Prices Modify Associations between Genetic Susceptibility to Obesity and Adiposity Outcomes  aNAL-light  aThe role of the retail food environment in obesity risk is unclear, which may be due in part to the lack of consideration of individual differences in the responsivity to food cues. This cross-sectional investigation geo-temporally linked the CARTaGENE biobank (including genetic, dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric data) with in-store retail food environment data to examine interactions between a polygenic risk score (PRS) for obesity and (1) diet quality (n = 6807) and (2) in-store retail food measures (n = 3718). The outcomes included adiposity-related measures and diet quality assessed using the 2010 Canadian-adapted Healthy Eating Index. A vegetable:soft drink ratio was constructed for each retail measure to assess the relative healthfulness of exposures. Generalized linear models adjusted for individual and neighborhood socio-demographic factors were used to evaluate main and interactive effects. Diet quality significantly modified the association between polygenic risk of obesity and body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat percent. A significant interaction was also observed between PRS and regular price of vegetables in relation to soft drinks on waist circumference. These results replicate previous reports of diet moderating polygenic risk of obesity and suggest that prices of low vs. high-energy density foods are an intervention target to address population obesity rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3adensity 3adiet 3aenvironment 3afood prices 3ahealthy eating habits 3alifestyle 3alinear models 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3apopulation 3arisk 3asoft drinks 3avegetables 3awaist circumference1 aPaquet, Catherine 1 aDubé, Laurette,1 aNielsen, Daiva  E0 tNutrients.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121133493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014600164300001600310520102800326592002801354650002001382650002001402650001101422653002501433653002301458653002601481653001601507653003101523700002101554700001701575773012001592856008201712852000901794655001201803IND60607535720221122071133.0180731e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060753572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xiaosun10aFinite mixture of nonlinear mixed-effects joint models in the presence of missing and mismeasured covariate, with application to AIDS studies  ap. 119-130.  aIt is a common practice to analyze longitudinal data using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, the following issues may standout. (i) Individuals may be possibly from a heterogeneous population following more than one mean trajectories, while a homogeneous population assumption for model structure may be unrealistically obscuring important features of between- and within-subject variations; (ii) some covariates may be missing and/or measured with errors. There has been few studies concerning both population heterogeneity and covariates measured with errors and missing data features simultaneously in longitudinal data analysis. A finite mixture of NLME joint (FMNLMEJ) models is developed to address simultaneous impact of both features under Bayesian framework, which offers a route to estimate not only model parameters but also probabilities of class membership. An AIDS data set is analyzed to demonstrate the methodologies in comparison of the proposed FMNLMEJ model with a commonly used NLME model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3adata collection 3amodels 0aAIDS clinical trials 0aBayesian inference 0aFinite mixture models 0aNLME models 0aLongitudinal data analysis1 aHuang, Yang Xin,1 aZhu, Yiliang0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2016 Jan., v. 93 p.119-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012200171300001600293520082300309592002801132650002001160650003001180650002501210650001701235650001001252650001401262650002001276650001401296650002601310650002301336650001101359653003201370653001701402653002001419653000901439653002001448700002101468700002601489700002701515700003101542773011901573856008201692852000901774655001201783IND60533601220221118160453.0190410e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053360122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2014.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisetnan, Suwattana10aDomain 2 of a Kazal serine proteinase inhibitor SPIPm2 from Penaeus monodon possesses antiviral activity against WSSV  ap. 526-530.  aA 5-domain Kazal type serine proteinase inhibitor SPIPm2 from Penaeus monodon is involved in innate immune defense against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). To test which domains were involved, the 5 domains of SPIPm2 were over-expressed and tested against WSSV infection. By using hemocyte primary cell culture treated with each recombinant SPIPm2 domain along with WSSV, the expression of WSSV early genes ie1, WSV477 and late gene VP28 were substantially reduced as compared to other domains when the recombinant domain 2, rSPIPm2D2, was used. Injecting the WSSV along with rSPIPm2D2 but not with other domains caused delay in mortality rate of the infected shrimp. The results indicate that the SPIPm2D2 possesses strong antiviral activity and, hence, contributes predominantly to the antiviral activity of SPIPm2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aantiviral properties 3acell culture 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3amortality 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3ashrimp 0aSerine proteinase inhibitor 0aKazal domain 0aPenaeus monodon 0aWSSV 0aShrimp survival1 aDonpudsa, Suchao1 aSupungul, Premruethai1 aTassanakajon, Anchalee1 aRimphanitchayakit, Vichien0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 2 p.526-530dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2014.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245007100203506007600274520086800350592002801218506003701246650001801283650001801301650001401319650001701333650002001350650001801370650001701388650003101405650001501436650001501451650002101466650001301487650002901500700001601529700002601545773012201571856007401693852000901767655001201776IND60650673820221207053814.0190710e20181222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065067382DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110100252doi7 aPMC63563052pmcid7 a305835002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnors, Jessica 14aThe Role of Succinate in the Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSuccinate is a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle within host cells. Succinate is also produced in large amounts during bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber. Elevated succinate levels within the gut lumen have been reported in association with microbiome disturbances (dysbiosis), as well as in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and animal models of intestinal inflammation. Recent studies indicate that succinate can activate immune cells via its specific surface receptor, succinate receptor 1(SUCNR1), and enhance inflammation. However, the role of succinate in inflammatory processes within the gut mucosal immune system is unclear. This review includes current literature on the association of succinate with intestinal inflammation and the potential role of succinate&ndash;SUCNR1 signaling in gut immune functions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3adietary fiber 3adysbiosis 3afermentation 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestines 3amicrobiome 3amucosal immunity 3apatients 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aDawe, Nick 1 aVan Limbergen, Johan 0 tNutrients.g2018 Dec. 22, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110100253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007600167300001400243520153500257592002801792650002701820650001701847650001401864650001701878650001401895650002001909650001001929650004301939650002301982650001402005650001102019650001202030650002002042650001202062650002302074650001602097650000902113650000902122650002602131650001002157700002902167700002002196700001902216700001802235700001802253773009702271856008102368852000902449655001202458IND50068645420221121054013.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006864542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-013-9804-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmood, Khalid10aUV-irradiation enhances rice allelopathic potential in rhizosphere soil  ap. 21-29.  aUltraviolet-B radiation is rising continuously due to stratospheric ozone depletion over temperate latitudes. This study investigated effects of UV exposure on rice allelopathic potentials. For this purpose, two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars BR-41 (high allelopathic = able to inhibit neighboring plants in native environment) and Huajingxian (low allelopathic = not able to inhibit neighboring plants, which were suppressed by higher allelopathic plants) were exposed to UV. Rhizosphere soils and leaf leachates bioassay were used to evaluate allelopathic potentials against receiver plants (barnyard grass and lettuce). These bioassays showed significant inhibition in lettuce and barnyard growth after UV in both rice cultivars. Interestingly, Huajingxian, which did not exhibit allelopathic potential in absence of UV showed significant inhibition after UV exposure. Phenolics, enzymes activities and genes responsible for biosynthesis of allelopathic compounds were examined after UV exposure. Phenolic compounds accumulated in rice leaves were quantified through HPLC analysis. They were significantly higher in BR-41 leaves after UV exposure. Enzyme activities (PAL and C4H) were significantly higher after UV exposure. The relative transcripts of genes (OsPAL and OsCYC1) responsible for biosynthesis of allelopathic compounds were also significantly higher after UV exposure. These results suggest that enhanced UV-irradiation levels due to ozone depletion may increase rice allelopathic potentials on paddy weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aOryza sativa 3abioassays 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindigenous species 3aleachates 3aleaves 3alettuce 3aozone depletion 3apaddies 3aphenolic compounds 3arhizosphere 3arice 3asoil 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweeds1 aKhan, Muhammad Bismillah1 aSong, Yuan Yuan1 aIjaz, Muhammad1 aLuo, Shi Ming1 aZeng, Ren Sen0 tPlant growth regulation.g2013 Sept., v. 71, no. 1 p.21-29dSpringer-Verlagx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-013-9804-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001400276520123300290592002801523650001901551650001801570650001601588650000901604650001001613650001301623650001101636650001101647650001701658651001401675653002901689653001901718653002301737653001801760653001501778653002401793700002101817700002401838700001801862773011001880856008101990852000902071655001202080IND60604439020221120121609.0180717e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060443902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtaola, Clara10aGeographic scale and zooarchaeological analysis of Late Holocene foraging adaptations in western Argentina  ap. 16-25.  aPrevious research on intensification in hunter gatherer strategies from Central West Argentina ca. 2000 years BP states that human demographic packing and overhunting of guanacos (Lama guanicoe) may have caused resource depression of this large prey animal. As a result, people broadened their diet to include smaller prey animals. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes an increase in Shannon's Diversity Index and a decrease in the abundance of artiodactyl remains over time in southern Mendoza. However, these studies about change in diet breadth did not consider the importance of spatial scale on analysis of prey choice and diet breadth and used the entire region as a unit of analysis. This is problematic because southern Mendoza has a heterogeneous landscape. In this paper we analyze different faunal abundance indices considering different spatial scales and the representativeness of the zooarchaeological samples. The results of the analyses show distinctive patterns of resource use over time at the macro- and subregional scales. Some of the difference can be explained by environmental differences between subregions and others might relate to differences in sample representativeness between subregions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aLama guanicoe 3aarchaeology 3adiet 3afauna 3aforaging 3ahumans 3apeople 3aprey species 3aArgentina 0aResource intensification 0aZooarchaeology 0aHunter–gatherers 0aSpatial scale 0aNestedness 0aSpecies area curves1 aWolverton, Steve1 aGiardina, Miguel A.1 aNeme, Gustavo0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 Mar., v. 55 p.16-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015900174300001600333520126100349592002801610650001101638650001101649650002501660650001301685650001201698650002101710650002201731650001701753650000901770650001901779651001501798700002601813700001901839700001901858700002101877700001501898700002201913773009001935856008102025852000902106655001202115IND50088833920221118161554.0151104e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008883392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9702-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovelock, Catherine E.10aContemporary Rates of Carbon Sequestration Through Vertical Accretion of Sediments in Mangrove Forests and Saltmarshes of South East Queensland, Australia  ap. 763-771.  aMangrove forests and saltmarshes are important habitats for carbon (C) sequestration in the coastal zone but variation in rates of C sequestration and the factors controlling sequestration are poorly understood. We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuncus 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amangrove forests 3aplant communities 3asalt marshes 3asand 3awetland plants 3aQueensland1 aAdame, Maria Fernanda1 aBennion, Vicki1 aHayes, Matthew1 aO’Mara, Julian1 aReef, Ruth1 aSantini, Nadia S.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.763-771dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9702-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012500169300001600294520138300310592002801693650001801721650001401739650001501753650002301768650001301791650001401804650001601818650002101834650001501855650002801870650001901898650001601917650002101933650001701954650001601971650001201987650001501999650001102014650001102025653001502036653001302051653001302064653001102077653001402088653001502102700002302117700002302140700002102163773012702184856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60094720720221122055658.0190329e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009472072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2012.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouma, Hjalmar R.10aHibernation is associated with depression of T-cell independent humoral immune responses in the 13-lined ground squirrel  ap. 154-160.  aMammalian hibernation consists of periods of low metabolism and body temperature (torpor), interspersed by euthermic arousal periods. The function of both the innate and adaptive immune system is suppressed during hibernation. In this study, we analyzed the humoral adaptive immune response to a T-cell independent (TI-2) and a T-cell dependent (TD) antigen. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were immunized in summer or during hibernation with either a TI-2 or TD antigen on day 0 and day 14. Blood was drawn on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Both types of antigens induced a significant rise in antibody titer in summer animals. Much to our surprise, however, only immunization with the TD antigen, and not with the TI-2 antigen induced a humoral response in hibernators. Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 (helper T-lymphocytes), CD8 (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) and CD45RA (B-lymphocytes) in blood, spleen and lymph nodes ruled out massive apoptosis as explanation of the absent TI humoral response during hibernation. Rather, reduced TI-2 stimulation of B-lymphocytes, possibly due to lowered serum complement during torpor, may explain the reduced antibody production in response to a TI-2 antigen. These results demonstrate that hibernation diminishes the capacity to induce a TI-2 humoral immune response, while the capacity to induce a humoral response to a TD antigen is maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aSciuridae 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3abody temperature 3acomplement 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3aflow cytometry 3ahibernation 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunization 3alymph nodes 3amammals 3ametabolism 3aspleen 3asummer 0aImmunology 0aAntibody 0aSquirrel 0aFicoll 0aOvalbumin 0aLymphocyte1 aHenning, Robert H.1 aKroese, Frans G.M.1 aCarey, Hannah V.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2013 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.154-160dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2012.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520169900314592002802013650002202041650001402063650001302077650001402090650001402104650002702118650001102145650001702156650002202173650001702195650001002212650002102222650001502243650001102258650002602269650002302295650001702318650001102335650002402346650002002370650001402390650001102404653001302415653003502428653001702463653002202480653001402502700001402516700001802530773012702548856008202675852000902757655001202766IND60542971020221120095039.0190408e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Cheng-Lei10aCytotoxicity of atropine to human corneal epithelial cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis  ap. 517-524.  aAtropine is an anticholinergic drug for mydriasis in eye clinic, and its abuse might be cytotoxic to the cornea and result in blurred vision. However, the cytotoxicity of atropine to the cornea and its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of atropine to corneal epithelium and its underlying mechanisms using an in vitro model of non-transfected human corneal epithelial (HCEP) cells. Our results showed that atropine, above the concentration of 0.3125g/l (1/32 of its therapeutic dosage in eye clinic), had a dose- and time-dependent toxicity to HCEP cells by inducing morphological abnormality, cytopathic effect, viability decline, and proliferation retardation. Moreover, the proliferation-retarding effect of atropine on the cells was achieved by inducing G1/S phase arrest and downregulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin. Besides, atropine also had an apoptosis-inducing effect on the cells by inducing phosphatidylserine externalization, plasma membrane permeability elevation, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic body formation. Furthermore, atropine could also induce activations of caspase-2, -3 and -9, disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, upregulation of Bax and Bad, and upregulation of cytoplasmic cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, implying a death receptor-mediated mitochondrion-dependent pathway is most probably involved in the apoptosis of HCEP cells induced by atropine. Taken together, our results suggest that atropine has remarkable cytotoxicity to HCEP cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and death receptor-mediated mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aapoptosis 3aatropine 3acadherins 3acaspase-2 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acornea 3acytochrome c 3acytopathogenicity 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3amembrane permeability 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aphosphatidylserines 3aplasma membrane 3aviability 3avision 0aAtropine 0aHuman corneal epithelial cells 0aCytotoxicity 0aCell cycle arrest 0aApoptosis1 aWen, Qian1 aFan, Ting-Jun0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2015 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.517-524dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245008100186300001800267520131600285592002801601650001301629650001201642650001401654650002401668650002501692650001501717650001501732650001401747650002501761650004001786650001301826650002801839650001501867650004701882650003001929700002701959700001901986700001602005773013502021856004802156852000902204655001202213IND50067897420221120065858.0130717e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006789742DNAL7 a236739232pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1791-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, J.

In this context, this study aims to review the recent advances on microalgal cultures in wastewaters to enhance their economic viability. We focused on three different culture concepts: (1) suspended cell systems, (2) cell immobilization, and (3) microalgae consortia. Cultures with suspended cells are the most studied. The nutrient removal efficiencies are usually high for wastewaters of different sources. However, biomass harvesting is difficult and a costly process due to the small cell size and lower culture density. On the other hand, the cell immobilization systems showed to be the solution for this problem, having as main limitation the nutrient diffusion from bulk to cells, which results in a reduced nutrient removal efficiency. The consortium between microalgae and bacteria enhances the growth of both microorganisms. This culture concept showed to be a promising technology to improve wastewater treatment, regarding not only nutrient removal but also biomass harvesting by bioflocculation. The aggregation mechanism must be studied in depth to find the process parameters that would lead to an effective and cheap harvesting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aeconomics 3aenergy requirements 3aenvironmental impact 3aharvesting 3amicroalgae 3aviability 3awastewater treatment 2aAir Pollutionxprevention & control 2aBiofuels 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aMicroalgae 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxeconomicsxmethods. 2aWastewaterxmicrobiology.1 aAlvim-Ferraz, M.

I.10aAdaptivity of Archaeal and Bacterial Extremophiles  ap. 379-401.  aExtremophilic prokaryotes, inhabitants of hot, cold, acidic, alkaline, saline, and deep-sea ecosystems, are classified as mono- and polyextremophilic or extreme-tolerant. Under conditions of heating, acidification, or salinization, thermophilic saprotrophic archaea are capable of maintaining endogenous homeostasis and high growth rates by biosynthesis of heat shock enzymes (proteins ofgeneral stress response), C₄₀C₄₀ membrane tetraesters with different numbers of cyclopentane rings, trehalose, and other hyperosmolytes. Small size of reduced genomes (0.5–3.0 Mb) of archaeal thermoacidophiles and hyperthermophiles was shown to reflect their adaptability mainly due to phenotypic changes and probably to have a reduced potential for speciation. In contrast, psychrophilic heterotrophic bacteria respond to sublethal temperature decrease by increased conformational flexibility of the macromolecules and elevated content of unsaturated fatty acids in the composition of their membrane lipids, synthesize membrane-associated glycoproteins, anti-freeze proteins, a group of general stress response proteins, specific and inducible cold shock proteins, which increase the growth rate. When slowing down and stopping the growth, psychrophiles switch on the processes of secondary metabolism and sharply increasing the biosynthesis of adaptogenic exopolysaccharides. Thus, they ameliorate the direct effects of salinity and hydrostatic pressure on viable cells, block the viral attack, and affect the microstructure and physicochemical properties of ice. Marine psychrophilic and piezopsychrophilic bacteria havelarger genomes of 2.6–6.4 Mb, which reflects their adaptability due to genotypic changes and an increased potential for speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aacidification 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acell viability 3acold 3acold shock proteins 3aecosystems 3aenzymes 3aexopolysaccharides 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrostatic pressure 3aice 3amicrostructure 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprokaryotic cells 3asalinity 3asaprotrophs 3astress response 3atemperature 3athermophilic microorganisms 3atrehalose 3aunsaturated fatty acids0 tMicrobiology.g2019 July, v. 88, no. 4 p.379-401dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl46286x0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617190401063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009000165300001600255520147600271592002801747650001801775650001401793650001301807650003001820650002001850650001001870650001601880650001201896650001101908650001501919653000801934653000701942653001801949653003101967653002601998700001502024700001702039700002002056700001702076773012702093856008202220852000902302655001202311IND60542971220221120095031.0190408e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054297122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2015.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Wen-Sheng12aA simple method for the formalin fixation of lungs in toxicological pathology studies  ap. 533-538.  aOptimized lung preparation for detailed structural evaluation is required to improve consistency in preclinical safety evaluation, differences of opinion exist among regulatory agency personnel regarding the optimal methods for routine formalin fixation of lungs from rodent toxicology studies. The simple tracheal ligation fixation method emphasizes tracheal ligation before opening the thorax instead of attempting to re-inflate after lung collapse when opening the thorax. Photomicrographs of this method demonstrated an unprecedented ability to maintain the natural lung architecture, in contrast to the unavoidable changes in the alveolar environment by the intratracheal instillation and vascular perfusion methods. In addition, a comparison of fixation methods on lung morphology in a rodent model of LPS-induced acute lung injury demonstrated that the tracheal ligation fixation method may provide a standard approach for morphometry. Additionally, a TUNEL assay was used to determine the degree of autolysis, which revealed that the autolysis was insignificant in the central areas of each lobe of the lung compared to the lung periphery by tracheal ligation fixation. In conclusion, our novel modified method, which avoids the disadvantages of generating artifacts, fulfills the requirement of preserving the clear, natural morphology of the lung making it suitable and worthy of recommendation for toxicological studies in a good laboratory practice (GLP) lab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aautolysis 3aformalin 3agood laboratory practices 3ahuman resources 3alungs 3amorphometry 3arodents 3athorax 3atoxicology 0aGLP 0aHE 0aLung fixation 0aIntratracheal instillation 0aToxicologic pathology1 aYin, Ji-Ye1 aWang, He-Mei1 aDong, Yan-Sheng1 aDing, Ri-Gao0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2015 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.533-538dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245012400197300001600321506007600337520128000413592002801693506003701721650002101758650001001779650001101789650001301800650001201813650002201825650002601847650001501873650001901888650002601907650002001933650001301953650001301966653001701979653002101996653002302017653002102040700002602061700002502087700002502112700002302137773011602160856007502276852000902351655001202360IND60568901620221207091854.0170521e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056890162DNAL7 a10.1021/pr500936p2doi7 aPMC42861962pmcid7 a253508652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Weili10aDevelopment of an Enhanced Metaproteomic Approach for Deepening the Microbiome Characterization of the Human Infant Gut  ap. 133-141.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe establishment of early life microbiota in the human infant gut is highly variable and plays a crucial role in host nutrient availability/uptake and maturation of immunity. Although high-performance mass spectrometry (MS)-based metaproteomics is a powerful method for the functional characterization of complex microbial communities, the acquisition of comprehensive metaproteomic information in human fecal samples is inhibited by the presence of abundant human proteins. To alleviate this restriction, we have designed a novel metaproteomic strategy based on double filtering (DF) the raw samples, a method that fractionates microbial from human cells to enhance microbial protein identification and characterization in complex fecal samples from healthy premature infants. This method dramatically improved the overall depth of infant gut proteome measurement, with an increase in the number of identified low-abundance proteins and a greater than 2-fold improvement in microbial protein identification and quantification. This enhancement of proteome measurement depth enabled a more extensive microbiome comparison between infants by not only increasing the confidence of identified microbial functional categories but also revealing previously undetected categories.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adigestive system 3afeces 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ainfants 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3anutrient availability 3apremature birth 3aproteins 3aproteome 0aMetaproteome 0ahuman infant gut 0ashotgun proteomics 0adouble filtering1 aGiannone, Richard J.,1 aMorowitz, Michael J.1 aBanfield, Jillian F.1 aHettich, Robert L.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Jan. 02, v. 14, no. 1 p.133-141dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr500936p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007300171300001600244520131400260592002801574650001501602650001601617650001201633650001101645650002101656650001101677650001501688650001501703653000901718653001001727653001201737653001201749653001601761653001401777700002001791773011201811856008601923852000902009655001202018IND60600365120221119030042.0180703e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060036512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilim, Michael10aWind power bidding in electricity markets with high wind penetration  ap. 141-155.  aThe optimal day-ahead bidding strategy is studied for a wind power producer operating in an electricity market with high wind penetration.A generalized electricity market is studied with minimal assumptions about the structure of the production, bidding, or consumption of electricity. Two electricity imbalance pricing schemes are investigated, the one price and the two price scheme. A stochastic market model is created to capture the price effects of wind power production and consumption. A bidding algorithm called SCOPES (Supply Curve One Price Estimation Strategy) is developed for the one price system. A bidding algorithm called MIMICS (Multivariate Interdependence Minimizing Imbalance Cost Strategy) is developed for the two price system.Both bidding strategies are shown to have advantages over the assumed “default” bidding strategy, the point forecast.The success of these strategies even in the case of high deviation penalties in a one price system and the implicit deviation penalties of the two price system has substantial implications for power producers and system operators in electricity markets with a high level of wind penetration.From an electricity market design perspective, the results indicate that further penalties or regulations may be needed to reduce system imbalance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprices 3awind power 3awind speed 0aWind 0aPower 0aBidding 0aPricing 0aElectricity 0aImbalance1 aBotterud, Audun0 tApplied energy.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 118 p.141-155dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001600157245011200173300001600285500000900301520168900310592002801999650002302027650001602050650001102066650001502077650001602092650002302108650002902131650000902160650001002169651001502179700001502194700001702209773020702226852000902433856009402442655001202536IND2206918520221118061146.0191028e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220691852DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroiano, J.10aEmpirical Modeling of Spatial Vulnerability Applied to a Norflurazon Retrospective Well Study in California  ap. 397-403.  aepub  aOne goal of mandated well monitoring in California is to search for residues of active ingredients previously undetected in the state's groundwater. The realization that pesticide residues move into groundwater via several different pathways has led us to develop an empirical approach to delineate vulnerable areas; major climatic and edaphic features of areas where pesticides residues have been detected in well water have been identified on a geographic basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of our empirical model in a retrospective well- sampling study for norflurazon, a preemergence herbicide with physical-chemical properties that indicated potential to move offsite with water. In our modeling approach, sections of land, which are 2.59 km² areas, were identified as having a greater potential for contamination based on soil and depth-to-groundwater (DGW) data. Wells were sampled from a subset of these sections where use of norflurazon was historically the greatest. Norflurazon residue was detected in 8 of 43 wells sampled in Fresno County, California, and in concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 0.69 µg L⁻¹. This result was considered highly successful because residues had not been detected in 18 previous California groundwater studies for other active ingredients, some of which had been detected in other state and federal sampling programs. Location of sampling sites in these previous 18 California studies was based only on pesticide use data. The detections of norflurazon in this study indicated that, even though using an empirical modeling approach appeared to be unorthodox, it enabled us to effectively identify vulnerable areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3agroundwater 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anorflurazon 3apesticide residues 3apreemergent weed control 3asoil 3awells 3aCalifornia1 aMarade, J.1 aSpurlock, F.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1999 Mar., v. 28, no. 2 p.397-403dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020005x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02267naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004900172520126600221592002801487650001801515650002401533650001701557650001701574650001501591650001501606650001401621650001401635651001201649700002201661700002201683773012901705856008601834852000901920655001201929IND60754296420221119222107.0211023e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429642DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeeren, Kathrin 10aEnterovirus Surveillance (EVSurv) in Germany  aThe major aim of the enterovirus surveillance (EVSurv) in Germany is to prove the absence of poliovirus circulation in the framework of the Global Polio Eradication Program (GPEI). Therefore, a free-of-charge enterovirus diagnostic is offered to all hospitals for patients with symptoms compatible with a polio infection. Within the quality proven laboratory network for enterovirus diagnostic (LaNED), stool and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected aseptic meningitis/encephalitis or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) are screened for enterovirus (EV), typing is performed in all EV positive sample to exclude poliovirus infections. Since 2006, ≈200 hospitals from all 16 German federal states have participated annually. On average, 2500 samples (70% stool, 28% CSF) were tested every year. Overall, the majority of the patients studied are children <15 years. During the 15-year period, 53 different EV serotypes were detected. While EV-A71 was most frequently detected in infants, E30 dominated in older children and adults. Polioviruses were not detected. The German enterovirus surveillance allows monitoring of the circulation of clinically relevant serotypes resulting in continuous data about non-polio enterovirus epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus C 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aencephalitis 3aepidemiology 3ameningitis 3amonitoring 3aparalysis 3aserotypes 3aGermany1 aBöttcher, Sindy 1 aDiedrich, Sabine 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167520130600228592002801534650001601562650002201578650001201600650001001612650001801622653002201640653001801662653002201680653001201702653002201714653003101736653002601767700005801793700006201851700002201913700002401935700002201959700002101981700002102002700002102023700002702044700002102071773011202092856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60768839120221119060517.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076883912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2022.1055772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Nasa, Jacopo10aArchaeology of the invisible: The scent of Kha and Merit  aThe burial assemblage of Kha and Merit discovered in 1906 and now preserved at the Museo Egizio in Turin (Italy) constitutes the most abundant, complete, and well-preserved non-royal Egyptian burial assemblage ever found. The discoverer of the tomb and director of Museo Egizio, Ernesto Schiaparelli, limited investigations to a few non-unique items, leaving most of the assemblage untouched. His decision has enabled contemporary scholars to study such exceptional archaeological finding with non-invasive approaches that could not be foreseen at the time. Here we show that the volatile compounds emitted by organic materials contained in vessels can be analyzed and detected directly in museums by a transportable mass spectrometer (selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, SIFT-MS). The interpretation of the mass spectrometric data, supported by statistical data analysis, shed new light on the chemical nature of the organic materials preserved in 50 vessels of the Museo Egizio in a completely non-destructive way. Our study proves the reliability of SIFT-MS as a fast-screening method for archaeometric investigations directly in museum, providing the unique possibility to complement, confirm and extend the archaeological research on the use and purpose of archaeological vessels and jars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3amass spectrometry 3amuseums 3aodors 3aspectrometers 0aBurial assemblage 0aKha and Merit 0aMass spectrometry 0aSIFT-MS 0aOrganic materials 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aNon-invasive analysis1 aDegano, Ilaria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3585-85551 aModugno, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0446-668X1 aGuerrini, Camilla1 aFacchetti, Federica1 aTurina, Valentina1 aCarretta, Andrea1 aGreco, Christian1 aFerraris, Enrico1 aColombini, Maria Perla1 aRibechini, Erika0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2022 May, v. 141 p.105577-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2022.1055773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013300172520111500305592002801420650001701448650001101465650001901476650001001495650001301505650001501518650002301533650001101556650001101567650002401578700003001602700002101632773012901653856008601782852000901868655001201877IND60754296520221119221911.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429652DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlonade, Israel 10aGenomic Characterization of a Prophage, Smhb1, That Infects Salinivibrio kushneri BNH Isolated from a Namib Desert Saline Spring  aRecent years have seen the classification and reclassification of many viruses related to the model enterobacterial phage P2. Here, we report the identification of a prophage (Smhb1) that infects Salinivibrio kushneri BNH isolated from a Namib Desert salt pan (playa). Analysis of the genome revealed that it showed the greatest similarity to P2-like phages that infect Vibrio species and showed no relation to any of the previously described Salinivibrio-infecting phages. Despite being distantly related to these Vibrio infecting phages and sharing the same modular gene arrangement as seen in most P2-like viruses, the nucleotide identity to its closest relatives suggest that, for now, Smhb1 is the lone member of the Peduovirus genus Playavirus. Although host range testing was not extensive and no secondary host could be identified for Smhb1, genomic evidence suggests that the phage is capable of infecting other Salinivibrio species, including Salinivibrio proteolyticus DV isolated from the same playa. Taken together, the analysis presented here demonstrates how adaptable the P2 phage model can be.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalinivibrio 3aVibrio 3abacteriophages 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahost range 3aintermediate hosts 3amodels 3aplayas 3ataxonomic revisions1 avan Zyl, Leonardo Joaquim1 aTrindade, Marla 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008600170300001600256520069400272592002800966650002300994650002101017650002601038650001201064653001201076653002201088653002301110653002601133700001601159700001801175700001901193700002001212700001901232700005601251773009901307856008501406852000901491655001201500IND60609713920221119100111.0200523e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060971392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoh, Seung-Yoon10aPerformance improvement of a cyclone separator using multiple subsidiary cyclones  ap. 145-152.  aThe aim of this study was to develop a new type of cyclone separator that can increase collection efficiency while maintaining a low pressure drop, and compare its collection efficiency and pressure drop with that of the general forms of tangential cyclone separators.

Recent studies have revealed the effectiveness of early-warning mechanisms that enable the public reduce their exposure to air pollutants. This highlights the need for accurate air quality forecasts. However, air quality in many developing and highly urbanised countries remains unmonitored. Hence, a novel spatiotemporal interpolation modelling approach based on a deep learning and wavelet pre-processing technique was proposed in this paper. In more detail, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) were utilised to model the spatial variability of hourly NO₂ levels at six urban sites in Central London, the United Kingdom. The models were trained using only the NO₂ concentration data from the neighbouring sites. Benchmark models such as plain LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were also developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The proposed wavelet-based spatiotemporal models were found to provide superior forecasting results, explaining 77% to 93% of the variability of the actual NO₂ concentration levels at most sites. The overall results reveal the very promising potential of the proposed models for the spatiotemporal characterisation of outdoor air pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aneural networks 3anitrogen dioxide 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awavelet 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAir pollution forecasting 0aArtificial neural networks 0aWavelet decomposition 0aLong short-term memory units 0aDeep learning 0aSpatial interpolation1 aCalautit, John Kaiser1 aHughes, Ben0 tEcological modelling.g2020 May 15, v. 424 p.109017-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1090173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010000164300001600264520067300280592002800953650001000981650001800991650001201009650001901021650001401040650002401054773013801078856007701216852000901293655001201302IND60524011720221116192657.0160701e20041201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052401172DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2004.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorkowska, Lidia10aPatterns of seedling recruitment in experimental gaps on mosaic vegetation of abandoned meadows  ap. 343-350.  aThe paper presents results of a study on the response of species growing in experimental gaps in the patches dominated by Carex acutiformis, C. cespitosa and Salix cinerea.

The effectiveness of misoprostol in preventing aspirin‐induced gastroduodenal injury was studied in 3 groups of 6 adult mixed breed dogs. Group I received 3 μg/kg misoprostol PO tid. Group II received 3 μg/kg misoprostol PO tid and 35 mg/kg aspirin PO tid. Group III received 35 mg/kg aspirin PO tid. Endoscopy was performed on days 0, 5, 14, and 30. Five regions of the upper gastrointestinal tract were qualitatively scored from 1 to 12 based on the presence of submucosal hemorrhage, erosion, or ulceration, with ulceration receiving a higher numerical score than submucosal hemorrhage. A total score was assigned based on the sum of the scores from all regions. Comparisons among groups on each day were performed using the Kruskal‐Wallis test. Differences within a group among different time periods were determined using appropriate multiple comparisons. Significant difference in mean gastroduodenal lesion score was found among all groups at 5, 14, and 30 days. Mean total score on days 5, 14, and 30 were as follows: group 1,5.0,5.2, 9.0; group II, 12.0, 12.7, 16.2; and group III, 26.0, 23.8, 21.5, respectively. Significant differences within a group among different time periods were found from days 0 to 5 in groups I and II, and from days 14 to 30 in group I. It was concluded that misoprostol effectively decreased endoscopically detectable mucosal lesions in dogs given aspirin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaspirin 3adogs 3aendoscopy 3agastrointestinal system 3ahemorrhage 3ahumans 3amedicine 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3asynthetic prostaglandins1 aLeib, Michael S.1 aForrester, S.

Socially robust knowledge relies on transparency and citizen participation. These two underlying elements take the form of both assessment and post-assessment decision support systems. Initially, during the assessment process citizens and stakeholders are engaged in the framing, proposal of alternatives, and evaluation criteria. Then the analysts assessed the alternatives proposed by means of DSS. Then, in a second stage, the analysts inspired in the idea of transparency, gave back the assessment result to the «extended peer community» who were able to give their opinion regarding the results and suggest potential parametric changes that were used for sensitivity analyses. The authors explore the proposed extended peer communities’ knowledge sharing for environmental governance assessment using a case study applied to a sustainable mobility planning process carried out in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The results gathered highlight that this approach is of use for guaranteeing the robustness of complex environmental decisions under high levels of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acitizen participation 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental governance 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3aCanary Islands 0aExtended peer communities 0aKnowledge 0aSensitivity analysis 0aSocial sensitivity analysis 0aMulti-criteria evaluation 0aFocus group 0aRobustness1 aCorral, Serafín0 tLand use policy.g2017 Apr., v. 63 p.140-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012800161300001800289500001900307520212800326592002802454596006002482596006002542596005902602596007302661596006002734596011702794650002202911650003002933650001802963650001602981650001702997650001503014650001703029650001403046700001503060700001603075700001703091700001603108700001703124700001303141773014603154856008203300852000903382655001203391IND60715633820221119220800.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10932-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Wei10aIdentification and engineering a C4-dicarboxylate transporter for improvement of malic acid production in Aspergillus niger  ap. 9773-9783.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aModification of C₄-dicarboxylate transport processes is an important strategy for the development of efficient malic acid producing cell factory in Aspergillus niger. However, there is a lack of identification and functional research of malic acid transport proteins, which seriously hinders the construction of high-yield malic acid metabolic engineering strains. A C₄-dicarboxylate transport protein (DCT) DCT1 is identified as major malic acid transport protein and exhibits significant elevation in malic acid production when overexpressed. DCT1 is found by homology searches and domain analyses with SpMAE1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe as the template. Phylogenetic and domain analyses show that DCTs belong to voltage-dependent slow-anion channel transporter (SLAC1) family and are members of Tellurite-resistance/Dicarboxylate Transporter (TDT) Family. DCT1 disruption dramatically decreases malic acid titer by about 85.6% and 96.2% at 3 days and 5 days compared with the parent strain, respectively. Meanwhile, the citric acid titers increase by 36.4% and 13.7% at 3 days and 5 days upon DCT1 deficiency. These results suggest that DCT1 is the major malic acid transporter in A. niger. Overexpression of dct1 with its native promoter significantly improves malic acid production yielding up to 13.86 g/L and 30.79 g/L at 3 days and 5 days, respectively, which is 36.8% and 22.8% higher than those in the parent strain. However, the citric acid has no significant change during the 5-day fermentation. These results demonstrate the importance of C₄-dicarboxylate transporters for the efficient production of malic acid. Furthermore, enhancement of malic acid transport process is a feasible approach of efficient malic acid production in this citric acid producing A. niger strain. KEY POINTS: • A dicarboxylate transporter DCT1 is identified as a major malic acid transporter. • DCT1 deficiency results in significant decrease of malic acid. • DCT1 overexpression leads to increased titers of malic acid. • Enhancement of malic acid transport is vital for malic acid production in A. niger.  aPublisher supplied data  a18JCQNJC78700cTianjin Science and Technology Committee  a18YFZCSY01360cTianjin Science and Technology Committee  a21706192cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016LG12cFoundation of Tianjin University of Science and Technology  a2015cThe Program of Distinguished Professor of Tianjin  a17PTGCCX00190cIndustrial Microbial Strain Selection and Fermentation Technology Public Service Platform Project 3aAspergillus niger 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abiotechnology 3acitric acid 3afermentation 3amalic acid 3amicrobiology 3aphylogeny1 aYan, Luwen1 aLi, Mengxin1 aLiu, Xinyuan1 aXu, Yongxue1 aXie, Zhoujie1 aLiu, Hao0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 22 p.9773-9783dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10932-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013500176500001900311520215700330592002802487650002402515650001302539650002402552650001402576650001402590650002802604650001502632650001402647650001502661650001702676650001802693650002402711650000902735650002202744650001402766653001402780653002502794653000902819653000902828653001902837700002402856700001702880773011502897856008503012852000903097655001203106IND60679758820221121133915.0200221e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1041672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhti, Seyedeh Zahra10aUnique constellations of five polymorphic sites of Helicobacter pylori vacA and cagA status associated with risk of gastric cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHelicobacter pylori possesses virulence genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of the bacterium. There are little data regarding all constellations of five polymorphic sites of H. pylori vacA and cagA status. We therefore aimed to i) find any associations between H. pylori vacA alleles (s1/s2, m1/m2, i1/i2, d1/d2, and c1/c2) and cagA status and ii) determine the frequency of all five-genotype combinations of the vacA alleles with and without cagA gene, and their associations with risk of gastric cancer (GC). A total of 290 Iranian H. pylori isolates from gastrointestinal patients were obtained successfully by the cultivation of biopsies and genotyped. The patients included 144/290 with non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), 57/290 with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and 89/290 with GC. We found that each of the vacA m1-, i1-, d1-, and c1-genotypes was significantly associated with cagA⁺ status. The odds ratio(OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was 2.316 (1.241–4.301) for cagA⁺/vacA m1, 2.764 (1.540–4.960) for cagA⁺/vacA i1, 4.288 (2.305–7.977) for cagA⁺/vacA d1, and 2.639 (1.488–4.680) for cagA⁺/vacA c1, respectively. In this study, 43 five- and six-genotype combinations were found among 224 strains. The highest frequencies were observed for vacA s1m2i2d2c2 (85/224, 37.9%), s1m2i2d2c2/cagA (48/222, 21.6%), s1m1i1d1c1 (40/224, 17.9%) and s1m1i1d1c1/cagA (35/222, 15.8%). Logistic regression analysis showed that vacA s1m1i1d1c1, s1m2i1d2c1, s1m2i2d2c1, and s1m2i2d2c1/cagA had a high prevalence in GC patients compared to non-atrophic gastritis patients (p < .05). The ORs and 95% CI were 2.433 (1.070–5.531), 11.524 (1.253–106.023), 4.200 (1.261–13.993), and 6.263 (1.494–26.256), respectively. These results were also confirmed when the controls were non-tumors (NAG/PUD). We found novel five- and six-genotype combinations associated with the risk of GC. These associations seem to be strongly dependent on the presence of c1-type of vacA. Therefore, analysis of all combined genotypes of the vacA alleles and cagA status may play a significant role in determining H. pylori-related clinical outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3abacteria 3aconfidence interval 3aevolution 3agastritis 3agastrointestinal system 3agenotyping 3ainfection 3aodds ratio 3apathogenesis 3apeptic ulcers 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3astomach neoplasms 3avirulence 0aH. pylori 0aGenotype combination 0avacA 0acagA 0aGastric cancer1 aLatifi-Navid, Saeid1 aZahri, Saber0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Apr., v. 79 p.104167-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1041673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009200168300001600260520108300276592002801359650001001387650001201397650004901409650001401458650002101472651002101493653001501514653002201529653001501551653002301566653001001589653002101599653001501620653001101635700001601646700002001662700001901682773013301701856008301834852000901917655001201926IND60601175120221120132438.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlusoy, Ülkü10aESR and 230Th/234U dating of speleothems from Aladağlar Mountain Range (AMR) in Turkey  ap. 367-380.  aElectron spin resonance (ESR) and ²³⁰Th/²³⁴U ages of speleothem samples collected from karstic caves located around 3000m elevation in the Aladağlar Mountain Range (AMR), south-central Turkey, were determined in order to provide new insight and information regarding late Pleistocene climate. ESR ages were validated with the ²³⁰Th/²³⁴U ages of test samples. The ESR ages of 21 different layers of six speleothem samples were found to range mostly between about 59 and 4ka, which cover the Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages (MIS) MIS 3 to MIS 1. Among all, only six layers appear to have deposited during MIS 8 and 5. Most of the samples dated were deposited during the late glacial stage (MIS 2). It appears that a cooler climate with a perennial and steady recharge was more conducive to speleothem development rather than a warmer climate with seasonal recharge in the AMR during the late Quaternary. This argument supports previous findings that suggest a two -fold increase in last glacial maximum mean precipitation in Turkey with respect to the present value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaves 3aclimate 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amountains 3apaleoclimatology 3aTurkey (country) 0aESR dating 0a230Th/234U dating 0aSpeleothem 0aLast glacial stage 0aMIS 2 0aLate Pleistocene 0aAladağlar 0aTurkey1 aAnbar, Gül1 aBayarı, Serdar1 aUysal, Tonguç0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Mar., v. 81, no. 2 p.367-380dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014200167300001800309500001900327520189400346592002802240650002102268650001502289650001902304650001802323650001402341650002002355650001502375650002102390650001702411650001102428650002202439650001702461650002102478650001502499650002202514650003202536650001102568700001102579700001802590700002002608700001702628700001702645700001802662700005902680773014602739856008202885852000902967655001202976IND60715633920221119220744.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10920-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLénon, Marine10aImproved production of Humira antibody in the genetically engineered Escherichia coli SHuffle, by co-expression of human PDI-GPx7 fusions  ap. 9693-9706.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial production of antibodies offers the promise of cheap, fast, and efficient production of antibodies at an industrial scale. Limiting this capacity in prokaryotes is the absence of the post-translational machinery, present in dedicated antibody producing eukaryotic cell lines, such as B cells. There has been few and limited success in producing full-length, correctly folded, and assembled IgG in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cell lines. One such success was achieved by utilizing the genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain SHuffle with an oxidative cytoplasm. Due to the genetic disruption of reductive pathways, SHuffle cells are under constant oxidative stress, including increased levels of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The oxidizing capacity of H₂O₂ was linked to improved disulfide bond formation, by expressing a fusion of two endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins, the thiol peroxidase GPx7 and the protein disulfide isomerase, PDI. In concert, these proteins mediate disulfide transfer from H₂O₂ to target proteins via PDI-Gpx7 fusions. The potential of this new strain was tested with Humira, a blockbuster antibody usually produced in eukaryotic cells. Expression results demonstrate that the new engineered SHuffle strain (SHuffle2) could produce Humira IgG four-fold better than the parental strain, both in shake-flask and in high-density fermentation. These preliminary studies guide the field in genetically engineering eukaryotic redox pathways in prokaryotes for the production of complex macromolecules. KEY POINTS: • A eukaryotic redox pathway was engineered into the E. coli strain SHuffle in order to improve the yield of the blockbuster antibody Humira. • The best peroxidase-PDI fusion was selected using bioinformatics and in vivo studies. • Improved yields of Humira were demonstrated at shake-flask and high-density fermenters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibodies 3abioinformatics 3abiotechnology 3acytoplasm 3adisulfide bonds 3adisulfides 3aeukaryotic cells 3afermentation 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amicrobiology 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aprokaryotic cells 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3athiols1 aKe, Na1 aSzady, Cecily1 aSakhtah, Hassan1 aRen, Guoping1 aManta, Bruno1 aCausey, Bryce1 aBerkmen, Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9579-97450 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 22 p.9693-9706dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10920-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010900172300001600281520174000297592002802037650002102065650000802086650002302094650002502117650001902142650002202161650001002183650001702193650001602210650003002226650001502256650001002271650000902281650001802290700002502308700002202333773013402355856008202489852000902571655001202580IND60588734320221120133427.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1280-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeykhasaber, Mojtaba10aDistribution and persistence of Verticillium dahliae in the xylem of Norway maple and European ash trees  ap. 323-339.  aVerticillium dahliae colonizes the xylem vessels of susceptible host plants. Hence it can be expected that the distribution of the fungus as well as disease progress will be influenced by the anatomy of the xylem of that host. Here, we studied the spatial and temporal distribution of V. dahliae in relation to recovery from disease symptoms in young European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides) trees that differ in vascular anatomy. Quantifying the amount of V. dahliae DNA at different heights in the stem of inoculated trees at different time points after inoculation showed that, in the year of inoculation, the speed of colonization of these two species by V. dahliae was similar. Nevertheless, in the year after inoculation disease incidence and also quantities of V. dahliae detected in maple trees were significantly higher than in ash trees, suggesting that the xylem of ash trees is much less supportive for growth and survival of V. dahliae than that of maple trees. Moreover, in this second year V. dahliae could not be re-isolated from the wood of ash trees that had recovered from disease and was only rarely detected by PCR, only in xylem of the previous year and never in the current xylem. In contrast, V. dahliae easily was detected in the wood of diseased ash and maple trees. Furthermore, despite the presence of a layer of parenchyma cells between growth rings in ash trees, in symptomatic ash trees V. dahliae was present in the xylem of the new growth ring. We also observed that V. dahliae can move downward from the point of inoculation into the root collar, which possibly provides a way for infection of new growth rings by circumventing the physical barriers within the stem xylem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer platanoides 3aDNA 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aVerticillium dahliae 3adisease course 3adisease incidence 3afungi 3agrowth rings 3ahost plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroot crown 3atrees 3awood 3axylem vessels1 aThomma, BartP.

We identified eriodictyol-6-C-β-D-glucoside (E6CG) as the active component affecting the secretory functions of exocrine glands; however, the pharmacokinetics and distribution of E6CG in exocrine glands have not been elucidated in mice receiving rooibos extract. We have developed a quantification method using LC–MS/MS to detect E6CG without an internal standard. Experiments on C57BL/6 mice administered rooibos extract showed that E6CG was transferred into blood plasma, with its concentration levels peaking 19.3 min after treatment. Substantial levels of E6CG were detected in the submandibular, sublingual, parotid, and lacrimal glands and in the sweat glands in palm skin. This study reports that rooibos extracts containing E6CG can be used as functional foods for improving systemic dryness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3ablood plasma 3achromatography 3aflavonoids 3amice 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aplant extracts 3asweat glands 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aRooibos 0aEriodictyol-6-C-β-d-glucoside 0aPharmakcokinetics 0aTissue distribution 0aDryness 0aM3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 0aM3R 0aSS 0aE6CG 0aE8CG 0aLG 0aPG 0aPS 0aSMG 0aMRM1 aNakamura, Yoshitaka1 aTateyama, Riho1 aArakaki, Rieko1 aTsutsui, Takuya1 aIshimaru, Naozumi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 1137 p.121881-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1218813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245008800199500002000287520183900307592002802146596007902174596003002253650001302283650001402296650001502310650002202325650002502347650001302372650002302385650001102408650002002419650001102439650001602450650001002466650001802476650001602494650001502510650001102525651001202536700006302548700001902611773013102630856007702761852000902838655001202847IND60772798520221119091933.0220410e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077279852DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0297432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakir, Younes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4299-586210aSeasonality in Intermittent Streamflow Losses Beneath a Semiarid Mediterranean Wadi  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStreamflow losses beneath ephemeral and intermittent streams are potentially major contributors to groundwater recharge. Compared to ephemeral streams, intermittent streams often have more than one season of streamflow and often experience shorter zero‐flow periods during the dry seasons and typically longer wet season of steady streamflow. Intermittent streams losses are lacking significant investigation on their variability over wet and dry season, and on the influence on potential groundwater recharge of flooding streamflow compared with more gradual wet seasonal baseflow. To address these issues, both streambed‐sediment water content and temperature were continuously logged over a year for an intermittent stream (wadi) under semi‐arid conditions in Central Morocco. Water content measurements uniquely distinguished between downward percolation and upward advance of the wetting front due to the rise of the water table, whereas temperature modeling was used to estimate vertical fluxes of percolated water. For the year of data, more than 90% of the estimated potential recharge occurred during winter and spring, when the alluvium typically has a higher water moisture, with most recharge generated during flooding conditions. Winter and spring baseflow generally generated low infiltration, though importantly contributes to wetting the sediment for rapid, deep percolation during flooding. Alternatively, summer flashfloods over dry sediment resulted in shallower infiltration despite higher peak streamflows. Thus, clear seasonality (seasonal variation) in relations between amounts of streamflow, streamflow loss, and depth of wetting into the streambed were distinguished over the study year. Finally, lateral recharge was detected, leading to additional seasonal water‐table fluctuation beneath the wadi.  aPublisher supplied data  aB/2015/48; ERANETMED3‐062 CHAAMS; PRIMA‐S2‐ALTOS‐2018cSAGESSE PPR  aMACECEcFulbright program 3aalluvium 3abase flow 3adry season 3aephemeral streams 3agroundwater recharge 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3astream channels 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater 3awater content 3awater table 3awet season 3awinter 3aMorocco1 aBouimouass, Houssne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4780-67841 aConstantz, Jim0 tWater resources research.g2021 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.e2021WR029743-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0297433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170520177500311592002802086650002102114650001502135650002002150650002202170650002602192650001502218650001302233650001502246650002002261650001302281650001502294650001902309650002902328653002602357653004702383653002702430653000802457653001002465653000802475653001002483653000902493653000802502653000702510653000902517653000802526653000802534653000802542653000702550653000802557653000802565653001002573653000902583653000702592653000802599653000802607653000702615653001202622653000902634653000802643653001102651653001002662653000802672653000802680700002102688700001902709700001802728700001902746700001802765700002002783700002102803700001902824700002002843700002002863700001702883700001902900773011102919856008603030852000903116655001203125IND60679759220221120222919.0200117e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1219582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Hee-Yeon10aPotential urinary extracellular vesicle protein biomarkers of chronic active antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplant recipients  aThe aim of this study was to identify potential proteomic biomarkers for chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR) in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Among 385 KTRs enrolled in a cross-sectional multicenter study, 26 KTRs with biopsy-proven CAMR, 57 KTRs with long-term graft survival (LGS), and 10 rejection-free matched KTRs were included. A proteomic approach was employed to measure urinary extracellular vesicle (EV) changes in the KTRs. The urinary EVs were trypsin-digested using a gel-assisted protocol and quantified by label-free liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, using a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm the protein levels for each candidate biomarker. Analysis of the isolated EV proteins revealed 93 and 97 proteins in the CAMR and LGS patients, respectively. Proteins that were identical in both groups were excluded and only high-significance proteins with a fold change of at least 1.5 were selected as candidate biomarkers. Six proteins (APOA1, TTR, PIGR, HPX, AZGP1, and CP) that were distinguishable between CAMR and LGS were selected. The proteins were confirmed by immunoblot analyses using independently acquired urinary EV samples. AZGP1 in particular was found to be a CAMR-specific proteomic biomarker that was distinguishable from the rejection-free control group with matching kidney function, duration of transplantation, and age. We identified and validated six proteomic biomarkers for CAMR and clarified one CAMR-specific proteomic biomarker in KTRs. Further clinical trials are needed before these rejection-specific biomarkers can be applied for the early prediction, diagnosis, and monitoring of the clinical response of KTRs to the treatment of CAMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abiomarkers 3aclinical trials 3akidney transplant 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arenal function 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aExtracellular vesicle 0aChronic active antibody-mediated rejection 0aKidney transplantation 0aACN 0aAPOA1 0aAUC 0aAZGP1 0aCAMR 0aCNI 0aCP 0aDSAs 0aDTT 0aECL 0aEVs 0aFA 0aHLA 0aHPX 0aIF/TA 0aKTRs 0aLC 0aLGS 0aMFI 0aMS 0aPANTHER 0aPIGR 0aSDS 0aSTRING 0aTEABC 0aTHP 0aTTR1 aLee, Chan-Hyeong1 aChoi, Ji-Young1 aCho, Jang-Hee1 aPark, Sun Hee,1 aKim, Yong-Lim1 aMoon, Pyong-Gon1 aBaek, Moon-Chang1 aBerm Park, Jae1 aHoon Kim, Yeong1 aHa Chung, Byung1 aLee, Sang-Ho1 aKim, Chan-Duck0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 1138 p.121958-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1219583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012000210300001800330500001900348500001100367520145300378592002801831650000801859650001401867650001801881650001201899650002201911650001301933650001101946650001501957700001701972773014601989856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60715634120221119220649.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10922-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDash, Hirak Ranjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1954-645210aThanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic community signatures for estimation of post-mortem time interval in human cadaver  ap. 9497-9512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aEstimation of post-mortem time interval (PMI) is a key parameter in the forensic investigation which poses a huge challenge to the medico-legal experts. The succession of microbes within different parts of the human body after death has shown huge potential in the determination of PMI. Human body harbors trillions of microorganisms as commensals. With the death of an individual when biological functions are stopped, these microorganisms behave contrarily along with the invasion of degrading microbes from the environment. Human cadaver becomes a rich source of nutrients due to autolysis of cells, which attracts various invading microorganisms as well as macroorganisms. At different stages of degradation, the succession of microorganisms differs significantly which can be explored for accurate PMI estimation. With the advent of microbial genomics technique and reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing, thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic community analysis have gained huge attention in PMI estimation. The article summarizes different sources of microorganisms in a human cadaver, their succession pattern, and analytical techniques for application in the field of microbial forensics. KEY POINTS: • Thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic microbiome develop in postmortem human body. • Lack of metabolic, immune, neuroendocrine systems facilitate microbial succession. • Analysis of postmortem microbial communities predicts accurate PMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aautolysis 3abiotechnology 3acadaver 3aforensic sciences 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amicrobiome1 aDas, Surajit0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 22 p.9497-9512dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10922-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100002700195245011100222300001400333506007600347506003100423520106000454592002801514596004501542596006301587506003701650650001101687650001101698650001801709650001501727650002401742650002101766650001901787650001901806650001001825650002101835651001201856653003301868653002601901653001801927653001801945653002301963653002201986700002602008773010002034856008702134852000902221655001202230IND60570348820221207082804.0201125e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0382chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohebalian, Phillip M.10aBeneath the Canopy: Tropical Forests Enrolled in Conservation Payments Reveal Evidence of Less Degradation  ap. 64-73.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAssessments of programs offering payments for forest conservation have largely focused on their contribution to avoiding deforestation but have overlooked degradation. We integrated remotely-sensed forest cover images, georeferenced landscape information, field-level forest inventories and face-to-face landowner surveys to quantify avoided deforestation and degradation within the context of Ecuador's Socio Bosque Program (PSB). We found the PSB prevented 9% of enrolled forest area in Ecuador's Amazon Basin from being deforested over the 2008–2014 period. This value is higher than previous assessments conducted in other Latin American nations. Inventory data suggest that forests within PSB-enrolled areas exhibited less evidence of degradation although statistical differences were only marginally significant. On average, PSB-enrolled forests had between one and two more tree species per hectare than non-enrolled forests. These additional tree species were twice as likely to be of commercial timber value and at greater threat of extinction.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Missouridhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000071650 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3acanopy 3adeforestation 3aextinction 3aforest conservation 3aforest inventory 3ageoreferencing 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aEcuador 0aTropical forest conservation 0aPrograma Socio Bosque 0aAdditionality 0aDeforestation 0aForest degradation 0aImpact Evaluation1 aAguilar, Francisco X.0 tEcological economics.g2018 Jan., v. 143 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008200198300001600280500002000296520170100316592002802017596010002045596009902145650001002244650001902254650002002273650001802293650001202311700006302323773010802386856007402494852000902568655001202577IND60773191320221119144422.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077319132DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.132742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekizawa, Maisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7813-719210aPattern, function and constraint of infant handling in wild Japanese macaques  ap. 412-423.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn group‐living primates, non‐mother individuals frequently contact and handle an infant. Although previous studies showed that the function of this behaviour varies among and within species, few have considered a possibility the handlers’ accessibility to an infant may be restricted by a social relationship between the handlers and infants’ mothers. Considering this proximate constraint on the choice and handling of an infant, we aimed to clarify the function of infant handling in wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We collected behavioural data on infant handling from 24 mother–infant pairs over three years on Kinkazan Island, Japan. We tested the predictions of three functional hypotheses: learning‐to‐mother, kin selection and reproductive competition among females. We found that handling by males rarely occurred. The proximity between mother and a potential handler positively affected the frequency of infant handling, and its effect interacted with the handler's parity, kinship and relative dominance relationship with the mother. Hence, the effects of handlers’ proximity were prominent for nulliparous, related and relatively lower‐ranked females relative to parous, unrelated and higher‐ranked females. We also found that infants were handled positively in most cases. These results fit the predictions of the learning‐to‐mother hypothesis and kin selection hypothesis, indicating that the functions of infant handling varied with the attributes of the handlers. This study provides rare results clarifying the function of infant handling in wild primates, based on the fact that handler behaviour is constrained by accessibility to the mother.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015–B–16cThe Cooperative Research Program of Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University  a2016–B–7cThe Cooperative Research Program of Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University 3aJapan 3aMacaca fuscata 3aanimal behavior 3akin selection 3akinship1 aKutsukake, Nobuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8637-62330 tEthology.g2022 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.412-423dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.132743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009800158300002000256520123300276592002801509650002201537650003701559650001301596650001101609650002001620650002201640650003001662650002101692650001301713650001101726650002001737650001701757653001201774653001201786653001201798653002101810653002401831700005701855700001101912700003201923700001501955700005401970700001602024700001702040700001702057700001602074700001902090700001502109700001902124700005302143773014202196856007902338852000902417655001202426IND60759328220221117222011.0211208e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c183032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Yukun12aA New Co-Free Ni-Rich LiNi₀.₈Fe₀.₁Mn₀.₁O₂ Cathode for Low-Cost Li-Ion Batteries  ap. 57341-57349.  aIn recent years, with the rapid development of electric vehicles, the ever-fluctuating cobalt price has become a decisive constraint on the supply chain of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery industry. To address these challenges, a new and unreported cobalt-free (Co-free) material with a general formula of LiNi₀.₈Fe₀.₁Mn₀.₁O₂ (NFM) is introduced. This Co-free material is synthesized via the coprecipitation method and examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the morphological, crystal-structure, and electrochemical properties. The NFM cathode can deliver a specific capacity of 202.6 mA h g–¹ (0.1C, 3.0–4.5 V), a specific energy capacity of 798.8 W h kg–¹ in material level (0.1C, 3.0–4.5 V), a reasonable rate capability, and a stable cycling performance (81.1% discharge capacity retention after 150 cycles at 10C, 3.0–4.3 V). Although the research on this subject is still in its early stage, the capability of this novel cathode material as a practical candidate for applications in next-generation Co-free lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is highlighted in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acathodes 3acobalt 3acoprecipitation 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aindustry 3aprices 3aspecific energy 3asupply chain 0aCo-free 0aNi-rich 0acathode 0aLi-ion batteries 0aLiNi0.8Fe0.1Mn0.1O21 aWang, Mingjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0829-03591 aXu, Le1 aKheimeh Sari, Hirbod Maleki1 aLi, Wenbin1 aHu, Junhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0191-15031 aCao, Yanyan1 aChen, Liping1 aWang, Linzhe1 aPu, Xiaohua1 aWang, Jingjing1 aBai, Yikun1 aLiu, Xingjiang1 aLi, Xifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4828-41830 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 13, no. 48 p.57341-57349dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c183033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009700169520077400266592002801040650001001068650001401078650004601092650001601138650001701154650002601171650001301197650002101210650001801231650000901249650001601258653001101274653001701285653001701302653004401319653002601363653002001389700001901409700002101428700002401449700002201473773011101495856008601606852000901692655001201701IND60679759320221120222841.0200601e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1219562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoury, Spiro10aRapid sample preparation for ganglioside analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry  aGangliosides (GG) are glycosphingolipids, composed of a ceramide moiety (fatty acid and long chain base) linked to an oligosaccharide chain containing one (or more) molecule of sialic acid.

However, most of these studies have been conducted in batch reactors, which are not fully applicable to large-scale industrial production. In this investigation an inexpensive laboratory scale continuous flow system was designed and tested for the liquefaction of microalgae produced during wastewater treatment. The system was operated at a range of temperatures (300°C–340°C) and flow rates (3–7mLmin⁻¹), with the feed being delivered using high pressure N2 rather than a mechanical pump. The design incorporated the in-situ collection of solids through a double tube design. The algae was processed at 5wt% and the results were compared to those from a batch reactor operated at equivalent conditions. By combining high heating rates with extended reaction times, the continuous system was able to yield significantly enhanced bio-crude yields compared to the batch system. This demonstrates the need for inexpensive continuous processing in the lab, to aid in scale up decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3abiofuels 3acontinuous systems 3adecision making 3aliquefaction 3amicroalgae 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment1 aLe, Chien D.1 aTing, Valeska P.1 aChuck, Christopher J.0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Oct., v. 165 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016700171520229200338592002802630650001502658650001002673650002802683650001302711650001602724650003102740650003102771650001702802650001302819650001902832650002902851650005202880650001102932650001002943651002102953700002102974700002002995700001903015700001903034700001803053700002103071773013403092856008503226852000903311655001203320IND60672769320221120075829.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067276932DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz037.P15-003-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Sang-Woon10aCirculating Extracellular MicroRNAs in Blood and Saliva Are a New Source of Biomarkers in the Assessment of Health Effects of Traditional Korean Diet (P15-003-19)  aOver the past decades current Korean diet has been rapidly modified to the Western style, which might be responsible for the increased risk of metabolic diseases in Korea, whereas the traditional Korean diet (K-diet) has been reported as metabolically and epigenetically healthy diet. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNAs that affect posttranscriptional regulation and circulating miRs have been regarded as next generation biomarkers of many health conditions. We therefore determined whether extracellular miRs can be useful biomarkers to determine the health effects of K-diet. Ten obese perimenopausal women were recruited and randomly divided into either K-diet group (n = 5) or control diet (a Westernized Korean diet) group (n = 5). Subjects were housed in a metabolic unit like condition for 2 weeks of dietary intervention. Blood and saliva samples were collected before and after the intervention and circulating miRs were extracted using Qiagen miRNeasy kit. After 84 circulating miRs were detected with miScript miRNA PCR Array, miRs with statistical significance were validated with individual RT-PCRs. In the K-diet group significantly down-regulated plasma miRs were hsa-miR126-3p, hsa-miR18a-5p, hsa-miR19b-3p, hsa-miR107, hsa-miR148a-3p, hsa-miR26b-5p, hsa-miR374a-5p and hsa-miR26a-5p, which are known to be associated with type 1 or 2 diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Among them hsa-miR126-3p (P = 0.0158) and hsa-miR26a-5p (P = 0.0348) were validated by RT-PCR. In the control group plasma hsa-miR25-3p was down-regulated and hsa-miR-148a-3p was up-regulated. Only hsa-miR-25-3p (P = 0.0407), which is known to be associated with cardiovascular disease, was validated. In the K diet group 5 saliva miRs, hsa-miR-92-3p , hsa-miR-17-3p, hsa-miR-25b-3p, hsa-miR-122a-5p and hsa-miR-193a-5p, were significantly down-regulated by the array, while only hsa-miR-92-3p (P = 0.0381) and hsa-miR-122a-5p (P = 0.0242) were validated by RT-PCR. In the control group 3 saliva miRs (hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-31-5p and hsa-miR-200a-3p) showed significantly altered expression by the array but not by RT-PCR. Circulating miRs can be a new source of biomarkers to determine the health effects of K-diet.

We developed a high-molecular-mass complex of SSPS cross-linked via phosphate (SSPS-HC; absolute molecular weight = 2850 kg/mol, radius of gyration = 106 nm), and found that it has different protein stabilization properties when compared with the original SSPS (absolute molecular weight = 550 kg/mol, radius of gyration = 36 nm). The objective of this work was not only to study the rheological properties of SSPS-HC, but also clarify its protein-stabilizing properties in comparison with SSPS; if molecular mass or negative charge affected protein dispersion. Irrespective of high-molecular-mass, SSPS-HC possessed similar rheological properties to SSPS such as low viscosity in aqueous solution. The absolute negative charges of SSPS-HC measured by a zeta potential analyzer at pH range of 2.0–7.0 were higher than those of SSPS. Acidified milk drinks prepared with 8.4% non-fat milk solids and 0.4% SSPS-HC or SSPS showed low viscosity and small protein particle size, and did not aggregate for 14 days. The thickness of the hydrated layer, which was formed on the surface of protein particles by SSPS molecules measured after hemicellulase treatment with DLS (dynamic light scattering), was estimated to be about 89 nm for SSPS-HC and 33 nm for SSPS. These numerical values were in good relation to the molecular diameter of SSPS-HC and SSPS in aqueous solution measured by DLS and AFM image, and suggested that protein particles were dispersed and the hydrated monolayer made on the surface of protein particles by SSPS-HC or SSPS molecules prevented aggregation. However, stabilizing pH ranges were different with stability of SSPS-HC at pH range of 4.0–4.8 and stability for SSPS at pH range of 3.6–4.2. In addition to the difference in the molecular mass and absolute negative charge, the phosphate groups of SSPS-HC were possibly influenced on the protein-dispersing property approximately at isoelectric point of milk protein; SSPS-HC prevent aggregation of casein by accelerating solubility of calcium phosphate under acidic conditions as is already reported in the starches phosphorylated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium phosphates 3aaqueous solutions 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3asoy protein 3askim milk 3aviscosity 3asoybeans 3astarch 3abyproducts 3aisoelectric point 3aparticle size 3acasein 3apH 3afunctional properties 3asurface proteins 3asolubility 3aacidified milk 0adairy protein1 aFujii, Nanae1 aTobe, Junko1 aAdachi, Norifumi1 aHirotsuka, Motohiko0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 Oct., v. 29, no. 1 p.75-84dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173520107900311592002801390650002001418650001301438650002001451650001201471650004101483650004301524650001901567650002801586650002901614653002001643653003101663653001301694653001201707653002101719700002401740773011101764856008601875852000901961655001201970IND60679759420221120234123.0200601e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067975942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1219572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTölgyesi, Ádám10aQuantification of aromatic amines derived from azo colorants in textile by ion-pairing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  aAzo dyes can metabolize back to precursor aromatic amines (arylamines), which are potentially carcinogenic. The ISO 14362–1:2017 standard requires the determination of the arylamines, produced from textile samples, preferably by using the gas chromatography mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method. This paper presents an ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method for determining aromatic amines, derived from azo colorants, in both natural and synthetic textiles. The separation enables adequate apparent retention factor (k’ > 2.1 for the most hydrophilic compounds) and has appropriate sensitivity without sample clean-up procedure. The background matrix constituents influence the quantification in even a 100-fold diluted sample, therefore, calibration requires background compensation. The method allows fast confirmation and quantification of twenty-five arylamines in complex matrices of textiles. The method was validated with success and used to both natural and synthetic textile proficiency test (PT) samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3aazo dyes 3acarcinogenicity 3afabrics 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aion pair chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAromatic amines 0aIon-pairing chromatography 0aLC-MS/MS 0aTextile 0aProficiency test1 aSharma, Virender K.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 1137 p.121957-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1219573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011500172300001800287500001900305520206800324592002802392596003402420596005202454596005902506650002502565650002502590650001702615650001802632650001002650650001302660650002002673650001602693650002902709650003102738700001902769700001902788700001602807700003002823700002002853700005902873773014602932856008203078852000903160655001203169IND60715634420221119220221.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-020-10900-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchüller, Andreas,12aA novel fungal gene regulation system based on inducible VPR-dCas9 and nucleosome map-guided sgRNA positioning  ap. 9801-9822.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProgrammable transcriptional regulation is a powerful tool to study gene functions. Current methods to selectively regulate target genes are mainly based on promoter exchange or on overexpressing transcriptional activators. To expand the discovery toolbox, we designed a dCas9-based RNA-guided synthetic transcription activation system for Aspergillus nidulans that uses enzymatically disabled “dead” Cas9 fused to three consecutive activation domains (VPR-dCas9). The dCas9-encoding gene is under the control of an estrogen-responsive promoter to allow induction timing and to avoid possible negative effects by strong constitutive expression of the highly active VPR domains. Especially in silent genomic regions, facultative heterochromatin and strictly positioned nucleosomes can constitute a relevant obstacle to the transcriptional machinery. To avoid this negative impact and to facilitate optimal positioning of RNA-guided VPR-dCas9 to targeted promoters, we have created a genome-wide nucleosome map from actively growing cells and stationary cultures to identify the cognate nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). Based on these maps, different single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and tested for their targeting and activation potential. Our results demonstrate that the system can be used to regulate several genes in parallel and, depending on the VPR-dCas9 positioning, expression can be pushed to very high levels. We have used the system to turn on individual genes within two different biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which are silent under normal growth conditions. This method also opens opportunities to stepwise activate individual genes in a cluster to decipher the correlated biosynthetic pathway. Graphical abstract KEYPOINTS: • An inducible RNA-guided transcriptional regulator based on VPR-dCas9 was established in Aspergillus nidulans. • Genome-wide nucleosome positioning maps were created that facilitate sgRNA positioning. • The system was successfully applied to activate genes within two silent biosynthetic gene clusters.  aPublisher supplied data  aP32790cAustrian Science Fund  aK3-G-2/026-2013cLower Austria Science Fund NFB  aWitschaftskammerpreis 2018cWirtschaftskammer WKO (AT) 3aAspergillus nidulans 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3afungi 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3anucleosomes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aWolansky, Lisa1 aBerger, Harald1 aStudt, Lena1 aGacek-Matthews, Agnieszka1 aSulyok, Michael1 aStrauss, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0474-62670 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 22 p.9801-9822dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10900-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007900173300001800252520124100270592002801511650003401539650002101573650001801594650002501612650002601637650001001663650002401673650001501697650001101712650001801723650001901741650002101760650002401781650001001805650001001815650001801825650001201843653003401855653002601889653001501915653002801930653002301958653002301981700002402004700005802028700001902086700002202105700002502127773011702152856008502269852000902354655001202363IND60528523720221118104038.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052852372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Bradley W.M.10aDevelopment of a subgenomic clone system for Kyasanur Forest disease virus  ap. 1047-1051.  aEmerging tropical viruses pose an increasing threat to public health because social, economic and environmental factors such as global trade and deforestation allow for their migration into previously unexposed populations and ecological niches. Among such viruses, Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) deserves particular recognition because it causes hemorrhagic fever. This work describes the completion of an antiviral testing platform (subgenomic system) for KFDV that could be used to quickly and safely screen compounds capable of inhibiting KFDV replication without the requirement for high containment, as the structural genes have been replaced with a luciferase reporter gene precluding the generation of infectious particles. The coordination of KFDV kinetics with the replication characteristics of the subgenomic system has provided additional insight into the timing of flavivirus replication events, as the genetically engineered KFDV genome began replication as early as 2h post cellular entry. Possession of such antiviral testing platforms by public health agencies should accelerate the testing of antiviral drugs against emerging or recently emerged viruses mitigating the effects of their disease and transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKyasanur Forest disease virus 3aantiviral agents 3adeforestation 3adisease transmission 3aenvironmental factors 3afever 3agenetic engineering 3aluciferase 3aniches 3apublic health 3areporter genes 3astructural genes 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3atrade 3atree diseases 3aviruses 0aKyasanur Forest disease virus 0aTick-borne flavivirus 0aFlavivirus 0aSubgenomic clone system 0aMolecular genetics 0aAntiviral research1 aNikiforuk, Aidan M.1 aCutts, Todd A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7691-56191 aKobasa, Darwyn1 aCourt, Deborah A.1 aTheriault, Steven S.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 5 p.1047-1051dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245014600172300001600318520141500334592002801749650002101777650002701798650002701825650002701852650002601879650002201905650001701927650001901944650001201963650002401975650002101999650001602020700002802036700001602064773009902080856008602179852000902265655001202274IND4468855020221118033335.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446885502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenavides, Sergio10aPhysical, mechanical and antibacterial properties of alginate film: Effect of the crosslinking degree and oregano essential oil concentration  ap. 232-239.  aAlginate films with different degrees of crosslinking obtained by internal gelation, and alginate films incorporated with oregano essential oil (OEO) were prepared. The impact of the degree of crosslinking caused by the use of calcium carbonate as crosslinking agent and the incorporation of OEO into the alginate films on their antibacterial, optical, mechanical, microstructural and water vapour barrier properties was evaluated. An increase in the degree of crosslinking produced alginate films that were significantly thicker (0.031–0.038mm) and stronger (51.9–52.9MPa) but less elastic (2.3%) than those non-crosslinked films (0.029mm; 39.7MPa; 4.4%). The water vapour permeability (WVP) of the films decreased significantly only with the highest level of crosslinking. The incorporation of OEO in alginate films affected significantly their physical properties. Thickness and percent elongation at break of the films were increased by the addition of OEO (0.036–0.042mm and 2.7–3.7%), while the tensile strength and water vapour permeability decreased (31.1–55.5MPa and 2.7–3.0×10⁻⁹g/msPa). Films incorporated with OEO were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) than Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and SalmonellaEnteritidis). A minimum concentration of 1.0% of OEO was necessary to ensure their antibacterial efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acalcium carbonate 3acrosslinking 3aessential oils 3aoregano 3aphysical properties 3atensile strength 3awater vapor1 aVillalobos-Carvajal, R.1 aReyes, J.E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 2 p.232-239dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245008600165300001600251520129400267592002801561650001901589650002101608650002901629650002401658650002201682650001101704653003801715653002601753653002701779653002501806700001401831700001201845773010201857856008701959852000902046655001202055IND60570349120221120142303.0190405e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, H.12aA Multi-region Structural Decomposition Analysis of Global CO2 Emission Intensity  ap. 163-176.  aThis paper studies changes in global and national CO2 emission intensities using the multi-region structural decomposition analysis (SDA) technique. Emission intensities such as the ratio of CO2 emissions to GDP have lately been widely used to characterize national emission performance. Meanwhile the impact of international trade has been found to be important in global emission accounting. It is therefore important to analyze changes in emission intensities by taking trade into consideration. In this study, we first propose two SDA models, one at the global level and the other at the country level, to quantify both the domestic and trade related effects on an intensity indicator. The models are then used to study changes in global and countries' CO2 emission intensities from 2000 to 2009. The results show that sectoral emission efficiency improvement was the main contributor to the slight decrease in global emission intensity during the period, while international trade marginally hampered improvement of global emission intensity. Comparisons of the performance between emerging economies and advanced economies reveal the importance of production structure and final demand structure in emission intensity reduction. The policy implications of the findings are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions factor 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainternational trade 3aissues and policy 3amodels 0aStructural decomposition analysis 0aMulti-region analysis 0aCO2 emission intensity 0aGlobal CO2 emissions1 aAng, B.W.1 aSu, Bin0 tEcological economics.g2017 Dec., v. 142 p.163-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013600162300002000298520183800318592002802156650001502184650001802199650002302217650001602240650001302256650002002269650001202289650001402301650002302315650001302338650001502351653002202366653002202388653001302410653002402423653001502447700001802462700005402480700005502534700005302589773014202642856007902784852000902863655001202872IND60759328520221117222124.0211208e20211129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075932852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c185232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Fangying10aWeak Interaction-Tailored Catalytic Interface of Ultrasmall Gold Nanoclusters as Enzyme Mimics for Enhanced Colorimetric Biosensing  ap. 58209-58219.  aGold nanoclusters (AuNCs) represent an emerging type of engineered nanomaterials with intrinsic enzymatic activity for both chemical and biological applications, but the catalytic activity of most reported AuNCs remains rather limited. Herein, we report a new, efficient strategy of promoting the peroxidase-mimic activity of AuNCs by tailoring their catalytic interfaces via small molecule-mediated weak interactions. Inspired by the presence of imidazole structures in many biocatalytic centers, we screened a series of imidazole-containing small molecules to evaluate their impact on the enzymatic activity of AuNCs. Through monitoring the absorbance change of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, 1-methyl-2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde (MCA) was identified to possess the most significant effect on enhancing the peroxidase-mimic activity of glutathione-stabilized AuNCs (GSH-AuNCs) among all the examined molecules. Interestingly, the enhancement effect of MCA on the catalytic activity of these AuNCs was found to be highly reversible and can be switched on/off by simply adding MCA/dialysis treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations and further experimental analysis confirmed that these MCA molecules were adsorbed on the surface of GSH-AuNCs through weak non-covalent interactions. The underlying mechanism analysis suggested that the presence of MCA can efficiently promote the production of •OH in the GSH-AuNC system. As a proof of example, we then demonstrated that the presence of MCA can greatly increase the bioanalytical performance of AuNC-based peroxidase mimics, as evidenced by a 65-fold lower LOD for glucose detection of AuNCs@MCA than that using AuNCs only. Finally, the present system has been successfully applied for sensing the blood glucose level of both healthy people and diabetics with promising results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3ablood glucose 3acatalytic activity 3acolorimetry 3adialysis 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3aimidazole 3amolecular dynamics 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 0agold nanoclusters 0aperoxidase mimics 0ananozyme 0acatalytic interface 0abiosensing1 aLiang, Yunyan1 aJin, Lihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7553-66491 aShi, Junqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2741-17371 aShang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1575-19340 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 29, v. 13, no. 48 p.58209-58219dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c185233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010200152300002000254520111400274592002801388650001201416650002201428650001501450650002201465650001901487650001701506650002701523650003701550700001501587700001701602700001601619700001501635700001501650700001801665700001601683700001601699700001501715773014401730856007401874852000901948655001201957IND60642580420221119042327.0190507e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064258042DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta03624h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi, Jun10aDefect engineering in atomically-thin bismuth oxychloride towards photocatalytic oxygen evolution  ap. 14144-14151.  aPhotocatalytic solar energy conversion is a clean technology for producing renewable energy sources, but its efficiency is greatly hindered by the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, confined defects in atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets were created to serve as a remarkable platform to explore the relationship between defects and photocatalytic activity. Surface defects can be clearly observed on atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets from scanning transmission electron microscopy images. Theoretical/experimental results suggest that defect engineering increased states of density and narrowed the band gap. With combined effects from defect induced shortened hole migratory paths and creation of coordination-unsaturated active atoms with dangling bonds, defect-rich BiOCl nanosheets displayed 3 and 8 times higher photocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution compared with atomically-thin BiOCl nanosheets and bulk BiOCl, respectively. This successful application of defect engineering will pave a new pathway for improving photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of other materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3aenergy conversion 3ananosheets 3aoxygen production 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar energy 3asustainable technology 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChen, Chao1 aYang, Shi-Ze1 aJi, Mengxia1 aYan, Cheng1 aGu, Kaizhi1 aXia, Jiexiang1 aLi, Huaming1 aLi, Shuzhou1 aLiu, Zheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 July 11, v. 5, no. 27 p.14144-14151dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03624h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008900157300001600246500002000262520088400282592002801166650002701194650002401221650001201245650001801257651001001275700001801285773014301303856007101446852000901517655001201526IND60680221920221120151221.0200104e196811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022192DNAL7 a10.2307/12376322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMellor, John W.10aDeterminants and Development Implications of Foodgrains Prices in India, 1949–1964  ap. 962-974.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA price index for foodgrains in India for the period 1949–1964 is estimated as a function of a set of real demand and supply variables and the money supply. More than 80 percent of the variation in the foodgrain price index is associated with variation in these independent variables. The upward trend in foodgrains prices is associated prmarily with expansion of the money supply. There is little evidence of government foodgrain price policy having affected the trend of relative agricultural prices. The coefficient on the lagged supply‐demand variable suggests that year‐to‐year changes in farmers' storage stocks are an important determinant of foodgrains prices in any one year. The implications of these findings to the relation between agricultural and industrial growth, monetary and fiscal policy, and agricultural price and buffer‐stock policy are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aagricultural prices 3afarmers 3afiscal policy 3aIndia1 aDar, Ashok K.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1968 Nov., v. 50, no. 4 p.962-974dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12376323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245008900183300001800272520148200290592002801772650002501800650002901825650001201854650002101866650001701887650001201904650003301916650001601949650001101965650000901976650003801985650002102023650002902044650002602073650002202099650001702121650004202138651002102180651001102201700002002212700002002232773013602252856004802388852000902436655001202445IND50068073020221121021731.0140228e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006807302DNAL7 a235362752pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1627-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarol, Memet10aDissolved heavy metals in the Tigris River (Turkey): spatial and temporal variations  ap. 6096-6108.  aMultivariate statistical techniques, such as analysis of variance, cluster analysis (CA), correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and factor analysis (FA), were applied to determine the spatial and temporal variations of dissolved heavy metals in the Tigris River at 7 different sites spread over the river stretch of about 500 km during the period of February 2008 to January 2009. The results indicated that Fe, Cr, and Ni were the most abundant elements in the river water, whereas Cd and As were the less abundant. Cu, Fe, Ni, and Zn showed significant spatial variations, reflecting the influence of anthropogenic activities. The lowest total concentration of heavy metals was found at site 2 downstream of the Dicle Dam due to clean water from the dam. The concentrations of most metals were found lower when compared with results of previous studies due to reduction of the activity of the copper mine plant and the construction of two dams on the river. The lowest total concentrations were determined in February due to high precipitation and snow melts. Hierarchical agglomerative CA classified all the sampling sites into three main groups of spatial similarities. Clusters 1 (Maden and Bismil), 2 (Cizre), and 3 (Eğil, Diyarbakır, Batman, and Hasankeyf) corresponded to moderate polluted and relatively low polluted regions, respectively. PCA/FA, CA, and correlation analysis suggest that Cu, Ni, and Zn are controlled by anthropogenic sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acluster analysis 3aheavy metals 3amelting 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariver water 3arivers 3asnow 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHuman Activities 2aMetals, Heavyxchemistry 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aTime Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey1 aGökot, Bülent1 aBekleyen, Aysel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Sept., v. 20, no. 9 p.6096-6108dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1627-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006100173300001600234520163800250592002801888650001601916650001001932650001301942650002101955650001101976650001201987650001801999650002302017650002102040650002002061653000902081653000902090653001102099653000802110653001402118653000802132653001102140653001102151653001102162653000802173653000802181653001302189653001202202653000802214653001002222653001402232653000902246653000802255653000802263653000802271653000902279653001102288653000802299653001002307653002502317700002102342700002202363773008502385856008402470852000902554655001202563IND60552033620221118120645.0161019e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055203362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyd, Nathaniel H.10aPolycomb recruitment at the Class II transactivator gene  ap. 482-491.  aThe Class II Transactivator (CIITA) is the master regulator of Major Histocompatibility Class II (MHC II) genes. Transcription of CIITA through the IFN-γ inducible CIITA promoter IV (CIITA pIV) during activation is characterized by a decrease in trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). While EZH2 is the known catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is present at the inactive CIITA pIV, the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment to mammalian promoters remains unknown. Here we identify two DNA-binding proteins, which interact with and regulate PRC2 recruitment to CIITA pIV. We demonstrate Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and Jumonji domain containing protein 2 (JARID2) are binding partners along with EZH2 in mammalian cells. Upon IFN-γ stimulation, YY1 dissociates from CIITA pIV while JARID2 binding to CIITA pIV increases, suggesting novel roles for these proteins in regulating expression of CIITA pIV. Knockdown of YY1 and JARID2 yields decreased binding of EZH2 and H3K27me3 at CIITA pIV, suggesting important roles for YY1 and JARID2 at CIITA pIV. JARID2 knockdown also results in significantly elevated levels of CIITA mRNA upon IFN-γ stimulation. This study is the first to identify novel roles of YY1 and JARID2 in the epigenetic regulation of the CIITA pIV by recruitment of PRC2.

Chi² (χ²) and Mann–Whitney tests were used for testing statistical significance. The overweight rate was 2 times higher in males than in females (31.7% and 16.0%, respectively). While the obesity was more than 2.5 times higher in females than in males (29.0% and 11.5%, respectively). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that none of the factors studied (sex, age, family socioeconomic level, parent's level of education, number of meals per day, physical activity) was risk factor for obesity in our population, except the behavior of eating in the absence of hunger (OR=4.99; 95% CL: 2.51–9.90; P<0.0001). Overweight and obesity can be considered as factors of over-handicap for this population; hence, the need of a nutritional and physical activity approach must be added to the medical and paramedical care of individuals with DS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDown syndrome 3aeducational status 3ahunger 3anutrition 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3ayouth 3aMorocco 0aOverweight 0aObesity 0aDown syndrome 0aMorocco 0aSurpoids 0aObésité 0aSyndrome de Down 0aMaroc1 aHilali, Mohamed Kamal1 aCherkaoui, Mohamed0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.200-206dElsevier Masson SASaSociété francophone nutrition clinique et métabolisme (SFNCM)wJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2021.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245012000206300001800326500002000344520153200364592002801896596011001924596007702034596009302111650003002204650002302234650002002257650001302277650001502290650001802305650002402323650001302347651001102360700006102371700006302432700006402495700006302559700006202622773012502684856007402809852000902883655001202892IND60773191920221119144353.0220412e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077319192DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.127852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiqueira‐Neto, Marcos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3982-798310aSoybean expansion impacts on soil organic matter in the eastern region of the Maranhão State (Northeastern Brazil)  ap. 1203-1216.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecently, the eastern region of the Maranhão state (Northeastern Brazil) became a hotspot of land‐use change (LUC) directly from native vegetation to soybean cultivation, but due to the soil characteristics, LUC has caused substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen depletion. Therefore, we quantified these impacts arising from two factors: (i) different timeframes after LUC and (ii) contrasting soil management practices. For the first study, soil samples (0–30 cm; six replicates) were taken on soybean fields year one, year eight and 15 years after LUC. It the second study, another area was sampled, of which part was managed under no‐tillage (NT) and the other using a mouldboard plough (MP). For both studies, native vegetation (NV) was sampled as the control. NV stored about 50 Mg of carbon (C) ha⁻¹; but LUC reduced C stocks by 35% (after 8 and 15 years); moreover, labile‐C decreased between 20% and 45%, while, microbial‐C decreased between 20% and 60%, considering the interval between year one and 15 years. Regarding soil management, the MP did not cause differences on C stock (24 Mg C ha⁻¹) in comparison to NT; however, both labile‐C and microbial‐C decreased by 15% to NT, while, decreased by 40% to MP. These results lead us to believe that, since LUC is inevitable, we suggested the adoption of the best agricultural management practices, in order to preserve/increase the SOC, reducing the impacts on GHG emissions and, thus, achieving sustainability and profitability.  aPublisher supplied data  a03572/2016cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Maranhão  a2019/25988‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a88882.328637 /2019‐01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aadministrative management 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aprofitability 3asoil organic carbon 3asoybeans 3aBrazil1 aPopin, Gustavo V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1436-48951 aFerrão, Gregori E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1740-67231 aSantos, Arthur K.

In addition, the catalytic performances of the composite zeolites in the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) reaction were examined. The results indicate that introducing PAM into the synthesis gel of ZSM-5/AlPO4-5 facilitates both the formation of the ZSM-5/AlPO4-5 composite zeolite and the improvement of the catalyst performance. Moreover, the catalyst acidities are closely related to their selectivities for the MTO reaction. The composite zeolite obtained in the PAM hydrogel has a lower density of total acid sites and a higher selectivity for light olefins compared with the composite zeolite prepared without the PAM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkenes 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ahydrogels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyacrylamide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azeolites 0aZSM-5/AlPO4-5 0aComposite zeolite 0aPolymer hydrogel 0aMethanol-to-olefins1 aJiang, Xin-Ge1 aLu, Tian-Liang1 aWang, Bai-Shun1 aXu, Jun1 aZhan, Yu-Zhong1 aWang, Jian-Feng1 aRawal, Aditya1 aZhao, Chuan,d1967-0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Oct., v. 165 p.87-93dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012200168300001600290520125000306592002801556650002401584650001001608650001401618650002201632650001401654650002301668650001701691650002601708650001301734650001401747650001201761650002101773650001101794650003001805650001601835651001001851700002501861700002101886700001701907773013401924856008202058852000902140655001202149IND60588735120221120102737.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1298-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVezzulli, Silvia10aDowny mildew resistance evaluation in 28 grapevine hybrids promising for breeding programs in Trentino region (Italy)  ap. 485-495.  aDowny mildew is a major grapevine disease caused by the biotrophic oomycete, Plasmopara viticola. Numerous disease resistance studies of diverse Vitis germplasm have been previously carried out to identify downy mildew resistance sources; however, ratings were mainly reported using leaf disc in vitro testing and foliage field assessment, or upon leaf and cluster field evaluations. In the current study, 28 grapevine hybrid cultivars were screened using leaf disc bioassay, for disease resistance characterization of both existing and wild-collected materials. 16 hybrids were identified as highly resistant or resistant, and will serve as relevant resistance donors in future pre-breeding and breeding programs. All grapevine hybrids were evaluated for foliar and cluster downy mildew resistance in an untreated field trial over three successive years. This study showed that the leaf disc bioassay provided some information on the resistance level of the genotypes under scrutiny, but it was a weak predictor of their resistance level under field conditions on leaves and even more on bunches. These findings are relevant to future applications in both traditional and marker-assisted breeding programs which promote sustainable viticulture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmopara viticola 3aVitis 3abioassays 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3amarker-assisted selection 3aviticulture 3aItaly1 aVecchione, Antonella1 aStefanini, Marco1 aZulini, Luca0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2018 Feb., v. 150, no. 2 p.485-495dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-017-1298-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245010100159300001800260500002000278520087800298592002801176650001101204650001701215650001801232650002201250650002401272650001201296650001001308650002501318651001701343773014501360856007101505852000901576655001201585IND60680222120221120151317.0200104e196811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068022212DNAL7 a10.2307/12376362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtis, Samuel M.14aThe Use of a Business Game for Teaching Farm Business Analysis to High School and Adult Students  ap. 1025-1033.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn a controlled teaching experiment that involved 25 high school and 8 adult farmer classes, two ways of using a business game for teaching farm business analysis were compared with more traditional instructional methods. A small Pennsylvania dairy farm was simulated. Each of the classes using simulation made five yearly management decisions at weekly intervals. The criterion measures were a subject‐matter and a decision‐ability test. Test results immediately after the course revealed no significant differences among the methods of instruction with high school classes. The adult students who used the simulation in conjunction with a related student resource handbook scored significantly higher on the decision‐ability test. The experiment demontrated that business games can be used to teach farm business analysis at the high school and adult farmer levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aagribusiness 3adairy farming 3aeconomic analysis 3aeducational methods 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahigh school students 3aPennsylvania0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1968 Nov., v. 50, no. 4 p.1025-1033dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12376363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001400278520134900292592002801641650004401669650003701713650002301750650001201773650001201785650001201797650001901809650001401828650001301842650003701855650001901892650001401911650003301925653001201958653000801970653002201978653002902000653002802029700001602057700001402073700001702087700001802104773010602122856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60569151320221118131634.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Dongdong10aChanges of biochar physiochemical structures during tar H2O and CO2 heterogeneous reforming with biochar  ap. 72-79.  aIn order to investigate the detail changes of biochar physiochemical structures during the tar heterogeneous reforming with biochar under H2O and CO2 atmosphere, the experiment was carried out by a two-stage fluidized bed/fixed bed reactor. The physiochemical structures of biochar samples were analyzed by the SEM-EDX, XPS, FTIR and Raman. The results show that during the heterogeneous reforming of biomass tar with biochar, H2O/CO2 not only has a direct effect on the cracking of tar, but also indirectly affects tar H2O/CO2 reforming by changing biochar structures. The tar heterogeneous reforming in H2O atmosphere takes place from the interior of biochar particles to the surface, while it only occurs on biochar surface under CO2 atmosphere. H2O increases the concentration of metal catalysts (mainly K and Ca) on the surface of biochar, while CO2 have little effect on it. Tar is thermally decomposed and reformed on biochar under H2O or CO2 atmosphere, resulting in the increase of hydrocarbon CH. With the concentration of reforming agent increasing, the effect of H2O on the surface oxygen-containing functional groups plays a more dominant role than that of CO2. The increase of H2O/CO2 concentration greatly promotes the transformation of small aromatic ring system to large aromatic ring structure in biochar during tar reforming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acracking 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluidized beds 3apotassium 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aBiochar 0aTar 0aFunctional groups 0aAromatic ring structures 0aHeterogeneous reforming1 aZhao, Yijun1 aZhang, Yu1 aGao, Jianmin1 aSun, Shaozeng0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Oct., v. 165 p.72-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007700163520166000240592002801900650001101928650002601939650002001965650002501985650002202010650001902032650001702051650001602068650002202084651001002106653001702116653002602133653002502159653001902184653002502203700005502228700006002283773011602343856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60679760020221120064945.0200719e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067976002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1265712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Anqi14aThe impact of power-geometry in participatory planning on urban greening  aPublic participation in land-use planning has long been considered beneficial to the urban environment by involving different stakeholders in decision-making. Through participation, the question of how to improve the provision of public Green Space in urban development has been discussed in many research studies, especially in cities undergoing densification; yet the Arnstein gaps between the desired and actual levels of citizen participation, as well as the insufficient green space provision, are problems still apparent, and thus worth deeper investigation. Focusing on power-geometry in participatory planning, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the impact of citizen participation on green-space planning from an agent-based perspective. It introduces a methodology of Pre- and Post-Participation Evaluation through dissecting the participation process, evaluating the outcome and its effects, and illustrating the power-geometry behind the decision-making. A participatory planning case of a new development in Hong Kong is then analysed using the proposed methodology. The results suggest that the Arnstein gap can seldom be filled in cases where there are divergent interests and differentiated power, whereas the prioritization of environmental goals is the key to success in greener planning. The study not only contributes a methodology to connect the participatory process to planning outcomes, but it also demonstrates the useful role played by directional power-geometry. This enhances an understanding of the pathways to improve the effectiveness of participatory planning through collaboration and consensus building.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acitizen participation 3adecision making 3agreen infrastructure 3aland use planning 3aprioritization 3astakeholders 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aChina 0aArnstein gap 0aCitizen participation 0aGreen space planning 0aPower-geometry 0aUrban sustainability1 aChan, Edwin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4841-69561 aChan, Edwin H.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4841-69560 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2020 Feb., v. 48 p.126571-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1265713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014900167300001600316520131800332592002801650650001201678650001201690650002801702650000801730650001101738650002001749650003001769651001801799651001001817653001301827653003001840653002001870653001901890700001701909700002001926700001401946773013201960856008302092852000902175655001202184IND60601176220221120174119.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2014.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoxin10aIntegration of Tibetan Plateau ice-core temperature records and the influence of atmospheric circulation on isotopic signals in the past century  ap. 520-530.  aTemperature signals in ice-core δ¹⁸O on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), particularly in the central and southern parts, continue to be debated because of the large scale of atmospheric circulation. This study presents ten ice-core δ¹⁸O records at an annual resolution, with four (Malan, Muztagata, Guliya, and Dunde) in the northern, three (Puruogangri, Geladaindong, Tanggula) in the central and three (Noijin Kangsang, Dasuopu, East Rongbuk) in the southern TP. Integration shows commonly increasing trends in δ¹⁸O in the past century, featuring the largest one in the northern, a moderate one in the central and the smallest one in the southern TP, which are all consistent with ground-based measurements of temperature. The influence of atmospheric circulation on isotopic signals in the past century was discussed through the analysis of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and of possible connections between sea surface temperature (SST) and the different increasing trends in both ice-core δ¹⁸O and temperature. Particularly, El Niño and the corresponding warm Bay of Bengal (BOB) SST enhance the TP ice-core isotopic enrichment, while La Niña, or corresponding cold BOB SST, causes depletion. This thus suggests a potential for reconstructing the ENSO history from the TP ice-core δ¹⁸O.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aatmospheric circulation 3aice 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3asurface water temperature 3aBay of Bengal 3aChina 0aIce core 0aδ18O temperature records 0aTibetan Plateau 0aENSO influence1 aYao, Tandong1 aJoswiak, Daniel1 aYao, Ping0 tQuaternary research.g2014 May, v. 81, no. 3 p.520-530dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2014.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012000167300001800287520147700305592002801782650002001810650001901830650001401849650002101863650001201884650001101896650001401907650001201921650001501933650001701948650001001965650002601975650002402001650002002025650001102045650001502056700002802071773009802099856004802197852000902245655001202254IND4474993120221120052307.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447499312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-011-9465-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardozo, Gabriela10aPhenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to reproductive strategies in Boa constrictor occidentalis  ap. 1163-1177.  aThe close connection between reproductive ecology and life history in snakes leads to trade-offs between reproductive and other life-history traits. Optimal energy allocation to growth and reproduction is a key factor to determine life history structure. Therefore, elucidating the relationship between body size variations and reproductive characters is essential for a better understanding of life-history plasticity. The aim of this work was to determine to what extent life-history differs among populations of Boa constrictor occidentalis and to identify possible life-history trade-offs between morphological and reproductive traits. We compared two populations from areas that are separated latitudinally, with different climatic conditions and vegetation landscape structure. Reproductive and morphological data of specimens were recorded. Although populations had a similar mean length of mature snakes, the frequency of some size classes tended to be different. Size at sexual maturity differed between populations for females, generating variations in the proportion of mature individuals. Reproductive threshold and follicular size also varied, but female reproductive frequency was similar between populations. Reproductive frequency of males varied between populations although their body condition was similar. We discussed two major issues: (1) implications of size at sexual maturity for body size and fecundity; (2) trade-offs in reproductive characters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoa constrictor 3abody condition 3abody size 3aclimatic factors 3aecology 3aenergy 3afecundity 3afemales 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amales 3aphenotypic plasticity 3areproductive traits 3asexual maturity 3asnakes 3avegetation1 aChiaraviglio, Margarita0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 25, no. 5 p.1163-1177dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-011-9465-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012800212300001400340520134200354592002801696650001401724650001301738650001401751650001201765650001301777650001701790650001101807650001701818650002401835650001101859650001301870650000901883650002601892650001201918650001601930650001301946650002301959650001301982650000901995653002502004653001202029653001602041653001702057653003002074653001802104700001602122700001702138700001602155700001602171700001902187700001202206773010602218856008502324852000902409655001202418IND60569151620221118131658.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrehlneek, E.

In this research the mechanism of zeolites formation and stabilization/migration of heavy metals during hydrothermal process affected by external addition of coal fly ash (CFA), bentonite, and kaolin as silicon-aluminum source, were studied. Tobermorite could be synthesized, attributing to the proper element proportion of Ca/(Si+Al) adjusted by 30% of additives addition. Heavy metals were detected on the surface of tobermorite crystalline. The leaching toxicity of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr in FA were significantly reduced after HT, associated with the transformation into the residue fraction. The decrease of heavy metals in liquid phase and the decrease of leaching toxicity in solid phase were observed, indicating that heavy metals were really stabilized in the treated FA, rather than transferred into liquid. Higher reaction temperature could promote the formation of tobermorite, but increase the leaching toxicity and migration of heavy metals. Addition of 30% of CFA and temperature of 150°C would be the recommended technological parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aaluminum 3abentonite 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoal fly ash 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahot water treatment 3akaolin 3aleaching 3alead 3amunicipal solid waste 3asilicon 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awaste incineration 3azeolites 3azinc 0aHydrothermal process 0aFly ash 0aTobermorite 0aHeavy metals 0aSilicon-aluminum additive 0aStabilization1 aHu, Chunyan1 aZhang, Jinlu1 aLi, Pengfei1 aZhang, Chao1 aWang, Xiaoming1 aMa, Hua0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Oct., v. 165 p.44-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002300155245010700178300001600285520171800301592002802019650003002047650002002077650001402097650001202111650002302123650001702146650002602163650002202189650001502211650001302226650004602239650003602285650004302321650004502364650002302409650003902432650002402471650002802495650003702523650003102560650005702591700002102648700002302669700002002692700002402712700002202736773010302758856003902861852000902900655001202909IND4468645420221120174755.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446864542DNAL7 a217740162pmid7 a10.1002/pca.13422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappiello, Achille10aDetermination of Natural Pyrethrins by Liquid Chromatography‐Electron Ionisation‐Mass Spectrometry  ap. 191-196.  aINTRODUCTION: Pyrethrum extract is a mixture of six insecticidal compounds from the flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium L.. Since they only have low to moderate mammalian toxicity they can be used as natural insecticides in agriculture or to develop low cost and safe dermatological formulations. Because of the thermal instability of pyrethrins, analytical methods based on liquid chromatography (LC) are preferred over those based on gas chromatography (GC). A few applications using LC with mass spectrometry detection are presented in the literature. Current protocols for their characterisation by LC rely on the use of less sophisticated detectors such as UV detection. OBJECTIVE: To develop the first liquid chromatography‐electron ionisation‐mass spectrometry (LC‐EI‐MS) method for pyrethrins detection and quantitation in pyrethrum extracts. METHODOLOGY: A commercial pyrethrum extract and various samples of flower heads from C. cinerariaefolium L. were investigated using reversed‐phase nano‐liquid chromatography coupled to direct electron ionisation‐mass spectrometry (nanoLC‐direct EI‐MS). The eluted compounds were identified through searches of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library, exploiting the direct EI capability to produce high quality EI mass spectra. RESULTS: The method demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD) range: 0.04–0.38 mg/g), linearity (R2 range: 0.9740–0.9983) and precision (RSD% range: 4–13%) for the quantitation of the natural pyrethrins in extracts from C. cinerariaefolium L. CONCLUSION: The nanoLC‐direct EI‐MS technique can be a useful tool for the detection of pyrethrins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTanacetum cinerariifolium 3adetection limit 3adetectors 3aflowers 3agas chromatography 3ainsecticides 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apyrethrins 3atoxicity 2aBiological Productsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aChromatography, Reverse-Phasexmethods 2aChrysanthemum cinerariifoliumxchemistry 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Structure 2aNanotechnologyxmethods 2aPyrethrinsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods1 aTirillini, Bruno1 aFamiglini, Giorgio1 aTrufelli, Helga1 aTermopoli, Veronica1 aFlender, Cornelia0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2012 May, v. 23, no. 3 p.191-196dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.1342  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010900166300001400275520131000289592002801599650001201627650001101639650001401650650001501664650001301679650001501692650001001707650001701717650000901734650001301743650001401756650001201770650001001782650001601792653001201808653002301820653001501843653001401858653002201872653001201894700001701906700001701923700001701940700001501957700002001972773010601992856008502098852000902183655001202192IND60569151720221118131721.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056915172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yahui10aBiomass steam gasification for hydrogen-rich gas production in a decoupled dual loop gasification system  ap. 54-61.  aIn order to improve tar destruction and hydrogen-rich gas production in steam gasification of biomass, a novel decoupled dual loop gasification system (DDLG) has been proposed. In the system, fuel pyrolysis/gasification, tar cracking/reforming and char combustion are decoupled into three reactors correspondingly, i.e. fuel reactor, reformer and combustor. Both the fuel reactor and the reformer are separately interconnected with the combustor, forming two bed material circulation loops, one for fuel pyrolysis/gasification and the other for tar cracking/reforming. In this way, the above-mentioned reactions could be optimized separately under appropriate conditions. With pine sawdust as feedstock and calcined olivine as both solid heat carrier and in-situ tar cracking/reforming catalyst, the steam gasification performance of the system has been investigated. It has been indicated that the configuration of the system provides an effective way to strengthen the tar cracking/reforming reaction for efficient tar removal. Specifically, a product gas with hydrogen concentration of 40.8vol%, tar content as low as 14.1g/Nm³ and dry gas yield of 1.0Nm³/kgdaf was obtained at the fuel reactor temperature 800°C, reformer temperature 850°C, steam to carbon mass ratio 1.2 and circulation ratio 10.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3acracking 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3agasification 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3apyrolysis 3asawdust 3asteam 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aSteam gasification 0aDecoupling 0aDual loop 0aHydrogen-rich gas 0aOlivine1 aXu, Shaoping1 aSong, Yangbo1 aShan, Yiyuan1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Guangyong0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Oct., v. 165 p.54-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012100163300001600284520126200300592002801562650002001590650001901610650001101629650001501640650002201655650002301677650001201700650001001712650001201722650002101734650001201755650002001767650001001787650001301797650001801810650002401828650001001852651001201862653001301874653002101887653001501908653001601923700001901939700001801958773013701976856007802113852000902191655001202200IND60706042220221120211628.0200807e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070604222DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.v37i3.35362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdewale, B.

The low hectarage productivity of 0.3 – 0.5 tonnes/ha from individual farms across Nigeria has poorly supported the national cocoa production. Hybrid cocoa pods have very high breeding value for yield and other economic traits, their use for mass cultivation will increase cocoa productivity. Cocoa seed garden are hectares of established known parental clones of cocoa with an aim of generating hybrid pods through controlled cross pollination. Cocoa Seed garden sites are in fourteen states of Nigeria, Ondo state has the largest cumulative hectarage. By principle, the process of Cocoa Seed Garden entails, selection of parental stocks based on the result from routine test for combining ability among parents within thegermplasm, clonal seedling production of selected parents, patterned field establishment of the parental clones and hand pollination of parents to generate hybrid pods. Details of the principle are well discussed and information on the effective Cocoa Seed garden sites in Nigeria is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3abreeding value 3aclones 3acocoa pods 3across pollination 3adisease resistance 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahybrids 3aopen pollination 3aparents 3apest resistance 3apests 3aplanting 3aseed orchards 3aseedling production 3aseeds 3aNigeria 0aBiclonal 0aClonal seedlings 0aPolyclonal 0aSeed garden1 aAdeigbe, O.

In this study, we quantified and compared the carbon stocks at livestock ranches in Tabasco, Mexico, containing either scattered trees in grazing pastures (STP) or grass monocultures. Sampling plots were randomly established at each ranch where the above‐ and below‐ground carbon stocks, carbon input from litterfall, grass production and arboreal biomass growth were measured. We found that silvopastoral systems stored an average of 257.45 Mg ha⁻¹ of soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to 119.17 Mg SOC ha⁻¹ at grass monoculture ranches (to 30 cm depth); silvopastoral systems also stored 44.64 Mg C ha⁻¹ in wood biomass; and, grass monocultures had greater cumulative grass biomass production. Overall, it is concluded that livestock ranches in Tabasco, Mexico, with scattered trees in grazing pastures stored 58.8% more carbon than those grass monocultures, with carbon stocks of 327.01 Mg C ha⁻¹and 134.47 Mg C ha⁻¹, respectively. The results are useful for land management decision making for sustainable livestock systems framed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3agrasses 3aland management 3alivestock 3aplant litter 3asoil organic carbon 3asustainable development 3atrees 3awood 3awoody biomass 3aMexico1 aVillanueva‐López, Gilberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9200-25531 aAlcudia‐Aguilar, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2334-57251 aMedrano‐Pérez, Ojilve Ramón1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5445-11361 aCámara‐Cabrales, Luisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7843-81581 aMartínez‐Zurimendi, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8031-64481 aCasanova‐Lugo, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2485-91701 aAryal, Deb Raj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4188-30840 tSoil use and management.g2022 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.1237-1249dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.127993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002400163245015200187300001600339520134800355592002801703650002501731650001901756650001101775650001801786650001301804650002401817650001501841650001901856650001601875650002701891650001401918650002601932650002401958650002101982650002202003650000902025650001302034650003902047650002502086650001402111650002502125650001202150650003102162650003202193650002402225650002502249650002502274650005602299650001102355650002302366650003502389650000902424650001702433650002702450650002802477700001902505700001702524700001902541700001702560700002602577700001902603773010702622856004702729852000902776655001202785IND4472956420221120061048.0120503e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447295642DNAL7 a219761432pmid7 a10.1177/07482337114109092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmara, Ibtissem Ben10aDimethoate-induced oxidative damage in erythrocytes of female adult rats: possible protective effect of vitamin E and selenium supplemented to diet  ap. 222-237.  aPesticide hazards have been accentuated by the sharp rise in their agricultural, industrial and domestic use. Acute exposure to pesticides can cause oxidative damage. Our study investigated the potential ability of selenium (Se) and/or vitamin E, used as nutritional supplements, to alleviate erythrocyte oxidative damage induced by dimethoate (DM), an organophosphate pesticide. Female Wistar rats were exposed to DM (0.2g/L–1 of drinking water), DM + Se (0.5 mg/kg of diet), DM + vitamin E (100 mg/kg of diet), or DM + Se + vitamin E. Rats exposed to DM for 30 days showed an increase in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in their erythocytes, while Na+,K+-ATPase and catalase activities, glutathione, non-protein thiol, vitamin E and vitamin C levels decreased. We also noted an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, marker of haemolysis and a decrease in acetylcholinesterase, the principal mode of organophosphorus action. Co-administration of Se or vitamin E to the diet of DM-treated rats ameliorated the biochemical parameters cited above. But the combined effect of Se and vitamin E was more powerful in antagonizing DM-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, our investigation revealed that both Se and vitamin E were useful elements in preventing DM-induced erythrocytes damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aacute exposure 3aadults 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3adietary supplements 3adimethoate 3adrinking water 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemolysis 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amechanism of action 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aselenium 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin E 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aDimethoatextoxicity 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aErythrocytesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSeleniumxpharmacology 2aVitamin Expharmacology1 aSoudani, Nejla1 aHakim, Ahmed1 aBouaziz, Hanen1 aTroudi, Afef1 aZeghal, Khaled Mounir1 aZeghal, Najiba0 tToxicology & industrial health.g2012 Apr., v. 28, no. 3 p.222-237dSAGE Publicationsx0748-23377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0748233711410909  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014900169300001600318520167400334592002802008650001702036650002702053650001702080650001002097650001202107650001402119650001102133650000702144650001502151650001702166650001402183650001702197650001502214653001302229653001002242653001402252653002302266653001502289700002102304700002402325700002802349773011902377856008302496852000902579655001202588IND60570349820221120183437.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuaglieri, Cindy10aUpdated knowledge about pyranoanthocyanins: Impact of oxygen on their contents, and contribution in the winemaking process to overall wine color  ap. 139-149.  aBetter knowledge of wine composition, especially that of anthocyanin-derived pigments, has helped improve wine quality over the years. The use of micro-oxygenation (MOX), which consists in adding low quantities of oxygen at different stages of the winemaking process, contributes to enhancing and stabilizing wine color through the formation of stable pigments called pyranoanthocyanins, while the cycloaddition of anthocyanins requires an oxidation step.This review describes the formation kinetics and the evolution of the concentrations of the various groups of pyranoanthocyanins. Both non-oxygenated and oxygenated varietal red wine samples are compared in order to determine the impact of MOX on pyranoanthocyanin contents.During alcoholic fermentation, the concentration of vitisin A increases due to the availability of pyruvic acid and progressively decreases with aging. Higher contents are found in Port red wines. MOX can enhance the concentrations in dry red wines but the contents remain lower than those found in Port wines. The formation of vitisin B can be promoted by the oxidation of ethanol in acetaldehyde but the results depend on the varietal red wine used. Flavanol-pyranoanthocyanin contents also vary according to wine age, with a reported decreasing concentration during aging for Port and dry red wines. After MOX treatment, their concentrations increase with a more acidic pH and a higher oxygen rate. The increase of the content in pyranoanthocyanins after two years of ageing contributes to stabilize wine colour. Further studies will determine the impact of oxygen on phenyl-pyranoanthocyanins since data are still scarce on the subject.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aethanol 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aport wines 3apyruvic acid 3ared wines 3awine quality 3awinemaking 0aRed wine 0aColor 0aOxidation 0aPyranoanthocyanins 0aWinemaking1 aJourdes, Michael1 aWaffo-Teguo, Pierre1 aTeissedre, Pierre-Louis0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2017 Sept., v. 67 p.139-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017000168300001800338520189100356536011602247592002802363596010902391650002802500650001502528650001002543650001502553650001602568650001902584650001402603650001302617651001002630653002002640653000602660653002002666653000602686653001102692653000602703653001702709653001902726653002202745700001302767700001802780700001402798700001502812700001302827773012702840856008502967852000903052655001203061IND60654123820221118190524.0190722e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065412382DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2019.16151372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jiang10aDietary intake assessment of caramel colours and their processing by-products 4-methylimidazole and 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxy-butylimidazole for the Chinese population  ap. 1009-1019.  aThe aim of the study was to assess the dietary intake of caramel colours and their by-products 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) and 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI) for the Chinese population. Based on the typical and maximum reported use levels of caramel colours in 15 food categories, the dietary intakes of combined and single-class caramel colours of Classes I, III and IV were estimated with the food consumption data from the China National Nutrient and Health Survey. Using the mean values of 4-MEI and THI contents in Class III and Class IV Caramel colour samples, the exposures to 4-MEI and THI from dietary caramel colours were derived. The results showed that the combined and individual average dietary caramel colour intakes for the Chinese population of different age groups were estimated to be 232–60.3 mg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ for combined caramels, 5.9–29.2 mg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ for Class I, 7.7–29.6 mg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ for Class III, 21.2–54.3 mg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ for Class IV, which were far below the group acceptable daily intake (ADI) and respective ADIs. The combined intake of 4-MEI from Class III and IV caramel colours was estimated to be 3.8–5.2 μg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ on average, and 12.9–27.1 μg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ at 95th-97.5th percentile for the general population. The anticipated exposure to THI from Class III caramel colours was estimated to be 0.1–0.3 μg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ on average and 0.5–1.7 μg kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹ at 95th–97.5th percentile for the general population. The dietary caramel colours intakes and the exposures to 4-MEI and THI from dietary caramel colour for the Chinese population were considered to be of low health concern based on the present toxicological data. Soy sauce, vinegar and compound seasonings were found to be the main contributors to the dietary intake of caramel colours.  aThis work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project [grant number 2016M601517].  aPublisher supplied data  a2016M601517cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Projectdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3aacceptable daily intake 3abyproducts 3acolor 3aflavorings 3afood intake 3ahealth surveys 3asoy sauce 3avinegars 3aChina 0aCaramel colours 0a4 0aMethylimidazole 0a2 0aAcetyl 0a4 0atetrahydroxy 0abutylimidazole 0aintake assessment1 aCao, Pei1 aWang, Xiaodan1 aGao, Peng1 aXu, Haibin1 aMa, Ning0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2019 July 3, v. 36, no. 7 p.1009-1019dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2019.16151373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245014900217300001800366506007600384520169100460592002802151506003702179650002302216650001202239650002902251650001602280650001102296650002202307650001902329650000902348650001602357650001302373651001502386653001602401653002502417653001402442653001602456700001802472700002202490700001502512700002302527700002202550700001802572700002602590700002402616700001902640700001802659700002402677700002402701700002102725700002002746773009902766856008602865852000902951655001202960IND60562611520221207063346.0190319e20170313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0802doi7 aPMC53417372pmcid7 a281967152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Ashraful Islam10aSafety of the oral cholera vaccine in pregnancy: Retrospective findings from a subgroup following mass vaccination campaign in Dhaka, Bangladesh  ap. 1538-1543.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPregnant women are vulnerable to complications of cholera. Killed oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are not recommended for pregnant women though there is no evidence of harmful effects during pregnancy. We evaluated the effect of a killed OCV, Shanchol™, on pregnancy outcomes during an effectiveness trial of the vaccine in urban Bangladesh.Individuals ⩾1year were invited to participate in the trial, conducted in 2011 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Pregnancy by history was an exclusion criterion and all women of reproductive age (15–49years) were verbally questioned about pregnancy at enrollment and prior to vaccination. Out of 48,414 women of reproductive age 286 women received the OCV unknowingly while pregnant. Out of these, we could recruit 69 women defined as exposed to OCV. Accordingly, we selected 69 pregnant women randomly from those who did not take the OCV (non-exposed to OCV). We evaluated adverse pregnancy outcome (spontaneous miscarriages, still births, or congenital malformations) between those who were exposed to OCV and those who were not exposed to OCV.About 16% of pregnant women exposed to OCV had pregnancy loss, as compared to 12% of unvaccinated pregnant women (P=0.38). One congenital anomaly was observed and occurred in women non-exposed to OCV group. Models that adjusted for baseline characteristics that were unbalanced between the exposed and non-exposed groups, revealed a no elevation of risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in vaccinees versus non-vaccinees (Adj. OR (95% CI): 0.45 (0.11–1.88).No excess of adverse fetal outcomes associated with receipt of OCV was observed in this study.Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov number NCT01339845.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabortion (animals) 3acholera 3acongenital abnormalities 3afetal death 3amodels 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnant women 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aBangladesh 0aShanchol™ 0aOral cholera vaccine 0aPregnancy 0aVaccination1 aAli, Mohammad1 aChowdhury, Fahima1 aSaha, Amit1 aKhan, Iqbal Ansary1 aKhan, Arifuzzaman1 aAkter, Afroza1 aAsaduzzaman, Muhammad1 aIslam, Md.

Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p<0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrinking 3adry environmental conditions 3aflight 3ainsectivores 3amaneuverability 3anatural resources conservation 3aspecies diversity 3asurface area 0aBats 0aClimate change 0aFlight 0aManeuverability 0aMorphology 0aWater1 aLambert, Connor T.1 aLarsen, Randy T.1 aKnight, Robert N.1 aMcMillan, Brock R.0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Sept., v. 201 p.284-292dElsevier LtdaElsevier Ltd.wJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245005500213300001600268520183500284592002802119650001702147650001302164650001302177650000902190650001802199650001802217650001302235650001402248650001902262650001502281650001802296650001802314650002102332650001202353650002002365650001102385650001602396650001402412653001702426653001802443653002702461653001802488700002202506700002202528700002702550700002202577773010202599856008502701852000902786655001202795IND60609710920221119101445.0181207e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060971092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulo, Bruna Barbon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4604-671210aCoating approach for a Phase Change Material (PCM)  ap. 147-156.  aPCMs (Phase Change Materials) go through volumetric variation during the solid-liquid phase transitions. Encapsulation enables the preservation of their thermal efficiency and prevents adherence on the surface where they are applied. For PCM application, particles with high load are desirable, and the coating in fluidized bed represents a scalable way to protect them. However, this process requires PCMs in solid state and, thus, it is restricted to their phase change temperature. Carnauba wax (CW) has a high enthalpy and relatively high melting point value, which can be a promising organic PCM and desirable to be employed in processes of coating. This work aimed to coat CW particles in fluidized bed. Some strategies were adopted to increase the load of wax in a particle and reduce experimental assays of coating. For this purpose, CW particles were produced by cold extrusion and a preliminary selection of potential substances to be used as coating material (chitosan, Eudragit® L30-D55, gum Arabic, maltodextrin and sodium alginate) was performed based on their rheological and adhesive properties. Adhesive property was evaluated through the contact angle between the CW and the coating materials. Suspensions containing sodium alginate and Eudragit® showed the lowest contact angle (θ ≅ 40°), low viscosity, and could restrain the volumetric variation of CW particles (coating efficiency = 55%) under heating at 100 °C for at least 1 h. Coating solutions/suspensions with contact angle above 57° and high viscosity were not effective to coat the particles. This study allowed a successful coating process of CW particles in fluidized bed, with potential application to other PCMs and, consequently, enlarging the range of thermal responsive textile and construction materials, and food packages.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarnauba wax 3achitosan 3acoatings 3acold 3acontact angle 3aencapsulation 3aenthalpy 3aextrusion 3afluidized beds 3agum arabic 3amaltodextrins 3amelting point 3aphase transition 3apowders 3asodium alginate 3asolids 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aFluidization 0aFluidized bed 0aThermal energy storage 0aEncapsulation1 aAndreola, Kaciane1 aTaranto, Osvaldir1 aFerreira, Almerindo D.1 aPrata, Ana Silvia0 tPowder technology.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 341 p.147-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009700211300002000308520124900328592002801577596003401605650001701639650001901656650001201675650002001687650001001707650001201717650001301729650001101742650001101753650000901764650001201773650001001785650001201795650001401807650001301821650001301834650001301847650001701860700002201877700002401899700001801923700002101941700002601962773015501988856008302143852000902226655001202235IND60794718120221117064507.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079471812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20886-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSquadrone, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1365-725810aTrace and rare earth element bioaccumulation in the spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus stellaris)  ap. 70262-70268.  aMetals (trace elements and rare earth elements, REEs) were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in blood, the liver, the kidney and muscle of ex situ spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus stellaris). The controlled environment in which these elasmobranchs were hosted allowed to assess a baseline level of metals in the different organs since exposure via water and food can be easily monitored. The highest arsenic, chromium, copper, and iron values were found in the liver, cobalt in the kidney, and cadmium and rubidium in muscle. The highest total trace elements content was found in the trend liver (75 mg kg⁻¹) > blood (33 mg kg⁻¹) > muscle (31 mg kg⁻¹) > kidney (10 mg kg⁻¹), while the ΣREEs was the liver (30 μg kg⁻¹) > muscle (15 μg kg⁻¹) > kidney (13 μg kg⁻¹) > blood (4.1 μg kg⁻¹). Between REEs, the most represented element was scandium. Significant differences in the concentration of metals among organs were observed for almost all elements. Nonessential elements were generally lower and essential elements higher in the examined specimens compared to wild elasmobranchs, suggesting a close relationship between a balanced diet and animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data  a15C01cMinistero della Salute 3aScyliorhinus 3aanimal welfare 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3ablood 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adiet 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3apollution 3aresearch 3arubidium 3ascandium 3aspectroscopy1 aBiancani, Barbara1 aDa Rugna, Cristiano1 aFavaro, Livio1 aPederiva, Sabina1 aAbete, Maria Cesarina0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 46 p.70262-70268dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20886-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245013100214300001600345500001500361520150700376592002801883650002201911650001801933650001401951650000901965650001801974650001001992650001602002650001102018650002102029650002002050651001202070651001402082653002102096653002302117653001102140653002402151653003002175653003202205700002502237700002002262773011402282856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60567346220221119165237.0180904e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056734622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakarikov, Arseny A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4389-839710aDescription and phylogenetic affinities of two new species of Nomadolepis (Eucestoda, Hymenolepididae) from Eastern Palearctic  ap. 453-463.  a2019-12-06  aTwo new species of hymenolepidid cestodes belonging to the genus Nomadolepis are described from small mammals in western Siberia and the Far East, Russian Federation. Nomadolepis fareasta n. sp. is described from the striped dwarf hamster Cricetulus barabensis in Amurskaya Oblast' and Nomadolepis shiloi n. sp. is described from the Eurasian harvest mouse Micromys minutus from Novosibirskaya Oblast' and Amurskaya Oblast'. Nomadolepis fareasta n. sp. differs from Nomadolepis merionis, Nomadolepis ellobii and N. shiloi n. sp. in having a substantially longer strobila, longer cirrus-sac and wider ovary. Furthermore, N. fareasta n. sp. can be readily distinguished from its congeners by the arrangement of the testes and the number and size of rostellar hooks. Nomadolepis shiloi n. sp. differs from N. merionis, N. ellobii and N. fareasta n. sp. by the number and length of the rostellar hooks, the presence of irregular transverse anastomoses as well as the length of the cirrus-sac and position of the cirrus-sac in relation to the poral ventral osmoregulatory canal. Morphological differentiation of the two new species from morphologically similar Palearctic species of the related genus Rodentolepis (sensu lato) from rodents is also provided. Phylogenetic affinities of Nomadolepis were studied for the first time using partial sequences of the nuclear ribosomal 28S DNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported the status of Nomadolepis as a separate genus closest to Pararodentolepis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalearctic region 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3amice 3asmall mammals 3agenes 3anew species 3atestes 3aChinese hamsters 3aHymenolepididae 3aSiberia 3aEast Asia 0aNuclear 28S gene 0aPalaearctic region 0aRussia 0aMolecular phylogeny 0aNomadolepis shiloi n. sp. 0aNomadolepis fareasta n. sp.1 aMel'nikova, Yulia A.1 aTkach, Vasyl V.0 tParasitology international.g2015 Oct., v. 64, no. 5 p.453-463dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2015.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015200170300001600322520172000338592002802058650004402086650002202130650003702152650002402189650002202213650001602235650001702251650001902268650001702287650001302304650001902317650000902336650001602345650001402361650001402375650001302389650001902402650001802421650001902439650001402458650001602472650001702488650003702505653001902542653001302561653001302574653000802587653004302595700001702638700001802655700001902673700001402692773009102706856008602797852000902883655001202892IND60590689020221120203706.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059068902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mei-Ling10aLaser-assisted in situ synthesis of graphene-based magnetic-responsive hybrids for multimodal imaging-guided chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy  ap. 433-442.  aMagnetic graphene-based hybrids are being increasing recognized as an effective nanotheranostic agent in biomedicine. Conventional technologies for their synthesis have drawbacks not only from a synthetic standpoint, mainly requiring high temperatures and multi-step processes, but also from a biological perspective, chemical precursors or surfactants involved in the chemical process are toxic to cells. Herein, we report a novel approach for one-step fabricating magnetic graphene hybrid nanocomposites based on laser irradiation of an Fe target in GO-PEG aqueous solution at room temperature without using any other chemical reagent. TEM, XPS, FT-IR, XRD, Mossbauer spectrum and VSM observation reveal that γ-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles were directly grown on the surface of GO-PEG with uniform morphology and superior dispersibility. These GO-PEG-γ-Fe₂O₃ nanocomposites (labeled as GPF) showed low cytotoxicity in vitro compared to chemically synthesized nanoparticles since the pulsed-laser-ablation-in-liquid (PLAL) process is free of toxic agents. After tail vein injection of the nanotheranostics, the tumor was clearly mapped by T₂-weighted magnetic resonance of γ-Fe₂O₃, photothermal imaging of graphene and fluorescence imaging of loaded antitumor DOX. Meanwhile the tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo achieved highly superior inhibition by the synergistic chemo/photothermal therapeutic effect which provided an intense heating effect and enhanced DOX release upon 808 nm NIR light exposure. The results revealed that the magnetic graphene-based hybrids prepared by PLAL is competent for future multi-modal imaging assisted tumor targeted chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acaudal vein 3acytotoxicity 3adispersibility 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3airon 3airradiation 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amedicine 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3asurfactants 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aLaser ablation 0aγ-Fe2O3 0aGraphene 0aMRI 0aChemo/photothermal synergistic therapy1 aGao, Zhi-Wen1 aChen, Xue-Min1 aPang, Shu-Chao1 aZhang, Yi0 tTalanta.g2018 May 15, v. 182 p.433-442dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011400155300001800269520056900287592002800856650001200884650002300896650002300919650000900942700001600951700002800967700001800995700001901013700001801032700002001050700001701070773010501087856007501192852000901267655001201276IND60578831820221119061810.0170814e20140307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057883182DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50013892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Hyewon10aGround-State Elevation Approach To Suppress Side Reactions in Gold-Sensing Systems Based on Alkyne Activation  ap. 1374-1377.  aA novel approach to suppress the side reactions observed in the reaction-based gold-sensing systems based on the alkyne activation is disclosed. By elevating steric strain around the reaction site, the gold ion promoted ring-opening process in rhodamine-lactam probes is significantly accelerated, which also leads to suppression of those possible side reactions. As a result, the probes show very high sensitivity in addition to excellent selectivity toward gold species. Furthermore, bioimaging of gold species in live cells was demonstrated with a FRET version.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3agold1 aJun, Mi Eun1 aRanganathan, Koteeswari1 aLee, Kyung-Ha1 aKim, Kyong-Tai1 aLim, Woocherl1 aRhee, Young

Research aimed at reducing their impact is hindered by a lack of non-subjective, quantitative, tools to measure parasite replication in the host. The time-consuming, and often time-sensitive, nature of existing approaches precludes their use in large-scale genetic, epidemiological, and evolutionary analyses. We have used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to accurately quantify Eimeria tenella in chicken tissue and shown this to be more efficient and sensitive than traditional methodologies. We tested four chicken-specific reference qPCR assays and found beta-actin (actb) to be optimal for sample normalisation. In an experimental setting, chickens were inoculated with 500, 1500, or 4500 E. tenella oocysts and parasite replication and the impact of infection measured by i) qPCR analysis of DNA extracted from caecal tissues collected at five and eight days post-infection (dpi), ii) faecal oocyst counts (FOCs) on samples taken from six to eight dpi, and iii) lesion scoring on caeca collected post-mortem at five and eight dpi. Quantitative real-time PCR test results indicated a significant dose-dependent increase in parasite numbers among study groups for samples collected five dpi (i.e., prior to gametogony) (R²=0.994) (p<0.002) but not in those from day eight (after most oocyst shedding) (R²=0.006) (p>0.379). A strong dose-dependent increase in parasite replication and severity of infection was also revealed by FOC (R²=0.997) and lesion scoring. Importantly, qPCR offers substantial improvements for animal welfare via improved statistical power and reduced group sizes in experimental studies. The described qPCR method overcomes subjective limitations of coproscopic quantification, allows reproducible medium- to high-throughput examination of tissues, faeces, and oocysts, and is a valuable tool for determining the impact of Eimeria infections in both experimental and field settings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEimeria tenella 3aactin 3aanimal welfare 3acecum 3achickens 3adose response 3afeces 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aAvian coccidiosis 0aChicken 0aRAPD-SCAR marker (Tn-E03-1161) 0aCytoplasmic beta-actin gene (actb)1 aTomley, Fiona M.1 aKaiser, Peter K.,1 aBlake, Damer P.0 tParasitology international.g2015 Oct., v. 64, no. 5 p.464-470dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2015.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245005400176300001600230520139300246592002801639650001501667650001301682650002001695650001501715650001201730650001501742650000901757650002201766650001201788650001301800650006201813650004601875650003001921650001501951650002501966650002301991650002302014650001802037650002302055650002402078650005702102650002102159700002502180700002202205700002502227700002302252773010402275856003902379852000902418655001202427IND4468416220221118064817.0120622e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446841622DNAL7 a220254542pmid7 a10.1002/pca.13702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Ana M.10aAnalysis of Cardamonin by Square Wave Voltammetry  ap. 396-399.  aINTRODUCTION: Several biochemical studies have already shown that cardamonin has health promoting properties, such is in agreement with typical characteristics of chalcones. Although being a very promising compound for the nutraceutical field there is a lack of studies concerning its electroanalytical properties. OBJECTIVE: To develop an electroanalytical methodology for the quantification of cardamonin in cardamom. METHODOLOGY: Cardamonin was analysed electrochemically by means of a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) using square wave voltammetry (SWV). It was extracted from cardamom spice and quantified thereafter using the standard additions method to overcome matrix effects. RESULTS: A limit of detection (LOD) of 0.15 mg/L and good linearity (r2 = 0.9998) were obtained. Decoction using ethanol as the extraction solvent appears to be the simplest extraction technique. Spectrophotometric analysis (maximum absorbance peak was found in ethanol at 344 nm with a value of molar extinction coefficient of (2.8 ± 0.1) × 104 L mol−1 cm−1) and mass spectrometry analysis by electrospray in the positive ion mode were also performed. CONCLUSION: Cardamonin was detected voltammetrically. The LOD and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the proposed voltammetric methodology are adequate for trace analysis of this compound in several phytochemical matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acardamom 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aethanol 3aextinction 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 3asolvents 2aChalconesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aChemistry Techniques, Analyticalxmethods 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aElectrodes 2aElettariaxchemistry 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aLimit of Detection 2aLinear Models 2aMercuryxchemistry 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aSpicesxanalysis1 aGonçalves, Luís M.1 aValente, Inês M.1 aRodrigues, José A.,1 aBarros, Aquiles A.0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2012 July, v. 23, no. 4 p.396-399dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.1370  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245008900210300001600299520147800315592002801793650001901821650001801840650002001858650002101878650001301899650001401912650000901926650002601935650001001961651001501971700002401986700002402010773013302034856008302167852000902250655001202259IND60778461120221121065838.0220527e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077846112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-022-10200-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinquist, Bruce A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0750-842710aAssessment of potassium soil balances and availability in high yielding rice systems  ap. 255-271.  aPlant demand for K in rice is comparable to nitrogen. With yields and management practices changing, refining K fertility management and decision-making tools is necessary. Our objectives were to determine (1) how soil K balances affect soil K indices, (2) the best soil test indicator of plant K availability, and (3) the relationships between plant and soil K indices. We assessed soil (plow layer) and flag-leaf samples from 55 commercial rice fields in California. Growers provided historical information on K fertility practices, straw management, and yields to develop a soil K balance. A soil K balance average of − 15 kg K ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (range: − 72 to 47) suggested an increased likelihood of K infertility; however, K balance was not correlated with soil K indices or flag-leaf K. This, plus the potential for K losses and fixation of surplus K, suggests that attempting to build up soil K may not be an effective strategy. Soil K indices were poorly correlated with plant K, but 1 N NH₄OAc-extractable K (Kext) was the best of the K indices tested. Soils that were low in Kext had low clay content, CEC, and K saturation, a high Ca + Mg:K ratio, and showed evidence of K fixation. Soil K varied regionally and may be related to irrigation water and soil parent material. The critical level for Kext (currently 60 mg K kg⁻¹) may need to be revised based on our findings, as there was evidence of K deficiencies above this concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aclay fraction 3adecision making 3airrigation water 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil parent materials 3astraw 3aCalifornia1 aCampbell, Johnny C.1 aSouthard, Randal J.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2022 Apr., v. 122, no. 3 p.255-271dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-022-10200-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008100153300002000234520150200254592002801756650000801784650001501792650001501807650002201822650002001844650002001864650001401884650001301898650001601911650001001927650002501937650002801962650001401990650001302004650002202017650002802039650001602067700002202083773012402105856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60640335820221121030254.0190504e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064033582DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra28102d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ziyi10aDNA photo-cleaving agents in the far-red to near-infrared range – a review  ap. 24617-24634.  aPhotosensitizing agents that oxidatively cleave DNA are important to photodynamic therapy (PDT), an emerging treatment option for patients diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, pre-cancerous conditions such as Barrett's esophagus, and localized cancers that include inoperable neoplasms. Excitation with low energy irradiation activates the PDT agents, causing spatially targeted, oxidative damage to DNA and other macromolecules in diseased cells. While most routinely used PDT photosensitizers rely on visible light sources that emit at wavelengths ≤689 nm, excitation that extends from the far-red into the near-infrared wavelength range is desirable. Due to low absorption by biogenic chromophores, light in this region has a greater penetration depth through tissue when compared to visible irradiation that is higher in energy. In the present review, we describe the development of new, long wavelength DNA photo-oxidizing agents. We have attempted to correlate the structural elements of the photosensitizers with their reported light-induced nuclease activities (λₑₓ ≥ 690 nm). Reaction pathways that lead to DNA cleavage are discussed, including ³O₂ dependent Type I electron transfer and Type II energy transfer processes and anaerobic Type I hydrogen atom abstraction from deoxyribose. The summary discussion contained in this review is intended to contribute to the discovery of new phototherapeutic agents that are activated with far-red to near-infrared light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aabsorption 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme activity 3aesophagus 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3alight 3amacular degeneration 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3awavelengths1 aGrant, Kathryn B.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 6, no. 29 p.24617-24634dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra28102d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04043naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010500175520221600280592002802496650001502524650001402539650002502553650002902578650001602607650001302623650002802636650002902664650001002693650002402703650001802727650000902745650002502754650001102779650000902790650001902799650001602818650001202834650002102846650002302867650002202890650001302912650001602925650002802941650001802969653001602987653002003003653001903023653002403042653002503066700002303091700002603114700002403140700001803164700003303182773010803215856008503323852000903408655001203417IND60768836720221119055948.0220704e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076883672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2022.1096822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavan, Aline Marjana10aInfluence of laying hen-systems and ecologic variables on mites of medical and veterinary importance  aThe search for improvements in the poultry production chain and for increased egg productivity have grown significantly. However, intensive production with or by using of confinement systems negatively affect the welfare of animals and is favoring the appearance of harmful ectoparasites in production. Due to differences in the existing management systems, (e.g. Californian and cage-free systems) and given the importance of the poultry industry in the international market, the aim of the present study was: (1) to compare mite community between SIG (Intensive system – cage: Californian) and SIF (Intensive system – free: cage free); (2) egg-laying systems to analyze how the abundances of the ectoparasites Dermanyssus gallinae, Megninia ginlgymura, and Ornithonyssus sylviarum are affected by these egg-laying models; (3) to evaluate the association between the functional diversity found in traps, organic matter, and feathers in both systems; and finally, (4) to analyze how abiotic factors (e.g. humidity, temperature at sampling) affect mite community composition inside each model. A total of 860,571 mites were sampled, belonging to 59 taxa from six functional groups. Mite composition in the SIF system was different from the SIG system, while their variations in dispersion homogeneity were quite similar to each other. Although taxonomic composition is different between them, they are quite similar when clustered according to functional diversity. The variables 'humidity' and 'temperature' were not determining factors for the appearance of species. The species that most contributed for distinguishing the models were: M. ginlgymura, Dermatophagoides farinae, D. gallinae, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, O. sylviarum, Blattisocius keegani, Glycyphagus sp., Acotyledon sp., and Cheyletus malaccensis, respectively. Dermanyssus gallinae was strongly associated with the Californian model. Two taxa were highly correlated with cloaca, neck, dorsum, and inner wings; variations in relative air humidity also affected M. ginlgymura and O. sylviarum populations. Organic matter had a high abundance of predatory mites with potential for controlling mites of sanitary importance in the poultry chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcotyledon 3aCheyletus 3aDermanyssus gallinae 3aDermatophagoides farinae 3aGlycyphagus 3aMegninia 3aOrnithonyssus sylviarum 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3acages 3acommunity structure 3aectoparasites 3aeggs 3afunctional diversity 3amodels 3aneck 3aorganic matter 3aoviposition 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3apoultry production 3arelative humidity 3ataxonomy 3atemperature 3aveterinary parasitology 3aworld markets 0aCage-system 0aPoultry farming 0aOrganic matter 0aMegninia ginlgymura 0aDermanyssus gallinae1 aSchussler, Matheus1 aSilva, Flávio Renato1 aFerla, Noeli Juarez1 aJohann, Liana1 aSilva, Guilherme Liberato da0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2022 Apr., v. 304 p.109682-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2022.1096823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165300002000260500001100280520130300291592002801594650002301622650002401645650005201669650001401721650001901735650001401754650001301768650001401781650001401795650001301809650001201822700002601834700001701860700001801877700002001895700001801915700002001933700001701953700002301970700006501993773015502058856008302213852000902296655001202305IND60794718820221117064348.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079471882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-22333-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghar, Asma10aSARS-COV-2/COVID-19: scenario, epidemiology, adaptive mutations, and environmental factors  ap. 69117-69136.  aReview  aThe coronavirus pandemic of 2019 has already exerted an enormous impact. For over a year, the worldwide pandemic has ravaged the whole globe, with approximately 250 million verified human infection cases and a mortality rate surpassing 4 million. While the genetic makeup of the related pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, many unknown facets remain a mystery, comprising the virus’s origin and evolutionary trend. There were many rumors that SARS-CoV-2 was human-borne and its evolution was predicted many years ago, but scientific investigation proved them wrong and concluded that bats might be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins act as intermediary species to transmit the virus from bats to humans. Airborne droplets were found to be the leading cause of human-to-human transmission of this virus, but later studies showed that contaminated surfaces and other environmental factors are also involved in its transmission. The evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 variants worsens the condition and has become a challenge to overcome this pandemic. The emergence of COVID-19 is still a mystery, and scientists are unable to explain the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2. This review sheds light on the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2, its transmission, and the key factors that worsen the situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aPholidota (mammals) 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aevolution 3ahuman diseases 3amortality 3apandemic 3apathogens 3apollution 3aresearch 3aviruses1 aImran, Hafiz Muhammad1 aBano, Naheed1 aMaalik, Sadia1 aMushtaq, Sajida1 aHussain, Asim1 aVarjani, Sunita1 aAleya, Lotfi1 aIqbal, Hafiz M.

Whereas considerable research has been directed to overlapping rights on customary land, there is limited research on the solutions to overlapping land rights between registered landowners and unregistered occupants. The Mailo tenure in Uganda, which is a case of a century-old impasse between registered owners on one hand and legally recognized unregistered occupants on the other hand, has resisted both political and legislative-based solutions. Yet Mailo tenure accounts for about 20 % of Uganda’s land, including the capital city, major influential towns and high value land.In this paper, we introduce and evaluate the Land Inventory Approach, which is a step by step approach to documentation and formalization of occupancy rights on registered land, with acceptance of landlords and tenants, while maintaining harmony within the community and the political environment. The approach is specifically designed for the Mailo tenure and other similar tenure systems where overlapping land rights are shared between registered owners and legally protected unregistered occupants. The land inventory approach was initiated by GIZ under the Improvement of Land Governance in Uganda (ILGU) project co-funded by the European Union (EU) and the German Government, as part of the Global Program "Responsible Land Policy" for the Special Initiative "One World, No Hunger" (SEWOH) of the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). After more than one year of piloting, an assessment was undertaken to review the suitability of the approach to addressing overlapping rights impasse between landlords and tenants on Mailo tenure. The assessment was based on four guiding questions, namely whether the approach: (i) improves the relationship between landlords and tenants, (ii) addresses all land related disputes on Mailo tenure, (iii) provides adequate information for negotiations between landlords and tenants, and (iv) provides an appropriate Fit-For-Purpose (FFP) technological as well as operational/procedural solution.Findings indicate that overall, the approach significantly improved the relationship between landlords and tenants in the areas where the project was successfully piloted. The approach provides the necessary information, such as location and size of tenancies, use of tenancy portions, claims to usufruct rights and proportion of the landlords’ occupied and unoccupied land, which helps further negotiations. The collected information will, if included in the National Land Information System, not only improve transparency in land administration but will also increase the menu of negotiation options and hence empower both the landlords and tenants to reach consensus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3agovernance 3ainformation systems 3ainventories 3aland improvement 3aland productivity 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3alandowners 3apolitics 3atowns 3aUganda 0aPrivate Mailo 0aLand inventory 0aOverlapping land rights 0aOccupancy rights 0aFit-For-Purpose 0aUganda1 aHuber, Thorsten1 aKirumira, Daniel1 aDrate, Pamella0 tLand use policy.g2021 Nov., v. 110 p.104562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1045623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011500174300001600289520174700305592002802052650001902080650002302099650001902122650001202141650001102153650001502164650001402179650001002193650002702203650001902230650001202249650002102261650001202282650002502294650001302319650002502332650001802357650001302375650001202388650001002400650001902410650001502429651001102444700007002455700006202525700006602587700006202653700006102715700006202776700006702838773013302905856008303038852000903121655001203130IND60778461620221121065904.0220527e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077846162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-022-10207-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuimarães, Bianca C.10aEmissions of N2O and NH3 from cattle excreta in grass pastures fertilized with N or mixed with a forage legume  ap. 325-346.  aPasture is the major livestock production system in Brazil, and nitrogen (N) excretion by cattle has been identified as an important source of nitrous oxide (N₂O) and ammonia (NH₃). This study assessed long-term N₂O and NH₃ emissions from cattle urine and dung deposited on three pasture systems: (1) palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) monoculture without N-fertilizer (GRASS); (2) palisadegrass monoculture fertilized with 150 kg N ha⁻¹ (GRASS + N); (3) palisadegrass mixed with Arachis pintoi without N-fertilizer application (GRASS + LEGUME). Two trials were carried out, one beginning in the dry season and the other in the rainy season. Urine N₂O emission factors (EFN₂O) were the lowest for the GRASS pasture (0.41% vs. 0.56 and 0.62% for the GRASS + N and GRASS + LEGUME pastures, respectively). There was a tendency of lower EFN₂O in for dung from cattle grazing the GRASS + LEGUME pasture (0.11% vs. 0.20% for the GRASS and GRASS + N pastures; P < 0.10). Excreta-N lost by NH₃ volatilization (EFNH₃) was highest for urine under GRASS + N pasture (12.6% vs. 5.9 and 4.7% for the GRASS + LEGUME and GRASS pastures, respectively). These figures are within the ranges reported in the IPCC 2019 guidelines but consistently in the lower range, probably due to the tropical climate. The lowest urine EFN₂O estimated for the GRASS pasture showed that N fertilization increased N₂O emissions from urine patches.

To suggest management options, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of diversity, structure, biomass and carbon stock of woodland vegetation. In this study we used data from three sites in the Miombo woodlands of western Zambia, which are subject to low, medium and high land-use intensity. We sampled 20 plots of 1 000 m² at each of these sites. Woody vegetation was sampled for richness and structure to provide an understanding of the impact of land-use intensity. Woody plant species richness was not affected by land-use intensity. However, an ANOVA revealed that stem diameter at breast height (DBH) was higher at the low land-use intensity (national park) than at medium and high land-use intensities (selective timber harvest, and non-selective harvest for crop fields and timber). We tested three different allometric equations (one global and two regionally adapted) to determine woody aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock at the three sites. The estimated AGB using the regionally adapted allometric equation of Ryan et al. and the global tropical equation of Brown et al. revealed that the AGB for low and high land-use intensity sites were significantly different from each other with the medium land-use intensity site being intermediate. We concluded that DBH and AGB estimations were influenced by the land-use intensity in the Miombo woodlands as suggested by other studies in the tropical forest and woodlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachystegia 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbon sinks 3aequations 3afuels 3aland use 3anational parks 3aspecies richness 3atree and stand measurements 3atropical forests 3awoodlands 3awoody plants 3aZambia 0acarbon stock of woodlands 0aselective tree harvesting 0atree density 0awoody species richness1 aSchmiedel, Ute1 aOldeland, Jens1 aJürgens, Norbert,0 tSouthern forests.g2019 July 3, v. 81, no. 3 p.213-221dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000154x2070-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/20702620.2018.15559433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011800199300001800317500001900335500002000354520163000374592002802004650002102032650001502053650001402068650001402082650001102096650002902107650002302136650001902159650001302178700001702191700001902208700002502227773013202252856007302384852000902457655001202466IND60709255520221120080016.0200904e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070925552DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.138542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenmahdi, Fatiha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6036-086613aAn experimental study of dispersion of an interactive tracer in chemically heterogeneous medium at a column scale  ap. 3932-3940.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper aims at examining the increase of phenol adsorption breakthrough curves spreading caused by the chemical heterogeneity of granular activated carbon fixed beds. The local and the thermodynamic equilibrium assumption, as well as the nonlinear adsorption obeying to Langmuir isotherm, are considered. This study particularly tempts to link the reduced variance of phenol breakthrough curves to a measurable quantifying parameter of the chemical heterogeneity. The investigated artificial heterogeneous media are prepared by alternating layers of two types of granular activated carbon, active and non‐active ones, that have similar physical properties. On the one hand, the chemical heterogeneity is quantified by the active layer relative thickness of the column length, l₁/L. On the other hand, it is quantified by the mean value of the probability distribution γ. The latter also represents the mean active grains mass ratio of the total medium mass, hence the medium mean capacity. The obtained results show an increase in the reduced variance and thus the effective global dispersion with the heterogeneity; the increase is as important as the medium capacity decreases. However, the dispersion increase achieves a limit value, even when the heterogeneity increases. The results are statistically modelled using a regression equation function of the capacity variation in terms of γ and the chemical heterogeneity in terms of l₁/L. The relationship combining the medium capacity and the chemical heterogeneity is obtained. The relationship implicitly takes into account the effect of the column length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aequations 3ahydrology 3aphenol 3aprobability distribution 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3avariance1 aSemra, Safia1 aKolli, Mounira1 aBouhelassa, Mohammed0 tHydrological processes.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 34, no. 20 p.3932-3940dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.138543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008800165300001600253520217900269592002802448650001102476650001302487650002702500650001302527650001302540650001902553650001102572650001902583650001902602700001702621700001802638700001802656700001902674773012202693856004802815852000902863655001202872IND50070479920221116142631.0131108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007047992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-013-0539-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinyan10aEffects of shear force on formation and properties of anoxic granular sludge in SBR  ap. 896-905.  aThis paper reports the effects of shear force on anoxic granular sludge in sequencing batch reactors (SBR). The study was carried out in two SBRs (SBR1 and SBR2) in which sodium acetate (200 mg COD·L⁻¹) was used as the sole substrate and sodium nitrate (40 mgNO₃-N·L⁻¹) was employed as the electron acceptor. The preliminary objective of this study was to cultivate anoxic granules in the SBR in order to investigate the effects of shear force on the formation of anoxic granular sludge and to compare the properties of anoxic sludge in the SBR. This study reports new results for the values of average velocity gradient, a measure of the applied shear force, which was varied in the two SBRs (3.79 s⁻¹ and 9.76 s⁻¹ for SBR1 and SBR2 respectively). The important findings of this research highlight the dual effects of shear force on anoxic granules. A low shear force can produce large anoxic granules with high activity and poor settling ability, whereas higher shear forces produce smaller granules with better settling ability and lower activity. The results of this study show that the anoxic granulation is closely related to the strength of the shear force. For high shear force, this research demonstrated that: 1) granules with smaller diameters, high density and good settling ability were formed in the reactor, and 2) granular sludge formed faster than it did in the low shear force reactor (41days versus 76 days). Once a steady-state has been achieved, the nitrate and COD removal rates were found to be 98% and 80%, respectively. For low shear force, such as was applied in SBR1, this research demonstrated that: 1) the activity of anoxic granular sludge in low shear force was higher than that in high shear force, 2) higher amount of soluble microbial products (SMPs) were produced, and 3) large pores were observed inside the larger granules, which are beneficial for nitrogen gas diffusion. Electron microscopic examination of the anoxic granules in both reactors showed that the morphology of the granules was ellipsoidal with a clear outline. Coccus and rod-shaped bacteria were wrapped by filamentous bacteria on the surface of granule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccus 3abacteria 3achemical oxygen demand 3agranules 3anitrogen 3ashear strength 3asludge 3asodium acetate 3asodium nitrate1 aWang, Binbin1 aHan, Qingqing1 aZhao, Hongmei1 aPeng, Dangcong0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2013 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.896-905dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-013-0539-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170300001600257520144900273592002801722650002101750650001201771650001701783650002101800650000901821650001801830650001101848650002101859650001901880653002201899653002901921653001401950653001901964700002801983700002102011700002302032700002302055700002702078700001802105700002302123700001902146773009202165856008602257852000902343655001202352IND60590689720221120203405.0190129e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059068972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattio, Elodie10a3D-printed lab-on-valve for fluorescent determination of cadmium and lead in water  ap. 201-208.  aIn recent years, the development of 3D printing in flow analysis has allowed the creation of new systems with various applications. Up to now, 3D printing was mainly used for the manufacture of small units such as flow detection cells, preconcentration units or mixing systems. In the present study, a new 3D printed lab-on-valve system was developed to selectively quantify lead and cadmium in water. Different technologies were compared for lab-on-valve 3D printing. Printed test units have shown that stereolithography or digital light processing are satisfactory techniques for creating complex lab-on-valve units. The lab-on-valve system was composed of two columns, eight peripheral ports and a central port, and a coil integrating baffles to increase mixing possibilities. A selective extraction of lead was first carried out by TrisKem Pb™ Resin column. Then, cadmium not retained on the first column was extracted on a second column of Amberlite® IR 120 resin. In a following step, lead and cadmium were eluted with ammonium oxalate and potassium iodide, respectively. Finally, the two metals were sequentially detected by the same Rhod-5N™ fluorescent reagent. This 3D printed lab-on-valve flow system allowed us to quantify lead and cadmium with a linear response from 0.2 to 15 µg L−1 and detection limits of 0.17 and 0.20 µg L−1 for lead and cadmium, respectively, which seems adapted for natural water analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium oxalate 3acadmium 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3alead 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3apotassium iodide 3awater analysis 0aStereolithography 0aDigital light processing 0aLOV-MSFIA 0aNatural waters1 aRobert-Peillard, Fabien1 aVassalo, Laurent1 aBranger, Catherine1 aMargaillan, André1 aBrach-Papa, Christophe1 aKnoery, Joël1 aBoudenne, Jean-Luc1 aCoulomb, Bruno0 tTalanta.g2018 June 01, v. 183 p.201-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.02.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011000166500001900276500002000295520136000315592002801675650001401703650001501717650001301732650001101745650001301756650001101769650001101780650001501791650001601806650002201822700002001844700001901864700001501883700002601898700002001924773015401944856007802098852000902176655001202185IND60709255620221120075912.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070925562DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2020001362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Behnam10aInfluence of Methanol on Prion Reduction during High Temperature and High Pressure Oleochemical Processes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrion‐reduction in standard biodiesel processes is caused by acidic and alkaline conditions. In the alternative RepCat biodiesel process, efficient prion‐reduction can be achieved by high‐temperature/pressure. However, a possible increase in thermostability of prions in the presence of methanol during these conditions has not previously been investigated, and is verified in this work. Samples are spiked with prions, treated with methanol, and incubated at 220 °C at 80 bar for 30 min. No traces of protease‐resistant prion protein (as proxy for prions) are detected in tallow or glycerine (as the final by‐product) after treatment. Serial dilutions of spiked prions show at least 6 log₁₀ prion reduction. More importantly, similar effects are detected using milder conditions of 200 °C at 70 bar for 15 min, representing the worst‐case conditions of the process. In conclusion, this study shows that methanol does not increase the thermostability of prions and the RepCat process can efficiently eliminate prions and is therefore safe for the usage of category 1 tallow. Practical Applications: The study further supports the applicability of RepCat process in reducing prion‐contamination in the presence of methanol. Furthermore, the conditions leads to a considerable reduction of prions in glycerine obtained as by‐product.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abyproducts 3aglycerol 3alipids 3amethanol 3aprions 3atallow 3atechnology 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aRaudner, Robert1 aShafiq, Mohsin1 aAhn, Edgar1 aAltmeppen, Hermann C.1 aGlatzel, Markus0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2020 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.e2000136-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2020001363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169520213400304592002802438650001902466650001802485650002202503650003002525650001202555650002002567650002302587650002102610650000902631650001102640650001402651650001102665650001902676650000902695650002202704650001802726651001102744700002602755700003302781700002002814700002402834700003202858700002502890700002002915700001702935700002102952773012902973856008603102852000903188655001203197IND60754294520221119221705.0211023e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429452DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRostami, Ali 10aSeroprevalence Estimates of Latent and Acute Toxoplasma Infections in HIV+ People—Call for Action in Underprivileged Communities  aWe undertook a comprehensive, systematic review of observational studies to estimate respective seroprevalences of latent and acute Toxoplasma gondii infections in HIV⁺ people at the global, regional and country levels; related seroprevalence to socio-economic variables and CD4+ cell counts; and assessed temporal changes in prevalence and risk factors for this group. We systematically searched international databases for seroepidemiological surveys between 1 January 1980 and 31 July 2020. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled seroprevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and estimated the numbers of HIV⁺ people inferred to harbour latent and acute T. gondii infections (LT or AT). We grouped seroprevalence data according to the geographic regions defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and conducted subgroup and meta-regression analyses of the data. Of a total of 4024 studies identified, 150 and 65 of them met the inclusion criteria for LT and AT in HIV⁺ people, respectively. The overall, pooled seroprevalences of LT and AT were 37.4% (95% CI, 33.4–41.4) and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.9–1.8%), equating to ~14.2 and 0.5 million HIV⁺ people, respectively. Most HIV⁺ people with T. gondii infections originated from Africa, and the highest seroprevalences were in low-income countries with low human development indices. Significant risk factors for toxoplasmosis in HIV⁺ patients included the consumption of raw/undercooked meat, frequent contact with soil, a low CD4+ T lymphocyte number (<200 cells per μL) and age. Overall, the finding of high seroprevalences of particularly latent T. gondii infection in HIV⁺ people in underprivileged regions of the world, such as parts of Africa, calls for preventative action. Programs that include routine serological monitoring, counselling, care, animal control and/or prophylactic treatment measures are needed to prevent severe toxoplasmosis from developing in people living with HIV infection. Our study highlights the potential importance of parasite chemoprophylaxis in resource-poor settings, particularly in low-income countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimals 3achemoprevention 3adisease prevention 3alymphocyte count 3ameat 3amodels 3aparasites 3apeople 3aseroprevalence 3asoil 3asystematic review 3atoxoplasmosis 3aAfrica1 aRiahi, Seyed Mohammad1 aAbdollahzadeh Sagha, Shayan 1 aTaghipour, Ali 1 aSepidarkish, Mahdi 1 aMohammadnia-Afrouzi, Mousa 1 aEbrahimpour, Soheil 1 aHotez, Peter J.1 aGamble, Ray 1 aGasser, Robin B.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245008100173300001600254520119200270592002801462650001901490650001801509650001101527650001501538650001501553650001901568650000901587650002001596650001701616650001201633651001901645653002601664653002501690653002301715653002201738653002301760700002101783700002101804773009501825856008901920852000902009655001202018IND60562612420221120043851.0190319e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056261242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Jonathan10aDiscourse and practice of participatory flood risk management in Belfast, UK  ap. 408-417.  aThe introduction of the Floods Directive signals a move from flood protection towards flood risk management in the European Union. Public participation is highlighted in the Floods Directive as being instrumental to effective implementation of this new approach. This study utilised document analysis, non-participant observation, a questionnaire survey, and interviews to evaluate the discourse and practice of participation in the implementation of the Floods Directive in Belfast, United Kingdom. Flood risk management processes in Belfast are found to be high on participatory rhetoric but low on meaningful engagement. The participatory process is lacking in transparency, does not encourage the active participation of interested parties and has not been clearly communicated to key publics. Opportunities to increase meaningful public participation in the process remain underutilised, and the establishment of local flood forums has provided little opportunity for meaningful engagement. Some actions of governance agencies could be best characterised as facilitating the responsibilisation of risk and are designed to manage risk to agencies rather than address flooding issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aflood control 3afloods 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFlood risk management 0aPublic participation 0aResponsibilisation 0aPublic engagement 0aRisk communication1 aFlannery, Wesley1 aRevez, Alexandra0 tLand use policy.g2017 Apr., v. 63 p.408-417dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014600169500001900315500002000334520112800354592002801482596013401510650001501644650002001659650001101679650001501690650001401705650001501719650001401734650001401748650001401762650002701776650001501803700002201818700002101840700001801861773015401879856007802033852000902111655001202120IND60709255820221120075933.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070925582DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2020001342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgeois, Christine10aCanola Proteins Used as Co‐Emulsifiers with Phospholipids Influence Oil Oxidability, Enzymatic Lipolysis, and Fatty Acid Absorption in Rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study is to formulate and characterize oil‐in‐water emulsions with plant‐derived ingredients only, that is, proteins extracted from canola oil bodies, used as co‐emulsifiers with a canola lecithin, and to assess their suitability for food applications. Using the protein extract increases the chemical stability of rapeseed oil emulsions toward oxidation, based on the delay in conjugated diene formation under accelerated storage conditions, and favors pancreatic lipase activity. Bioaccessibility of rapeseed fatty acids is compared in lymph‐duct‐cannulated rats fed oil or emulsion. Fatty acid absorption by the intestine is increased by 78% when the oil is emulsified with canola proteins as co‐emulsifier: 28.7 mg mL⁻¹ versus 16.1 mg mL⁻¹ for oil (p < 0.05). In vitro lipolysis results are in overall agreement with fatty acid absorption in vivo. Practical Applications: Results obtained for rapeseed oil emulsified with canola proteins and phospholipids suggest that increased bioaccessibility of n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be offered in vegan food products.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acanola 3acanola oil 3aemulsions 3aintestines 3alecithins 3alipolysis 3aoxidation 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3avegan diet1 aCouëdelo, Leslie1 aSubirade, Muriel1 aCansell, Maud0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2020 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.e2000134-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2020001343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001800292520144300310592002801753650001301781650001301794650002101807650000901828650001101837650001901848653001701867653002401884653002301908653002001931653002201951653002501973700002001998700001902018700001802037773010802055856008602163852000902249655001202258IND60532098820221121043951.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053209882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ye-Chen12aA general analytical model for pumping tests in radial finite two-zone confined aquifers with Robin-type outer boundary  ap. 1162-1175.  aThis study develops a general analytical model for describing transient drawdown distribution induced by pumping at a finite-radius well in a radial two-zone confined aquifer of finite areal extent with Robin-type condition at both inner and outer boundaries. This model is also applicable to heat conduction problems for a composite hollow cylinder on the basis of the analogy between heat flow and groundwater flow. The time-domain solution of the model is derived by the methods of Laplace transform, Bromwich integral, and residue theorem. This new solution can reduce to the solution for constant-head test (CHT) or constant-rate test (CRT) problem by specifying appropriate coefficients at the Robin inner boundary condition. The solution describing the flow rate across the wellbore due to CHT is further developed by applying Darcy’s law to the new solution. In addition, steady-state solutions for both CHT and CRT are also developed based on the approximation for Bessel functions with very small argument values. Many existing solutions for transient flow in homogeneous or two-zone finite aquifers with Dirichlet or no-flow condition at the outer boundary are shown to be special cases of the present solution. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is also performed to investigate the behaviors of the wellbore flow due to CHT and the aquifer drawdown induced by CRT in response to the change in each of aquifer parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrawdown 3agroundwater flow 3aheat 3amodels 3atransient flow 0aAquifer test 0aAnalytical solution 0aLaplace transforms 0aResidue theorem 0aComposite aquifer 0aSensitivity analysis1 aYang, Shaw-Yang1 aFen, Chiu-Shia1 aYeh, Hund-Der0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 Sept., v. 540 p.1162-1175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012300166520082100289592002801110650002901138650002501167650001001192650001601202650002001218650001701238650000901255650001301264650001101277650001301288650001901301650001401320650001701334653002001351653001901371653001701390653001701407700001401424700001601438700001601454700001701470700001401487700005601501773010801557856008601665852000901751655001201760IND60673918420221122030230.0191227e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067391842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1154792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Chunbo10aHyaluronic acid-based levofloxacin nanomicelles for nitric oxide-triggered drug delivery to treat bacterial infections  aAntibiotics are powerful weapons to fight against bacterial infections, while most of them lack of selective targeting towards pathological site which could restrict their antibacterial efficacy. To overcome this challenge, an antimicrobial levofloxacin(LF)was conjugated onto hyaluronic acid (HA) moieties via an o-phenylenediamine linker to prepare a NO-sensitive nanosystem (HA-NO-LF) in this study. The HA-NO-LF nanomicelles could enter host cells via a CD44 mediated endocytosis and release drug gradually upon exposure to endogenous NO. Furthermore, the more promising therapeutic effect of the nanomicelles in ameliorating inflammatory levels was observed in a mouse pneumonia model than that of LF. These results suggest that the HA-NO-LF nanomicelles may exert potent curative effect in infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial infections 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3ahyaluronic acid 3alevofloxacin 3amice 3amicelles 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananotechnology 3apneumonia 3atherapeutics 0aHyaluronic acid 0aNO-sensitivity 0aNanomicelles 0aDrug release1 aXiao, Yao1 aLiu, Yinyin1 aSun, Feifei1 aQiu, Yuanhao1 aMu, Haibo1 aDuan, Jinyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8488-31590 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 229 p.115479-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1154793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01401naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013600157300001800293520039600311592002800707650001300735650002300748650002800771650001200799650001400811650001600825700001600841700001400857700001500871773010500886856007500991852000901066655001201075IND60578832820221119062135.0170814e20140307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057883282DNAL7 a10.1021/ol500202q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Wen-Ming13aAn Efficient Synthesis of Novel Fused Cycloheptatrienes through Mn(II)-Mediated Formal Intermolecular [2 + 2 + 2 + 1] Cycloaddition  ap. 1286-1289.  aA new method for manganous acetate tetrahydrate mediated formal intermolecular [2 + 2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition was developed for the synthesis of fused cycloheptatriene derivatives from N-(acylmethyl)pyridinium iodides and naphthoquinone.

Loss and degradation of farmland habitats are an important contributor to the continued decline of biodiversity. Despite this, little information is available regarding the diversity and ecological condition of farmland habitats in Europe. Indeed, where habitat data are available, this is usually at a very broad landscape scale rather than farm scale. Coupled with this, strategies to increase agricultural output in response to growing global population, will likely place increasing pressure on farmland biodiversity. Knowledge and ongoing monitoring of farmland habitat type and extent is a prerequisite for the future protection of much of Europe’s biodiversity. Here we report the findings of a national scale survey of farmland habitat diversity in Ireland.Detailed surveys of farm habitats and management practices (system, stocking rate agri-environment scheme participation status and organic N and P inputs) were undertaken on 118 farms in three regions of the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Recorded farm habitats were subsequently digitised on orthophotography. The resulting ground truthed data from the total surveyed area of 3688ha, were then used, together with satellite imagery, to classify the habitat composition of a further approximately 87,000ha of the surrounding landscape.Results revealed that at individual farm scale, an average of 73% of the land surveyed comprised agriculturally productive (mainly improved grassland) habitats. Marginally productive habitats (mainly extensively managed grasslands) accounted for an average of 11% of farm area, while other semi-natural habitats (mainly hedgerows) accounted for an average of 13%, with the remaining ca. 3% under build ground. Results from the classification at the wider landscape scale showed a similarly substantial incidence of non-intensively managed habitats. However, at both farm and landscape scales, habitat diversity was found to vary markedly between different regions and farming systems.This study represents one of a very small number that currently exist, where farm scale habitat and management data have been collected. From the few that are available, semi-natural habitat cover has been found to account for an average farm area of 1–12%. Therefore, our data present a relatively positive picture in terms of the intensity, scale and impact of Irish farming on landscape heterogeneity. However, as in other parts of the world, agricultural expansion and intensification to meet increased global food supply will necessitate careful monitoring of the impact of these changes on the structure of farmed landscapes. This study provides a novel approach for the collection of such monitoring data at farm scale, and illustrates how such data can be reliably up-scaled to landscape level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3afarm area 3afarm surveys 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afood supply chain 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ainformation management 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aorthophotography 3aremote sensing 3astocking rate 3asustainable agriculture 3aIrish Republic 0aHabitat diversity 0aLandscape heterogeneity 0aHabitat classification 0aEcosystem services 0aAgricultural intensification and expansion 0aRemote sensing 0aFarm scale 0aLandscape scale1 aKeogh, B.1 aAnderson, A.1 aCarnus, T.1 aMcMahon, B.J.1 aGreen, S.1 aPurvis, G.0 tLand use policy.g2017 Apr., v. 63 p.206-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015800172520054100330592002800871650002300899650001900922650002800941650001400969650001300983650001900996700003301015700003401048700002301082700002501105700002901130700002201159700002701181700002201208700002401230700002501254773012901279856008601408852000901494655001201503IND60754294820221119221835.0211023e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429482DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Chiara 14aThe Multifaceted COVID-19: CT Aspects of Its Atypical Pulmonary and Abdominal Manifestations and Complications in Adults and Children.

This pictorial review has the aim to describe the radiological aspects of atypical presentations and of some complications of COVID-19 disease in adults and children and provide a simple guide for radiologists to become familiar with the multiform aspects of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadult children 3acomplications (disease) 3ahospitals 3alearning 3amicroorganisms1 aFrancavilla, Mariantonietta 1 aStabile Ianora, Amato Antonio1 aCozzolino, Monica 1 aGualano, Alessandra 1 aStellacci, Giandomenico 1 aSacco, Antonello 1 aLorusso, Filomenamila 1 aPedote, Pasquale 1 aDe Ceglie, Michele 1 aScardapane, Arnaldo 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245009500183300001500278520152100293592002801814650001101842650001501853650001101868650002301879650001001902650001001912650002201922650000901944650002201953650001001975650001101985650001901996650001202015653002602027653000902053653001302062653001302075653002302088653002302111653002202134700002002156700002002176700002202196700002602218773010602244856008702350852000902437655001202446IND60552526620221118012910.0161021e20130110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055252662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomolo, Francesco Saverio10aSurface-sampling and analysis of TATP by swabbing and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 96-100.  aThe method of sample recovery for trace detection and identification of explosives plays a critical role in several criminal investigations. After bombing, there can be difficulties in sending big objects to a laboratory for analysis. Traces can also be searched for on large surfaces, on hands of suspects or on surfaces where the explosive was placed during preparatory phases (e.g. places where an IED was assembled, vehicles used for transportation, etc.).In this work, triacetone triperoxide (TATP) was synthesized from commercial precursors following reported methods. Several portions of about 6mg of TATP were then spread on different surfaces (e.g. floors, tables, etc.) or used in handling tests. Three different swabbing systems were used: a commercial swab, pre-wetted with propan-2-ol (isopropanol) and water (7:3), dry paper swabs, and cotton swabs wetted with propan-2-ol. Paper and commercial swabs were also used to sample a metal plate, where a small charge of about 4g of TATP was detonated. Swabs were sealed in small glass jars with screw caps and Parafilm® M and sent to the laboratory for analysis. Swabs were extracted and analysed several weeks later by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. All the three systems gave positive results, but wetted swabs collected higher amounts of TATP. The developed procedure showed its suitability for use in real cases, allowing TATP detection in several simulations, including a situation in which people wash their hands after handling the explosive.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3aexplosives 3afloors 3agas chromatography 3aglass 3ahands 3aisopropyl alcohol 3ajars 3amass spectrometry 3apaper 3apeople 3atransportation 3awashing 0aImprovised explosives 0aTATP 0aSampling 0aSwabbing 0aForensic chemistry 0aGas chromatography 0aMass spectrometry1 aCassioli, Luigi1 aGrossi, Silvana1 aCinelli, Giuseppe1 aRusso, Mario Vincenzo0 tForensic science international.g2013 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.96-100dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008200172300001800254500001500272520066700287592002800954650001200982650001400994650001601008650001701024651001801041653000901059653001301068653001401081653002201095700002101117700002301138700002001161773011001181856005101291852000901342655001201351IND50087634720221119161623.0140412e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008763472DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2011.5595972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanborn, Allen F.12aA new species of the genus Beameria (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) from North America  ap. 1589-1605.  a2019-12-05  aCicadas of the genus Beameria Davis are small, grass dwelling species found across much of western North America.

It is one of the most abundant species of the orb-weaving guild of the spider community of soybean crops in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The first three instars occurred inside the egg sac, and instar IV (spiderlings) started the dispersion from it. The female of Alpaida veniliae achieved greater adult size and adult longevity than the male. Mean fecundity, mean number of egg sacs per female, mean number of eggs per egg sac, as well as the net reproductive rate, the intrinsic rate of increase (r), the generation time (T), and the reproductive values (Vₓ) of three cohorts were determined under laboratory conditions, indicating a high capacity for growth. Their biological and ecological attributes indicate the importance of conservation of this predator as a natural enemy of soybean crop pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aadults 3acrops 3aeggs 3afecundity 3ahatching 3ainstars 3alongevity 3apests 3arearing 3asoybeans 3aArgentina 0aspiders 0ageneralist predators 0asoybean 0alife history traits 0apopulation growth rates1 aSánchez, Norma E.1 aGonzález, Alda0 tJournal of natural history.g2011 July 1, v. 45, no. 25-26 p.1607-1617dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2011.559598  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012500166520184200291592002802133650001502161650002902176650000902205650001502214650002102229650002002250650001902270650001302289650001502302650001902317650001502336650004302351650001902394650002002413700001702433700001602450700001902466700001902485700001602504700001502520700001802535773012902553856008602682852000902768655001202777IND60754294920221119221956.0211023e20210927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075429492DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91020382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Qiqi 10aComparative Genomic Analysis Determines the Functional Genes Related to Bile Salt Resistance in Lactobacillus salivarius  aLactobacillus salivarius has drawn attention because of its promising probiotic functions. Tolerance to the gastrointestinal tract condition is crucial for orally administrated probiotics to exert their functions. However, previous studies of L. salivarius have only focused on the bile salt resistance of particular strains, without uncovering the common molecular mechanisms of this species. Therefore, in this study, we expanded our research to 90 L. salivarius strains to explore their common functional genes for bile salt resistance. First, the survival rates of the 90 L. salivarius strains in 0.3% bile salt solutions were determined. Comparative genomics analysis was then performed to screen for the potential functional genes related to bile salt tolerance. Next, real-time polymerase chain reaction and gene knockout experiments were conducted to further verify the tolerance-related functional genes. The results indicated that the strain-dependent bile salt tolerance of L. salivarius was mainly associated with four peptidoglycan synthesis-related genes, seven phosphotransferase system-related genes, and one chaperone-encoding gene involved in the stress response. Among them, the GATase1-encoding gene showed the most significant association with bile salt tolerance. In addition, four genes related to DNA damage repair and substance transport were redundant in the strains with high bile salt tolerance. Besides, cluster analysis showed that bile salt hydrolases did not contribute to the bile salt tolerance of L. salivarius. In this study, we determined the global regulatory genes, including LSL_1568, LSL_1716 and LSL_1709, for bile salt tolerance in L. salivarius and provided a potential method for the rapid screening of bile salt-tolerant L. salivarius strains, based on PCR amplification of functional genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aLactobacillus salivarius 3abile 3abile salts 3acluster analysis 3adigestive tract 3agene targeting 3agenomics 3ahydrolases 3apeptidoglycans 3aprobiotics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalt tolerance 3astress response1 aShen, Xudan 1 aYu, Leilei 1 aTian, Fengwei 1 aZhao, Jianxin 1 aZhang, Hao 1 aChen, Wei 1 aZhai, Qixiao 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91020383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245010400197500001900301500002000320520149800340592002801838596005901866596005901925596008501984650004402069650002202113650001502135650001302150650001302163650004302176650002102219650001502240650004402255650001802299650001502317650002502332650001602357650001502373650001502388700001502403700001902418700001802437700001602455700001902471700002002490700001402510773015402524856007802678852000902756655001202765IND60709256020221122221323.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070925602DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2019004122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2623-325410aErythritol‐Based Medium‐Chain Sugar Amphiphile: Synthesis and Gelling Capability in Edible Oils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe production of organogels from vegetable oils requires low‐molecular‐weight gelators. Herein, a novel small‐molecule sugar ester gelator is synthesized from erythritol and octanoic acid. The purified reaction product is identified as erythritol 1,6‐dioctanoate by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with evaporative light‐scattering detection and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This low‐molecular‐weight erythritol ester exhibits self‐assembly behavior in vegetable oils with a minimum gelation concentration of 4 wt%. Microscopy reveals needle‐like crystals that became slender as the gelator concentration increases. X‐Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses indicate that the organogels are semicrystalline with both crystalline and amorphous domains. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals that the gel structure is maintained by non‐hydrogen‐bonding interactions. Furthermore, rheological tests show that the mechanical strength of the gel is poor, but as the gelator concentration is increased, the mechanical strength and hardness of the gel also increases. Thus, this erythritol ester effectively promotes the gelation of edible vegetable oils and increases the variety of available organogelators. Practical Applications: The synthesized erythritol ester is successfully applied as a gelator to produce organogels from a variety of vegetable oils, and are expected to advance the development of effective organogelators for edible oils.  aPublisher supplied data  a31371729cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31801504cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aPA2019GDPK0065cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aerythritol 3agelation 3ahardness 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alight scattering 3amicroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoctanoic acid 3aorganogels 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurfactants 3atechnology 3avegetables1 aLei, Zheng1 aZheng, Donglei1 aShi, Zhaojuan1 aGe, Yuanfei1 aCheng, Jieshun1 aJiang, Shaotong1 aCao, Lili0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2020 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.e1900412-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2019004123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245005300163300001400216520116000230592002801390650002701418700001901445773011701464852000901581856008201590655001201672IND8410577520221117225410.0181029e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND841057752DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517584054001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebert, J.J.10aReversal Frequencies in Developing Cotton Fibers  ap. 23-26.  aDirectional reversals in the helical deposition of fibrils affect the performance of cotton fibers. A developmental study was therefore conducted to determine the in fluences of genetics and developmental pattern on the incidence of these reversals. One cultivar of cotton, Deltapine 61, was studied in both 1980 and 1981; four other cultivars, Acala SJ-5, Stoneville 825, Stoneville 213, and Pima S-5, were studied only in 1981. Of these, the first four are upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) while the latter is a long-staple cotton (G. barbadense L.). Reversal frequencies were measured by polarized light microscopic techniques. In each cultivar, reversals were first detected after the third week of fiber development, coincident with the initiation of secondary wall formation. Reversal frequency increased with fiber maturity. Because reversal frequencies increased with fiber age, it seems that not all layers of the secondary wall reverse together. Slippage between layers may result from reversals occurring during late stages of fiber development. A plausible explanation for the two types of reversals reported in the literature is offered.  aPublisher supplied data 3anonfood plant products1 aBoylston, E.K.0 tTextile research journal.g1984 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.23-26dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517584054001053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02798naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008000169300002000249500001100269520129800280592002801578596006201606650001701668650001801685650001901703650001901722650001301741650001601754650001701770650001801787650001301805650001501818650002501833650002001858700001601878700002301894700001701917700002001934700001901954700002001973700001801993700005802011773015502069856008302224852000902307655001202316IND60794719820221117065150.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079471982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-22550-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Permender10aNanomaterials photocatalytic activities for waste water treatment: a review  ap. 69294-69326.  aReview  aWater is necessary for the survival of life on Earth. A wide range of pollutants has contaminated water resources in the last few decades. The presence of contaminants incredibly different dyes in waste, potable, and surface water is hazardous to environmental and human health. Different types of dyes are the principal contaminants in water that need sudden attention because of their widespread domestic and industrial use. The toxic effects of these dyes and their ability to resist traditional water treatment procedures have inspired the researcher to develop an eco-friendly method that could effectively and efficiently degrade these toxic contaminants. Here, in this review, we explored the effective and economical methods of metal-based nanomaterials photocatalytic degradation for successfully removing dyes from wastewater.

However, the excessive accumulation of beach wrack can be a nuisance for local residents and tourism. Meanwhile, beach wrack can become a source of greenhouse gas due to the decomposition. Hence, effective monitoring of beach wrack has become a priority for coastal environmental management. As a cost- and labor-saving approach, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can perform customized flight tasks and achieve aerial images with sub-decimeter spatial resolution. This study investigated the feasibility of using UAVs to map wrack on three different types of beaches. The method of object-based image analysis (OBIA) was applied to classify the aerial images. Three typical machine learning methods, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF), were examined with different feature spaces at several segmentation levels. The results showed that the three machine learning methods performed well with the overall classification accuracy >75%. The tested algorithm, SVM with only RGB as feature space at the segmentation scale 50, was geographically transferable to beaches with different characteristics. This study demonstrated that UAVs can be developed as an applicable tool for beach wrack mapping and monitoring, which will help to better explore the role of beach wrack in BCEs and assist the local municipalities in environmental management of the coastal zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue carbon 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aenvironmental management 3aflight 3agreenhouse gases 3aimage analysis 3asupport vector machines 3atourism 0aBeach wrack 0aUnmanned aerial vehicles 0aObject-based image analysis 0aBlue carbon ecosystems1 aFlindt, Mogens1 aSchneider-Kamp, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4000-55701 aHolmer, Marianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6095-54880 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 213 p.105843-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1058433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012600169300001400295520177000309592002802079650001502107650001802122650000902140650001202149650001402161650001102175650001502186650001202201650001302213650001002226650001202236653002402248653000902272653002702281653001402308653001502322700001302337700001402350700001402364700001602378700001402394700001502408700001502423700001302438773010702451856009002558852000902648655001202657IND60570346720221120121630.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057034672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Z.H.10aEffects of energy and protein restriction on digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract of Liuyang Black kids  ap. 13-19.  aThe effects of key nutrient restriction on digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract were investigated in 60 weaned Liuyang Black kids. Weaned kids in this study received one of the following diets (15 kids per treatment): diet with adequate nutrient supply (control diet), energy restriction diet (ER diet), protein restriction diet (PR diet), or both energy and protein restriction diet (EPR diet). The experiment included an adaptation period (0–6 d), a nutritional restriction period (7–48 d), and a recovery period in which all kids received a unified and normal diet (49–111 d). On d 48 and 111, 3 kids from each diet group were anaesthetised to collect samples of digesta, pancreas, and epithelia of the rumen and jejunum. When compared with control diet, the PR diet decreased the activity of exo-1,4-β-glucanase in the rumen and the amounts of Val and Phe transported from the jejunum mucosal side to the serosal side (p<0.05). The ER, PR, and EPR diets decreased the activities of trypsin and α-amylase in the jejunum (p<0.05). The EPR diet decreased the activities of exo-1,4-β-glucanase in the rumen, α-amylase in the pancreas, and the amounts of Val, Leu, Phe, and Arg transported from the jejunum mucosal side to the serosal side (p<0.05). After 9 wk of nutritional recovery, the amount of Val transported from the jejunum mucosal side to the serosal side of kids in EPR group was still lower than that of kids in control group (p<0.05), indicating prolonged effects even after nutritionally recovery. This study demonstrated that 6 wk of PR or EPR reduced the digestive and absorptive ability of the rumen and jejunum of weaned kids and the reduced absorptive ability was not fully recovered after 9 wk of nutritional recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalpha-amylase 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestion 3aenergy 3aepithelium 3ajejunum 3apancreas 3arumen 3atrypsin 0aProtein restriction 0aGoat 0aGastrointestinal tract 0aDigestion 0aAbsorption1 aHe, Z.X.1 aTan, Z.L.1 aLiu, S.M.1 aZhang, Q.L.1 aHan, X.F.1 aTang, S.X.1 aZhou, C.S.1 aWang, M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Sept., v. 154 p.13-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245012000207300002000327500001900347520160900366592002801975650001902003650001502022650001502037650001102052650001402063650002302077700002002100700002202120773013802142856008102280852000902361655001202370IND60715632320221119220648.0201106e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071563232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c077142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogov, Aleksey B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-412510aRelaxation Kinetics of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Coated Al Electrode: Insight into the Role of Negative Current  ap. 23784-23797.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is an advanced coating process based on high-voltage anodizing. Notwithstanding the anodic nature of the PEO process, it is known that negative polarization leads to synergetic effects in oxide formation efficiency and characteristics of resulting coatings. In this work, we used dynamic anodic voltammograms derived from polarization signal, combining working and diagnostic segments to evaluate in real time the effects of negative polarization on the formation of PEO on the coating on Al in the bipolar regime with a frequency of 50 Hz and a negative-to-positive charge ratio of 1.3. It was found that the hysteresis between ascending and descending branches of the voltammogram can be both caused by prior cathodic polarization and spontaneously generated under unpolarized conditions. This indicated the existence of a quasi-equilibrium in the chemical state of the coating material, which could be perturbed by the external bipolar polarization. The characteristic relaxation time for this system was found to be 40–370 ms. The quasi-equilibrium was attributed to a reversible hydration/dehydration reaction taking place in the active zone of anodic alumina layer (degree of hydration: 10–40%). Coating response analysis via kinetic hydration model allowed both explanations to be provided to a number of previous experimental observations and practical recommendations to be made for the design of efficient electrical regimes for intelligent PEO processes. The latter includes recommendations on avoiding long pauses during negative to positive switching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aelectrodes 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aMatthews, Allan1 aYerokhin, Aleksey0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 124, no. 43 p.23784-23797dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c077143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008800166300001600254520161500270592002801885596010901913650001602022650002202038650001702060650002402077650001302101650002902114650002302143650003002166650001302196650001602209650001802225650002402243650001302267650003102280650001202311650002102323650001902344650001102363650001902374650001202393650001202405650000902417700001902426700002702445773013402472856008202606852000902688655001202697IND60588732820221120045151.0191113e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058873282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-017-1272-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajitha, K. L.10aBiocontrol potential of Bacillus subtilis B1 against sapstain fungus in rubber wood  ap. 237-244.  aRubber wood, one of the most preferred plantation timbers in the tropical regions, is easily prone to various moulds, decay and stain fungi. Lasiodiplodia theobromae, the dominant sapstain fungus of rubber wood, causes high economic loss to the industry through its bluish black sap wood discolouration. In our previous laboratory trials, Bacillus subtilis B1 isolated from market available compost was proved as a potent biocontrol agent against the sapstain fungus L. theobromae. The main aim of the present study was to demonstrate the biocontrol potential of B. subtilis B1 against rubber wood sapstain fungus on fresh rubber wood pieces during pre-monsoon, southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon seasons in the field. The visual ratings provided for the wood fungal growth and internal wood stain exhibited the bio-protectant efficiency of B. subtilis B1 even in the southwest monsoon season, which is considered as the most favourable period for the wood fungal growth. Biocontrol agent, B. subtilis B1 demonstrated significant inhibitions of sapstain fungus on open stacked rubber wood pieces in all the seasons. The frequent rainfalls during monsoon periods provide a conducive environment for fungal growth on felled rubber wood. Successful field evaluations of the biocontrol agent during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon periods would guarantee year round protection against rubber wood sapstain. B. subtilis B1 displayed holistic biocontrol efficiency towards other stain (Ceratocystis sp., Fusarium sp.), mould (Aspergillus sp., Penicllium sp.) and decay fungi (Trametes versicolor) as well.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR14542/AGR/05/527/2010cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology (IN), India 3aAspergillus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCeratocystis 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aFusarium 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acomposts 3adecay fungi 3adiscoloration 3afinancial economics 3aindustry 3alaboratory experimentation 3amarkets 3amicrobial growth 3amonsoon season 3arubber 3asapstain fungi 3asapwood 3atropics 3awood1 aDev, Suma Arun1 aFlorence, E.

The highly specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers which bind to TET with high affinity were employed to discriminate other antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, lomefloxacin, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, enoxacin. The sensing approach is based on the strongly specific interactions between the TET-binding aptamers and TET over the electrostatic interactions between the negatively-charged TET-binding aptamers and the positively-charged CS-AuNPs. Thus a simple colorimetric aptasensor for TET determination is developed using CS-AuNPs as the colorimetric probe. Under the optimum conditions, the absorbance change (ΔA527) of CS-AuNPs was linearly proportional with TET concentration in the range of 0.20–2.0 μg/mL with the detection limit of 0.039 μg/mL (3σ), which is lower than the permissible level in the European Union (EU) (225 nM) and China (100 μg/kg). The application of this method for samples of TET-spiked raw milk suggested satisfactory recoveries between 91.28% and 100.87%. Owing to the advantages of simple operation procedure, reduced detection time, and excellent selectivity, practical application of the proposed colorimetric assay could be expected to realize in on-site and real-time detection of TET in raw milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aabsorbance 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adoxycycline 3aelectrostatic interactions 3akanamycin 3alomefloxacin 3ananogold 3aofloxacin 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxytetracycline 3arapid methods 3araw milk 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atetracycline 3aChina 0aTetracycline 0aColorimetric detection 0aCS-AuNPs 0aAptamers 0aMilk1 aXu, Jingyue1 aLi, Ying1 aGao, Hanting1 aGuo, Jiajia1 aShen, Fei1 aSun, Chunyan0 tFood control.g2015 Aug., v. 54 p.7-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015400167300001400321520146900335592002801804650001301832650001201845650001801857650002601875650001701901650001401918650001401932650001101946651001001957653001201967653001201979653001701991653001402008653002402022653002302046653000802069653001002077653002102087653002602108700002002134700002202154773013102176856008302307852000902390655001202399IND60601173720221120122539.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060117372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiba, Tomoki10aRecognizing cryptic environmental changes by using paleoecology and taphonomy of Pleistocene bivalve assemblages in the Oga Peninsula, northern Japan  ap. 21-34.  aMultivariate analyses applied to Pleistocene bivalve assemblages from the Oga Peninsula (northern Japan) discriminate three distinct assemblages. The assemblages and their taphonomy were used to recognize environmental settings and changes. The Astarte–Cyclocardia–Glycymeris assemblage indicates shelf environment (below the storm wave base) where gravels and shells are transported from shallower settings. Supply of the exotic coarse sediment probably enabled epifaunal bivalves to inhabit the sea floor. The Glycymeris assemblage is characterized by dominance of G. yessoensis and represents current-swept shoreface environment (above the storm wave base). The Moerella assemblage is characterized by bivalves inhabiting bay to open-marine conditions and diverse deposit-feeders, indicating a moderately land-locked environment, such as an open bay or a bay mouth. Fine-grained substrata rich in organic matters in the bay were probably suitable for the deposit-feeders. Ordination also shows the assemblages along two environmental gradients, a bathymetrical one and the other related to open-marine and bay conditions. The environmental changes are explained mainly by glacio-eustatic sea-level changes and alternation of coastal geomorphology caused by local crustal movements. This study also suggests that fossil assemblages can be a powerful tool to reconstruct environments and depositional dynamics even in intensely bioturbated sedimentary facies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3afossils 3ageomorphology 3amultivariate analysis 3apaleoecology 3asea level 3asediments 3astorms 3aJapan 0aBivalve 0aMollusk 0aPaleoecology 0aTaphonomy 0aShell concentration 0aSedimentary facies 0aBay 0aShelf 0aCrustal movement 0aMultivariate analysis1 aShirai, Masaaki1 aSatō, Shin'ichi,0 tQuaternary research.g2014 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.21-34dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011500171300001600286520211900302592002802421650001902449650002002468650001802488650001702506650001402523650002302537650001302560651001202573653001202585653002302597653001602620653002202636653002202658653002302680700001802703700001802721700002302739700002002762773011702782856008502899852000902984655001202993IND60569149020221118130439.0190403e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056914902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBölöni, János10aQuantity and dynamics of dead wood in managed and unmanaged dry-mesic oak forests in the Hungarian Carpathians  ap. 120-131.  aDead wood (DW) has great importance for many wildlife species and ecological processes. The volume of DW is considered a useful indicator of the sustainability and maintenance of biodiversity in forests. Though dry-mesic oak forests cover large areas in Hungary, little is known about DW quantities or dynamics in these forests. We investigated DW conditions in five age classes of dry-mesic Quercus petraea and Q. cerris dominated forests in the Hungarian Carpathians. Stands of the first four age classes (age class 1: 40–59, age class 2: 60–79, age class 3: 80–99, age class 4: 100–119years old) were managed and stands at least 120years old were unmanaged at least for 30years (age class 5). We measured the volume, density, dominance and size distribution of standing DW and volume of downed DW. We also evaluated the decay stages of DW on an ordinal scale (I-V, intact to well-decayed). The effect of age class on the derived variables such as density, dominance, volume or proportion of DW was analysed with general linear mixed models using age class as a fixed and region as a random effect. Mean total DW volume did not reach 15m3/ha in age class 1, 2 and 3. A much larger volume of DW was found in age class 4 and 5, where the mean total volume of DW was 36.9 and 45.1m3/ha, respectively. Volume and proportion of total DW over 30cm in diameter were markedly lower in age classes 1, 2 and 3 than in age classes 4 and 5, moreover standing and downed DW over 30cm in diameter were totally absent in stands under 100years old. The proportion of well-decomposed (decay stage IV and V) DW was much lower (3–18% of the volume) in all five age classes than in old-growth stands of dry-mesic oak forests. After three decades of non-intervention (age class 5), the volume of DW can approach that of old-growth forests. The 40–99-year old stands contained a similarly low percentage of DW as other managed dry-mesic oak forests in Europe. Based on the results, it is likely that stands greater than 100years old will support much higher biodiversity of saproxylic organisms compared to younger stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus cerris 3aQuercus petraea 3aage structure 3abiodiversity 3adead wood 3aold-growth forests 3awildlife 3aHungary 0aQuercus 0aStanding dead tree 0aDowned tree 0aForest management 0aAbandoned forests 0aOld-growth forests1 aÓdor, Péter1 aÁdám, Réka1 aKeeton, William S.1 aAszalós, Réka0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 399 p.120-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014500167300001400312520168800326592002802014650001302042650001102055650001002066650001702076650001402093650001802107650000902125650001302134653002102147653001702168653002202185653001602207700002102223700002102244700002102265773012702286856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60773189220221118153657.0220412e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077318922DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299220000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGündel, Sandra10aComparison of the feeding behaviour of primiparous and multiparous Jersey and Holstein cows kept under equal conditions throughout lactation  ap. 37-43.  aThe objective of the study was to describe the feeding behaviour of primiparous and multiparous Jersey cows compared to Holstein cows housed in separate groups in the same barn. Such information could help farmers to optimise management with respect to welfare and production. Yet, it remains limited for Jersey cows over the entire period of lactation. Feeding data of 116 Danish Jersey (mean parity 2.14 ± 1.32) and 218 Danish Holstein cows (mean parity 1.90 ± 1.16) were assessed using automatic feeders from day 15 to 252 of lactation. Total eating duration, duration of eating per visit, intervals between meals, number of visits per day and the eating rate were analysed using linear mixed effects models. The cows were kept in a loose-housing system, with cubicles and automatic milking robots, and the group composition was dynamic. Compared to Holstein cows, Jersey cows visited the feeder significantly more often with shorter between meal intervals. However, the visit duration and total daily eating time and eating rates were significantly shorter for Jersey cows. There was no difference between breeds in the daily eating time and eating rate of older cows. Younger Jersey cows had significantly lower eating rates than older Jersey cows. No other difference in parity was found within Jersey cows. Weeks in milk significantly affected the eating time per day, number of visits per day and eating rate. The trajectories of outcome variables during lactation did not differ between the two breeds. In conclusion, we found substantial differences in the feeding behaviour of Jersey and Holstein cows, however, these differences could also be related to a group effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3abarns 3agroup effect 3alactation 3aloose housing 3amilk 3aresearch 0aBreed difference 0adairy cattle 0afeeding behaviour 0aJersey cows1 aMunksgaard, Lene1 aLooft, Christian1 aFoldager, Leslie0 tJournal of dairy research.g2022 Feb., v. 89, no. 1 p.37-43dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299220000613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04099naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010200174520236100276592002802637650002802665650001402693650002402707650002502731650001202756650002602768650002602794650002302820650001402843650001002857650001302867650002202880650001802902650002302920650001002943650001802953650000902971650001702980650002202997650001903019650001203038650002303050650002003073650005203093650002103145650001603166700002203182700001803204700002503222700001903247700002703266773013403293856008503427852000903512655001203521IND60672767520221122143957.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067276752DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz037.FS11-01-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPahlavani, Mandana10aEicosapentaenoic Acid Regulates Brown Adipose Tissue Function, Independently of UCP1 (FS11-01-19)  aBrown adipose tissue (BAT) is a critical tissue in energy expenditure through its specific uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). We previously reported that mice fed high fat (HF) diet supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduced body weight, adiposity, and insulin resistance, and increased UCP1 protein and mRNA levels of other thermogenic markers in BAT at ambient temperature. Hence, we hypothesized that these metabolic effects of EPA on BAT are in part mediated by UCP1. To determine the role of UCP1 in obesity and BAT regulation by EPA, wild type (WT) and UCP1 knockout (KO) B6 male mice were housed at thermoneutral conditions (30°C), previously reported to induce obesity in the KO mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HF, 45% kcal fat) or HF diet supplemented with 36 g/kg of AlaskOmega EPA-enriched fish oil (800 mg/g), kindly provided by Organic Technologies, for up to 14 weeks. We metabolically phenotyped these mice and investigated metabolic and molecular changes in their interscapular BAT. Specifically, we determined effects of UCP1 deficiency and EPA on BAT thermogenic and mitochondrial markers. The previously reported beneficial metabolic effects of EPA in WT mice at ambient, including increased UCP1 expression, were attenuated or lost at thermoneutral temperature. EPA reduced weight gain and adiposity, and improved glucose tolerance in KO mice. In both diets (HF and EPA), BAT triglyceride content was increased, while mitochondrial UCP1, COX I and COX IV protein levels were decreased in the KO compared to the WT genotype (P < 0.05). EPA also increased (P < 0.05) mitochondrial DNA/nuclear DNA ratio in the KO mice. Finally, BAT PGC1α at both gene and protein levels along with whole-body oxygen consumption were increased (P < 0.05) by EPA in KO mice. EPA did not alter the calcium cycling-related markers such as sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (Serca2b) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (Trpv2) in any of the genotypes. EPA effects on BAT and mitochondrial function are independent of UCP1, and include increased mitochondrial DNA and oxygen consumption, which may be in part relate to increased PGC1α. Additional studies are required to determine fuel or mitochondrial mechanisms by which energy expenditure is increased independently of UCP1.

Bulk raw milk from six commercial flocks was sampled during the milking period from May to June. Flocks were managed under extensive grazing but, according to usual local practices in valley farms, sheep diet was supplemented with a small amount of concentrate in May. Botanical species from mountain and valley areas where commercial flocks grazed were also collected. Sheep milk from mountain farms showed higher fat content that was richer in α-linolenic acid and its biohydrogenation intermediates, long-chain saturated, branched-chain, and cis-monounsaturated fatty acids compared to milk from valley farms. Differences in fatty acid profile of botanical species plus the concentrate supplementation given to sheep in May were the factors that mostly influenced the fatty acid composition of milk from mountain compared to valley farms. Overall, this approach has evidenced that milk produced in mountain regions of northern Spain would add value to the ‘mountain product’ label, and would contribute to maintain a resilient and sustainable dairy production system in these areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiohydrogenation 3acase studies 3adairy sheep 3adiet 3aewe milk 3aewes 3afarms 3afatty acid composition 3aflocks 3agrazing 3ahuman health 3alipid content 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk production 3amilk quality 3anutritive value 3araw milk 3arearing 3aSpain 0aFatty acid 0aOvine milk 0aGrazing management 0aPasture1 aAldai, Noelia1 aKramer, John K.G.1 aBarron, Luis Javier R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2563-10820 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.374-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010100128300001600229520090700245592002801152650002701180650002001207650001701227650001501244650001801259650001601277650002601293650002301319650001801342650001601360650001501376650001701391650000901408650001701417650001501434650001101449653001701460700001401477700001801491773014601509852000901655655001201664IND60706038620221118235536.0200807e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070603862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhaka, S.S.10aRelative efficacy of novel insecticides and biopesticides against Earias vittella (Fab.) in Okra  ap. 271-275.  aThe novel insecticides and biopesticides were sprayed three times at an interval of 15 days, The first spray was done after 50 days of sowing the crop, when the pest crossed the economic threshold level.

The purpose of this article is to explore whether the existence of market instability can change that conclusion. In the case of fluctuations originating in domestic supply, export quotas will tend to destabilize domestic consumer prices and, whenever demand elasticities are low, will increase fluctuations in farmers' income. On the other hand, the case of instability originating in foreign markets is more favorable for quotas. In a free trade situation, all the external price instability carries over to the internal market. A quota scheme, on the contrary, stops instability at the country's frontiers. It is when markets are unstable, then, and instability is concentrated in external markets, that we find an argument for quotas. However, it has to be shown that quotas reduce price and income fluctuations in a degree that more than compensates for the reduction of export returns resulting from the introduction of quotas.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademand elasticities 3aexports 3afarm income 3aforeign markets 3afree trade 3amarket stabilization 3aprices 3asubsidies 3ataxes0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1968 Aug., v. 50, no. 3 p.643-659dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12382653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009400173520185100267592002802118650001602146650001802162650001702180650001902197650002902216650000902245650001302254650001902267650000702286650001502293650001802308650001402326650001902340653001602359653003402375653002402409653002702433653001402460700001502474700001202489700001302501700005402514773009102568856009002659852000902749655001202758IND60674137220221121065923.0200103e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067413722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1251342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huiqin10aOne-step Ferrate(VI) treatment as a core process for alternative drinking water treatment  aTraditional water treatment plants adopt multiple treatments to sequentially treat raw water for producing potable water. Besides complex treatment design and operation, they typically require a large space to accommodate different reactors. Furthermore, emerging issues (e.g. poor removal of persistent micro-pollutants) challenge the conventional treatment train. In this study, bench-scale tests were performed with real surface waters to evaluate ferrate(VI) treatment as a key alternative process for traditional water treatment. Of note, most earlier investigations on ferrate(VI) for water treatment utilized ferrate(VI) merely for pre- or post-treatment or simply as a disinfecting agent. Fundamentally different from the previous efforts, this study aimed to assess whether one-step ferrate(VI) addition, coupled with sedimentation, provided a comprehensive treatment, better than or equivalent to conventional surface water treatment. Results show that ferrate(VI) could simultaneously and effectively remove turbidity, degrade natural organic matter (NOM), and inactivate bacterial indicators in one single dose. The treatment performance relied heavily on ferrate(VI) dose and pH. Generally, higher ferrate(VI) dose improved the treatment results, except that it might re-suspend particles at a high dose at an alkaline condition. Lower pH favored coagulation due to reduction of zeta potentials on particle surface and promotion of their aggregation and enhanced the degradation of NOM because of higher Fe(VI) reactivity toward reductive moieties. In contrast, higher pH benefited the disinfection efficiency due to better stability and greater exposure of ferrate(VI). This study demonstrates that ferrate(VI) treatment can serve as a core treatment process in alternative water treatment designs for addressing various challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3adrinking water treatment 3airon 3amoieties 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apollutants 3asurface water 3aturbidity 3azeta potential 0aFerrate(VI) 0aMultiple treatment mechanisms 0aParticulate matters 0aNatural organic matter 0aPathogens1 aZheng, Lei1 aLi, Zhu1 aPi, Kewu1 aDeng, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2908-30440 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125134-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1251343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245016600166520147900332592002801811650001501839650001701854650001501871650001601886650003601902650001401938650001001952650001801962650001501980650000901995650001302004650002102017650001702038700002202055700002302077700002102100700002302121700001802144700002502162700002702187700002302214700002202237700002402259773012602283856007802409852000902487655001202496IND60732017620221120070211.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073201762DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100303592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Colin  G.10aSupplemental Ascorbate Diminishes DNA Damage Yet Depletes Glutathione and Increases Acute Liver Failure in a Mouse Model of Hepatic Antioxidant System Disruption  aCellular oxidants are primarily managed by the thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1)- and glutathione reductase (Gsr)-driven antioxidant systems. In mice having hepatocyte-specific co-disruption of TrxR1 and Gsr (TrxR1/Gsr-null livers), methionine catabolism sustains hepatic levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Although most mice with TrxR1/Gsr-null livers exhibit long-term survival, ~25% die from spontaneous liver failure between 4- and 7-weeks of age. Here we tested whether liver failure was ameliorated by ascorbate supplementation. Following ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, or mock treatment, we assessed survival, liver histology, or hepatic redox markers including GSH and GSSG, redox enzyme activities, and oxidative damage markers. Unexpectedly, rather than providing protection, ascorbate (5 mg/mL, drinking water) increased the death-rate to 43%. In adults, ascorbate (4 mg/g × 3 days i.p.) caused hepatocyte necrosis and loss of hepatic GSH in TrxR1/Gsr-null livers but not in wildtype controls. Dehydroascorbate (0.3 mg/g i.p.) also depleted hepatic GSH in TrxR1/Gsr-null livers, whereas GSH levels were not significantly affected by either treatment in wildtype livers. Curiously, however, despite depleting GSH, ascorbate treatment diminished basal DNA damage and oxidative stress markers in TrxR1/Gsr-null livers. This suggests that, although ascorbate supplementation can prevent oxidative damage, it also can deplete GSH and compromise already stressed livers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidants 3acatabolism 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahistology 3aliver 3aliver failure 3amethionine 3amice 3anecrosis 3aoxidative stress 3athioredoxins1 aKundert, Jean  A.1 aPrigge, Justin  R.1 aAmato, Julie  A.1 aPerez, Allison  E.1 aCoppo, Lucia 1 aRizzo, Gabrielle  N.1 aKavanaugh, Michael  P.1 aOrlicky, David  J.1 aShearn, Colin  T.1 aSchmidt, Edward  E.0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100303593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245004600172300001000218500002000228520074900248592002800997650002001025650001801045650002001063650001501083773014101098856008401239852000901323655001201332IND60786581020221121192456.0220804e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078658102DNAL7 a10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.00182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercer, Kenneth L.10aInside Insight—Changes and Improvements  ap. 2.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTalk of change abounds these days, but it's generally accepted that change in the water industry is slow, and rightfully so.

In addition to safeguarding public health, water professionals act as stewards of long‐lived, expensive assets that support every aspect of a community's success.

Their structures were elucidated via spectroscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and electronic circular dichroism calculations. In addition, the absolute configuration of 1 was determined by Marfey’s technique and an analysis of the acid hydrolysates using a chiral phase HPLC column. Among all the compounds, 6 and 8 showed medium cytotoxic activities against four tumor cell lines (SF-268, HepG-2, MCF-7, and A549), with IC₅₀ values ranging from 31.03 ± 3.04 to 50.25 ± 0.54 µM. Meanwhile, they strongly inhibited α-glucosidase activities, with IC₅₀ values of 35.73 ± 3.94 and 22.00 ± 2.45 µM, which were close to and even stronger than the positive control acarbose (IC₅₀ = 32.92 ± 1.03 µM). Compounds 6–8 showed significant antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values of 10.26 ± 0.76 µM, 17.00 ± 1.25 µM, and 5.30 ± 0.29 µM, respectively. Compounds 9 and 12 exhibited potent radical scavenging activities against DPPH, with IC₅₀ values of 12.23 ± 0.78 µM and 7.38 ± 1.16 µM. In addition, asperhiratide (1) was evaluated for anti-angiogenic activities in the in vivo zebrafish model, which showed a weak inhibitory effect on intersegmental vessel (ISV) formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDanio rerio 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacarbose 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3asecondary metabolites 3asesquiterpenoids 3aspectral analysis1 aChen, Yuchan 1 aWang, Junfeng 1 aShi, Xuefeng 1 aChe, Yihao 1 aChen, Xiayu 1 aZhong, Weimao 1 aZhang, Weimin 1 aWei, Xiaoyi 1 aWang, Fazuo 1 aZhang, Si 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 18, v. 20, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200201503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017900207300001200386520183100398592002802229650000902257650001402266650001802280650000902298650002202307650001902329650000902348650001602357650001302373650000902386650001202395650004402407650002402451700006002475773011702535856008302652852000902735655001202744IND60696442020221118121505.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069644202DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02379-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivry, Thierry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1399-003410aCritically appraised topic on adverse food reactions of companion animals (9): time to flare of cutaneous signs after a dietary challenge in dogs and cats with food allergies  ap. 158.  aBACKGROUND: At this time, elimination diets followed by oral food challenges (OFCs) represent the “gold standard” for diagnosing skin-manifesting food allergies (FA) in dogs and cats. Regrettably, there is no clear consensus on how long one should wait for clinical signs to flare after an OFC before diagnosing or ruling-out a FA in a dog or a cat. RESULTS: We searched two databases on October 23, 2019 to look for specific information on the time for a flare of clinical signs to occur during OFCs after elimination diets in dogs and cats with skin-manifesting FAs. Altogether, we reviewed the study results of nine papers that included 234 dogs and four articles containing data from 83 cats. As multiple OFCs could be done in the same patient and not all animals included were subjected to an OFC, we were able to compile 315 and 72 times to flare (TTF) after an OFC in dogs and cats, respectively. When regrouping all cases together, about 9% of dogs and 27% of cats exhibited a flare of clinical signs in the first day after an OFC; 21% of dogs and 29% of cats had such relapse by the end of the second day. The time needed for 50 and 90% of dogs to exhibit a deterioration of clinical signs (TTF₅₀ and TTF₉₀) was 5 and 14, respectively; in cats, these times were 4 and 7 days, respectively. By 14 days after an OFC, nearly all food-allergic patients from both species had had a relapse of clinical signs. These results are limited by the likely under-reporting of flares that occur on the first day immediately following an OFC, the time in which IgE-mediated acute allergic reactions typically develop. CONCLUSION: Veterinary clinicians performing an OFC need to wait for 14 and 7 days for more than 90% of dogs and cats with a skin-manifesting FA to have a flare of clinical signs, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3adatabases 3adeterioration 3adogs 3aelimination diets 3afood allergies 3agold 3ainformation 3apatients 3apets 3arelapse 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aveterinary medicine1 aMueller, Ralf S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5835-59100 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.158-158dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02379-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014200164300001600306520119800322592002801520650002401548650001601572650001501588650001201603650004101615650001501656650001901671650001501690650001101705700002601716700002201742700001901764700002201783773010401805856008201909852000901991655001202000IND60684896620221123014019.0200226e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068489662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-019-02786-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanff, Erik10aGC–MS measurement of spermidine and putrescine in serum of elderly subjects: intriguing association between spermidine and homoarginine  ap. 225-234.  aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) methods were developed, validated and used to measure serum spermidine (SPD) and putrescine (PUT) in 9 seropositive Helicobacter pylori (Hp +) and 18 seronegative Helicobacter pylori (Hp −) subjects (31–105 years).

Serum SPD and hArg concentrations correlated with each other (r = 0.426, P = 0.026, n = 27). The PUT/SPD molar ratio correlated inversely with the hArg concentration (r = − 0.406, P = 0.034, n = 27) and proteinic citrulline (r = − 0.487, P = 0.01, n = 27). These results suggest that SPD and PUT synthesis is associated with hArg formation and protein citrullination in healthy elderly subjects. The mechanisms underlying these associations and their significance remain to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3ablood serum 3acitrulline 3aelderly 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aputrescine 3aseroprevalence 3aspermidine 3at-test1 aBollenbach, Alexander1 aBeckmann, Bibiana1 aBrunner, Gorig1 aTsikas, Dimitrios0 tAmino acids.g2020 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.225-234dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-019-02786-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160520172800271592002801999650002002027650001302047650001002060650002402070650003502094650001302129650001402142650002002156650001702176650001702193650002702210650001102237650002102248700002602269700002102295700002402316773012602340856007502466852000902541655001202550IND60768420020221120072150.0220225e20220218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076842002DNAL7 a10.3390/md200201512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Beatriz 10aChitosan and Hyaluronic Acid Nanoparticles as Vehicles of Epoetin Beta for Subconjunctival Ocular Delivery  aNeuroprotection in glaucoma using epoetin beta (EPOβ) has yielded promising results. Our team has developed chitosan-hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (CS/HA) designed to carry EPOβ into the ocular globe, improving the drug’s mucoadhesion and retention time on the ocular surface to increase its bioavailability. In the present in vivo study, we explored the possibility of delivering EPOβ to the eye through subconjunctival administration of chitosan-hyaluronic acid-EPOβ (CS/HA-EPOβ) nanoparticles. Healthy Wistar Hannover rats (n = 21) were split into 7 groups and underwent complete ophthalmological examinations, including electroretinography and microhematocrit evaluations before and after the subconjunctival administrations. CS/HA-EPOβ nanoparticles were administered to the right eye (OD), and the contralateral eye (OS) served as control. At selected timepoints, animals from each group (n = 3) were euthanized, and both eyes were enucleated for histological evaluation (immunofluorescence and HE). No adverse ocular signs, no changes in the microhematocrits (≈45%), and no deviations in the electroretinographies in both photopic and scotopic exams were observed after the administrations (p < 0.05). Intraocular pressure remained in the physiological range during the assays (11–22 mmHg). EPOβ was detected in the retina by immunofluorescence 12 h after the subconjunctival administration and remained detectable until day 21. We concluded that CS/HA nanoparticles could efficiently deliver EPOβ into the retina, and this alternative was considered biologically safe. This nanoformulation could be a promising tool for treating retinopathies, namely optic nerve degeneration associated with glaucoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aelectroretinography 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglaucoma 3ahistology 3ahyaluronic acid 3amucoadhesion 3anerve tissue 3aneuroprotective effect 3aretina 3aretinal diseases1 aGonçalves, Lídia M.1 aBraz, Berta São1 aDelgado, Esmeralda 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 18, v. 20, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200201513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245014400178520116400322592002801486650002601514650002601540650001201566650001401578650001401592650001401606650001001620700001701630700002301647700002101670700002401691700001901715700002401734700002801758773012301786856008201909852000901991655001202000IND60763553020221120152759.0220120e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076355302DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110100422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOleksy-Wawrzyniak, Monika 14aThe In Vitro Ability of Klebsiella pneumoniae to Form Biofilm and the Potential of Various Compounds to Eradicate It from Urinary Catheters  aUrinary infections related to the presence of bacterial biofilm on catheters are responsible for loss of patients’ health and, due to their high frequency of occurrence, generate a significant economic burden for hospitals. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a pathogen frequently isolated from this type of infection. In this study, using a cohesive set of techniques performed under stationary and flow conditions, we assessed the ability of 120 K. pneumoniae strains to form biofilm on various surfaces, including catheters, and evaluated the usefulness of clinically applied and experimental compounds to remove biofilm. The results of our study indicate the high impact of intraspecies variability with respect to K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and its susceptibility to antimicrobials and revealed the crucial role of mechanical flushing out of the biofilm from the catheter’s surface with use of locally active antimicrobials. Therefore, our work, although of in vitro character, may be considered an important step in the direction of efficient reduction of K. pneumoniae biofilm-related hospital infections associated with the presence of urine catheters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aanti-infective agents 3abiofilm 3acatheters 3ahospitals 3apathogens 3aurine1 aJunka, Adam 1 aBrożyna, Malwina 1 aPaweł, Migdał 1 aKwiek, Bartłomiej 1 aNowak, Maciej 1 aMączyńska, Beata 1 aBartoszewicz, Marzenna 0 tPathogens.g2021 Dec. 31, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110100423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245006900201300001600270500002000286520146500306592002801771650001701799650002701816650001001843650001601853650001401869650001201883650001201895650001501907650001901922650001201941650001101953650001101964700001901975700002201994773012702016856007402143852000902217655001202226IND60791705220221118163821.0220831e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079170522DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.129592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuleger, Annika M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4057-759510aDeriving observation distances for camera trap distance sampling  ap. 423-432.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCamera trap distance sampling (CTDS)o is a recently developed survey method to estimate animal abundance from camera trap data for unmarked populations. It requires the estimation of camera‐animal observation distances, which previously was done by comparing animal positions to reference labels at predefined intervals. Here, we test a photogrammetry approach to derive camera‐animal observation distances. We applied both, the reference label and photogrammetry approaches to five ungulate species varying widely in body size (Giraffa camelopardalis, Equus grevyi, Oryx dammah, Kobus megaceros and Eudorcas thomsonii) and one ground‐dwelling bird species (Numida meleagris) inhabiting a large enclosure and estimated their density with CTDS. Both procedures provided highly correlated observation distances (ρ = 0.99, p < 0.001). A paired t test revealed a minor but significantly higher mean of the photogrammetry approach (MD = 0.28 m, p < 0.001). This, however, seems negligible as for analyses, distances were grouped in intervals of 2 to 5 metres. In general, estimated animal abundance was close to the true number of individuals in the enclosure for both approaches, with the exception of zebra, whose density was underestimated. The photogrammetry approach offers an alternative approach for deriving camera‐animal observation distances and is particularly useful for application in open habitats, with little occlusion of animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquus grevyi 3aGiraffa camelopardalis 3aKobus 3aOryx dammah 3abody size 3acameras 3aecology 3aguineafowl 3aphotogrammetry 3asurveys 3at-test 3azebras1 aHolland, Ruben1 aKühl, Hjalmar S.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2022 Sept., v. 60, no. 3 p.423-432dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.129593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015100167300001200318500001900330520134900349592002801698650001501726650001501741650001401756650001401770650001201784650001901796650002201815650001901837650002301856650002301879650002101902650001501923650001001938700003101948773012901979856008202108852000902190655001202199IND60696443420221118121842.0200620e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069644342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-020-01232-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAichour, Amina10aSynthesis and characterization of hybrid activated bentonite/alginate composite to improve its effective elimination of dyes stuff from wastewater  ap. 146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current paper is paying attention to the synthesis of a low-cost, abundant and efficient hybrid activated bentonite–alginate composite ABent/A. Hybrid composite morphology was determined through FTIR, XRPD, and pHPZC. The operational conditions for the retention of two dyes used in the textile industry (methylene blue and crystal violet) from aqueous mediums were evaluated. Results showed that MB and CV adsorbed amount on ABent/A was 780 and 546 mg/g, respectively. Kinetic Lagergren’s and Ho and McKay’s models provide the best result for the MB and CV adsorption on the prepared adsorbent, respectively. Langmuir isotherm model gives the best analyses of the experimentation, justifying a monolayer and a homogeneous nature of adsorption process. Results indicate also that the operational conditions studied affect significantly dyes removal. Reusability study of ABent/A for dyes was also investigated according to the type of desorbing agents. MB regeneration was found 98.92% using hydrochloric acid 0.01 M and CV regeneration percent was 95% using 0.5 M potassium chloride prepared in the mixture ethanol/water (0.5%/0.5%). From the obtained results, hybrid activated bentonite/alginate composites are low-cost, effective and regenerable adsorbent, which give a promising prospect for contaminated wastewaters treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalginates 3abentonite 3aethanol 3agentian violet 3ahydrochloric acid 3amethylene blue 3apotassium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3atextile industry 3awastewater 3awater1 aZaghouane-Boudiaf, Hassina0 tApplied water science.g2020 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.146-146dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01232-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012500168300002000293500001900313520163100332592002801963650001301991650002102004650001702025650002202042650001702064650001602081700001302097700001602110700001302126700005302139700005802192773012102250856008702371852000902458655001202467IND60711139720221116183441.0200917e20200803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071113972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Meigui10aAdvances in Ceramic Thin Films Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells  ap. 10568-10582.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as one of the clean electrochemical energy conversion devices have acquired increasing attention recently due to the high efficiency, low emission, and excellent fuel flexibility. Nevertheless, the practical application of SOFCs is hindered by poor stability and high cost. Thus, lowering the operating temperatures is critical to increase the lifetime and reduce the cost of SOFCs. However, the electrolyte and electrode materials used in high-temperature SOFCs suffer from insufficient ionic conductivity and poor electrocatalytic activity at lower operating temperatures, respectively. Nanomaterials and relevant nanotechnologies have great potential to enhance the performance of SOFCs operated at lower temperatures because of the enlarged surface area, distinct surface, and interface properties. Among various nanotechnologies, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been widely employed in SOFCs to reduce the operating temperature. Herein, we present an in-time review about the PLD-involved fabrication of key components in intermediate-temperature (IT) SOFCs in terms of cathodes, electrolytes, anodes, and interlayers. The superiority of the PLD technique to other traditional fabrication methods is emphasized, and design strategies for the key components in IT-SOFCs are presented and discussed. We also point out the trends, current challenges, and future directions that exist in this dynamic field. This review will inspire substantial interests from various disciplines and provide some valuable guidance for future development of PLD-involved energy storage and conversion devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aYu, Jian1 aSong, Yufei1 aRan, Ran1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7496-45481 aShao, Zongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4538-42180 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Aug. 03, v. 34, no. 9 p.10568-10582dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245007700153520149700230592002801727650001401755650001101769650002601780650002501806650002701831650000901858651001001867700001601877700001701893773012701910856007402037852000902111655001202120IND60652326620221119220444.0190712e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065232662DNAL7 a10.3390/su100722222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiu10aLegislative Study on China’s Compensation for Nuclear Damage Liability  aThe civil nuclear industry plays an important role in improving environmental quality and safeguarding energy security in China. Nevertheless, the industry is facing a huge risk of nuclear accident damage. The legal system of nuclear damage compensation is of vital importance for the industry to address potential risks. The Nuclear Safety Law, which has recently been published in China, stipulates two articles about nuclear damage compensation in principle. However, in general, the current nuclear damage compensation legal system in China has not yet been made systematic and there are still problems, such as a lack of maneuverability and details. This paper adopts qualitative and quantitative methodologies to summarize and analyze the current legislation and regulation pertaining to civil nuclear damage compensation liability in China and analyzes the shortages and deficiencies of these rules in detail by using legal analysis methods. Suggestions to establish and perfect China&rsquo;s legal system of nuclear damage compensation are proposed to safeguard the healthy development of the civil nuclear industry and remedy damages brought about by nuclear accidents. Such a legal system should contain the elements of clear legislative goals and objectives, a specific definition and scope of nuclear damage, strict and sole responsibility principles for operators, an appropriate liability amount, a stable financial guarantee for operators, and national supplementary liability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3alaws and regulations 3anuclear power industry 3arisk 3aChina1 aLiu, Bingyu1 aChen, Dantao0 tSustainability.g2018 June 28, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100722223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010400170520196400274592002802238650001202266650001102278650002902289650001602318650002902334650001002363650001302373650004302386650001302429650001902442650001102461650000902472650002402481650002002505650002202525650001502547650001502562651001402577653002402591653001902615653002302634653002802657700001602685700001802701773011902719856008802838852000902926655001202935IND60761738720221119095129.0220606e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076173872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunkel, V.R.10aModelling soil organic carbon using vegetation indices across large catchments in eastern Australia  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil component. However, examining SOC at the large catchment scale is difficult due to the intensive labour requirements. This study examines SOC distribution at large (>500 km²) catchment scales using field-sampled SOC data and remote sensed vegetation indices located in eastern Australia (Krui River catchment - 562 km²; Merriwa River catchment – 808 km²) on grazing land-use basalt soil. The SOC data obtained was compared to digital elevation model (DEM) derived elevation and insolation data, as well as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values corresponding to each sample site. These indices were obtained from the MODIS sensor (Terra/Aqua) and Landsat series satellites. Vegetation Indices (VI) captured immediately prior to sampling demonstrated a poor correlation with SOC. The use of multiple, aggregated, prior VI data sets provided a good match with SOC. The strongest match occurred for Landsat 8 EVI, indicating that VIs with higher spatial and spectral resolution, which can account for atmospheric interference, have the potential to produce more accurate SOC mapping (Krui samples in 2006, R² = 0.31, P < 0.01; Krui sampled in 2014, R² = 0.41, P < 0.01; Merriwa samples in 2015, R² = 0.37, P < 0.01). A sensitivity test for both remote sensing platforms demonstrated that the findings were robust. The results demonstrate that VIs are a reliable surrogate for historical vegetation growth in pasture dominated landscapes and therefore soil carbon inputs allowing for mapping of SOC across large catchment scales. Both Landsat and MODIS produced similar results and demonstrate that SOC can be reliably predicted at the large catchment scale and for different catchments in this environment with RMSE range of 0.79 to 1.06. The method and data can be applied globally and provides a new method for environmental assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abasalt 3adigital elevation models 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental assessment 3alabor 3aland use 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asolar radiation 3aspectral analysis 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aAustralia 0aSoil organic carbon 0aRemote sensing 0aVegetation indices 0aCatchment scale mapping1 aWells, Tony1 aHancock, G.R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 817 p.152690-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001800305500001900323520171500342592002802057650001002085650001402095650000802109650001802117650002502135650002002160650001202180650001402192650001602206650001802222650001802240650000902258650001302267650000902280650001502289650001902304651001202323651001202335700001702347700001802364700002402382773013502406856004802541852000902589655001202598IND50064309120221121054146.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006430912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1140-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinhauser, Georg10aArtificial radioactivity in environmental media (air, rainwater, soil, vegetation) in Austria after the Fukushima nuclear accident  ap. 2527-2534.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral environmental media in Austria were monitored for artificial radionuclides released during the Fukushima nuclear accident. Air (up to 1.2 mBq/m³ particulate ¹³¹I) and rainwater (up to 5.2 Bq/L ¹³¹I) proved to be the media best suited for the environmental monitoring, allowing also a temporal resolution of the activity levels. Significant regional differences in the wet deposition of ¹³¹I with rain could be observed within the city of Vienna during the arrival of the contaminated air masses. Forward-trajectory analysis supported the hypothesis that the contaminated air masses coming from the northwest changed direction to northeast over Northern Austria, leading to a strong activity concentration gradient over Vienna. In the course of the environmental monitoring of the Fukushima releases, this phenomenon—significant differences of ¹³¹I activity concentrations in rainwater on a narrow local scale (8.1 km)—appears to be unique. Vegetation (grass) was contaminated with ¹³¹I and/or ¹³⁷Cs at a low level. Soil (up to 22 Bq/kg ¹³⁷Cs) was only affected by previous releases (nuclear weapon tests, Chernobyl). Here, also significant local differences can be observed due to different deposition rates during the Chernobyl accident. The effective ecological half-lives of ¹³⁷Cs in soil were calculated for four locations in Austria. They range from 7 to 30 years. No Austrian sample investigated herein exceeded the detection limit for ¹³⁴Cs; hence, the Fukushima nuclear accident did not contribute significantly to the total radiocesium inventory in Austrian environmental media. The levels of detected radioactivity were of no concern for public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aaccidents 3aair 3aair pollution 3acesium radioisotopes 3adetection limit 3agrasses 3ahalf life 3ainventories 3apublic health 3aradioactivity 3arain 3aresearch 3asoil 3avegetation 3awet deposition 3aAustria 3aUkraine1 aMerz, Stefan1 aHainz, Dieter1 aSterba, Johannes H.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Apr., v. 20, no. 4 p.2527-2534dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1140-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003600153245014300189506011700332506007600449520163100525592002802156506003702184650002302221650002102244650001502265650002102280650001702301650001602318650001802334650002802352650001602380650002002396650001402416650001502430650001402445650001402459650001302473650001202486650001502498653002602513653001902539653002102558653002002579653002102599700003402620700002602654773011902680856008802799852000902887655001202896IND60761738820221207073652.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076173882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Paredes, Carlos Augusto10aPharmaceutical compounds used in the COVID-19 pandemic: A review of their presence in water and treatment techniques for their elimination  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, high consumption of antivirals, antibiotics, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this virus has been reported. Conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently remove these contaminants from water, becoming an emerging concern from the environmental field. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to address the current state of the literature on the presence and removal processes of these drugs from water bodies. It was found that the concentration of most of the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 increased during the pandemic in water bodies. Before the pandemic, Azithromycin concentrations in surface waters were reported to be in the order of 4.3 ng L⁻¹, and during the pandemic, they increased up to 935 ng L⁻¹. Laboratory scale studies conclude that adsorption and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be effective in the removal of these drugs. Up to more than 80% removal of Azithromycin, Chloroquine, Ivermectin, and Dexamethasone in aqueous solutions have been reported using these processes. Pilot-scale tests achieved 100% removal of Azithromycin from hospital wastewater by adsorption with powdered activated carbon. At full scale, treatment plants supplemented with ozonation and artificial wetlands removed all Favipiravir and Azithromycin, respectively. It should be noted that hybrid technologies can improve removal rates, process kinetics, and treatment cost. Consequently, the development of new materials that can act synergistically in technically and economically sustainable treatments is required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aantiviral agents 3aazithromycin 3achloroquine 3adexamethasone 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironment 3aglucocorticoids 3ahospitals 3aivermectin 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3apandemic 3aviruses 3awastewater 0aEmerging contaminants 0aCOVID-19 drugs 0aAqueous matrices 0aWater treatment 0aTreatment plants1 aRodríguez-Díaz, Joan Manuel1 aBoluda-Botella, Nuria0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152691-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010800165300001600273520117700289592002801466650000801494650001601502650000901518650001401527650001501541650001401556650003901570650001301609653002201622653003401644653001201678653001101690700001601701700001601717700002001733700001801753700001801771773011401789856008501903852000901988655001201997IND60610740120221118234245.0180829e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Wang12aA resonance Rayleigh scattering sensor for detection of Pb2+ ions via cleavage-induced G-wire formation  ap. 195-201.  aA resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) aptasensor was fabricated for detection of Pb²⁺via hairpin-like label-free substrate and G-wire for signal amplification. A hairpin-like DNA substrate contains a sequence in the loop labeled with ribonucleobase A and c-myc sequence in the stem. When hybridized with 8–17 DNAzyme in the presence of Pb²⁺, the sequence in the loop was activated and cleaved. Hundreds of c-myc sequences departing from the 8–17 DNAzyme yield nanowires superstructure called G-wire in the presence of Mg²⁺. The polymer G-wire was demonstrated by the RRS spectrum, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and AFM. The RRS intensity was enhanced by the product G-wires, and the RRS signal at 370nm was linear with the logarithm of Pb²⁺ concentration in the range of 2.0nM to 5.0μM. This method was selective for Pb²⁺ even coexisting with other metal ions at high concentrations and was successfully applied to the determination of Pb²⁺ in real samples. The aptasensor holds a great promise for universal RRS sensing platform for sensitive detection of various metal ions just by changing the sequence of the probe in the loop and DNAzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaptasensors 3alead 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3ananowires 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymers 0aDetection of Pb2+ 0aResonance Rayleigh scattering 0aDNAzyme 0aG-wire1 aZhang, Ying1 aFan, Yu Zhu1 aDong, Jiang Xue1 aLi, Nian Bing1 aLuo, Hong Qun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 336 p.195-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010900168520198500277592002802262650000802290650001302298650002002311650001202331650002102343650000902364650001602373650000802389650001902397650001302416650001302429650001102442650000902453651001002462651001502472653001302487653002102500653002002521653002702541653002402568700001602592700001702608700001702625700001202642700001902654700001502673700001502688700001802703700001602721773011902737856008802856852000902944655001202953IND60761738920221119094759.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076173892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xiang10aIce-core based assessment of nitrogen deposition in the central Tibetan Plateau over the last millennium  aAtmospheric nitrogen deposition is a unique source of bioavailable nitrogen for ecosystems in remote regions, and has vital impacts on ecological processes. Understanding variations of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in these regions remains challenging due to a lack of observations. Ice cores contain records of nitrogen species of nitrate (NO₃⁻) and ammonium (NH₄⁺), hence provide valuable long-term data to study past variations of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. In this study, we present an annually resolved record of NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ over the past millennium, derived from the Zangser Kangri (ZK) ice core in the central Tibetan Plateau. The concentration peaks of NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ coincide with those of Ca²⁺ (a dust tracer), indicating that variation of nitrogen species in the ZK ice core is largely driven by dust activities. An EOF analysis for all chemical species (Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, Na⁺, NH₄⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺) reveals significant but separate loadings of NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻ on EOF 2, suggesting an additional source of nitrogen, likely from biogenic emissions of terrestrial ecosystems. Over the past millennium, the EOF 2 series has relatively high values around 1300 CE and 1600 CE, and has increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution. These variations are likely driven by temperature-dependent biogenic emissions on the Tibetan Plateau. Analyses of seasonal air mass backward trajectories and wind fields find that the chemical concentrations in the ZK ice core are mostly influenced by the westerly, but South Asia summer monsoon plays an important role in the transport of nitrogen species generated from biogenic emissions. This is further confirmed by the significant correlation between EOF 2 series and the South Asian summer monsoon index. This study provides new insight into the preindustrial sources, natural variabilities and major drivers of nitrogen deposition on the Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aammonium 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3achemical species 3adust 3aenvironment 3aice 3amonsoon season 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3asummer 3awind 3aChina 3aSouth Asia 0aIce core 0aNitrogen species 0aTibetan Plateau 0aAtmospheric deposition 0aClimate variability1 aHou, Shugui1 aWu, Shuangye1 aPang, Hongxi1 aLiu, Ke1 aZhang, Wangbin1 aYu, Jinhai1 aSong, Jing1 aHuang, Renhui1 aLiu, Yaping0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006600162300001600228520125500244592002801499650001201527650001701539650001501556650001201571650001001583650001601593650001001609653002501619653002501644653002501669653002501694653003701719653002301756653002901779653003201808700001501840700001601855700001301871773012801884856008302012852000902095655001202104IND60478461020221119055616.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846102DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimár, I.10aDevelopment of female and male gametophytes in cereal species  ap. 321-335.  aThe first steps in studies on the female and male gametophytes of wheat involved the light microscope analysis of semi-thin sections of embryo sacs containing egg-cells developing <i>in planta</i>.

Therefore, we conducted a population-based, hospitalized CDI incidence study, compared the results with standard-of-care (SOC) CDI testing, and generalized the results for nationwide incidence estimates. Surveillance identified inpatients ≥50 years-of-age with diarrhea in nine Tokyo hospitals from December 17, 2018–March 30, 2020. A CDI case was defined as a patient with a PCR-positive/cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA)-positive stool or a PCR-positive stool and pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Incidence estimates were adjusted for the hospitalization share of participating hospitals and, in the sensitivity analysis, for missing CDI test results. SOC specimen collection and CDI testing occurred independently. Surveillance during 318 840 patient-days identified 4633 inpatients with diarrhea. Sixty-three CDI cases were identified; 11 (17·5%) had PMC, eight (12·7%) recurrent CDI, and nine (14·3%) died. The hospitalized CDI incidence was 97/100 000 population per year (PPY) in persons ≥50 years-of-age and, in the sensitivity analysis, 324/100 000 PPY. The incidence was 170 and 481/100 000 PPY in persons ≥65 and ≥85 years-of-age, respectively; these estimates increased to 569 and 1609/100 000 PPY in the sensitivity analysis, respectively. There were 12 primary SOC CDI cases in persons ≥50 years-of-age (18/100 000 PPY). The CDI incidence was high in older adults, with severe clinical consequences. SOC specimen collection and testing under-estimated CDI burden. There are >57 000 hospitalized CDI cases per year in Japan in persons ≥50 years-of-age. Public health interventions are needed to reduce the CDI burden in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3aJapan 3acolitis 3acytotoxicity 3adiarrhea 3amonitoring 3aneutralization tests 3apatients 3apublic health 0aClostridioides difficile 0aDisease burden 0aEpidemiology 0aHospital-onset diarrhea 0aIncidence 0aJapan1 aIshida, Junro1 aIto, Shuhei1 aGonzalez, Elisa1 aYoshizumi, Satoshi1 aZhang, Pingping1 aPride, Michael1 aGray, Sharon1 aFerreira, Cátia Matos1 aMinarovic, Nadia1 aAngulo, Frederick J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3120-77041 aMoïsi, Jennifer C.1 aJodar, Luis0 tAnaerobe.g2022 Aug., v. 76 p.102607-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.1026073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013700163300001800300520174700318592002802065650001602093650001902109650001102128650001402139650004302153650001102196650001402207650001302221650001202234650002202246650001302268650000702281650002802288650001102316650002702327650001302354700005502367700001802422700001302440700001502453700001502468773016402483856008202647852000902729655001202738IND60675850820221118174018.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067585082DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-019-02400-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, K.10aFate of ibuprofen under optimized batch biodegradation experiments using Micrococcus yunnanensis isolated from pharmaceutical sludge  ap. 8315-8328.  aIbuprofen, a frequently prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is a common environmental pollutant, and its increasing concentration in the environment leads to serious impacts. This concern has demanded a holistic scientific approach for the removal of pharmaceuticals and their by-products from the environment. Microbial degradation is an eco-friendly technique known to degrade complex molecules to simpler forms. The present study focuses on isolating the most potential bacterial strain from pharmaceutical industry site and investigates the biodegradation of ibuprofen. Among six isolated strains, one isolate KGP04 was identified as Micrococcus yunnanensis (GenBank: MG 493238), which exhibited the highest potential to degrade (~ 41.57%) ibuprofen before optimization. Taguchi-based L8 orthogonal array was used to optimize process parameters which improved the degradation rate by 83.50%. Drug concentration was reduced by 90.37% at optimum conditions (carbon 0.15%, nitrogen 0.1%, pH 7, inoculum size 2% (w/v), rpm 150, 12 h, 25 °C), as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Q-time of flight mass spectrometry demonstrated the ibuprofen degradation pathway followed by the strain resulting in various transformative products. Further, the effect of ibuprofen on human embryonic kidney 293 cells was also analyzed through the Alamar Blue assay, which exhibited lower toxicity on the cells treated with the degraded samples. These results indicate that the strain is a capable candidate for the degradation of pharmaceuticals and optimized conditions can be employed to remove the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and similar agents in a greener and economic manner from the pharmaceutical effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrococcus 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3aeffluents 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aibuprofen 3ainoculum 3akidneys 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3apH 3apharmaceutical industry 3asludge 3asustainable technology 3atoxicity1 aKaushik, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0979-97391 aThotakura, N.1 aRaza, K.1 aSharma, N.1 aNimesh, S.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.8315-8328dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-019-02400-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245014800203506007600351520120000427592002801627506003701655650002501692650002901717650001301746650001501759650001001774650002101784650002201805650002401827650001001851650001801861650002801879650001201907650001401919650001301933650001001946650001601956650002201972700002701994773011902021856007702140852000902217655001202226IND60650846520221207113502.0190710e20151224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065084652DNAL7 a10.3390/plants50100022doi7 aPMC48444122pmcid7 a271352222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJülke, Sabine10aResponse of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Roots with Altered Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP) Gene Expression to the Clubroot Disease and Salt Stress  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe clubroot disease of Brassicaceae is caused by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease is characterized by abnormal tumorous swellings of infected roots that result in reduced drought resistance and insufficient distribution of nutrients, leading to reduced crop yield. It is one of the most damaging diseases among cruciferous crops worldwide. The acquisition of nutrients by the protist is not well understood. Gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana clubroots indicate that lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) could be involved in disease development or at least in adaptation to the disease symptoms. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine the role of some, of the still enigmatic LTPs during clubroot development. For a functional approach, we have generated transgenic plants that overexpress LTP genes in a root specific manner or show reduced LTP gene expression. Our results showed that overexpression of some of the LTP genes resulted in reduced disease severity whereas the lipid content in clubs of LTP mutants seems to be unaffected. Additional studies indicate a role for some LTPs during salt stress conditions in roots of A. thaliana.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aclubroot 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adisease severity 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alipid content 3alipid transfer proteins 3amutants 3anutrients 3aprotists 3aroots 3asalt stress 3atransgenic plants1 aLudwig-Müller, Jutta,0 tPlants.g2015 Dec. 24, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants50100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014300164300001800307520222100325592002802546650001802574650002802592650001702620650001502637650002902652650003102681650002502712650002102737650001702758650001702775650001002792650001502802650002602817650001102843650001702854650001402871650001902885700002102904700002202925700001902947700002002966700002702986700002503013700006303038700001703101700002503118700001703143773013803160856008203298852000903380655001203389IND60750776920221121022842.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075077692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01616-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Ashia10aSilver nanoparticles biosynthesized from secondary metabolite producing marine actinobacteria and evaluation of their biomedical potential  ap. 1497-1516.  aBiosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from marine actinobacteria offers a promising avenue for exploring bacterial extracts as reducing and stabilizing agents. We report extracellular extracts of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (MOSEL-ME29) and Streptomyces sp. (MOSEL-ME28), identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for synthesis of AgNPs. Ultrafine silver nanoparticles were biosynthesized using the extracts of R. rhodochrous and Streptomyces sp. and their possible therapeutic applications were studied. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were established by HR-SEM/TEM, SAED, UV–Vis, EDS, XRD, and FTIR. UV–Vis spectra displayed characteristic absorption at 430 nm and 412 nm for AgNPs from Streptomyces sp. (S-AgNPs) and Rhodococcus sp. (R-AgNPs), respectively. HR-SEM/TEM, XRD, EDS analysis confirmed the spherical shape, crystalline nature, and elemental formation of silver. Crystallite or grain size was deduced as 5.52 nm for R-AgNPs and 35 nm for S-AgNPs. Zeta-potential indicated electrostatic negative charge for AgNPs, while FTIR revealed the presence of diverse functional groups. Disc diffusion assay indicated the broad-spectrum antibacterial potential of S-AgNPs with the maximum inhibition of B. subtilis while R-AgNPs revealed potency against P. aeruginosa at 10 µg/mL concentration. Biogenic AgNPs revealed antileishmanial activity and the IC₅₀ was calculated as 164 µg/mL and 184 µg/mL for R-AgNPs and S-AgNPs respectively. Similarly, the R-AgNPs and S-AgNPs revealed anti-cancer potential against HepG2 and the IC₅₀ was calculated as 49 µg/mL and 69 µg/mL for R-AgNPs and S-AgNPs, respectively. Moreover, the antioxidant activity showed significant results. MTT assay on RD cells, L20B cells, and Hep-2C indicated intensification in viability by reducing the concentration of R-AgNPs and S-AgNPs. The R-AgNPs and S-AgNPs inhibited sabin-like poliovirus (1TCID₅₀ infection in RD cells). Furthermore, hemocompatibility at low concentrations has been confirmed. Hence, it is concluded that biogenic-AgNPs has the potential to be used in diverse biological applications and that the marine actinobacteria are an excellent resource for fabrication of AgNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus C 3aRhodococcus rhodochrous 3aStreptomyces 3aabsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aantileishmanial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatibility 3abiosynthesis 3acrystallites 3agenes 3ananosilver 3asecondary metabolites 3asilver 3atherapeutics 3aviability 3azeta potential1 aTanveer, Faouzia1 aKhalil, Ali Talha1 aZohra, Tanzeel1 aKhamlich, Saleh1 aAlam, Muhammad Masroor1 aSalmān, Muḥammad,1 aʻAlī, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7835-06631 aIkram, Aamer1 aShinwari, Zabta Khan1 aMaaza, Malik0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2021 Oct., v. 114, no. 10 p.1497-1516dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-021-01616-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007700157300001400234520139800248592002801646650002401674650001801698650001901716650001801735650002101753650001101774650002301785650001901808650000901827650002601836650001901862650001101881650001701892700001601909700001401925700001701939700001801956773010501974856007302079852000902152655001202161IND60479320920221118034627.0160120e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047932092DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.121302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAamlid, T.

Our objective was to determine Kc, turf quality and growth rate under daily irrigation to field capacity (FC = −3 kPa tension) and drying. Minilysimeters installed in a green (mowing height 3–5 mm) and fairway (15 mm) were weighed during four periods of 4–10 days duration in 2009 and 2010. Crop coefficients on the second and subsequent days after irrigation were not significantly different among species and averaged 0.81 and 0.91 on green and fairway, respectively. On the first day after irrigation, the Kc varied from 1.67 to 2.85 and decreased in the order Agrostis capillaris > Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis > F. rubra ssp. commutata > A. stolonifera > A. canina on the green, and F. rubra ssp. litoralis > Lolium perenne > F.rubra ssp. rubra > Poa pratensis > F. rubra ssp. commutata on the fairway. Drying reduced the average daily height growth from 0.98 to 0.74 mm on the green and 1.97–1.72 mm on the fairway. Scores for turf quality were reduced but remained acceptable. Although the Kc during the first day after irrigation to FC may be overestimated due to latent soil heat and a possible oasis effect, we conclude that irrigation to FC should be avoided as it causes excessive water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis capillaris 3aFestuca rubra 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa pratensis 3acrop coefficient 3adrying 3aevapotranspiration 3afield capacity 3aheat 3airrigation scheduling 3alawns and turf 3amowing 3aturf grasses1 aKnox, J.

To this end, the biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were conducted using four different biomass samples (i.e., sunflower: Helianthus annuus) that were obtained from the different remediation sites. In particular, this study laid great emphasis on evaluating the inhibition for the anaerobic digestion (AD) process induced by endogenous heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) content in biomass. Despite the high levels of heavy metal contents (Cd: 58.4, Cu: 23.0, Ni: 2.01, Pb: 9.88, and Zn: 146 mg kg⁻¹) in the substrate for the AD process, the overall performance was comparable relative to the case of the references. Therefore, this study signified that the inhibition derived from heavy metals was nearly negligible, which suggested that biomass from the phytoremediation site could be used as a substrate for the AD process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amethane 3anickel 3aphytoremediation 3azinc 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aBiomass 0aCytotoxic effect 0aHeavy metals1 aPark, Ki Young1 aCho, Jinwoo1 aKwon, Eilhann E.1 aKim, Chae-yŏng,0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Dec., v. 243 p.1704-1709dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011700161300001600278520076200294592002801056650002501084650000901109650001201118650001401130650001701144650001401161650001401175651001001189653001001199653001001209653001001219653001001229653002501239653001701264653001401281653002101295653001101316653000901327700001401336700001701350700000701367773012801374856008301502852000901585655001201594IND60478461220221119055737.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846122DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHevia, F.10aQuality and yield in St. John's wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L.) harvested in different phenological stages  ap. 349-358.  aTwo experiments were conducted in the province of Ñuble, Chile during the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons with the objective of evaluating the effect of harvesting date on the yield and quality of St. John's wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L.) in the second year of production.

Nevertheless, the results indicate that the best time to harvest St. John's wort is when 10 to 20% of the flowers are open and the rest are in the bud stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum perforatum 3abuds 3acorolla 3aflowering 3aharvest date 3ahypericin 3aphenology 3aChile 0ayield 0ayield 0ayield 0ayield 0aHypericum perforatum 0aHypericaceae 0ahypericin 0aharvesting stage 0aflower 0aleaf1 aBerti, M.1 aWilckens, R.1 a, 0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.349-358dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013500168300001400303520132300317592002801640650001801668650001501686650001701701650001601718650001101734650001601745650001801761650001801779650001801797650002101815650002001836650001001856650002901866650001101895650001901906650001801925650000901943650001801952653001401970653001501984653002901999653000802028653001802036700001802054700005602072700001202128700001602140700002302156700001402179700001502193773011102208856008802319852000902407655001202416IND60582495720221117020358.0190405e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058249572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaji, D.10aSpecies-specific control of hepatocyte growth factor expression and production in adipocytes in a differentiation-dependent manner  ap. 39-48.  aHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mesenchymal cell-derived factor that regulates cell growth, cell motility, and morphogenesis. Since there are conflicting reports on HGF-producing cells, we herein examined HGF activity in conditioned medium (CM) of bovine and mouse preadipocytes before and after adipogenic differentiation. CM of bovine adipocytes and mouse preadipocytes induced the morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells that was inhibited by an NK4 HGF antagonist, whereas CM of bovine preadipocytes and mouse adipocytes did not. HGF mRNA expression was increased by a treatment with dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine in bovine as well as human cells, whereas it was decreased in rodent cells. It was unfortunate that HGF gene promoter activity failed to reflect HGF mRNA expression in these cells. After actinomycin D treatment, expression of HGF mRNA remained stable in pre- and differentiated bovine adipocytes and mouse preadipocytes, whereas rapidly decreased in mouse-differentiated adipocytes. These results indicate that expression and production of HGF are regulated in a species-specific adipogenic differentiation-dependent manner and suggest that the decrease in HGF mRNA in mouse differentiated adipocytes is, at least in part, mediated by differentiation-dependent loss of its stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactinomycin D 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aantagonists 3acattle 3acell growth 3acell movement 3adexamethasone 3aendocrinology 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahumans 3amammary glands 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amorphogenesis 0aAdipocyte 0aFibroblast 0aHepatocyte growth factor 0aNK4 0aMammary gland1 aSoliman, M.M.1 aKamikawa, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8530-60491 aIto, T.1 aAhmed, M.M.1 aOkamatsu-Ogura, Y.1 aSaito, M.1 aKimura, K.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2018 Jan., v. 62 p.39-48dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013600160520180400296592002802100650001202128650002002140650001702160650001202177650001602189700002502205773012702230856007402357852000902431655001202440IND60652327020221119163354.0190712e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065232702DNAL7 a10.3390/su100722262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKijewska, Kinga14aThe Concept of Urban Freight Transport Projects Durability and Its Assessment within the Framework of a Freight Quality Partnership  aThis article focuses on the role of Urban Freight Transport (UFT) projects in improving the life quality of city inhabitants. The main focus of the deliberations is the aspect of UFT projects&rsquo; durability. The authors take an original approach to the definition of UFT project durability and also provide the results of a research study carried out in 2018. This made it possible to furnish an answer to the research questions that boiled down to the analysis of the current status of the relevant academic literature, to attempt to define the total durability of a UFT project, and to indicate the critical gaps in perception among the key stakeholders of the projects. In this study, particular attention is paid to the terminological synthesis and the conclusion resulting from adopting induction and deduction as the methods of solving research study problems. A novelty is the approach adopted in the project evaluation emphasising the mentioned durability aspect as one of the major success factors. This is particularly important for implementation of a Freight Quality Partnership as a solution enabling development of sustainable systems of urban logistics. The solution was treated as a specific implementation project for which the issue of key importance is the identification of success factors in the context of satisfying the needs of diverse groups of UFT stakeholders. It should be stressed that durability of projects in the area of UFT is critically important, even though there is a significant conceptual gap in that regard. The research study involved the originally developed concept of the Pyramid of Stakeholders Survey. By means of this concept, FQP durability was analysed on the example of the experience gained in the course of the solution functioning in Szczecin.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreight 3aquality of life 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aurban areas1 aJedliński, Mariusz,0 tSustainability.g2018 June 28, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100722263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245015300180300001800333520165700351592002802008596005602036596005702092650004202149650002002191650003102211650001402242650002702256650001802283650002002301650001502321650002002336650001402356700003002370700003102400700003602431700002802467700003002495700003002525700002902555700006402584773013802648856008202786852000902868655001202877IND60750777120221116194452.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075077712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01628-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraiza-Cervantes, Carlos A.10aTranscript pattern analysis of Arf-family genes in the phytopathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici reveals the role of Arl3 in the virulence  ap. 1619-1632.  aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is an important plant pathogen that has been used to understand the virulence mechanisms that soil inhabiting fungi exhibit during the infection process. In F. oxysporum many of the virulence factors are secreted, and the secretion process requires the formation of vesicles. Arf family members, represented by Arf (ADP- Ribosylation Factor), Arl (Arf-like), and Sar (Secretion-associated and Ras-related) proteins, are involved in the vesicle creation process. In this study we identified the Arf family members in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, which includes seven putative proteins: Arf1, Arf3, Arl1 through Arl3, Arl8B, and Sar1. Quantification of the mRNA levels of each arf encoding gene revealed that the highest expression corresponds to arf1 in all tested conditions. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that no other Arf1 paralogue, such as Arf2 from yeast, is present in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The essential function suggested of Arf1 in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici was corroborated experimentally when, after several attempts, it was impossible to obtain a knockout mutant in arf1. Moreover, arl3 mRNA levels increased significantly when plant tissue was added as a sole carbon source, suggesting that the product of these genes could play pivotal roles during plant infection, the corresponding mutant ∆arl3 was less virulent compared to the wild-type strain. These results describe the role of arl3 as a critical regulator of the virulence in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and stablish a framework for the arf family members to be studied in deeper details in this phytopathogen.  aPublisher supplied data  a2.6cCoordinación de la Investigación Científica  a2.36cCoordinación de la Investigación Científica 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant tissues 3aregulator genes 3asoil fungi 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence1 aValle-Maldonado, Marco I.1 aPatiño-Medina, J.

The field is regularly harvested, and the hay is used as fodder. The area under investigation is situated directly alongside the protecting fence of the motorway. The soil of the area is classified as chernozem brown forest soil. In 2000 approximately 22,860 cars per month travelled on the motorway. The plant samples were taken at a distance of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 metres from the motorway. At each distance 10 samples were collected. After digestion with hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid the zinc, lead, cadmium and copper contents of the samples were analysed using an ICP spectrophotometer. After analysing the data it was established that for each of the heavy metals the concentration of metal in the plant samples decreased as the distance from the motorway grew. The measured zinc, cadmium and copper concentrations were similar to those reported by other authors (on average 44.9, 0.276 and 5.25 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), while the values of the lead concentration were lower than those published previously (on average 2.93 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). This may have been due to the widespread use of lead-free fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aforage 3aforest soils 3afuels 3ahay 3aheavy metals 3ahighways 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3ameadows 3anitric acid 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aHungary 0acadmium 0acadmium 0acadmium 0acadmium 0alead 0azinc 0acopper 0amicroelement concentration 0ameadow plants1 aNémeth, N.1 aKöles, P.1 aet al., 0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.371-376dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011900206300001800325520135600343592002801699596008001727596008001807650004401887650001601931650002501947650002401972650002701996650001402023650002302037650001502060650003702075650002402112650002002136650000702156650002202163650001102185650001502196650002502211700002002236700001302256700001602269773016402285856008202449852000902531655001202540IND60675851120221118174032.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067585112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-019-02413-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGönder, Z.

Taguchi experimental design method was applied to identify the optimized values of operating parameters for chemical oxygen demand, anionic surfactant and oil–grease removals. The effects of operating parameters on the removal of selected pollutants were investigated. The operating variables were selected as pH: 4–8; current density: 2.5–30 A/m²; stirring speed: 150–350 rpm. 84% chemical oxygen demand, 99.3% anionic surfactant and 82% oil–grease removal efficiencies were achieved under the optimized conditions. The operating cost was calculated as 9.67 $/m³ for these conditions. The analysis of variance results indicated that the current density had the greatest effect on the removals. EC sludge produced at the optimum conditions was analyzed using environmental scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X–ray and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The results indicated that Taguchi design method was suitable to determine the optimum values of operating parameters for EC treatment of carwash effluents. High chemical oxygen demand, anionic surfactant and oil–grease removals showed that electrocoagulation process using Ti electrode can be used for the removal of organic matters from carwash effluents.  aPublisher supplied data  a53606cScientific Research Project Coordination Unit of Istanbul University  a25085cScientific Research Project Coordination Unit of Istanbul University 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aanalysis of variance 3aanionic surfactants 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeffluents 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aexperimental design 3aoperating costs 3apH 3apollution control 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aBalcıoğlu, G.1 aKaya, Y.1 aVergili, I.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.8041-8052dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-019-02413-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010400162300001800266520137800284592002801662596007101690596006801761596003201829650001601861650001701877650002301894650001301917650001901930650001401949650003101963650002501994650001802019650001302037650002602050650002202076651001002098700001502108700001802123700001202141700001702153700001402170700001602184700005802200773013802258856008202396852000902478655001202487IND60750777220221116194656.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075077722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01631-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Feina10aSchumannella soli sp. nov., a novel actinomycete isolated from mangrove soil by in situ cultivation  ap. 1657-1667.  aA novel actinobacterial strain, designated 10F1D-1ᵀ, was isolated from soil sample collected from Futian mangrove nature reserve, China using of the in situ cultivation technique. Preliminary analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain 10F1D-1ᵀ was the member of genus Schumannella with sharing highest sequence similarity (99.7%) to Schumannella luteola DSM 23141ᵀ. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and core proteome consistently exhibited that strain 10F1D-1ᵀ formed a monophyletic clade with Schumannella luteola DSM 23141ᵀ. Comparative genomic analyses clearly separated strain 10F1D-1ᵀ from the only species of the genus Schumannella based on average nucleotide identity (ANI), average amino acid identity (AAI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values below the thresholds for species delineation. The genome of strain 10F1D-1ᵀ contains the biosynthetic gene clusters for osmoprotectants to adapt to the salt environment of mangrove.

The plant genetic material was cultivated in the field and laboratory under two different water regimes (irrigated and non-irrigated). High significant differences were found for promptness index (PI), coleoptile length (CL) and root length (RL) under stress and non-stress conditions, indicating the presence of genetic variation and the possibility of selection for these traits. High correlation coefficients were found between PI, germination stress index (GSI) and stress tolerance index (STI), displaying a high association between the indices of field and laboratory predictors of drought tolerance. Field and laboratory predictors of drought tolerance showed that most of the QTLs controlling drought tolerance criteria in <i>Agropyron</i> are located on chromosomes 3E, 5E and 7E, which collectively constitute 84.3% of the additive genetic variance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgropyron 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3achromosome addition 3achromosomes 3acoleoptiles 3acorrelation 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic background 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3agermination 3aquantitative trait loci 3astress tolerance 3awheat 3aIran 0aQTLs 0aQTLs 0aQTLs 0aQTLs 0adrought tolerance 0astress tolerance index 0agermination stress index1 aMohammadi, R.1 aSutka, J.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.377-381dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006600164300001600230520124500246592002801491650002101519650002301540650001901563650001201582650001401594650001501608650001101623650001701634650002001651650001301671650002101684650002001705650001701725650001701742653001201759653001201771653001201783653001201795653001701807653001101824653002201835700002101857700001501878700001301893773012801906856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60478461620221119055601.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846162DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegedűs, Z.10aProtein and wet gluten contents in winter wheat grain samples  ap. 383-387.  aThe milling and baking quality of wheat is mainly determined by the genetic basis, but may also be influenced by management techniques. Series of winter wheat varieties were examined under identical agronomic conditions in the experimental years of 1996-2001. Weed control, the rate and application time of nitrogen top dressing, the use of insecticide and fungicide and the climate of the production year were evaluated as main factors. In the present study two major characteristics: the protein and gluten content of grain samples, were examined. The effect of nitrogen fertilization proved to have the strongest impact on both quality indexes. no significant quality differences were induced by the various means of weed control. Plant protection treatments had a rather diverse effect on the contents of the protein and gluten in certain years. The protein and gluten values were correlated in all the experimental treatments, but the level of the correlation showed considerable variation. The effect of crop year proved to be the strongest, followed by fertilization, from among the quality-determining factors. The protein versus gluten correlation was also found to be the closest in the case of nitrogen top dressing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3aapplication timing 3abaking quality 3aclimate 3acrop year 3afungicides 3agluten 3ainsecticides 3amilling quality 3anitrogen 3aplant protection 3aprotein content 3aweed control 3awinter wheat 0aprotein 0aprotein 0aprotein 0aprotein 0awinter wheat 0agluten 0aagronomic impacts1 aSzentpétery, Z.1 aKassai, K.1 aet al., 0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.383-387dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012500169520144300294592002801737650001701765650002301782650001701805650001601822650001501838650001401853650001501867650002201882653002301904653003801927653002801965653002801993700001902021700001502040700001802055700001302073700002002086773011902106856008802225852000902313655001202322IND60761739420221119095250.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076173942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zheng10aHoneycomb-like holey Co3O4 membrane triggered peroxymonosulfate activation for rapid degradation of organic contaminants  aHeterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are commonly employed for the degradation of recalcitrant contaminants, however, practical application of heterogeneous AOPs has been limited by their low activation efficiency and inefficient utilization of radicals. Herein, this study demonstrates for the first time that 2D honeycomb-like holey membranes assembled by Co₃O₄ nanosheets, serve as an excellent activator for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and aid in rapid pollutant removal. The Co₃O₄ membrane achieved 100% target pollutant ranitidine removal and a membrane retention time of only ~385 ms with the degradation rate 3–5 orders of magnitude faster than that achieved by conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Ranitidine degradation was maintained at >90% for 13 h of continuous-flow operation at a high flux of 176 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹. Furthermore, the Co₃O₄ membrane could also effectively degrade several recalcitrant pollutants, including pharmaceutical personal care products, phenols, and dyes. SO₄•– and •OH were identified as the primary reactive oxygen species in the Co₃O₄ membrane/PMS system, with Co providing the active site for PMS activation. This strategy of membrane-based AOP treatment offers helpful guidance for the design of other efficient heterogeneous catalytic systems and presents a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of conventional heterogeneous catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt oxide 3aenvironment 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3apollution control 0aCatalytic membrane 0aTransition metal oxide nanosheets 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aReactive oxygen species1 aMeng, Chenchen1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Shaoze1 aYang, Bo1 aZhang, Zhenghua0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01478naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010200163300001800265520034900283592002800632650002300660650001500683650001500698650001200713653002900725653002300754653002400777653002200801653002800823700002200851700001900873700002000892773011100912856008401023852000901107655001201116IND60599473220221121220704.0180702e20140514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059947322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.03.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing13aAn improved preparation and a new application of trichloromethylcarbinols from enolizable ketones  ap. 3151-3153.  aWe report an improved method for the preparation of trichloromethylcarbinols from enolizable ketones.

It has since become one of the major invasive species of the Great Lakes. The mechanisms through which round goby has become a successful invader are poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that phenotypic plasticity of species may influence their establishment, spread, and impact. If a species is phenotypically plastic, it could more easily adapt to a variety of environments. We examine whether phenotypic variation is present in round goby in the Laurentian Great Lakes and whether morphological variation in dorsal and lateral shape is related to habitat type and time since invasion. Morphological variation in preserved round goby specimens was analyzed for dorsal and lateral shape differences between lake, large river, and river habitats, waterbody of origin (Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, Simcoe) and time since initial invasion (i.e., early, mid, recent) using a Procrustes ANOVA and visualized using a principal component analysis. There is significant variation in body shape among lake and river populations, which may be due to differences in water flows between these habitats. Lake specimens have an overall deeper body shape, whereas river specimens have an overall shallow body shape and large river specimens are intermediate in shape. The results of this study help better understand what morphological mechanisms facilitate invasions and provide valuable information for management decisions related to spread of round goby in the Great Lakes basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3abasins 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asurface water 3aEurope 3aMichigan 3aOntario1 aCampbell, Sara E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7195-88981 aMandrak, Nicholas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8335-96810 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2021 Sept., v. 104, no. 9 p.1089-1102dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01138-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009600164300001600260520094800276592002801224650002101252650004001273650002401313650001601337650001001353650001201363650002801375650001501403650002601418650001401444650001401458700001501472700001601487700001501503700001801518773009501536856008301631852000901714655001201723IND60083290520221121224650.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008329052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Zhen10aEngineering Escherichia coli for efficient production of 5-aminolevulinic acid from glucose  ap. 492-498.  a5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) recently received much attention due to its potential applications in many fields. In this study, we developed a metabolic strategy to produce ALA directly from glucose in recombinant Escherichia coli via the C5 pathway. The expression of a mutated hemA gene, encoding a glutamyl-tRNA reductase from Salmonella arizona, significantly improved ALA production from 31.1 to 176mg/L. Glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase from E. coli was found to have a synergistic effect with HemAᴹ from S. arizona on ALA production (2052mg/L). In addition, we identified a threonine/homoserine exporter in E. coli, encoded by rhtA gene, which exported ALA due to its broad substrate specificity. The constructed E. coli DALA produced 4.13g/L ALA in modified minimal medium from glucose without adding any other co-substrate or inhibitor. This strategy offered an attractive potential to metabolic production of ALA in E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella enterica subsp. arizonae 3aaminolevulinic acid 3aengineering 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglutamyl-tRNA reductase 3ahomoserine 3asubstrate specificity 3asynergism 3athreonine1 aWang, Yang1 aGu, Pengfei1 aWang, Qian1 aQi, Qingsheng0 tMetabolic engineering.g2011 Sept., v. 13, no. 5 p.492-498dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012600204300001800330520186100348592002802209650001002237650002102247650001602268650001402284650001302298650002502311650001402336650001502350650001102365650001902376650003502395650001102430650000702441650001902448650001302467650001702480650002402497650001402521650002202535700005702557700006502614700005902679700006202738700005702800700005702857773013302914856008203047852000903129655001203138IND60750777620221116194737.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075077762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-021-01134-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiri, Sandip1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9338-833910aRole of biogeochemical parameters in delineating suitable habitats of juvenile Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) within an estuary  ap. 1057-1072.  aThis investigation characterized the relationship between percentage occurrences of three size classes of Hilsa juveniles (3–5, 5.1–10, and 10.1–15 cm) and six biogeochemical parameters (water temperature, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH) in the lower part of the tidal riverine to the entire estuarine stretch of Hooghly. These relationships helped us determine the ranges of each biogeochemical parameter for different suitability criteria in three seasons, pre-monsoon (February–May), monsoon (June–September), and post-monsoon (October–January). Salinity had the highest weight (0.37–0.39) followed by chlorophyll-a (0.26–0.30) and turbidity (0.12–0.20). The geospatial data of the biogeochemical parameters were interpolated followed by reclassification with the suitability ranges, separately for each season. These reclassified data were integrated into GIS-based modeling by a multi-criteria decision-making technique (analytical hierarchy process) to generate the habitat suitability maps of juvenile Hilsa. The model-derived information was verified with the indigenous knowledge of the fishers regarding the suitable habitat of juvenile Hilsa by conducting group discussions at 13 locations along the entire study area. The degree of agreement/disagreement between the model and the field information was determined by measuring Kendall’s tau (0.81–0.96) and Kappa coefficients (0.77–0.86), which indicated a strong agreement. In total, 3.80%, 10.12%, and 31.08% of the total river-estuarine area considered for the present study were identified as highly suitable for juvenile Hilsa during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. This mapping can act as baseline information for the policymakers for sustainable Hilsa fishing keeping in view the livelihood of fishers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHilsa 3aTenualosa ilisha 3achlorophyll 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3aindigenous knowledge 3ajuveniles 3alivelihood 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aoxygen 3apH 3ariparian areas 3asalinity 3aspatial data 3ataxonomic revisions 3aturbidity 3awater temperature1 aChanda, Abhra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3280-19591 aMondal, Partho Protim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2655-34501 aSamanta, Sourav1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0756-86621 aChakraborty, Kunal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6940-93551 aMaity, Sourav1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2337-54571 aHazra, Sugata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4046-70300 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2021 Sept., v. 104, no. 9 p.1057-1072dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01134-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245011500170300001400285520185900299592002802158650003002186650002702216650001702243650001302260650001202273650001902285650001902304650002802323650001302351650002502364650001802389650001602407650003702423650002302460650001502483650001302498650002402511650001102535653002902546653002702575653000902602653001202611653001102623653001202634700002602646700002202672700002502694700002602719773009802745856008102843852000902924655001202933IND60582496320221117020502.0190405e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058249632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2017.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgyri, Anthoula A.10aEffect of high pressure processing on the survival of Salmonella Enteritidis and shelf-life of chicken fillets  ap. 55-64.  aHigh pressure processing (HPP) is a preservation technology alternative to heat treatment that is mild for food, but effectively inactivates the spoilage microbiota and foodborne pathogens of several foods. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of HPP on Salmonella ser. Enteritidis, indigenous microbiota and shelf-life of chicken fillets. Chicken fillets were inoculated with S. Enteritidis at three different initial inocula (3, 5, 7 log CFU/g), packed under vacuum, treated or not with HPP (500 MPa/10 min) and stored at 4 and 12 °C. Total viable counts, S. Enteritidis, pseudomonads, Brochothrix thermosphacta, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts/molds populations were determined in parallel with sensory analysis of non-inoculated samples. The HPP resulted in the reduction of the pathogen population below the detection limit of the enumeration method (0.48 log CFU/g), irrespective of the inoculum. During the shelf life of the HPP samples, the pathogens population remained below or near the detection limit of the enumeration method at both temperatures, except from the high inoculum case that an increase was observed at 12 °C. At the low inoculum level, the pathogen could not be detected with the enrichment method after the first storage days (2nd day for 4 °C and 0 day for 12 °C). The survival of Salmonella strains was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and it was shown that the survival of the different strains depended on the inoculum and storage temperature. Regarding the indigenous microbiota, Br. thermosphacta was reported for the first time to be the main spoilage microorganism that survived and dominated after the HPP. From the results it was evident that, HPP may enhance the safety and increase the shelf life (6 at 4 °C and 2 days at 12 °C) of chicken meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3achicken meat 3achickens 3afillets 3afood pathogens 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ainoculum 3alactic acid bacteria 3amolds (fungi) 3aplate count 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage temperature 3ayeasts 0aHigh pressure processing 0aSalmonella Enteritidis 0aPFGE 0aChicken 0aSafety 0aQuality1 aPapadopoulou, Olga S.1 aNisiotou, Aspasia1 aTassou, Chrysoula C.1 aChorianopoulos, Nikos0 tFood microbiology.g2018 Apr., v. 70 p.55-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2017.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245006900163300001600232500001500248520080500263592002801068650002201096650002101118650001501139650001701154650001301171653003101184700001701215700001801232773009901250856004801349852000901397655001201406IND4483829920221120130507.0120715e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448382992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-009-0070-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Siying,10aKinematics and forces of a flexible body in Karman vortex street  ap. 556-561.  a2019-12-05  aExperiments of a flexible filament in the wake of a cylinder and in free stream were conducted in a vertical soap film tunnel.

The experiment and numerical results revealed that different from that in free stream, the filament in Karman vortex street flapped at the same frequency as the vortex street, and with smaller amplitude and larger curvature. The filament suffered an evident thrust in Karman vortex street, while a drag appeared in the case of free stream. The dependence of the drag coefficient on the phase relation between the movement of the filament and the Karman vortex street was also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3adrag coefficient 3akinematics 3aaerodynamics 3aair flow 0amathematics and statistics1 aJia, LaiBing1 aYin, Xiezhen,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2009 Feb., v. 54, no. 4 p.556-561dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0070-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018100168300001600349500001900365520199500384592002802379650001802407650001902425650001402444650002402458650001502482650001702497650001002514650001302524650001602537650001502553650000902568650004402577650003302621650001602654650002502670700002402695700006002719700005802779773011902837856008202956852000903038655001203047IND60727303520221121033327.0210210e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072730352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-020-03032-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwibedi, Vagish10aResponse surface statistical optimization of fermentation parameters for resveratrol production by the endophytic fungus Arcopilus aureus and its tyrosinase inhibitory activity  ap. 627-644.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOBJECTIVE: The present investigation primarily focusses on enhancement of resveratrol production by endophytic production from the endophytic fungus, Arcopilus aureus via one variable at a time approach (OVAT) followed by statistical approach using response surface methodology (RSM). The paper also highlights the characterization of fungal resveratrol using spectroscopic techniques. Further the tyrosinase inhibitory property was also explored in this communication for its possible use as a cosmeceutical ingredient. RESULTS: Optimization of physicochemical and nutritional parameters using OVAT approach exhibited 1.23-fold enhancement in production of resveratrol when compared to initial yield, 89.1 ± 0.08 µg/mL. Further RSM resulted in 1.49-fold enhancement in resveratrol production i.e. 133.53 µg/ml. Further, 25 mg of fungal resveratrol in pure form was obtained from the spent broth of Arcopilus aureus by column chromatography using a mobile phase comprising of MeOH: DCM in a ratio of 1.75:98.25. Further its purity on TLC was checked using 5% MeOH: DCM as mobile phase. Symmetrical peak with Rₜ of 3.36 min using a C18 reverse phase column confirmed the homogeneity of the purified fungal resveratrol with standard resveratrol and further corroborated by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HR-MS analysis. Fungal resveratrol exhibited a good tyrosinase inhibition with an IC₅₀ of 2.654 ± 0.432 µg/mL as compared to Kojic acid (1.329 ± 0.333). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has provided sufficient lead that process optimization techniques can complement each other for optimized production of bioactive compounds by microorganisms apart from strain improvement techniques which are generally adopted in the industry. The enhancement of resveratrol production by Arcopilus aureus by process optimization further opens up avenues for strain improvement for commercial resveratrol production through fermentation for nutraceutical and cosmeceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3achromatography 3acosmetics 3adietary supplements 3aendophytes 3afermentation 3afungi 3aindustry 3aingredients 3akojic acid 3alead 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aresponse surface methodology 3aresveratrol 3astatistical analysis1 aRath, Santosh Kumar1 aPrakash, Ranjana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4628-64221 aSaxena, Sanjai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0025-83620 tBiotechnology letters.g2021 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.627-644dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-03032-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245010600161300001600267520114600283592002801429650002001457650001101477650002301488650001001511650002301521650001401544650001201558650003001570650002201600650001801622650001401640650002801654650001101682653001101693653001101704653001101715653001101726653001701737653002401754653001701778700002001795700001501815700001301830773012801843856008201971852000902053655001202062IND60478462120221119055809.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846212DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarsai, I.10aComparative mapping and QTL analysis of early spring adaptation traits in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  ap. 283-294.  aThe possibilities latent in molecular marker-based QTL analyses are presented through the example of studying winter survival and heading date in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). The whole range of QTL experiments consists of several important steps, through which answers are found to the following questions: (1) How many QTLs are involved and where do they map, (2) How does the environment influence the effect of a QTL region (environment × QTL interactions), (3) When and where are the genes determining the given trait expressed (QTL dynamics), (4) What interactions occur between these QTLs and pathways leading to specific phenotypes, and (5) How consistent is the effect of a QTL region in different genetic backgrounds and in a wider range of germplasms (comparative mapping and association studies)? This knowledge then makes it possible to continue these experiments in the direction of marker-assisted selection and/or gene isolation through marker saturation of the relevant chromosomal regions and map-based cloning. The latter can give an insight into the exact mechanism through which the gene determines the phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agermplasm 3aheading 3amarker-assisted selection 3amolecular cloning 3aoverwintering 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3aspring 0abarley 0abarley 0abarley 0abarley 0aQTL analysis 0acomparative mapping 0aheading date1 aMészáros, K.,1 aSzűcs, P.1 aet al., 0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.283-294dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001800299520031700317592002800634650002200662650001700684650002100701650002300722650002300745653003800768653001600806653002400822653006700846700002700913700002800940700002900968773011100997856008401108852000901192655001201201IND60599473520221120082001.0180702e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059947352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.03.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarandi, Ghasem10aCatalyst-free synthesis of 3-(alkylamino)-2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-8-carboxylic acids via a three-component condensation  ap. 3052-3054.  aThe synthesis of a number of 3-(alkylamino)-2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-8-carboxylic acids via a facile route involving the reaction between 2-amino-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid, benzaldehyde derivatives, and isonitriles is reported.

In theory, replacing the hydrolysis of disaccharides by a phosphorolytic cleavage reaction provides an opportunity to increase the ATP yield on the disaccharide. To test this concept, we first deleted the native maltose metabolism genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The knockout strain showed no maltose-transport activity and a very low residual maltase activity (0.03μmolmgprotein⁻¹min⁻¹). Expression of a maltose phosphorylase gene from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and the MAL11 maltose-transporter gene resulted in relatively slow growth (μₐₑᵣₒbᵢc 0.09±0.03h⁻¹). Co-expression of Lactococcus lactis β-phosphoglucomutase accelerated maltose utilization via this route (μₐₑᵣₒbᵢc 0.21±0.01h⁻¹, μₐₙₐₑᵣₒbᵢc 0.10±0.00h⁻¹). Replacing maltose hydrolysis with phosphorolysis increased the anaerobic biomass yield on maltose in anaerobic maltose-limited chemostat cultures by 26%, thus demonstrating the potential of phosphorolysis to improve the free-energy conservation of disaccharide metabolism in industrial microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis 3aLactococcus lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abiomass production 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrolysis 3amaltose 3amaterial flow analysis 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3aphosphorylase1 aYilmaz, Duygu1 aSuir, Erwin1 aPronk, Jack T.1 aDaran, Jean-Marc1 avan Maris, Antonius J.A.0 tMetabolic engineering.g2011 Sept., v. 13, no. 5 p.518-526dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245005500166506010400221506007600325520107300401592002801474506003701502650001601539650002201555650001901577650001601596650001001612650004301622650000901665650001801674653001201692653002001704653000901724653001701733653001501750700001901765700002001784700002201804700001701826700002501843700001901868773011901887856008802006852000902094655001202103IND60761739920221207064643.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076173992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Xin10aTransport of marine tracer phage particles in soil  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine phages have been applied to trace ground- and surface water flows. Yet, information on their transport in soil and related particle intactness is limited. Here we compared the breakthrough of two lytic marine tracer phages (Pseudoalteromonas phages PSA-HM1 and PSA-HS2) with the commonly used Escherichia virus T4 in soil- and sand-filled laboratory percolation columns. All three phages showed high mass recoveries in the effluents and a higher transport velocity than non-reactive tracer Br⁻. Comparison of effluent gene copy numbers (CN) to physically-determined phage particle counts or infectious phage counts showed that PSA-HM1 and PSA-HS2 retained high phage particle intactness (Iₚ > 81%), in contrast to T4 (Iₚ < 36%). Our data suggest that marine phages may be applied in soil to mimic the transport of (bio-) colloids or anthropogenic nanoparticles of similar traits. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) thereby allows for highly sensitive quantification and thus for the detection of even highly diluted marine tracer phages in environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia 3aPseudoalteromonas 3abacteriophages 3aenvironment 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3asurface water 0aViruses 0aParticle tracer 0aSoil 0aBreakthrough 0aIntactness1 aKallies, René1 aHild, Konstanze1 aHildebrandt, Anke1 aHarms, Hauke1 aChatzinotas, Antonis1 aWick, Lukas Y.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152704-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005000160520073600210592002800946650001300974650002100987650001901008650001201027700002801039700002001067700002201087773012701109856007401236852000901310655001201319IND60652327820221119163421.0190712e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065232782DNAL7 a10.3390/su100722332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernoster, Indy10aOverconfidence, Optimism and Entrepreneurship  aOverconfidence is one of the alleged drivers for market entry. However, establishing its effect is challenging and much of the existing entrepreneurship literature confusingly conflates overconfidence with optimism. In the present study, we use validated scales to analyze the relationship between overconfidence and two important aspects of entrepreneurship, while explicitly controlling for optimism. Specifically, we study the role of overconfidence in developing intentions about entering entrepreneurship as well as how overconfidence relates to entrepreneurial orientation. Our findings show that overconfidence is related to intended market entry but not to the market position (entrepreneurial orientation) of the business.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemotions 3aentrepreneurship 3ahuman behavior 3amarkets1 aRietveld, Cornelius  A.1 aThurik, A.

The low reaction rate registered in this reaction was investigated in terms of the effect of the alcohol on the physicochemical–enzymatic stability of the biocatalyst and the interaction of the substrates with the catalytic triad at a molecular level. The effect of contacting 2-propanol:H₂O mixture on Novozym® 435 was investigated at 45°C for an extended period of time (8 days). The mixture dissolves the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) that constitutes the support of the Candida antarctica B lipase (CALB). Additionally, the alcohol diffuses into the biocatalyst's beads remaining strongly adsorbed (the alcohol desorption is evidenced only upon heating at 187°C) and altering the inner texture of the biocatalyst's beads. Additionally, 2-propanol modifies the secondary structure of the enzyme by decreasing the β-sheet contribution and increasing the β-turn structure. The molecular modeling of the interaction of R/S-ketoprofen and 2-propanol with the catalytic triad of the lipase provides evidences that the secondary alcohol exerts an important steric hindrance for the reaction to proceed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3abiocatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aesterification 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amolecular models 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3asolvents 3atexture1 aJosé, Carla1 aCollins, Sebastián E.1 aBonetto, Rita D.1 aFerreira, María Luján1 aBriand, Laura E.0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2012 Nov., v. 83 p.108-119dElsevier B.V.x1381-11777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010500172300001800277520113700295592002801432650001701460650002201477650002701499650002701526650002101553650001601574650002701590650001101617650000901628650002001637650001101657651001401668700001901682700001801701700001801719700002001737700001601757773013301773856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60750777920221116194715.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075077792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-021-01141-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Aaron C.10aDemographic characteristics of sharks in the sublittoral environment of the Turks and Caicos Islands  ap. 1121-1137.  aBaited drumlines were employed to assess the relative abundance and demographics of sharks in three distinct but contiguous areas of the sublittoral environment of the eastern Caicos Bank, with a view to equipping policy-makers in the Turks and Caicos Islands with information pertinent to the conservation of local shark populations. Overall, the catch was dominated by nurse Ginglymostoma cirratum and Caribbean reef Carcharhinus perezi sharks, but tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, lemon Negaprion brevirostris, blacknose Carcharhinus acronotus and great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran sharks were also captured. Size distributions were consistent with a combination of sexually mature and immature animals for most of these species. The results confirm that shallow sand flat, deep sand flat and coral reef environments are utilised by a variety of shark species and life stages, including the movement of individuals between these areas. Therefore, current marine protected areas in the Turks and Caicos Islands, which mostly centre on nearshore and coral reef environments, probably afford local shark populations only partial protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcharhinus 3aGaleocerdo cuvier 3aGinglymostoma cirratum 3aNegaprion brevirostris 3aSphyrna mokarran 3acoral reefs 3ademographic statistics 3alemons 3asand 3asexual maturity 3asharks 3aCaribbean1 aSmith, Camilla1 aBell, Kathryn1 aGomez, Travis1 aJourdan, Adrian1 aLenain, Eva0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2021 Sept., v. 104, no. 9 p.1121-1137dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01141-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008600165300001400251520122100265592002801486650001001514650001501524650001301539650002401552650002201576650001201598650001901610650001401629650001101643650001401654650001001668650001501678653002301693653001401716653001001730653002801740700001801768700002101786773011201807856008501919852000902004655001202013IND60610741220221118234115.0180829e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradu, C.10aDegradation of the chlorophenoxyacetic herbicide 2,4-D by plasma-ozonation system  ap. 52-56.  aA novel advanced oxidation process based on the combination of ozonation with non-thermal plasma generated in a pulsed corona discharge was developed for the oxidative degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in water. The pulsed corona discharge in contact with liquid, operated in oxygen, produced 3.5mgL⁻¹ ozone, which was subsequently introduced in the ozonation reactor. The solution to be treated was continuously circulated between the plasma reactor and the ozonation reactor. The system was tested for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and considerably improved performance as compared to ozonation alone, both with respect to the removal of the target compound and to mineralization. The apparent reaction rate constant for 2,4-D removal was 0.195min⁻¹, more than two times higher than the value obtained in ozonation experiments. The mineralization reached more than 90% after 60min treatment and the chlorine balance confirms the absence of quantifiable amounts of chlorinated by-products. The energy efficiency was considerably enhanced by shortening the duration of the discharge pulses, which opens the way for further optimization of the electrical circuit design.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3aelectronic circuits 3aenergy efficiency 3aliquids 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozonation 3aozone 3apollutants 0aNon-thermal plasma 0aOzonation 0a2,4-D 0aPulsed corona discharge1 aMagureanu, M.1 aParvulescu, V.I.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 336 p.52-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245009800202300001800300520141100318592002801729650002201757650004401779650001501823650001301838650001801851650003001869650001801899650001901917650002701936650001901963650001201982650001001994650000702004650001202011650002102023650002702044650002702071650002502098650001502123700001402138700001502152700001302167700001602180773016402196856008202360852000902442655001202451IND60675851920221118174238.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067585192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-019-02430-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurbuz, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3561-388910aTreatment of textile effluents through bio-composite column: decolorization and COD reduction  ap. 8653-8662.  aTextile is one of the most important sectors generating large volume of liquid pollutants. Hence, one of the great challenges is to design effective adsorbent to treat wastewaters prior to their discharge in water streams. This study emphasizes the use of microorganisms for the treatment of recalcitrant and toxic dyes being caused by textile industries. For this aim, the azo dyes of Reactive Red 3, Reactive Yellow 42, Reactive Black 5, Reactive Blue 4 and Acid Orange 74, which are extensively used in textile industry, were treated by dispersed Aspergillus niger. Decolorizing of basic dyes was successful at higher pH values, while acid dyes’ removal was possible only at low pH values. Removal efficiency after 24 h incubation for R. Red, R. Black and R. Blue reached to 95% in batch process. FTIR analysis of 24-h treatment showed change in peaks when compared to control dye spectra indicating biodegradation of dyes after treatment. Then, the fungi were embedded in polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate-glycidyl methacrylate [poly (HEMA-co-GMA)] to fabricate bio-composite columns. Removal of color and reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total solids and total organic carbon of industrial textile effluent were studied through the bio-composite column. COD reduction and color removal of textile effluents were 77.5% and 99.2%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aazo dyes 3abatch systems 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradation 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3afabrics 3afungi 3apH 3astreams 3atextile industry 3atextile mill effluents 3atotal dissolved solids 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater1 aOzcan, A.1 aCiftci, H.1 aAcet, O.1 aOdabasi, M.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.8653-8662dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-019-02430-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245007400168300001600242520216300258592002802421650002402449650001702473650001102490650001602501650002402517650002302541650002902564650001502593650001402608650002502622650001302647650001702660650003902677650001802716650002002734650001202754650002702766650002202793650001502815650001102830650000802841650001902849650001402868650001002882653001002892653001002902653001002912653001002922653000802932653001102940653002402951653002502975653002603000700001203026700001603038700001303054773012803067856008203195852000903277655001203286IND60478462320221119055920.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846232DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolnár-Láng, M.10aMolecular cytogenetic analysis of wheat-alien hybrids and derivatives  ap. 303-311.  aNew wheat × barley, wheat × <i>Aegilops biuncialis</i> and wheat × rye hybrids were produced with the aim of alien gene transfer from these species into wheat. Amphiploids were produced with the help of colchicine treatment from the last two combinations. The new wheat × barley hybrids were multiplied in tissue culture because of the high degree of sterility and then pollinated with wheat to obtain backcross progenies. Wheat-barley chromosome pairing was detected using genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization (GISH) in two combinations (Mv9 kr1 × Igri, Asakazekomugi × Manas). <i>In vitro</i> conditions caused an increase in chromosome arm association frequency in both combinations and in fertility in some regenerants. Five wheat-barley translocations were produced in a wheat background and characterized through the combination of cytogenetic and molecular genetic approaches (GISH, FISH and SSR markers). The following translocations were identified: 2DS.2DL-1HS, 3HS.3BL, 6BS.6BL-4HL, 4D-5HS and 7DL.7DS-5HS. Physical mapping of the SSR markers on chromosomes 1H and 5H was carried out using the intragenomic and interspecific translocation breakpoints and the centromere as physical landmarks. Disomic wheat-<i>Aegilops biuncialis</i> additions were produced after backcrossing the wheat-<i>Ae. biuncialis</i> amphiploids. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) was carried out using two repetitive DNA clones (pSc119.2 and pAs1) on <i>Ae. biuncialis</i> and its two diploid progenitor species to detect chromosome polymorphism. The 7M and 3M disomic chromosome additions were selected and five more lines still need to be characterized. The octoploid triticale (Mv9 kr1 × Lovászpatonai) produced in Martonvásár was crossed with a 1RS.1BL wheat cultivar Matador. GISH analysis detected pairing between the 1RS arm of the translocation chromosome and that of Lovászpatonai rye in 32 % of the pollen mother cells, making it possible to select recombinants from this combination. The new recombinants between the 1RS of Petkus and the 1RS of Lovászpatonai rye cultivars are being analysed with the help of microsatellite markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops biuncialis 3abackcrossing 3abarley 3acentromeres 3achromosome addition 3achromosome pairing 3achromosome translocation 3acolchicine 3acultivars 3acytogenetic analysis 3adiploidy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agene transfer 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular cloning 3aoctaploidy 3apollen 3arye 3atissue culture 3atriticale 3awheat 0awheat 0awheat 0awheat 0awheat 0arye 0abarley 0aAegilops biuncialis 0aintergeneric hybrids 0ain situ hybridization1 aLinc, G1 aD.

The changes in attributes of the plant community (i.e., species richness, species asynchrony, dominance) might in turn explain the ecosystem temporal (inter-annual) stability of grassland production. Here, we evaluated the interactive effects of changes in livestock loads and chronic nutrient addition on the temporal stability of ANPP (estimated as μ/σ) in temperate grasslands. We also assessed the role of different attributes of the plant community on ecosystem stability. We carried out a factorial experiment of domestic livestock exclusion and nutrient addition (10 g.m⁻².year⁻¹ of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; n = 6 blocks) during five consecutive years in a natural grassland devoted to cattle production (Flooding Pampa, Argentina). Domestic livestock exclusion reduced ANPP stability by 65%, regardless of nutrient load, mainly by the increase of ANPP standard deviation. This reduction in ANPP stability after livestock exclusion was associated mostly with higher plant species dominance and also with reductions in plant effective richness and in the asynchrony of grassland's species. Despite not finding direct negative effects of eutrophication on ANPP stability, chronic nutrient addition decreased effective species richness and asynchrony, which may translate into reductions in ANPP stability in the future. Our findings highlight that the presence of livestock maintains the temporal stability of ANPP mainly by lowering the dominance of the plant community. However, increases in nutrient loads in grasslands devoted to livestock production may threaten grassland's stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle production 3aconservation practices 3aecological balance 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3alivestock 3anet primary productivity 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3apollution load 3apotassium 3aspecies richness 3astandard deviation 3aArgentina 0aAboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) 0aEffective species richness 0aSpecies asynchrony 0aSpecies dominance 0aInter-annual variability 0aFlooding Pampa grassland1 aTognetti, Pedro M.1 aYahdjian, Laura0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 817 p.152707-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013800211300001600349500001900365520110400384592002801488650002101516650001801537650002801555650001501583650001201598650001501610650001601625650002401641650001901665650002601684650000701710650000901717650002101726650001601747700002601763700001901789773011901808856008201927852000902009655001202018IND60727303720221121033243.0210210e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072730372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-020-03049-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChacón, Micaela G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3144-906810aSimultaneous saccharification and lactic acid fermentation of the cellulosic fraction of municipal solid waste using Bacillus smithii  ap. 667-675.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOBJECTIVE: A primary drawback to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) processes is the incompatibility of the temperature and pH optima for the hydrolysis and fermentation steps—with the former working best at 50–55 °C and pH 4.5–5.5. Here, nine thermophilic Bacillus and Parageobacillus spp. were evaluated for growth and lactic acid fermentation at high temperature and low pH. The most promising candidate was then carried forward to demonstrate SSF using the cellulosic fraction from municipal solid waste (MSW) as a feedstock. RESULTS: B. smithii SA8Eth was identified as the most promising candidate and in a batch SSF maintained at 55 °C and pH 5.0, using a cellulase dose of 5 FPU/g glucan, it produced 5.1 g/L lactic acid from 2% (w/v) MSW cellulosic pulp in TSB media. CONCLUSION: This work has both scientific and industrial relevance, as it evaluates a number of previously untrialled bacterial hosts for their compatibility with lignocellulosic SSF for lactic acid production and successfully identifies B. smithii as a potential candidate for such a process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus smithii 3abiotechnology 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afeedstocks 3aglucans 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3alignocellulose 3amunicipal solid waste 3apH 3apulp 3asaccharification 3atemperature1 aIbenegbu, Christopher1 aLeak, David J.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2021 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.667-675dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-03049-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245006700161300001600228520118100244592002801425650001301453650001401466650003101480650001201511650001601523650002501539650002201564650001901586650002101605653002501626653002501651653002501676653002501701653002001726653003201746653001801778773012801796856008201924852000902006655001202015IND60478462420221119055821.0160121e20020901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047846242DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.3.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLáng, L.,10aSeed production aspects of genetically modified crop varieties  ap. 313-319.  aThe seed multiplication of genetically modified (GM) plants requires a modification of the multiplication process used for conventional seed. The difference compared to conventionally-bred varieties involves the detection of the modified character during variety maintenance, seed multiplication and processing, the need for separate storage, processing and transportation, the extra cleaning required for the transportation, storage and processing equipment, and the extra administration necessary for the documentation and labelling of GM seed lots. All in all this results in the lower exploitation of seed-producing capacity and in additional costs. The appearance of GM plants also has an effect on the breeders and seed multipliers of conventional varieties, however, since the possibility of contamination cannot be excluded. The producers of seed free of GMs (within the tolerance threshold) are forced to employ costly cultivation techniques (temporal and spatial isolation, removal of volunteer plants) and laboratory tests (for GM contamination) if their varieties are to stay on the market and if it is to remain possible to produce GM-free products in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acultivars 3alaboratory experimentation 3amarkets 3amultipliers 3aprocessing equipment 3atransgenic plants 3atransportation 3avolunteer plants 0amaintenance breeding 0amaintenance breeding 0amaintenance breeding 0amaintenance breeding 0aseed production 0agenetically modified plants 0acontamination0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 50, no. 3 p.313-319dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.50.2002.3.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01296naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015700163300001300320500002200333520013700355592002800492650002400520650002200544650001200566650001400578650002700592700002000619700001600639700006000655773016400715856008200879852000900961655001200970IND60675852120221118174212.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067585212DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-019-02433-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRovani, S.10aCorrection to: Application of biochar from agro-industrial waste in solid-phase extraction for the determination of 17β-estradiol from aqueous solution  ap. 7631.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original article was published with partial Acknowledgements.

The encapsulation pattern was established as entrapped low density cells with culture (ELDCwc). The performance of ELDCwc cells was investigated against stress environments of simulated digestive fluids. RESULTS: After incubation in simulated gastric (pH 2.5) and intestinal fluids (4% bile salt) for 2 h, the survival rate of ELDCwc cells (18.19% and 27.54%) was significantly higher than that of the free cells (0.0000009% and 0.0005%). The reason why B. subtilis embedded in microcapsules can resist the stress environments was that the mass production of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides prompted B. subtilis to form cell aggregates. The production of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides were regulated by the concentration of c-di-GMP and the expression of ydaJKLMN operon, abbA, sinI, slrA, slrB, abrR and sinR. CONCLUSIONS: c-di-GMP is important for the production of extracellular polymer substance to enhance probiotic viability in stress environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a21476042cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aDUT17ZD209cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aBacillus subtilis 3abile salts 3abiotechnology 3acyclic GMP 3aintestines 3amicroencapsulation 3aoperon 3apH 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3aprobiotics 3astress tolerance 3asurvival rate 3aviability1 aWang, Chao1 aZhao, Shan1 aXiu, Zhilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1150-658X0 tBiotechnology letters.g2021 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.677-690dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-03055-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005500165520170400220592002801924650000901952650001601961650001801977650001401995650001002009650000902019650001302028650001002041650001502051650001902066650001802085650001402103650001702117650001002134651001002144651001102154773012302165856008202288852000902370655001202379IND60763549820221118063332.0220120e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076354982DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110100132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegani, Ofir 10aControl Strategies to Cope with Late Wilt of Maize  aControl of maize late wilt disease (LWD) has been at the forefront of research efforts since the discovery of the disease in the 1960s. The disease has become a major economic restraint in highly affected areas such as Egypt and Israel, and is of constant concern in other counties. LWD causes dehydration and collapsing at a late stage of maize cultivation, starting from the male flowering phase. The disease causal agent, Magnaporthiopsis maydis, is a seed- and soil-borne phytoparasitic fungus, penetrating the roots at sprouting, colonizing the vascular system without external symptoms, and spreading upwards in the xylem, eventually blocking the water supply to the plant’s upperparts. Nowadays, the disease’s control relies mostly on identifying and developing resistant maize cultivars. Still, host resistance can be limited because M. maydis undergoes pathogenic variations, and virulent strains can eventually overcome the host immunity. This alarming status is driving researchers to continue to seek other control methods. The current review will summarize the various strategies tested over the years to minimize the disease damage. These options include agricultural (crop rotation, cover crop, no-till, flooding the land before sowing, and balanced soil fertility), physical (solar heating), allelochemical, biological, and chemical interventions. Some of these methods have shown promising success, while others have contributed to our understanding of the disease development and the environmental and host-related factors that have shaped its outcome. The most updated global knowledge about LWD control will be presented, and knowledge gaps and future aims will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3acultivars 3afungi 3aheat 3aimmunity 3amales 3ano-tillage 3asoil fertility 3avascular wilt 3avirulence 3awater supply 3axylem 3aEgypt 3aIsrael0 tPathogens.g2021 Dec. 23, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110100133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017200164520145000336592002801786650001501814650002101829650003101850650002201881650001601903650001601919650001101935650002501946650001701971650001201988650002402000650001002024650001002034650000902044650001602053650001302069650001402082700002302096700001902119700001902138773012602157856007502283852000902358655001202367IND60768416720221120093657.0220225e20220203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076841672DNAL7 a10.3390/md200201212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerasawa, Masahiro 10aAnti-Inflammatory Activity of Orally Administered Monostroma nitidum Rhamnan Sulfate against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Damage to Mouse Organs and Vascular Endothelium  aWe previously reported that rhamnan sulfate (RS) purified from Monostroma nitidum significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Here, we analyzed the effect of orally administered RS on LPS-induced damage to mouse organs and vascular endothelium. RS (1 mg) was orally administered daily to BALB/c mice, 50 μg of LPS was intraperitoneally administered on day 8, and Evans blue was injected into the tail vein 6 h later. After 30 min, LPS-treated mice showed pulmonary Evans blue leakage and elevated plasma levels of liver damage markers, whereas this reaction was suppressed in LPS + RS-treated mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of mouse organs 24 h after LPS treatment showed significant neutrophil infiltration into the lung, liver, and jejunum tissues of LPS-treated mice and high expression levels of inflammation-related factors in these tissues. Expression levels of these factors were significantly suppressed in LPS + RS-treated mice. Analysis of lung glycocalyx showed a significant reduction in glycocalyx in LPS-treated mice but not in LPS + RS-treated mice. Levels of syndecan-4, one of the glycocalyx components, decreased in LPS-treated mice and increased in LPS + RS-treated mice. The current results suggest that orally administered RS protects organs and vascular endothelium from LPS-induced inflammation and maintains blood circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonostroma 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood circulation 3acaudal vein 3aendothelium 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ajejunum 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3alungs 3amice 3aneutrophils 3asulfates 3asyndecans1 aHiramoto, Keiichi 1 aUchida, Ryota 1 aSuzuki, Kōji,0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 03, v. 20, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200201213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002300167245011900190300001400309500002400323500002400347520121000371650002401581650002001605650001501625650002501640650001301665651001101678700002201689773009801711852000901809856011101818655001201929IND4465660020221123010354.0130328s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446566002DNAL7 a10.1663/0013-0001(2004)058[0038:COUPAE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalle, Sarah Paule10aConservation of Useful Plants: An Evaluation of Local Priorities from Two Indigenous Communities in Eastern Panama  ap. 38-57.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aOn both theoretical and practical grounds, respect for, and inclusion of, local decision-making processes is advocated in conservation, yet little is known about the conservation priorities on local territories. We employed interviews and ecological inventories in two villages in order to (1) evaluate the local perception of the conservation status of important plant resources; (2) compare patterns of plant use; and (3) compare perceived conservation status with population structure and abundance in the field. One-third of the 35 species examined were perceived to be threatened or declining. These were predominantly used locally for construction or sold commercially, but were not necessarily rare in the field. The destructiveness of harvest was the most consistent predictor of conservation status in both villages. Contrasting patterns were found in the two villages for the frequency of plant harvest and the relationship of this variable with conservation status. We suggest that local knowledge is an efficient means to rapidly assess the status of a large number of species, whereas population structure analysis provides an initial evaluation of the impact of harvest for selected species. 3aconservation status 3adecision making 3ainterviews 3apopulation structure 3avillages 3aPanama1 aPotvin, Catherine0 tEconomic botany.g2004 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.38-57dNew York Botanical Gardenx0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1663/0013-0001(2004)058%5B0038:COUPAE%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01969naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010000167300001400267500002000281520086000301592002801161650001301189650001501202650001701217650001701234650001701251650001101268650002001279700001601299700001901315700001901334700001701353773014401370856008401514852000901598655001201607IND60786576620221122204412.0220804e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078657662DNAL7 a10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.01152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yifeng10aPredicted Impact of Aeration on Toxicity From Trihalomethanes and Other Disinfection Byproducts  ap. 13-21.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe removal by aeration of a mixture of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) was modeled, and the resulting impact on overall cytotoxicity or genotoxicity was calculated. Both the aeration model and the toxicity model were simplistic, but all assumptions were made to err on the side of overestimating DBP volatility to try to demonstrate a possible health benefit. The results predicted that aeration designed to remove 90% of chloroform would leave the concentrations of many other DBPs largely unaffected; since these other DBPs are predicted to contribute to the majority of the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, the models used in the current research predicted only a 4% reduction in both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Although this study was a preliminary screening limited by simplistic models, it underscores a need to conduct more research in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfection 3agenotoxicity 3amodels 3awater utilities1 aZhang, Hong1 aZamyadi, Arash1 aAndrews, Susan1 aHofmann, Ron0 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2017 Oct., v. 109, no. 10 p.13-21dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.01153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04221naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245016600173520220900339592002802548650002602576650001302602650000902615650001502624650001402639650001602653650001602669650001602685650001002701650000902711650001602720650001002736650001302746650000902759650001702768650002002785650003102805650001602836650001602852650001002868650001702878650001102895650001202906650002002918650002102938651001002959653003102969653001103000653001603011653002203027653002803049700001803077700001903095700001203114700001503126700001603141700001703157700001903174700001403193700001803207700001603225700001703241700001503258700001603273773009903289856009003388852000903478655001203487IND60674134820221117180453.0200405e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067413482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Chunfang10aShort-term stress due to dietary pectin induces cholestasis, and chronic stress induces hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in yellow catfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco  aGreen liver syndrome and hepatic steatosis, named “hepatobiliary syndrome” (HBS) in China, was found to appear in fish fed diets with high levels of plant ingredients. Plant ingredients are rich in non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), and this study was conducted to explore the induction of NSPs on HBS with yellow catfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, as a model fish. Pectin, an important soluble NSP in plant feedstuffs, was included in diets at 0 (FM), 10 g kg⁻¹ (PEC1), 50 g kg⁻¹ (PEC5), 150 g kg⁻¹ (PEC15), and 300 g kg⁻¹ (PEC30), respectively. Fish with an initial mean weight of 9.65 ± 0.08 g were fed the above diets for 56 days. Interval sampling was conducted at 2, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days in fish fed the PEC30 and FM diets. The results showed that in fish fed PEC30 diet, green liver syndrome occurred after 2 days and peaked after 7 days, when the tosstal bile acids (TBA) in the serum and liver were 80 and 3 times higher, respectively, than in fish fed the FM diet. The green liver syndrome was not observed after 28 and 56 days, and the color of the bile became light after 28 days and colorless after 56 days. The expression of LXRa, CYP7A1, and NTCP was upregulated, and CYP8B1 was downregulated in the liver after 7 days, and all these genes were expressed weakly and had much lower expression levels than in fish fed the FM diet after 56 days (P < 0.05). Obvious diffuse adipose degeneration and fibrosis of hepatocytes were observed after 56 days. After 56 days of feeding, the total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, total protein, albumin and seroglobulin were decreased with increasing dietary pectin. However, indirect bilirubin and TBA were the highest in fish fed the PEC15 and PEC5 diets, respectively. In addition, green liver syndrome and cholestasis were also observed in fish fed PEC5 and PEC15 diets for 56 days. These results suggested that the nutritional stress of pectin was dose- and time-dependent. Short-term stress induced hypersynthesis of bile acids and then cholestasis, and chronic stress induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in yellow catfish. Soluble NSPs are likely the cause of fish HBS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3aalbumins 3abile 3abile acids 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3acholestasis 3acholesterol 3acolor 3adiet 3afatty liver 3afeeds 3afibrosis 3afish 3afish feeding 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahepatocytes 3aingredients 3aliver 3amalnutrition 3amodels 3apectins 3aprotein content 3atriacylglycerols 3aChina 0aNon-starch polysaccharides 0aPectin 0aGreen liver 0aHepatic steatosis 0aPelteobagrus fulvidraco1 aRen, Shengjie1 aCui, Guangtong1 aNi, Qin1 aLi, Xinyue1 aMeng, Yunhe1 aMeng, Zijing1 aZhang, Junbiao1 aSu, Xiong1 aChen, Huangen1 aJiang, Rong1 aLu, Jianqiao1 aYe, Yuantu1 aCao, Xiamin0 tAquaculture.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 516 p.734607-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167520107100299592002801370650001701398650002601415650001701441650001401458650001501472650001901487653002201506653003201528653003101560653002401591700005801615700001301673700001901686773011001705856008501815852000901900655001201909IND60755835320221119160019.0220118e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075583532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1184702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, XiaoJun10aDiversity and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes associated with road sediments transported in urban stormwater runoff  aRecently, increasing attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban stormwater runoff. However, there were little data on the diversity and distribution of ARGs associated with road sediments transported in runoff. The investigation of ARGs diversity showed that sulfonamide resistance genes (sul2 and sul3) occupied 61.7%–82.3% of total ARGs in runoff. The analysis of ARGs distribution in particulate matter (PM) implied that both tetQ and trbC existed mainly in PM with size of 150–300 μm, but other ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were dominant in PM with size <75 μm. The discussion of potential hosts indicated that target genes (ermF, blaOXA1/blaOXA30, ermC, qnrA, sul2, tnpA-01, intI2, tetW, intI1, sul3, trbC) had the strongest subordinate relationship with Proteobacteria at phylum level and Enterobacter at genus level. The effect evaluation of ARGs distribution suggested that 13 kinds of ARGs were positively correlated with Pr/PS and Zeta potential, resulting in the more ARGs in PM with smaller size (<75 μm).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aantibiotic resistance 3aparticulates 3apollution 3astormwater 3azeta potential 0aStormwater runoff 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aParticle size distribution 0aBacterial community1 aSuo, PengCheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0469-42361 aLi, Yang1 aXu, Qiangqiang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 292 p.118470-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1184703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166300001600279520113800295592002801433650001801461650001401479650001401493650002601507650002101533650001601554650001801570650002301588650001201611653000801623653000901631653000801640653000901648653000901657653000701666653000901673653000801682653000801690653000801698653001001706653001401716653003801730653001001768653001001778700001901788700001901807773011101826856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60086569120221121114530.0190401e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008656912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yung-Fu10aArecoline inhibits and destabilizes agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor cluster formation in C2C12 myotubes  ap. 391-396.  aAreca nut (Areca catechu) is chewed as a medical and psychoactive food by roughly 10% of the world population. Areca nut chewing may lead to low birth weight, premature delivery and impaired muscle development. Our previous study showed that arecoline, a major alkaloid in the areca nut, inhibited the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblastic cells. The clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by agrin, a signaling protein released by motor neurons, is critical for the development of functional muscles. Here, we further investigate whether arecoline affects the AChR clustering using cultured C2C12 myotubes. Rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin was used to detect the presence of AChR clusters. Our results showed that arecoline inhibited the formation of agrin-induced AChR clusters and destabilized agrin-induced or spontaneous AChR cluster formation. In addition, arecoline inhibited the expression of myogenin in C2C12 myotubes. These results shed light on the important role of arecoline on the detrimental effect of areca nut to muscle development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAreca catechu 3aarecoline 3abetel nut 3acholinergic receptors 3alow birth weight 3amastication 3amotor neurons 3amuscle development 3amuscles 0aACh 0aAChR 0aFAS 0aFASD 0aLRP4 0aMG 0aMuSK 0aNMJ 0aPBS 0aSMA 0aSTAT3 0aArecoline 0aAcetylcholine receptor clustering 0aAgrin 0aC2C121 aLiu, Dingyuan,1 aLiu, Shao-Tung0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Oct., v. 60 p.391-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012700156520124900283592002801532650001401560650001501574650001101589650001001600651002101610700001801631700001901649700001701668700001601685773012101701856007301822852000901895655001201904IND60750102520221118014052.0210910e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075010252DNAL7 a10.3390/w131724432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yeonsu 10aApplication of Stage-Fall-Discharge Rating Curves to a Reservoir Based on Acoustic Doppler Velocity Meter Measurement Data  aThe applicability of the stage-fall-discharge (SFD) method in combination with acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) data, upstream of a hydraulic structure, specifically, the Sejong-weir located in the Geum River, Korea, was examined. We developed three rating curves: a conventional simple rating curve with the data measured using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and floating objects, an SFD rating curve with the data measured using the ADCP and floating objects, and an SFD rating curve with the data measured using an ADVM. Because of the gate operation effect, every rating curve involved many uncertainties under 1000 m³/s (3.13 m²/s, specific discharge). In terms of the hydrograph reconstruction, compared with the conventional simple rating curve, the SFD developed using ADVM data exhibited a higher agreement with the measured data in terms of the pattern. Furthermore, the measured discharge over 1000 m³/s primarily ranged between 97.5% and 2.5% in the graph comparing the ratio of the median and observed discharge.

When nanoblends and MC were separated by dialysis membrane colorimetric response (CR) was similar, whereas a remarkable CR reduction was noticed after addition of dialyzed-MC, suggesting that small molecules present in MC (salts) caused PDA color change. Interaction enthalpy variation between nanoblends and MC showed an abrupt increase that coincided with MC concentration when colorimetric transition occurred. Copolymer hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and presence of other molecules in the system affected nanoblends CR. MC salts were found to interact with nanoblends leading to color changes. MC concentration, MC salt release, copolymer hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and presence of other molecules in the system affected responses of the sensors. These results contribute to future applications of PDA/copolymer nanosensors to dairy models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenthalpy 3acolorimetry 3asalts 3amodels 3ahydrophilicity 3amilk quality 3acasein 3acolor 3ahydrophobicity 3acomposite polymers 3adialysis 0aInteraction enthalpy 0aL64 0akappa-Carrageenan (PubChem CID: 11966249) 0a10,12-Pentacosadiynoic acid (PubChem CID: 538433) 0adairy protein 0aCalcium phosphate 0aPEG-PPG-PEG (PubChem CID: 10129990) 0aPentacosadiynoic acid 0aZeta potential 0aF681 ade Paula Rezende, Jaqueline1 aPires, Ana Clarissa dos Santos1 ada Silva, Luis Henrique Mendes1 ada Silva, Maria do Carmo Hespanhol1 aCastrillon, Elkin Dario Castellon1 ade Andrade, Nélio José0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.841-847dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.11.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010800178520129600286592002801582650002301610650001901633650001001652650001901662650003001681650001301711700002601724700002901750700003001779700003001809700002101839773012301860856008201983852000902065655001202074IND60763550120221120122300.0220120e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076355012DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110100172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResendiz-Nava, Carolina N.12aA Comprehensive Evaluation of Enterobacteriaceae Primer Sets for Analysis of Host-Associated Microbiota  aEnterobacteriaceae is one of the most important bacterial groups within the Proteobacteria phylum. This bacterial group includes pathogens, commensal and beneficial populations. Numerous 16S rRNA gene PCR-based assays have been designed to analyze Enterobacteriaceae diversity and relative abundance, and, to the best of our knowledge, 16 primer pairs have been validated, published and used since 2003. Nonetheless, a comprehensive performance analysis of these primer sets has not yet been carried out. This information is of particular importance due to the recent taxonomic restructuration of Enterobacteriaceae into seven bacterial families. To overcome this lack of information, the identified collection of primer pairs (n = 16) was subjected to primer performance analysis using multiple bioinformatics tools. Herein it was revealed that, based on specificity and coverage of the 16S rRNA gene, these 16 primer sets could be divided into different categories: Enterobacterales-, multi-family-, multi-genus- and Enterobacteriaceae-specific primers. These results highlight the impact of taxonomy changes on performance of molecular assays and data interpretation. Moreover, they underline the urgent need to revise and update the molecular tools used for molecular microbial analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3abioinformatics 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ataxonomy1 aSilva-Rojas, Hilda V.1 aRebollar-Alviter, Angel 1 aRivera-Pastrana, Dulce M.1 aMercado-Silva, Edmundo M.1 aNava, Gerardo M.0 tPathogens.g2021 Dec. 23, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110100173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015900165300001600324520143200340592002801772650001601800650001501816650001301831650001601844650002701860650000901887650001601896650002101912650002001933650002301953650001001976650001801986650000902004650001302013650004302026650001402069650001302083650002502096650002102121653003802142653002902180653002302209653002702232653000902259700002002268773011102288856008202399852000902481655001202490IND60086569320221121114546.0190401e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008656932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Ji Hye,14aThe inhibitory effect of black soybean on hepatic cholesterol accumulation in high cholesterol and high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  ap. 404-412.  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as excess of fat in the liver. We investigated the effects of black soybean on the cholesterol metabolism and insulin resistance of mice fed high cholesterol/fat diets. Mice were randomly allocated into four groups that were fed different diets: the normal cholesterol/fat diet; high cholesterol/fat diets (HCD); and HCD with 1%, and 4% black soybean powder (1B-HCD, and 4B-HCD). Liver total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower in the black soybean-supplemented groups than that in the HCD group. PCR revealed significantly lower hepatic SREBP2 and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels of black soybean-supplemented mice. Real-time PCR revealed significantly higher hepatic ABCA1 mRNA level of black soybean-supplemented mice, which may increase cholesterol efflux. Liver bile acids concentration was significantly high in the 4B-HCD group. Black soybean stimulated secretion of adiponectin, activation of pAMPK, and eliminated free fatty acids in the liver. Black soybean supplementation decreased MDA and nitrate level. The activities of SOD, catalase, and GPx were restored by black soybean supplementation. Our data strongly indicate that black soybean influences the balance between oxidative and antioxidative stress. We suggest that black soybean improves cholesterol metabolism, insulin resistance, and alleviates oxidative damage in NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3abile acids 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3adiet 3afatty liver 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anitrates 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aCholesterol accumulation 0aInsulin resistance 0aAntioxidative activity 0aMice1 aKim, Hyun Sook,0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Oct., v. 60 p.404-412dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245014600206300001400352500001900366520152700385592002801912650004401940650001801984650001502002650002002017650001702037650001602054650001002070650001502080650003102095650001802126650001702144650002202161650002102183650002102204653000902225653003702234700001302271700001502284773009702299856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60727665620221119025438.0210226e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072766562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8458-325210aChar derived from sewage sludge of hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification: Comparison of the properties of two chars  ap. 88-96.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSupercritical water gasification (SCWG) is considered a promising technology for sewage sludge (SS) treatment and utilization; however, char produced by a side reaction has become a bottleneck in SCWG. In this study, SS and its model compound (10% humic acid) were treated in an autoclave by SCWG at 400 °C for 30 min and by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) at 250 °C for 300 min. The char yield was 15.4% in SCWG and 41.3% in HTC. The chars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, and elemental analysis. By comparing the properties the char produced by SCWG and the hydrochar produced by HTC, which has been considered a valuable product, the feasibility of using char as an additional product in SCWG was explored. Compared with the char produced by HTC, the char generated in SCWG exhibits a lower BET specific surface area (8.257 and 15.782 m²/g) and combustion activity, a higher proportion of small pores (with pore sizes of 1–2 nm), and greater thermal stability. The formation pathway of the two types of chars is related to both dehydration and aromatization; decarboxylation also occurs in char formation during SCWG. Humus was proved to be related to char formation during the SCWG of SS based on experimental results obtained with the model compound. This work provides insights needed to guide follow-up treatments or utilization of the char produced during the SCWG of SS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaromatization 3acombustion 3adecarboxylation 3agasification 3ahumic acids 3ahumus 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3asewage sludge 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awaste management 0aChar 0aSupercritical Water Gasification1 aZhu, Wei1 aFan, Xihui0 tWaste management.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 123 p.88-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012100168300001600289520110800305592002801413650002501441650001901466650001101485650002201496650001801518650002801536650001101564650002001575650002901595650000701624650001501631653002901646653002901675653002101704653003501725653001901760700001901779700001201798700001501810700001701825700003301842700001501875700001501890773010001905856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60526015620221122170509.0190402e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052601562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.11.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dasong10aEffects of enzymatic dephosphorylation on infant in vitro gastrointestinal digestibility of milk protein concentrate  ap. 891-899.  aThis study investigated the effects of dephosphorylation extent on infant in vitro gastric clotting property and gastrointestinal digestibility of milk protein concentrate. Dephosphorylation was affected by phosphatase type and incubation pH. A series of milk protein concentrate with 0–69% dephosphorylation were obtained by incubation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at pH 6.5 for 0–420min. Both β- and αs1-caseins in the modified milk protein concentrate showed multiply dephosphorylated isoforms with different numbers of phosphate groups depending on the extent of dephosphorylation. With increased dephosphorylation of milk protein concentrate, the gastric clotting extent decreased and the gastrointestinal digestibility increased under infant in vitro conditions. These results suggested the potential of developing a dephosphorylated milk protein concentrate, with improved gastric clotting property and gastrointestinal digestibility, to simulate the multiply phosphorylated patterns of human casein and hence to further the humanization of infant formula on a molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aalphaS1-casein 3acalves 3adephosphorylation 3adigestibility 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3ainfant formulas 3amilk protein concentrate 3apH 3aphosphates 0aMilk protein concentrate 0aCasein dephosphorylation 0aGastric clotting 0aGastrointestinal digestibility 0aInfant formula1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aYu, Yun1 aHu, Jinhua1 aLü, Naiyan,1 aRegenstein, J.

In Thailand, seroprevalence studies on T. gondii have focused on domestic animals, and information on infections in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus indicus) is scarce. This study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in archival sera collected from 268 elephants living in Thailand. The serum samples were analyzed for anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibodies using the latex agglutination test (LAT) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on T. gondii lysate antigen (TLA-iELISA) and recombinant T. gondii dense granular antigen 8 protein (TgGRA8-iELISA). The prevalence of antibodies against T. gondii was 45.1% (121/268), 40.7% (109/268), and 44.4% (119/268) using LAT, TLA-iELISA, and TgGRA8-iELISA, respectively. Young elephants had a higher seropositivity rate than elephants aged >40 years (odds ratio = 6.6; p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 2.9–15.4). When LAT was used as the reference, TLA-iELISA and TgGRA8-iELISA showed a substantial (κ = 0.69) and moderate (κ = 0.42) agreement, respectively. Although our findings suggest the widespread exposure of Asian elephants to T. gondii in Thailand, the source of infection was not investigated.

A computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach comprising ligand- and structure-based methods was explored for predicting the antifouling activities of marine natural products (MNPs). In the CADD ligand-based method, 141 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database and literature with antifouling screening data were used to build the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) classification model. An overall predictive accuracy score of up to 71% was achieved with the best QSAR model for external and internal validation using test and training sets. A virtual screening campaign of 14,492 MNPs from Encinar’s website and 14 MNPs that are currently in the clinical pipeline was also carried out using the best QSAR model developed. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 125 MNPs that were selected by the QSAR approach were used in molecular docking experiments against the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Overall, 16 MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as antifouling agents, e.g., macrocyclic lactam, macrocyclic alkaloids, indole and pyridine derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantifouling activities 3aaquaculture 3abiofouling 3adatabases 3adrug design 3aindoles 3ainfrastructure 3alactams 3amodels 3apyridines 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships1 aPereira, Florbela 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 08, v. 20, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200201293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006800168300001800236520075100254592002801005650002201033650002101055650001301076650002001089650001701109650001001126650001601136650001101152650001401163650001301177650001401190650001101204653002001215653002801235653001601263653001301279653003401292653001001326653001701336700005701353700001701410700001801427700002301445773010201468856008701570852000901657655001201666IND60526015720221122170607.0190402e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052601572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.11.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauwers, K.10aWater electrolyte promoted oxidation of functional thiol groups  ap. 1235-1239.  aThe formation of disulfide bonds is of the utmost importance for a wide range of food products with gluten or globular proteins as functional agents.

Interestingly, the oxidation rate of both compounds into their corresponding disulfides was significantly higher in common tap water than in ultrapure water. The systematic study of different electrolyte components showed that especially CaCl2 improved the oxidation rate of GSH. However, this effect was not observed for CYS, which indicated a strong impact of the local chemical environment on thiol oxidation kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium chloride 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3aelectrolytes 3afoods 3aglutathione 3agluten 3aoxidation 3asulfides 3atap water 3athiols 0aThiol oxidation 0aDisulfide cross-linking 0aGlutathione 0aCysteine 0aWater electrolyte composition 0aCaCl2 0aGluten dough1 aBreynaert, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3499-04551 aRombouts, I.1 aDelcour, J.A.1 aKirschhock, C.E.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.1235-1239dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.11.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300001600277520035300293592002800646650001900674650001000693650001700703650001400720650001900734650001900753650002000772650002300792700001100815700001400826700001600840700001400856773013900870856007401009852000901083655001201092IND60670467120221121231010.0191002e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067046712DNAL7 a10.1039/c2tb00460g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jia-Shen10aStrategy to introduce an hydroxyapatite–keratin nanocomposite into a fibrous membrane for bone tissue engineering  ap. 432-437.  aAn hydroxyapatite (HA)–keratin nanocomposite was introduced into an electrospun poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) fibrous membrane with good electrospinnability.

PGM1s are typically cytosolic enzymes in organisms lacking chloroplasts. However, the protozoan Cryptosporidium parasites possess two tandemly duplicated PGM1 genes evolved by a gene duplication after their split from other apicomplexans. Moreover, the downstream PGM1 isoform contains an N-terminal signal peptide, predicting a non-cytosolic location. Here we expressed recombinant proteins of the two PGM1 isoforms from the zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum, namely CpPGM1A and CpPGM1B, and confirmed their enzyme activity. Both isoforms followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics towards glucose-1-phosphate (Kₘ = 0.17 and 0.13 mM, Vₘₐₓ = 7.30 and 2.76 μmol/min/mg, respectively). CpPGM1A and CpPGM1B genes were expressed in oocysts, sporozoites and intracellular parasites at a similar pattern of expression, however CpPGM1A was expressed at much higher levels than CpPGM1B. Immunofluorescence assay showed that CpPGM1A was present in the cytosol of sporozoites, however this was enriched towards the plasma membranes in the intracellular parasites; whereas CpPGM1B was mainly present under sporozoite pellicle, although relocated to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in the intracellular development. These observations indicated that CpPGM1A played a house-keeping function, while CpPGM1B played a different biological role that remains to be defined by future investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aProtozoa 3achloroplasts 3acytosol 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene duplication 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglycolysis 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aphosphoglucomutase 3asignal peptide 3asporozoites 3avacuoles1 aYin, Jigang 1 aWang, Dongqiang 1 aWang, Chenchen 1 aZhu, Guan 0 tPathogens.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110100213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01093naa a2200193 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245005700133300001300190520050600203592002800709650001500737773012600752852000900878655001200887IND60300816020221122221504.0150703e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030081602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerr, Richard A.10aPeering Inside the Moon to Read Its Earliest History  ap. 1272.  aA few billion years ago, huge impacts and massive volcanic eruptions pummeled the moon and erased any traces of its earliest history.

We present a unique physically based model of suspended sediment transport which is intimately coupled with fine sediment deposition and re‐entrainment processes within the gravel bed. This multi‐size fraction theory provides unique information about the effect of fine sediment size classes due to their dynamics and associated river bed changes in net deposition. The data from a series of flood events from the Oreti River, located in Southland, New Zealand were used to test the ability of this theory to provide a description of the dynamics of the fine sediment size distribution, their concentration, load, and rate of river bed deposition and re‐entrainment. After calibration of the model using the data from one flood event, the model provides good agreement between observed and modeled fine sediment concentration and event load for seven subsequent test events. One of the main applications of this theory in future is for routing suspended sediment concentration and changes on fine sediment deposition down a river network.  aPublisher supplied data  aFWCE2205cNational Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research  aC09X1804cMinistry of Business, Innovation and Employment 3ageomorphology 3agravel 3amodels 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3asediment transport 3astream channels 3asuspended sediment 3awater 3awater quality 3aNew Zealand1 aRose, C.

Sm-AWBE was also used in immunoprotection studies against a fatal live-cercariae challenge in experimental mouse vaccination (~43% protection). The Sm-AWBE fraction was prepared by mixing adult worm membranous suspensions with aqueous-saturated n-butanol, centrifuging and recovering n-butanol-resistant proteins in the aqueous phase. Here we report a preliminary identification of Sm-AWBE protein components as revealed from a qualitative proteomic study after processing Sm-AWBE by 1D-gel electrophoresis, in-gel and in-solution tryptic digestions, and mass spectrometry analyses. We identified 33 proteins in Sm-AWBE, all previously known S. mansoni proteins and antigens; among them, immunomodulatory proteins and proteins mostly involved in host–parasite interactions. About 81.8% of the identified Sm-AWBE proteins are antigenic. STRING analysis showed a set of Sm-AWBE proteins configuring a small network of interactive proteins and a group of proteins without interactions. Functional groups of proteins included muscle contraction, antioxidant, GPI-anchored phosphoesterases, regulatory 14-3-3, various enzymes and stress proteins. The results widen the possibilities to design novel antigen combinations for better diagnostic and immunoprotective strategies for schistosomiasis control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantigens 3aantioxidants 3abutanol 3aelectrophoresis 3aimmunoassays 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3amuscle contraction 3aproteomics 3aschistosomiasis 3aserodiagnosis 3avaccination1 aVerissimo da Costa, Giovani C.1 aLosada, Sandra 1 aPeralta, José M.,1 aCesari, Italo M.0 tPathogens.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110100223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245017800179300001400357520150300371592002801874650001601902650001801918650002001936650001401956650001001970650001401980650001201994650001802006650002202024650001702046773010202063856008202165990002302247852000902270655001202279IND60097616520221118164000.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009761652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eiar.2013.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJørgensen, Rikke Bramming10aIntroduction of a method for presenting health-based impacts of the emission from products, based on emission measurements of materials used in manufacturing of the products  ap. 49-55.  aA method for presenting the health impact of emissions from furniture is introduced, which could be used in the context of environmental product declarations. The health impact is described by the negative indoor air quality potential, the carcinogenic potential, the mutagenic and reprotoxic potential, the allergenic potential, and the toxicological potential. An experimental study of emissions from four pieces of furniture is performed by testing both the materials used for production of the furniture and the complete piece of furniture, in order to compare the results gained by adding emissions of material with results gained from testing the finished piece of furniture. Calculating the emission from a product based on the emission from materials used in the manufacture of the product is a new idea. The relation between calculated results and measured results from the same products differ between the four pieces of furniture tested. Large differences between measured and calculated values are seen for leather products. More knowledge is needed to understand why these differences arise. Testing materials allows us to compare different suppliers of the same material. Four different foams and three different timber materials are tested, and the results vary between materials of the same type. If the manufacturer possesses this type of knowledge of the materials from the subcontractors it could be used as a selection criterion according to production of low emission products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aallergenicity 3acarcinogenicity 3aemissions 3afoams 3afurniture 3aleather 3amanufacturing 3amaterials testing 3amutagenicity0 tEnvironmental impact assessment review.g2013 Nov., v. 43 p.49-55dElsevier Inc.x0195-92557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2013.05.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01225naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245006600134300001800200520040600218592002800624650001100652650001300663650001900676650001200695650001100707650002100718650001500739651001400754700002000768773012600788852000900914655001200923IND60300816220221122231202.0150703e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030081622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinkel, Elizabeth10aRiver Basin Management Plan Secures Water for the Environment  ap. 1273-1274.  aIn the scramble to secure water for drinking and agriculture, the environment often gets overlooked.

Quercetin, a dietary flavonoid, is known to elicit beneficial health effects. However, the influence of quercetin on the hepatic-renal toxicity associated with CYP-instigated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is unavailable in the literature. The current study evaluated the effects of quercetin on the dysfunctional hepatic-renal status triggered by CYP exposure in rats. Experimental animals were exposed to CYP (100 mg/kg) or co-treated with quercetin (50 mg/kg) every other day for 7 days. Results revealed that quercetin treatment significantly assuaged CYP-mediated oxidative-inflammatory response, as well as augmenting serum levels of thyroid hormones. Additionally, quercetin attenuated CYP-induced reduction in antioxidant enzyme activities and enhanced hepatic-renal function markers, namely aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and levels of urea and creatinine. Quercetin efficiently mitigated CYP-mediated increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, levels of nitric oxide and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in liver and kidney of rats. CYP-induced increase in the activities of immunosuppressive indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the tissues was abated in quercetin co-treated rats. In conclusion, Quercetin ameliorated deficits in the hepatic-renal function in CYP-exposed rats by lowering the activities/expression of immunosuppressive IDO and TDO via diminution of oxidative-inflammatory stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3acyclophosphamide 3aimmunosuppression 3aindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aquercetin 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atryptophan 3aurea 0aKidney 0aIndoeamine 2,3-dioxygenase 0aTryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 0aOxidative-inflammatory stress1 aObasi, Doris Olachi1 aNjoku, Rex Clovis C.1 aOsawe, Sharon1 aOlusanya, Olasiende1 aKalu, Winner O.0 tToxicology.g2021 Dec., v. 464 p.153027-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245017100156520124300327592002801570650001701598650001601615650002501631650002501656650001501681650001701696650000901713650002101722650001901743650001801762650001801780650000901798650002001807650001401827650001701841700002001858700001901878700004001897700001901937700001801956700001701974700001801991773012602009856007502135852000902210655001202219IND60768418020221120072132.0220225e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076841802DNAL7 a10.3390/md200201332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ŭn-a,10aAnti-Allergic Effect of 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde Isolated from Polysiphonia morrowii in IgE/BSA-Stimulated Mast Cells and a Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis Mouse Model  aIn this study, we investigated the anti-allergic effects of 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHB) isolated from the marine red alga, Polysiphonia morrowii, in mouse bone-marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized mice. DHB inhibited IgE/bovine serum albumin (BSA)-induced BMCMCs degranulation by reducing the release of β-hexosaminidase without inducing cytotoxicity. Further, DHB dose-dependently decreased the IgE binding and high-affinity IgE receptor (FcRI) expression and FcRI-IgE binding on the surface of BMCMCs. Moreover, DHB suppressed the secretion and/or the expression of the allergic cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the chemokine, thymus activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), by regulating the phosphorylation of IκBα and the translocation of cytoplasmic NF-κB into the nucleus. Furthermore, DHB attenuated the passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA) reaction reducing the exuded Evans blue amount in the mouse ear stimulated by IgE/BSA. These results suggest that DHB is a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of type I allergic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolysiphonia 3aanaphylaxis 3aanti-allergic agents 3abovine serum albumin 3achemokines 3acytotoxicity 3aears 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3asecretion 3atherapeutics1 aHan, Eui-Jeong 1 aKim, Junseong 1 aFernando, Ilekuttige Priyan Shanura1 aOh, Jae-Young 1 aKim, Kil-Nam 1 aAhn, Ginnae 1 aHeo, Soo-jin,0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 20, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200201333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013700157520154900294592002801843650001301871650001601884650002201900650002401922650000901946650001501955650001101970650002001981650001802001650001602019650002102035651001102056700002102067700001802088700002402106700002302130773012102153856007302274852000902347655001202356IND60750103520221118013004.0210910e20210906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075010352DNAL7 a10.3390/w131724522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Chuen-Fa 10aMapping Interflow Potential and the Validation of Index-Overlay Weightings by Using Coupled Surface Water and Groundwater Flow Model  aInterflow is an important water source contributing to river flow. It directly influences the near-surface water cycles for water resource management. This study focuses on assessing the interflow potential and quantifying the interflow in the downstream area along the Kaoping River in southern Taiwan. The interflow potential is first determined based on the modified index-overlay model, which employs the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to calculate the ratings and weightings of the selected factors. The groundwater and surface water flow (GSFLOW) numerical model is then used to link the index-overlay model to quantify the interflow potential for practical applications. This study uses the Monte Carlo simulations to assess the influence of rainfall-induced variations on the interflow uncertainty in the study area. Results show that the high potential interflow zones are located in the high to middle elevation regions along the Kaoping River. Numerical simulations of the GSFLOW model show an interflow variation pattern that is similar to the interflow potential results obtained from the index-overlay model. The average interflow rates are approximately 3.5 × 10⁴ (m³/d) in the high elevation zones and 2.0 × 10⁴ (m³/d) near the coastal zones. The rainfall uncertainty strongly influences interflow rates in the wet seasons, especially the peaks of the storms or heavy rainfall events. Interflow rates are relatively stable in the dry seasons, indicating that interflow is a reliable water resource in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models 3arain 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3awater management 3aTaiwan1 aTran, Quoc-Dung 1 aLee, I-Hsien 1 aTruong, Minh-Hoang 1 aHsu, Shaohua Marko0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 06, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131724523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245009300201300001800294500002000312520108500332592002801417596006101445596006601506650001201572650001901584650001501603650002101618650003101639650002501670650001301695650001601708700005901724700005901783700006001842700002201902700005701924700005901981773013202040856007702172852000902249655001202258IND60789701920221118112435.0220822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078970192DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0152872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyung Jeek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3690-226310aSuppressed CO2 Outgassing by an Enhanced Biological Pump in the Eastern Tropical Pacific  ap. 7962-7973.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to the atmosphere. Sinking particle fluxes at a depth of 4,950 m (50 m above the seafloor) in the ETP were monitored from 2003 to 2013, during which the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) shifted from a positive to negative phase. We show a disproportionate increase in the efficiency of the biological pump in this region relative to the increase in primary production that occurred during La Niña years following the shift of the PDO in 2008. Biogenic carbon export from the surface mixed layer was estimated from the observed particulate organic carbon and inorganic carbon fluxes at a depth of 4,950 m and from empirical equations of the vertical attenuation of carbon flux. Enhanced biological carbon export accounted for 2.3–5.5 mol C m–² year–¹ during the La Niña events. Despite a large uncertainty associated with these estimates, we propose that CO₂ outgassing was largely suppressed by an enhanced biological pump during the La Niña events in the negative PDO phase.  aPublisher supplied data  aPE99723cKorea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology  aPM61150cKorean Government's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries 3aLa Nina 3acarbon dioxide 3ageophysics 3ainorganic carbon 3aparticulate organic carbon 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch 3auncertainty1 aKim, Tae‐Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4236-07201 aHyeong, Kiseong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4134-18861 aYeh, Sang‐Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4549-16861 aPark, Jong‐Yeon1 aYoo, Chan Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9232-03561 aHwang, Jeomshik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0834-02240 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.7962-7973dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC0152873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014800162520156100310592002801871650001701899650001601916650001201932650001301944650001101957650001601968650002701984650002002011650001402031650001002045650002502055650001202080650000902092700002502101700003302126700003002159773012602189856007802315852000902393655001202402IND60732015820221120101319.0210326e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073201582DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100304932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizoń, Anna 14aThe Impact of Early Pregnancy and Exposure to Tobacco Smoke on Blood Antioxidant Status and Copper, Zinc, Cadmium Concentration—A Pilot Study  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of early pregnancy and exposure to tobacco smoke on antioxidant status and copper, zinc, and cadmium concentrations in the blood of non-smoking and smoking, as well as non-pregnant or pregnant women. The study included 213 women. More specifically, 150 women in first trimester of pregnancy and 63 non-pregnant women. Women were divided into subgroups according to exposure to tobacco smoke. Pregnancy significant influences higher copper and lower zinc concentration in the serum, whereas exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy is mainly associated with an elevation in cadmium and zinc concentration. It seems that metallothionein, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase are the important antioxidants during early pregnancy, when exposure to tobacco smoke occurs, whereas the pregnancy itself is associated with a higher concentration of metallothionein and activity of catalase. Both pregnancy in the first trimester and exposure to tobacco smoke decrease glutathione concentration. In addition, active and passive maternal smoking have a similarly negative effect on antioxidant status in the first trimester. Early pregnancy as well as exposure to tobacco smoke is associated with significant alteration in antioxidant status and copper, zinc, and cadmium concentration. Due to a small number of smoking subjects (11 cases of non-pregnant, active smokers and 14 pregnant active smokers), the obtained results should be treated as a pilot, and this should be considered for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acopper 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ametallothionein 3apregnancy 3asmoke 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3azinc1 aMilnerowicz, Halina 1 aKowalska-Piastun, Katarzyna 1 aMilnerowicz-Nabzdyk, Ewa 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100304933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245011000197300001800307500002000325520169000345592002802035650001102063650001302074650001502087650001002102650001302112650001902125700005602144700005402200773013202254856007702386852000902463655001202472IND60789702020221118112610.0220822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078970202DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0151232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatzer, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0093-942410aTwo‐Dimensional Spectra of Radar Returns From Sea: 2. Analysis of the Group Line From Experimental Data  ap. 8309-8323.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWavenumber‐frequency spectra are obtained by performing a two‐dimensional Fourier transform of range‐time normalized radar cross‐section (NRCS) or Doppler velocity maps. In such diagrams, some energy is present at low space‐time frequencies, resulting from the nonlinear behavior of the measured quantity related to the sea surface geometry. This feature is called the group line, since for a narrow‐band wave packet the energy is concentrated along a straight line with group velocity as slope. Which physical nonlinear process generates the group line remains an open question. Breaking waves have been proposed as the most probable contributor. However, numerical simulations from weakly nonlinear surfaces without breaking events and experiments performed at low winds also provide such feature. In a companion paper, a theoretical and numerical analysis has permitted to predict the energy distribution of the group line depending on the kind of nonlinearity. It provides some means to characterize a group line in a rigorous way. In this paper, it is used to analyze the group lines derived from the experimental MARLENE data. The group lines computed from the backscattering amplitude behave as the one of the square of sea surface slopes. The analysis of the Doppler velocities provides similar results, which significantly differ from what is expected if breaking waves are the main contributors and do break at velocities reported in the literature. Our results suggest that the group line mainly reflects the asymptotic behavior of the scattering amplitude at grazing incidence, of which the leading nonlinear term is proportional to the square of surface slope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3aradar 3aresearch 3aspace and time1 aSaillard, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2474-531X1 aFabbro, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4279-70680 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Nov., v. 124, no. 11 p.8309-8323dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC0151233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010900156300001800265520049500283592002800778650002600806650001000832650001400842650001600856650001800872650000900890650001300899650001300912700001600925700002100941700002600962773014100988856007401129852000901203655001201212IND60670467520221120163014.0191002e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067046752DNAL7 a10.1039/c2tb00495j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wei Li10aGastric-floating microcapsules provide controlled and sustained release of multiple cardiovascular drugs  ap. 1090-1095.  aFloating polymeric microcapsules that simultaneously entrap multiple drugs were prepared using a solid/water/oil/water emulsion solvent evaporation method, based on harnessing interfacial phenomena and manipulation of the solvent removal process.

Unlike other studies we did not found differences in the content of PCBs or OCPs of eggs in relation to its production type. Median ∑OCPs content was 3.87ngg−1 fat, being dieldrin, dicofol, hexachlorobenzene, p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDT the most frequently detected. Median ∑PCBs value was 3.93ngg−1 fat, with 79.9% of this amount coming from the marker PCBs. Two samples, one free-run and one organic, greatly exceeded the current European Commission (EC) limit of 2.5pgTEQPCDD/Fg−1 lipid, but the rest were well below of this limit. The concentrations of PAHs in conventionally produced eggs were almost 4 times higher than in free-run or organic eggs. Mean dietary intake estimates of the organochlorine contaminants based on consumption of eggs, regardless of the type chosen, is negligible for the Canary Islands’ population. However, the median dietary intake estimates of PAHs greatly depend on the type of eggs chosen, being much lower when free-run and organic eggs are consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adicofol 3adieldrin 3aeggs 3afood intake 3ahexachlorobenzene 3amarkets 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aCanary Islands 3aSpain 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aHen eggs 0aOrganic eggs1 aRodríguez-Hernández, Ángel1 aQuesada-Tacoronte, Yohana1 aRuiz-Suárez, Norberto1 aAlmeida-González, Maira1 aHenríquez-Hernández, Luis Alberto1 aZumbado, Manuel1 aBoada, Luis D.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Oct., v. 60 p.455-462dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245007400173300001400247500002000261520104000281592002801321650001001349650002301359650001001382650002001392700002101412700002401433773014401457856008401601852000901685655001201694IND60786578520221122204423.0220804e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078657852DNAL7 a10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.01182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurlingame, Gary A.10aHumans as Sensors to Evaluate Drinking Water Taste and Odor: A Review  ap. 13-24.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOver the past 70 years, both trained and untrained consumer sensory panels have been used to evaluate and monitor the quality of foods and beverages. Although much has been learned about the strengths and weaknesses of using humans as sensory assessors within a range of businesses, including the water industry, traditional approaches to the sensory evaluation of drinking water can still be improved. Specific limitations of test procedures, designs, and analyses have been identified that need to be addressed to optimize the sensitivity, validity, and reliability of organoleptic testing. Depending on the complexity of the sensory test, it is not sufficient to simply follow a written test procedure. In general, careful attention must be given to the test administration and data evaluation to guard against the many factors that can influence the results. Ultimately, however, humans remain the quintessential sensory analyzers essential for assessing and maintaining the sensory quality of water at the highest levels possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3awater utilities1 aDoty, Richard L.1 aDietrich, Andrea M.0 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2017 Nov., v. 109, no. 11 p.13-24dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.01183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012900163300001600292520151600308592002801824596006401852596004601916650001901962650002301981650002002004650001002024650002102034650003002055650001502085650002802100650001202128650002402140650001902164700001902183700001502202700002202217700001802239700001602257700001402273700002802287700001402315700005602329773012702385856008202512852000902594655001202603IND60684894920221122180056.0200226e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068489492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-019-00736-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeLory, T.10aLocal variation in recombination rates of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome among samples from six disparate populations  ap. 127-138.  aMeiotic recombination is an essential component of eukaryotic sexual reproduction, but its frequency varies within and between genomes. Although it is well established that honey bees have a high recombination rate with about 20 cM/Mbp, the proximate and ultimate causes of this exceptional rate are poorly understood. Here, we describe six linkage maps of the western honey bee Apis mellifera that were produced with consistent methodology from samples from distinct parts of the species near global distribution. We compared the genome-wide rates and distribution of meiotic crossovers among the six maps and found considerable differences. Overall similarity of local recombination rates among our samples was unrelated to geographic or phylogenetic distance of the populations that our samples were derived from. However, the limited sampling constrains the interpretation of our results, because it is unclear how representative these samples were. In contrast to previous studies, we found only in two datasets a significant relation between local recombination rate and GC content. Focusing on regions of particularly increased or decreased recombination in specific maps, we identified several enriched gene ontologies in these regions and speculated about their local adaptive relevance. These data are contributing to an increasing comparative effort to gain an understanding of the intra-specific variability of recombination rates and their evolutionary role in honey bees and other social insects.  aPublisher supplied data  aR15GM102753cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aDMS #1359187cNational Science Foundation 3aApis mellifera 3achromosome mapping 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3ageographical distribution 3ahoney bees 3aintraspecific variation 3ameiosis 3asexual reproduction 3asocial insects1 aFunderburk, K.1 aMiller, K.1 aZuluaga-Smith, W.1 aMcPherson, S.1 aPirk, C.

During the conversion of the PSt-EA@SiO₂ core/shell microspheres to the asymmetric PSt-EA/Ni-Silicate composite, the spherical PSt-EA was melted within the hollow Ni-Silicate interior to form semi-microspheres. Upon further treating the asymmetric hollow microspheres by 500 °C calcination for 5 h, hierarchical Ni-Silicate hollow spheres were obtained. The BET area of the asymmetric hollow PSt-EA/Ni-Silicate microspheres was 58.9 m² g⁻¹ and the pore diameter was about 10–20 nm. The large porous nature of the products enable them be used as carriers for bio-molecules, and experiments indicated that the maximum adsorption ability of the asymmetric hollow microspheres could reach 8.2 μmol g⁻¹ when the concentration of Cytochrome C was 200 mmol L¬¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acytochrome c 3amelting 3amicroparticles 3apolymerization 3asilica1 aJiang, Wanquan1 aXuan, Shouhu1 aGong, Xinglong1 aYe, Fang1 aWang, Sheng1 aFang, Qunling0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Feb. 13, v. 1, no. 10 p.1414-1420dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2tb00508e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01195naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245005600131300001300187520050800200592002800708650001300736650001500749650001400764651001000778651001800788773012600806852000900932655001200941IND60300816520221121232726.0150703e20121207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030081652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagla, Pallava10aIndia Barred Entry to U.S. Author of Seismic Review  ap. 1275.  aRoger Bilham, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, was detained at the New Delhi airport in May and denied entry to India, where he has done research since 1967.

However, this task is challenging and often associated with uncertainty. Equivalent porous media approaches for modeling flow in karst aquifers fall short of capturing the hydraulic effect of individual karst features, while process‐oriented karst evolution models imply major computational efforts. In this study, we apply the Stochastic Karst Simulator (SKS) developed by Borghi et al. (2012) to generate karst conduit networks at a regional scale of a highly karstified carbonate aquifer located in the Eastern Mediterranean region and extensively used for water supply. The SKS generates conduit network geometries reasonably quick, using a mathematical proxy that mimics conduit evolution. The conduit simulation is based on a conceptual model of the genesis of the aquifer, consisting of different karstification phases. The stochastic approach of the algorithm enables us to generate an ensemble of conduit network realizations and to represent the uncertainties of these simulations in a Karst Probability Map. With only soft input information to constrain conduit evolution, multiple equivalent realizations yield similar resulting network geometries, indicating a robust approach. The presented methodology is numerically efficient, and its input can be easily adjusted. Subsequently, the resulting stochastic spatial distribution of conductivities can be employed for the parametrization of regional karst groundwater models.  aPublisher supplied data  a02WGR1428AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3acarbonates 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3amodels 3aresearch 3auncertainty 3awater supply 3aMediterranean region1 aSomogyvári, M.1 aSauter, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7837-08591 aRenard, P.1 aEngelhardt, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2590-77280 tWater resources research.g2022 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.e2021WR031710-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0317103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007000145245008800215520065800303592002800961650002300989650001601012650001501028650001001043650001101053650002101064650001101085650001101096650001001107653001901117653002301136653001901159653000801178653000801186700001701194773014901211856008001360852000901440655001201449IND60711223320221121220644.0210812e20200111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071122332DNAL7 a10.1515/jafio-2019-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOutreville, Jean-François1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5923-565110aHedonic Price Functions and Wine Price Determinants: A Review of Empirical Research  aThe objective of this paper is to present a descriptive review of all the studies published on wine price determinants.

For this review, we have identified a list of 117 papers published on price determinants over the period 1993 to 2018.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3ainformation 3aliterature 3apaper 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3asupply 3avolume 3awines 0ahedonic models 0aprice determinants 0aWine Economics 0aC83 0aQ111 aLe Fur, Eric0 tJournal of agricultural & food industrial organization.g2020 Jan. 11, v. 18, no. 2 p.20190028-dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl4071752x1542-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jafio-2019-00283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001600286520135800302592002801660650001701688650001801705650001501723650001501738650001201753650001401765650001101779650003101790650001601821650001701837650000901854650001501863650000901878650001001887650001601897650002001913650000901933653001401942653002401956653002601980653003202006653002102038700002402059700002402083700002902107700001802136773011402154856008502268852000902353655001202362IND60610738420221121182624.0180829e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061073842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavakoli, Omid10aCompetitive removal of heavy metal ions from squid oil under isothermal condition by CR11 chelate ion exchanger  ap. 256-266.  aHeavy metal ions (HMIs) are serious threats to the environment. Sub-critical water treatment was used to mimic contamination of squid oil in aqueous, metal-soap and oil phases. Isothermal adsorption of HMIs (Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺ and Zn²⁺) was studied from aqueous phase to oil phase (493, 523, 548, and 573K) for solutions with different initial concentration of HMIs was studied. Decomposition of glycerides into fatty acids was favored at high subcritical temperatures, with metal-soap phase showing the highest chelation ability toward Cu²⁺ (96%, isotherm 573K). The removal-ability of HMIs from contaminated oil was performed by CR11 chelate ion exchanger, showing facilitated removal from metal-soap and oil phases at low temperatures compared to general-purpose PEI-chitosan bead and PEI-chitosan fiber sorbents. The chelation behavior of Pb²⁺ and Cd²⁺ was the same in the OIL, with maximum values of 5.7×10⁻³ (mol/l) and 5.0×10⁻³ (mol/l) at 573K, respectively. By contrast, concentration of Zn²⁺ ion showed a slight increase with increasing temperature due to electrostatic forces between Zn²⁺ and active sites of glycerides in oil phase. For oil solution, the selectivity of adsorption for CR11, especially for Zn²⁺, was at least five-fold larger compared to PEI-chitosan bead and PEI-chitosan fiber adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aacylglycerols 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3achelation 3acopper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afatty acids 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal ions 3aoils 3asquid 3atemperature 3awater treatment 3azinc 0aSquid oil 0aAdsorption isotherm 0aChelate ion exchanger 0aSubcritical water treatment 0aHeavy metal ions1 aGoodarzi, Vahabodin1 aSaeb, Mohammad Reza1 aMahmoodi, Niyaz Mohammad1 aBorja, Rafael0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 July 15, v. 334 p.256-266dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012300177300001400300520110600314592002801420650001201448650001301460650002501473650001601498653001801514653001301532653001101545653001201556653001501568700002001583700002501603700002301628773014101651856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60595531920221118003157.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059553192DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2018.14402542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulkarni, Vaishali M.12aA Different Approach to Augment Pigment Production and its Extraction from Kocuria flava by Using Ultrasound Technique  ap. 34-42.  aThis research work reports the mapping of an ultrasonic bath for production of yellow bacterial pigment from Kocuria flava species. The main objective of this work was to intensify pigment production from the isolated bacteria and to reduce the time required for pigment production by using ultrasound. The isolated bacterium was grown at 37°C for 48 hrs in a rotary shaker at 180 RPM. The influence of different parameters like frequency, time, power, position, and the depth of ultrasound bath on the pigment productivity were investigated to get maximum yield. The initial pigment yield of 18.18 μg/mL increased to 86.33 μg/mL after ultrasound treatment at the optimized parameters of 24 kHz frequency, time duration of 20 min, power input at 120 W, and a height of 2.54 cm from bottom of the bath. Thus, a significant increase in the pigment production by ultrasonic treatment shows the advantages of ultrasound treatment on the production of natural pigment. Hence, this study can prove as a fundamental study for other ultrasound bath to achieve maximum productivity for any bacterial pigment  aPublisher supplied data 3aKocuria 3abacteria 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aKocuria flava 0amicrobes 0ayellow 0apigment 0aultrasound1 aDixit, Anand S.1 aPatwardhan, Anand V.1 aBajwa, Arjun Singh0 tJournal of Biologically Active Products from Nature.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 8, no. 1 p.34-42dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19680x2231-18747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22311866.2018.14402543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245019000166300001400356500001900370520128600389592002801675650001301703650001401716650002501730650002901755650001301784650000901797650001501806650002601821650001801847650002001865651001001885651001201895773010901907856008502016852000902101655001202110IND6036809920221117233737.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603680992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonte, Luigi10aRegional-scale application of the decision support system MOIRA-PLUS: an example of assessment of the radiological impact of the Chernobyl accident on the fresh water ecosystem in Italy  ap. 73-83.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present work illustrates the customisation and application of the decision support system MOIRA-PLUS (a MOdel-based computerised system for management support to Identify optimal remedial strategies for Restoring radionuclide contaminated Aquatic ecosystems and drainage areas) to the fresh water environment in Italy. MOIRA-PLUS is aimed at evaluating the behaviour of radiocaesium and radiostrontium in fresh water ecosystems and at assessing the appropriateness of suitable strategies for the management of contaminated water bodies by the application of multi-attribute analysis techniques. MOIRA-PLUS can be applied to complex networks of lakes, rivers and tributaries and can be straightforwardly customised utilising data and information from readily accessible sources such as official websites provided by scientific or government organisations. The present work shows an application of the decision system to 10 lakes and 18 rivers in Italy contaminated with ¹³⁷Cs of Chernobyl origin. Site-specific values of some aggregated transfer parameters were estimated for the most important Italian lakes. Although high values of fish and water consumptions were hypothesised, very low doses to public from the fresh water pathway following the accident were calculated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aaccidents 3acesium radioisotopes 3adecision support systems 3adrainage 3afish 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aradioactivity 3awater pollution 3aItaly 3aUkraine0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2011 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.73-83dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245021400170300001600384500001900400520173200419592002802151596007602179596008602255650002002341650002102361650002702382650002302409650001702432650000902449650001402458650001602472650001202488650001002500650001802510650001402528700002302542700006502565700003202630700002802662700002202690700002202712773012902734856008202863852000902945655001202954IND60727301020221121045404.0210210e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072730102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-020-01264-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, Vanessa D.13aAn alternative to reduce the use of the synthetic insecticide against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais through the synergistic action of Pimenta racemosa and Citrus sinensis essential oils with chlorpyrifos  ap. 409-421.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSitophilus zeamais attacks stored corn kernels and is traditionally controlled using synthetic pesticides. However, the frequent use of these toxic compounds leads to environmental and health damage and to the development of resistant insect populations. Essential oils (EOs) represent an alternative to conventional pesticides for pest control. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the combination of EOs with chlorpyrifos against S. zeamais in order to reduce the effective applied dose of the synthetic insecticide. The most active EOs against S. zeamais were Rosmarinus officinalis, Pimenta racemosa var. ozua and Citrus sinensis. Moreover, all the binary mixtures (1:1 volume of EO/volume of EO) of these EOs (P. racemosa–R. officinalis, P. racemosa–C. sinensis and R. officinalis–C. sinensis) showed a higher fumigant activity and repellency than the individual EOs, with the combinatory index (CI) values of these binary mixtures indicating synergism for fumigant activity. The P. racemosa–C. sinensis–chlorpyrifos (16:1 volume of binary mixtures of EOs/volume of chlorpyrifos) combination had a lower LC₉₅ value compared to the respective binary mixtures of EOs, revealing a synergistic effect. In addition, this combination did not produce phytotoxicity on maize grains. The binary mixture P. racemosa–C. sinensis in combination with chlorpyrifos synergized the effect of the synthetic pesticide without affecting germination of the maize grains. In addition, the use of this mixture (P. racemosa–C. sinensis–chlorpyrifos) decreased the net quantity of the synthetic insecticide, thus making it an interesting alternative for the control of the maize weevil S. zeamais.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2016-2496cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aSECyT-UNCcSecretaria de Ciencia y Tecnología - Universidad Nacional de Córdoba 3aCitrus sinensis 3aPimenta racemosa 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aSitophilus zeamais 3achlorpyrifos 3acorn 3afumigants 3agermination 3ainsects 3apests 3aphytotoxicity 3asynergism1 aAchimón, Fernanda1 aPizzolitto, Romina P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8321-07561 aRamírez Sánchez, Agripina1 aGómez Torres, Elisa A.1 aZygadlo, Julio A.1 aZunino, María P.0 tJournal of pest science.g2021 Mar., v. 94, no. 2 p.409-421dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-020-01264-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010400173300002000277500001900297520136600316592002801682650001101710650001701721650001101738650001301749650001201762650001201774700001301786700005501799700005501854700005301909700001401962700001601976700005401992700006002046773012102106856008702227852000902314655001202323IND60711138220221116183823.0200917e20200818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071113822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Xiaosong10aIn Pursuit of a Dendrite-Free Electrolyte/Electrode Interface on Lithium Metal Anodes: A Minireview  ap. 10503-10512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs one of the most promising electrode materials, lithium metal has excellent performance with its ultrahigh theoretic specific capacity (3860 mAh/g) and the lowest potential (−3.04 V versus standard hydrogen electrode). Nevertheless, the practical application of lithium metal batteries is hindered by the low coulombic efficiency and safety issues, which originate from the uneven Li deposition/dissolution process and the continuous growth of lithium dendrites. The composition, structure, and morphology of the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) are key factors in regulating the lithium deposition behavior and suppressing dendrite growth. In this review, the failure mechanism of the lithium metal anode and structural and compositional properties of ideal and practical SEIs are briefly summarized, including models describing the ion transfer process and the evolution of uneven lithium deposition at the interface. There are three main strategies to obtain a high-performance lithium metal anode from the perspective of regulating the electrolyte/electrode interface. They are (i) liquid electrolyte regulation, (ii) solid electrolyte application and separator modification, and (iii) electrode interface coating and composite anode. Lastly, the remaining challenges to be further solved and possible directions for future development are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3alithium1 aZhou, Qi1 aZhu, Yusong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9264-50541 aChen, Yuhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3498-00571 aFu, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9830-30071 aLiu, Lili1 aYu, Nengfei1 aWu, Yuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0833-12051 aVan Ree, Teunis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0126-67970 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Aug. 18, v. 34, no. 9 p.10503-10512dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009100165300001200256520104800268592002801316650001201344650002201356650002701378650001301405650002201418650001001440650001501450650001001465650001401475650001801489650000901507650001501516650001001531653001401541653001401555653001401569653001401583653001801597653002201615653001601637700001701653700001701670773012301687856008201810852000901892655001201901IND60478458420221119061731.0160121e20020401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047845842DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.50.2002.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakheit, B.

Influence of different physicochemical parameters on the adsorptive removal of dye is investigated and the conditions are optimized. The maximum adsorption ability for the adsorbent is noticed as 151.6 mg/g. Surface morphology of the adsorbent is studied using field emission scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller techniques. The adsorption mechanism is analyzed by various adsorption isotherms and kinetic models. Investigation of thermodynamic parameters reveals the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the extraction process. The spent adsorbent is regenerated and reused for the extraction and noted the adsorption capacity is marginally affected due to regeneration. The method is applied for purifying the dye-contaminated samples from the industrial effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrial wastewater 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics1 aKunta, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3500-07670 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.7837-7848dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-2147-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245012800204300001600332500002000348520080700368592002801175650001401203650002301217650002001240650001801260650001201278650002101290650004301311650001301354651002101367700005801388700005901446773012401505856007901629852000901708655001201717IND60742912020221122203507.0210627e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074291202DNAL7 a10.1111/1748-5967.125022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Sung‐Up1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8363-380410aDetermination of 5‐hydroxy oxindole by high performance liquid chromatography in Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis extracts  ap. 282-286.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhite‐spotted flower larvae (Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis; PBS) have recently been approved as a food ingredient in Korea. They confer an antithrombotic effect in addition to various nutrients, including protein, fat, and dietary fiber. However, a quantitative analytical method is still required for the analysis of medicinal foods or medicines containing the active ingredient (5‐hydroxy oxindole, 5‐HI). The HPLC method validated on PBS larvae was verified through parameters such as linearity, specificity, range, accuracy, precision, detection limit, and quantitation limit. All the parameters tested met these criteria and were applied to the successful detection of the extract in PBS larvae. This HPLC method to detect 5‐HI could be used as a validated assay in regulatory processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtaetia 3aactive ingredients 3adetection limit 3adietary fiber 3aflowers 3afood composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aresearch 3aKorean Peninsula1 aChoi, In‐Hag1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4354-27451 aChung, Tae‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0890-519X0 tEntomological research.g2021 June, v. 51, no. 6 p.282-286dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867074x1738-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.125023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245007400204300001200278500001500290506007600305520119000381592002801571506003701599650001301636650003301649650001101682650001401693650001401707650001201721650002701733650000801760650001801768650004101786651001101827653003601838700002301874700001901897700001501916700001501931700001901946700001601965773009001981856008102071852000902152655001202161IND60548986920221207110620.0170816e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054898692DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-016-0577-42doi7 aPMC49362482pmcid7 a273882092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, R.

This virus belongs to the genus Tospovirus (family Bunyaviridae) and seems to be exclusively transmitted by Frankliniella zucchini (Thysanoptera). Tospoviruses have a tripartite and single-stranded RNA genome classified as S (Small), M (Medium) and L (Large) RNAS. Although ZLCV was identified as a member of the genus Tospovirus in 1999, its complete genome had not been sequenced until now. FINDINGS: We sequenced the full-length genome of two ZLCV isolates named ZLCV-SP and ZLCV-DF. The phylogenetic analysis showed that ZLCV-SP and ZLCV-DF clustered with the previously reported isolate ZLCV-BR09. Their proteins were closely related, except the non-structural protein (NSm), which was highly divergent (approximately 90 % identity). All viral proteins clustered similarly in our phylogenetic analysis, excluding that these ZLCV isolates have originated from reassortment events of different tospovirus species. CONCLUSION: Here we report for the first time the complete genome of two ZLCV isolates that were found in the field infecting zucchini and cucumber.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3azucchini 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3agenome 3acucumbers 3aphylogeny 3aviruses 3aFrankliniella zucchini 3aRNA 3aCucurbitaceae 3aZucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus 3aBrazil 0aZucchini lethal chlorosis virus1 aDe Oliveira, A.

The respiratory macrophages provide important defence against aspergillosis. T-2 toxin (T-2), a trichothecene mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp. in improperly stored agricultural products, has immunomodulatory effects. We studied the impact of T-2 on the antifungal response of the chicken macrophage cell line HD-11 against A. fumigatus infection. The macrophages were first exposed to 0.5 to 10 ng/ml T-2 for 24 h, and then their viability, antifungal activity, and cytokine expression in response to A. fumigatus conidial infection were determined. The viability of macrophages decreased when exposed to T-2 at concentrations higher than 1 ng/ml. One hour after conidial infection, phagocytosed conidia were observed in 30% of the non-T-2-exposed macrophages, but in only 5% of the macrophages exposed to 5 ng/ml T-2. Seven hours after infection, 24% of the conidia associated with non-T-2-exposed macrophages germinated, in contrast to 75% of those with macrophages exposed to 5 ng/ml T-2. A. fumigatus infection induced upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1β, CXCLi1, CXCLi2 and IL-12β, and downregulation of transforming growth factor-β4 in macrophages. Exposure of A. fumigatus-infected macrophages to T-2 at 1 to 5 ng/ml further upregulated the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, CCLi2, CXCLi1, CXCLi2, IL-18 (at 1 and 2 ng/ml) and IL-12β, and further downregulated that of transforming growth factor-β4 (at 5 ng/ml). In conclusion, T-2 impaired the antifungal activities of chicken macrophages against A. fumigatus conidia, but might stimulate immune response by upregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and T-helper 1 cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aFusarium 3aT-2 toxin 3aagricultural products 3aantifungal properties 3aaspergillosis 3achemokines 3achickens 3aconidia 3afungi 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3arespiratory system 3aviability1 aPasmans, Frank1 aCroubels, Siska1 aVerbrugghe, Elin1 aVan Waeyenberghe, Lieven1 aYang, Zhen1 aHaesebrouck, Freddy1 aMartel, An0 tAvian pathology.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 42, no. 5 p.457-463dTaylor & Francisx1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2013.822958  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011500171300001600286520190900302592002802211650001802239650001502257650001602272650001002288650002802298650001302326650001202339650001402351650001802365650002102383650001702404650000902421650001402430650001602444651000902460651001102469653002002480653002902500653004002529653003102569653001602600700001802616700002002634700001802654773011002672856008502782852000902867655001202876IND60594969120221122045428.0180525e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059496912DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2017.13857242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchachner, Anna10aFowl adenovirus-induced diseases and strategies for their control – a review on the current global situation  ap. 111-126.  aThe stand-alone pathogenicity of fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) had long been disputed, given the ubiquity of the viruses versus sporadic outbreaks, and variation between experimental studies. However, a globally emerging trend of FAdV-associated diseases has marked the past two decades, with hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome mainly in Asia besides Arabian and Latin American countries, and geographically more disseminated outbreaks of inclusion body hepatitis. Finally, the appearance of FAdV-induced gizzard erosion (AGE) in Asia and Europe completed the range of diseases. Epidemiological studies confirmed serotype FAdV-4 as agent of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome, whereas inclusion body hepatitis is related to FAdV-2, -8a, -8b and -11. Members of the biologically more distant serotype FAdV-1 induce AGE. Urged by increasing problems in the field, numerous pathogenicity studies with FAdVs from outbreaks substantiated the primary aetiologic role of particular strains for distinct clinical conditions. Developments in the poultry industry towards highly specialized genetic breeds and rigorous biosecurity additionally contribute to the growing incidence of FAdV-related diseases. Confirming field observations, recent studies connected a higher susceptibility of broilers with their distinct physiology, implying the choice of bird type as a factor to be considered in infection studies. Furthermore, elevated biosecurity standards have generated immunologically naïve breeding stocks, putting broilers at risk in face of vertical FAdV transmission. Therefore, future prevention strategies should include adequate antibodies in breeders prior to production and – if necessary – vaccination, in order to protect progenies. This review aims to deliver a detailed overview on the current global situation about FAdV-induced diseases, their reproduction in vivo and vaccination strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAviadenovirus 3aantibodies 3abiosecurity 3abirds 3aepidemiological studies 3aetiology 3agizzard 3ahepatitis 3apathogenicity 3apoultry industry 3areproduction 3arisk 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aFowl adenovirus 0ainclusion body hepatitis 0ahepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome 0aadenoviral gizzard erosion 0avaccination1 aMatos, Miguel1 aGrafl, Beatrice1 aHess, Michael0 tAvian pathology.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 47, no. 2 p.111-126dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4833x1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2017.13857243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015800165300001600323500001900339520146600358592002801824650002501852650001701877650001701894650002701911650001601938650001501954650000901969650000901978650002101987650001202008650001502020650002002035650001302055650001502068650002002083650002202103650001802125650001602143700001702159700002502176700001802201700002102219700002002240700002802260773013202288856008202420852000902502655001202511IND60733567820221118032139.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073356782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-00924-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoor, Zohaib10aDietary supplementations of methionine improve growth performances, innate immunity, digestive enzymes, and antioxidant activities of rohu (Labeo rohita)  ap. 451-464.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe dietary composition of fish constitutes numerous immune and growth-promoting substance; during the current study, methionine was amended in the diet of Labeo rohita (L. rohita), in order to appraise the diverse modulatory effects of methionine supplementation. Fish were grouped into three on the basis of methionine as methionine supplemented group 1 (MSG1), methionine supplemented group 2 (MSG2), and CTRL (control group). We assessed the effects of methionine at the end. Captivating results were obtained from the methionine supplementing groups. The results depict significantly high (p < 0.05) innate immunity parameters, including myeloperoxidase, IgG concentrations, lysozyme, respiratory burst, and total bacteriolytic activity of complement in MSG2. Furthermore, ameliorate growth performances were also noticed such as high weight gain, FCE%, and body length in MSG2, respectively. We also measured high level of antioxidant digestive enzymes, gut length, and survival rate in MSG2 compared to the rest of the groups. The results were further validated by measuring the stress parameters, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose, and hematocrit (HCT%), and the concentration remains low in MSG2. Lastly, after 90 days, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila, the highest survival was observed in the MSG2 and MSG1 compared to CTRL. These results ultimately give the baseline to the credible effects of methionine on L. rohita.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aLabeo rohita 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody length 3acomplement 3adiet 3afish 3afood composition 3aglucose 3ahematocrit 3ainnate immunity 3alysozyme 3amethionine 3amyeloperoxidase 3arespiratory burst 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain1 aNoor, Mannal1 aKhan, Syed Allauddin1 aYounas, Waqar1 aUaliyeva, Daniya1 aHassan, Zaigham1 aYousafzai, Ali Muhammad0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.451-464dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-00924-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010300157300001800260520105900278592002801337650001401365650002801379650002201407650001301429650000901442650001801451700001701469700002001486700001701506700001801523700002101541773014201562856007401704852000901778655001201787IND60671031320221116142930.0191002e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067103132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb01873g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Shenzhou14aThe influence of the hydrophilic–lipophilic environment on the structure of silk fibroin protein  ap. 2599-2606.  aThe present study examines the influence of the hydrophilic–lipophilic environment, mediated by small molecules, on the structural changes in silk protein fibroin. Small molecules mediate the various hydrophilic–lipophilic balances (HLBs) that impact the organisation of silk protein chains. Changes in the silk fibroin structure due to additives are related to the HLB value. At HLB > 10, silk fibroin primarily forms Silk I crystalline structures. Small molecules with HLB < 8.9 primarily induce the formation of Silk II crystalline structures. When 8.9 < HLB < 10, the crystalline structure of silk is related to the content of small molecules. The Silk I structure is primarily formed when the content of small molecules is low, whereas the Silk II structure is formed when the small molecule content is high. The structure of silk fibroin is maintained by regulating the HLB in the fibroin environment. This type of control for the functional design of materials may play a role in fine-tuning the biomaterial properties of silk fibroin protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abiocompatible materials 3acrystal structure 3afibroins 3asilk 3asilk proteins1 aLi, Jiaojiao1 aZhang, Shanshan1 aYin, Zhuping1 aXing, Tieling1 aKaplan, David L.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 3, no. 13 p.2599-2606dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb01873g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019900171300001600370520123500386592002801621650002501649650001101674650003001685650002201715650002201737650001101759650001301770650001001783650001701793651001601810653002501826653002301851653001701874653001901891653002701910653002401937700001801961773008801979856008402067852000902151655001202160IND60603630820221116194457.0180716e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060363082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Mulali, Usama14aThe effect of energy consumption, urbanization, trade openness, industrial output, and the political stability on the environmental degradation in the MENA (Middle East and North African) region  ap. 382-389.  aThe main goal of this study is to examine the events that caused the environmental degradation in the MENA (Middle East and North African) region. To achieve the goal of this study, a panel model that represents the environmental degradation utilizing ecological footprint as a better indicator is constructed taken the period 1996–2012 investigating 14 MENA countries. The results from the Pedroni cointegration test revealed that ecological footprint, energy consumption, urbanization, trade openness, industrial development and political stability are cointegrated. Moreover, the results of FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least square) concluded that energy consumption, urbanization, trade openness and industrial development increases environmental damage while the political stability lessens it in the long run. In addition, the Granger causality revealed that the used variables have short run and long run causal relationship with the ecological footprint. Moreover, different directions of causal relationship were found between the variables. According to the outcomes of this study, a number of policy recommendations were provided for the MENA countries that can help them to reduce their environmental degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological footprint 3aenergy 3aenvironmental degradation 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apolitics 3atrade 3aurbanization 3aMiddle East 0aEcological footprint 0aEnergy consumption 0aUrbanization 0aTrade openness 0aIndustrial development 0aPolitical stability1 aOzturk, Ilhan0 tEnergy.g2015 May 01, v. 84 p.382-389dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245021700170300001600387520176700403592002802170650003202198650003602230650001502266650001002281650001902291650002802310650001102338650001302349650001502362650002602377650003002403650001202433650001802445650005202463650001602515651001102531651001202542651001102554651001902565651001002584651001802594651001602612651001102628651001302639651001002652651001902662653000802681653000902689653001602698653001102714653001702725700001602742700001602758700001402774700001502788773011002803856008502913852000902998655001203007IND60594969220221122045527.0180525e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059496922DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2017.13872312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWit, J.

In 234 flocks that were sampled, strains from 10 different IBV genotypes were detected: the 793B genotype was detected most frequently, followed by QX, Massachusetts (Mass) and the Xindadi-like strains. Strains belonging to the Q1, Ark, D274, D1466, Italy-02 and B1648 genotypes were detected as well, although less frequently. The separate sampling of tracheas and kidneys for IBV detection using reverse transcriptase PCR was very useful, as different genotypes or significant differences in sequences of the same genotype were detected between both organs. The data of this survey also provided valuable information about the replication of IBD vaccines and subsequent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) antibody responses under field conditions. The detection of five non-vvIBDV field strains of two different genotypes shows the presence of non-vvIBDV non-vaccine strains, which can easily be undetected in Europe due to the focus on sampling of clinically ill birds. Detection of vaccine virus in the bursa and antibody response to the IBD vaccination in flocks that had been vaccinated by the drinking water with a live attenuated vaccine compared to a vaccination in the hatchery using an immune-complex vaccine showed a delayed replication of the vaccines that had been applied by the drinking water, indicating mistakes in the timing and/or application of the vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aantibodies 3abirds 3adrinking water 3aepidemiological studies 3aflocks 3agenotype 3ahatcheries 3ainfectious bronchitis 3ainfectious bursal disease 3akidneys 3alive vaccines 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccination 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aGreece 3aIrish Republic 3aItaly 3aMassachusetts 3aNetherlands 3aPoland 3aPortugal 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 0aIBV 0aIBDV 0avaccination 0aEurope 0aepidemiology1 aCazaban, C.1 aDijkman, R.1 aRamon, G.1 aGardin, Y.0 tAvian pathology.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 47, no. 2 p.140-151dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4833x1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2017.13872313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008700170300001600257520148000273592002801753650001701781650002001798650001801818650002001836650001601856650001601872650001601888650001201904650002401916650001201940650001901952650002901971650002102000650001202021651000902033653001502042653000902057653002402066653001002090653001102100653000902111700001902120700002102139700001902160700002102179773008802200856008402288852000902372655001202381IND60603630920221116194638.0180716e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060363092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemi, Hossein10aEnergy flow analysis for rice production in different geographical regions of Iran  ap. 390-396.  aRice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important primary crop in Iran. In this study, energy use pattern for rice production was analyzed and compared in different geographical regions, Golestan, Mazandaran and Guilan, northern provinces of Iran. There is a significant difference among the three provinces in respect to input energy and agronomical managements such as crop rotation, transplanting date and land preparation. Data were collected from 50 farmers using a face to face questionnaire-based survey. The data collected belonged to the production period of 2012–2013 with the following results obtained. The energy use efficiency varied from 1.39 for Golestan to 1.67 for Guilan provinces. The research results revealed the main difference between energy consumption in three provinces comes from diesel fuel, chemical fertilizers and electricity. The net energy for paddy production was approximately higher in Guilan (36,927.58 MJ ha⁻¹) than other provinces. Also, the values of energy productivity (kg MJ⁻¹) for Golestan, Mazandaran and Guilan provinces were found to be 0.064, 0.059 and 0.070, respectively. On average 84.70% of total energy input used in rice production was non-renewable, while the contribution of renewable energy was 15.30. The results showed that the total energy input for rice production in Golestan province was 64,158.78 MJ ha⁻¹ which was higher than other provinces, due to high energy consumption in diesel fuel style (46.44%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3adata collection 3adiesel fuel 3aelectricity 3aenergy flow 3afarmers 3amineral fertilizers 3apaddies 3aquestionnaires 3arenewable energy sources 3asite preparation 3asurveys 3aIran 0aEnergy use 0aFuel 0aChemical fertilizer 0aInput 0aOutput 0aIran1 aKamkar, Behnam1 aLakzaei, Somayeh1 aBadsar, Meysam1 aShahbyki, Malihe0 tEnergy.g2015 May 01, v. 84 p.390-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015400154300001600308520023200324592002800556650000800584650002200592650001500614650001400629650001700643650001800660650001500678650001100693700001500704700001500719700002100734700001200755700001800767773013900785856007400924852000900998655001201007IND60671031420221116142917.0191002e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067103142DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb01875c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jia12aA SiO₂ NP–DNA/silver nanocluster sandwich structure-enhanced fluorescence polarization biosensor for amplified detection of hepatitis B virus DNA  ap. 964-967.  aA novel homogeneous biosensor based on the fluorescence polarization enhancement effect of the SiO₂ NP–DNA/Ag nanocluster sandwich structure has been developed for sensitive and selective detection of hepatitis B virus DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHepatitis B virus 3abiosensors 3achemistry 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilica1 aChen, Qiao1 aGao, Cunji1 aZhang, Mingliang1 aQin, Bo1 aQiu, Hongdeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 3, no. 6 p.964-967dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb01875c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012400172500001900296520187300315592002802188650000802216650002602224650001402250650001602264650004302280650001402323650000902337650001502346653000902361653000902370653001202379653000702391653000802398653000702406653000902413653000902422653000902431653001002440653001002450653000702460653002102467653001902488653002202507653001802529700006202547773010102609856008602710852000902796655001202805IND60683085920221122101530.0200405e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068308592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Jaqueline10aCell-based internal standard for qPCR determinations of antibiotic resistance indicators in environmental water samples  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aQuantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water, wastewater, soil, sediment and tissue samples. Concerns regarding the comparability of data obtained in different laboratories has been a major bottleneck to incentivize the compilation of publicly available of ARGs quantifications gathered from different reports. In this study, the influence of the DNA extraction kits (NZY Tissue gDNA Isolation kit or DNeasy PowerWater kit) and of the operator on the DNA extraction yield and on qPCR genes quantification was assessed. Since in wastewater and water samples the matrix effect can affect the DNA recovery and, therefore, gene quantification, an internal standard, consisting in a cloned gene not found in environmental samples, was tested. The aim was to assess how qPCR determinations in wastewater and water samples can be affected by the matrix effect. The results show that the DNA extraction operator did not significantly influence DNA yield. The use of distinct kits resulted in qPCR gene quantifications that did not differ in more than 1 log-unit mL⁻¹. The matrix effect, assessed based on the use of an internal standard, was associated with an underestimation that ranged 0.1–0.9 log gene copy number mL⁻¹ of sample, irrespective of the water type.The reliability on the use of a DNA extraction kit that costs about 3 times less than the most commonly used can be an incentive for the use of DNA based analyses of ARGs in environmental waters. Moreover, the fact that both the DNA extraction operator and the reduced matrix effect have little influence on the final results, are good news, encouraging the compilation of data produced in distinct laboratories. Nevertheless, harmonization efforts are still necessary to minimize bias that may be due associated with other conditions, such as equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibiotic resistance 3aequipment 3agene dosage 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3asoil 3awastewater 0aARGs 0aASLP 0aEcmolA+ 0aHE 0aNZY 0aPW 0aqPCR 0aRWWA 0aRWWP 0asTWWA 0asTWWP 0aUP 0aQuantitative PCR 0aDNA extraction 0aInternal standard 0aMatrix effect1 aManaia, Célia M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3674-17890 tEcological indicators.g2020 June, v. 113 p.106194-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001600276520124800292592002801540650002001568650001701588650001701605650001601622650002001638650003301658650001501691650002301706650003201729650001401761650001401775650002101789650002501810650001301835650002601848653001301874653001601887653001301903653001701916653002401933653002001957700002901977700002202006700003202028773011202060856005102172852000902223655001202232IND50087477620221120094651.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008747762DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2011.5619342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Manish10aThiourea mediates alleviation of UV-B stress-induced damage in the Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.)  ap. 143-150.  aUV-B radiation (280–320 nm) as an environmental stress has damaging effect on plants and its overexposure can potentially interfere with growth and development. The effect of thiourea (TU) on UV-B stress tolerance of 10-day-old Brassica juncea seedlings subjected to supplementary UV-B for 5 days was investigated. An increase in the UV-B absorbing compounds anthocyanin, flavonoids and phenolic compounds was observed in UV-B + TU treated seedlings as compared to that of control. The enhanced synthesis of UV-B screening compounds resulted in lesser damage to chlorophyll and also gain in fresh weight and dry weight in UV-B + TU as compared to UV-B alone treatment. The enzymatic activities of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased in UV-B + TU. The expression profiling of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (pal) and chalcone synthase (chs) indicated an upregulation under UV-B + TU treatment, compared to that of control, suggesting that TU treatment ensured an early and efficient induction of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The results indicate that TU helps in ameliorating the damaging effects of UV-B stress by efficiently maintaining the antioxidant status and attenuating the penetration of the UV-B.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiourea 3aultraviolet radiation 0aBrassica 0aUV-B stress 0athiourea 0aanthocyanins 0aantioxidant enzymes 0agene expression1 aSrivastava, Ashish Kumar1 aSuprasanna, Penna1 aD'Souza, Stanislaus Francis0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2012 June 1, v. 7, no. 2 p.143-150dTaylor & Francis Groupx1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2011.561934  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245009300176300001600269520130600285592002801591650002601619650002901645650001001674650001801684650001201702650001101714650002201725650002401747650002101771650001501792650001301807651001001820653002401830653001701854653001801871653001401889653001001903700001501913700001601928700001901944700001501963700001201978700003101990700001902021773018302040856009402223852000902317655001202326IND60535733120221116182020.0160804e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053573312DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuemeng, Geng10aSimulating Methane Emissions from the Littoral Zone of a Reservoir by Wetland DNDC Model  ap. 281-290.  aThe littoral zone of freshwater ecosystems is believed to be a hotspot for methane (CH₄) emissions, but in situ measurements are rare. This paper reports a study of CH₄ fluxes from the Miyun Reservoir near Beijing in China based on an integrated observational and modelling approach. CH₄ fluxes were measured at three sites with different water levels containing nine representative vegetation communities. A process-based model, Wetland-DNDC, was tested against observations for its applicability in simulating CH₄ fluxes from the littoral zone of the reservoir. The R² values, which showed correlation between the modeled and observed results, were 0.89, 0.81 and 0.49 for the deep water, shallow water and seasonally flooded sites, respectively. The modeled data indicated that the observed CH₄ fluxes were mainly driven by water level fluctuations, soil temperature and soil organic matter content. The modeled average annual flux from the littoral zone of Miyun Reservoir was 15.1 g CH₄.m⁻², which was comparable with other studies in China. Our study suggests that Wetland-DNDC is a suitable choice as a model for CH₄ flux simulation from littoral zone of reservoirs or lakes, although improvements in the vegetation module could enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater ecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amethane 3amodels 3aplant communities 3asoil organic matter 3asoil temperature 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aChina 0aProcess-based model 0amethane flux 0alittoral zone 0areservoir 0aChina1 aMeng, Yang1 aJohn, Grace1 aChangsheng, Li1 aYifei, Jia1 aCai, Lu1 aZhou, Yanc(Xinhua writer)1 aGuangchun, Lei0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 4 p.281-290dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814%2Fj.issn.1674-764x.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009300165500001900258520197800277592002802255650001202283650001502295650002102310650004302331650000902374650001902383650000902402651001002411653002302421653004802444653002702492653002902519700005802548700001102606700001702617700005602634700001902690773010102709856008602810852000902896655001202905IND60683086120221122134037.0200405e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068308612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Qing10aEvaluation of submerged mangrove recognition index using multi-tidal remote sensing data  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor effective mangrove forest mapping, it is valuable to develop vegetation indices from remote-sensing imagery that can characterize the unique characteristics of mangrove forests and differentiate them from other land cover types (especially other vegetation types). In addition to diverse range of vegetation indices derived from single-phase, remote-sensing imagery that has been applied to mangrove forest classifications, recently a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI for short) that considers multi-tidal, high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery, and which is based on the differential spectral signature of mangrove forests under high and low tides, was proposed for use in mangrove forest classifications (Xia et al., 2018). However, to date SMRI has not been compared with existing vegetation indices that are often applied in mangrove forest classifications based on remote-sensing imagery in detail. In this study, the SMRI values obtained from medium- and high-resolution images (i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS and GF-1 respectively) are compared with four vegetation indices widely used in mangrove forest classifications (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index, ratio vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index). One more vegetation index, which was only available for remote-sensing imagery with visible bands, a short-wave infrared band, and a mid-wave infrared band, i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS images, was also compared with the SMRI obtained from the medium-resolution images. The results from experiments with medium- and high-resolution images of Yulin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China show that the SMRI can distinguish submerged mangrove forests more effectively than the compared vegetation indices, especially in areas between high- and low-tide levels. Furthermore, the SMRI results obtained from high-resolution images perform better than those obtained from medium-resolution images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aland cover 3amangrove forests 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aoils 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3aChina 0aVegetation indices 0aSubmerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) 0aHigh-resolution images 0aMedium-resolution images1 aQin, Cheng-Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-98071 aLi, He1 aHuang, Chong1 aSu, Fen-Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4972-35951 aJia, Ming-Ming0 tEcological indicators.g2020 June, v. 113 p.106196-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010300169300002000272520179000292592002802082650002602110650001802136650001802154650001802172650001902190650003102209650001102240650002202251650002102273650001302294650001502307700002202322700002002344700002602364700002202390700001902412700006002431773012502491856008302616852000902699655001202708IND60623802020221120101619.0181129e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062380202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b006602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimo, Marion J.10aInteractions between Metal Oxides and Biomolecules: from Fundamental Understanding to Applications  ap. 11118-11193.  aMetallo-oxide (MO)-based bioinorganic nanocomposites promise unique structures, physicochemical properties, and novel biochemical functionalities, and within the past decade, investment in research on materials such as ZnO, TiO₂, SiO₂, and GeO₂ has significantly increased. Besides traditional approaches, the synthesis, shaping, structural patterning, and postprocessing chemical functionalization of the materials surface is inspired by strategies which mimic processes in nature. Would such materials deliver new technologies? Answering this question requires the merging of historical knowledge and current research from different fields of science. Practically, we need an effective defragmentation of the research area. From our perspective, the superficial accounting of material properties, chemistry of the surfaces, and the behavior of biomolecules next to such surfaces is a problem. This is particularly of concern when we wish to bridge between technologies in vitro and biotechnologies in vivo. Further, besides the potential practical technological efficiency and advantages such materials might exhibit, we have to consider the wider long-term implications of material stability and toxicity. In this contribution, we present a critical review of recent advances in the chemistry and engineering of MO-based biocomposites, highlighting the role of interactions at the interface and the techniques by which these can be studied. At the end of the article, we outline the challenges which hamper progress in research and extrapolate to developing and promising directions including additive manufacturing and synthetic biology that could benefit from molecular level understanding of interactions occurring between inanimate (abiotic) and living (biotic) materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocomposites 3abiotechnology 3amanufacturing 3ananocomposites 3aphysicochemical properties 3asilica 3asynthetic biology 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 3azinc oxide1 aSola-Rabada, Anna1 aBoix, Estefania1 aThota, Veeranjaneyulu1 aWestcott, Zayd C.1 aPuddu, Valeria1 aPerry, Carole C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1517-468X0 tChemical reviews.g2018 Oct. 26, v. 118, no. 22 p.11118-11193dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b006603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001600267520145500283536014701738592002801885596005401913650002601967650001901993650002502012650003002037650001002067650001502077650002102092650000902113650001202122650001502134651001602149653002602165653003002191653001802221653001902239700002202258773014102280856008602421852000902507655001202516IND60742912620221120114109.0210721e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074291262DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2020.18371882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoliman, Tarek10aAssessing dairy farming eco-efficiency in New Zealand: a two-stage data envelopment analysis  ap. 411-428.  aWe employ a two-stage data envelopment analysis technique to assess the ecological-economic performance or ‘eco-efficiency’ of dairy farms in New Zealand. 108 dairy farms were surveyed over one year period across the country to analyse farming eco-efficiency. Survey data on milksolids production and production costs are used to estimate the economic performance (i.e. profits), while data on greenhouse gas emissions and estimated nutrient leaching are used to analyse environmental performance. Information on geophysical characteristics and management practices that could indirectly affect farm eco-efficiency, is also incorporated into the analysis. In the first stage, we estimate eco-efficiency scores for each sampled farm using data envelopment analysis which estimates the maximum possible reductions in environmental outputs while retaining the current level of profits. In the second stage, the effects of geophysical characteristics and management practices on the calculated eco-efficiency scores are estimated using an integrated truncated regression and bootstrapping procedure. The results show that, on average, a reduction of 27% in adverse environmental externalities is achievable while maintaining the same level of economic output. Adopting on-farm management practices can be an option to improve dairy efficiency. In addition, soil topography and higher temperatures are associated with reduced levels of eco-efficiency.  aThis work was supported by Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research [SSIF resource management decisions project (code 683120-0184) in– 2017/18].  aPublisher supplied data  a683120-0184cManaaki Whenua – Landcare Research 3aagricultural research 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic performance 3aenvironmental performance 3afarms 3ageophysics 3agreenhouse gases 3asoil 3asurveys 3atopography 3aNew Zealand 0aProductivity analysis 0adata envelopment analysis 0abootstrapping 0adairy industry1 aDjanibekov, Utkur0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2021 July 03, v. 64, no. 3 p.411-428dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl16066x1175-87757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2020.18371883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001600158245012200174300001600296520149900312592002801811650001301839650004301852650002201895650001901917650002201936650002101958650001201979650001701991651001002008653002702018653002702045653002302072653002702095700001702122700002002139773018302159856009402342852000902436655001202445IND60535733220221116182132.0160804e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053573322DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2016.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMengxu, Gao10aObject-Oriented Method for Rural Residential Land Extraction in the Hilly Areas of Southern China Using RapidEye Data  ap. 291-300.  aThe process of rapid urbanization in China features two opposing trends: declining rural population and increasing rural residential land, especially in southern hilly areas. The extraction and analysis of residential land in rural China represents an important application for remote sensing technology. The study aimed to discover rural residential land information using RapidEye satellite imagery, taking Taihe County as the research area in the hilly region of southern China. Based on multiple experiments, classification was conducted with an optimal image segmentation scale set to 200. The object-oriented classification rule set was constructed using the customized parameters NDVI, NDWI, brightness, and length/width. The areas of residential land and other land use types were interpreted by varying the parameter values for classification rule sets. Finally, validation and accuracy evaluations were carried out. The overall accuracy of residential land interpretation is 78.40%, and producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 68.75% and 77.33%, respectively. The results indicate that RapidEye provides a suitable data source for extraction of rural residential land using an object-oriented approach. Compared with the second national land survey of China, the classification gave an absolute difference of 93.67 ha residential land within the study area. Recognition errors occurred mainly in regions adjacent to the boundaries between residential land and other types of land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation growth 3aremote sensing 3aresidential areas 3arural population 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aChina 0arural residential land 0ainformation extraction 0aRapidEye satellite 0aobject-oriented method1 aJuanle, Wang1 aZhongqiang, Bai0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 4 p.291-300dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814%2Fj.issn.1674-764x.2016.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013200174500001900306520151100325592002801836650002301864650001301887650000801900650001601908650001301924650001201937650002001949650001601969650002301985650001602008650001602024651001902040653001802059653002702077653002202104653001802126700002302144700002402167773010702191856008702298852000902385655001202394IND60706876020221121055238.0201024e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070687602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, Alyssa10aObservations of new particle formation, modal growth rates, and direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles in an urban environment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUltrafine particles with diameters less than 100 nm suspended in the air are a topic of interest in air quality and climate sciences. Sub-10 nm particles are of additional interest due to their health effects and contribution to particle growth processes. Ambient measurements were carried out at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC between April to June 2019 and November 2019 to May 2020 to investigate the temporal variability of size distribution and number concentration of ultrafine particles. A mobile lab was deployed between March and May 2020 to characterize the spatial distribution of sub-10 nm particle number concentration. New particle formation and growth events were observed regularly. Also observed were direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles. Analysis against meteorological variables, gas-phase species, and particle concentrations show that the sub-10nm particles dominated number concentration during periods of low planetary boundary layer height, low solar radiation, and northeast winds. The spatial patterns observed during mobile deployments suggest that multiple temporally stable and spatially confined point sources of sub-10 nm particles are present within the city. These sources likely include the campus utility plants and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Additionally, the timing of data collection allowed for investigation of variations in the urban aerosol number size distribution due to reduced economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair quality 3aairports 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aenvironment 3atemporal variation 3atroposphere 3aurban areas 3aNorth Carolina 0aUrban aerosol 0aNew particle formation 0aSub-10 nm aerosol 0aAir pollution1 aPetters, Markus D.1 aMeskhidze, Nicholas0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 242 p.117835-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002000160245006100180300001500241506002800256520036600284592002800650506003700678650001600715650001200731650003000743650001200773653001500785653001700800653001500817653001500832700002400847700001800871773019300889856009501082852000901177655001201186IND60757436820221207100642.0190516e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075743682DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2009-5-1-91-1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolshakov, L.V.10aPyraloid moths (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) of Penza Region  ap. 91-110.  aResource is Open Access  aOn the basis of long-term collections (1907–1909, 1963–1988, 2001–2008), museum materials and literary data Penza Region Pyraloidea check-list is presented including 148 species, 23 of which are listed for the province for the first time, 1 – for the Middle Volga Region for the first time.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of strawberry disease caused by SVBV. METHODS: We performed the next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) study to identify gene expression changes induced by SVBV in woodland strawberry using mock-inoculated plants as a control. RESULTS: Using RNA-Seq, we have identified 36,850 unigenes, of which 517 were differentially expressed in the virus-infected plants (DEGs). The unigenes were annotated and classified with Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The KEGG pathway analysis of these genes suggested that strawberry disease caused by SVBV may affect multiple processes including pigment metabolism, photosynthesis and plant-pathogen interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides comprehensive transcriptome information regarding SVBV infection in strawberry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFragaria vesca 3aStrawberry vein banding virus 3achlorosis 3agene expression regulation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant veins 3aplant viruses 3astrawberries 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes1 aZhang, Hanping1 aFeng, Mingfeng1 aZuo, Dengpan1 aHu, Yahui1 aJiang, Tong0 tVirology journal.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.128-128dBioMed Centralx1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0584-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009700175300001600272520125800288592002801546650001801574650001301592650001901605650001301624650002501637650002501662650001301687650001501700650001001715650001601725650002201741650001101763650000701774650001401781650001501795650001401810650001001824650002501834653001301859653002401872653001501896653001301911653000801924653001501932700002801947700002101975773011201996856005102108852000902159655001202168IND50087477820221120094709.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008747782DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2011.5841332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatapathy, Prakasini10aAluminum-induced abiotic stress counteracts Fusarium infection in Cajanus cajan (L.)

Germinating seeds of C. cajan conditioned by treating presoaked seeds with Al at concentrations 0, 10, 50, and 100 µM, pH 4.5, for 24 h were subjected to fungal infection. Subsequently, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS: O₂•⁻ and H₂O₂), cell death, and activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase [SOD], guaiacol peroxidase [GPX], and ascorbate peroxidase [APX]) in the root tissue of seedlings were estimated. Both Al conditioning and Fusarium infection resulted in a significant increase in ROS generation, cell death, and SOD, but inhibited CAT activity significantly. CAT as well as GPX displayed isomorphic differences between treatments. APX activity was increased in response to Al conditioning, but decreased in response to Fusarium infection. Al conditioning at 50 µM significantly counteracted against Fusarium infection that was marked by a concomitant decrease in ROS generation and cell death whereas little changes were observed in activities of antioxidant enzymes. The findings underscored the importance of controlled ROS homeostasis in counteracting Fusarium infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aFusarium 3aabiotic stress 3aaluminum 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acell death 3afungi 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxygen 3apH 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aaluminum 0aantioxidant enzymes 0acell death 0aFusarium 0aROS 0apigeon pea1 aAchary, V.

The annual levoglucosan concentration was determined to be 328.3 ng m⁻³, at a similar level as it in other Chinese cities; the concentration peaked in fall, indicating influences of crop/straw burning during harvest periods. Concentrations of other species were a few orders of magnitude lower than that of levoglucosan, with salicylic acid (1.53 ng m⁻³), cis-pinonic acid (0.60 ng m⁻³) and vanillic acid (0.51 ng m⁻³) as the three most abundant ones. Total concentrations of tracers indicative of softwood, hardwood and grass burning were about equal. Seasonal concentrations of these tracers were generally similar, and all peaked in winter, different from that of levolglucosan. Further positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified four types of biomass (cellulose, harwood lignin, softwood lignin and grass). Celluose was dominated in fall, while softwood and hardwood were both dominated in winter, and seasonal contributions (except summer) were relatively even to grass. On an annual basis, softwood, hardwood and grass contributions were almost on par to the selected tracers, in agreement with the results based only on concentrations, but seasonally, grass was the major one in spring, summer and fall, but much less important in winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aenvironment 3agrasses 3ahardwood 3asalicylic acid 3asoftwood 3asoftwood lignin 3aspring 3astraw 3asummer 3avanillic acid 3awinter 3aChina 0aBiomass burning 0aGrass 0aSource apportionment1 aWang, Junfeng1 aQi, Lu1 aYu, Wentao1 aNie, Dongyang1 aShi, Shuangshuang1 aGu, Chuanxin1 aGe, Xinlei1 aChen, Mindong0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 240 p.117837-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1178373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008200169300001600251520100600267592002801273650001501301650002201316650001401338650001101352650001701363650001101380650001501391650002901406653001501435653003301450653002701483653001401510653002901524700002001553700001901573700001901592773008801611856008401699852000901783655001201792IND60603631320221116194204.0180716e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060363132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.02.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsied, Moataz10aEnergy management and optimization in microgrid system based on green energy  ap. 139-151.  aCurrent research activities witness a special focus on the integration of DERs (distributed energy resources) and ESSs (energy storage systems) in MG (micro-grid) applications.

For this purpose, an advanced EMS in a typical MG working in grid connected mode is introduced. The developed EMS is able to determine the optimal operating strategies that minimize the energy costs, pollutant emissions, and hence maximizing the output of the available renewable energy resources. The established EMS is formulated as a nonlinear optimization model with different equality and inequality constraints for proper solution based on the AIMMS (Advanced Integrated Multidimensional Modeling Software). The performance of AIMMS is compared with other commonly used algorithm such as GA (genetic algorithms) to clarify the efficient and robustness of AIMMS solver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3amodels 3apollutants 3arenewable energy sources 0aMicro-grid 0aDistributed energy resources 0aEnergy storage systems 0aMain grid 0aEnergy management system1 aOukaour, Amrane1 aGualous, Hamid1 aHassan, Radwan0 tEnergy.g2015 May 01, v. 84 p.139-151dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.02.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04179naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007100151245022800222500001900450520231200469592002802781650001302809650001702822650001102839650001702850650001902867650002102886650000902907650002302916650001202939650001502951650001302966650002902979650001503008650002403023650001903047650000903066650001603075651002203091651001303113651001003126653002603136653001203162653002503174653002703199653002903226700006803255700007203323700003403395773010103429856008603530852000903616655001203625IND60683086420221122134056.0200405e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068308642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Girón, José Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5583-739110aInfluence of climate variations on primary production indicators and on the resilience of forest ecosystems in a future scenario of climate change: Application to sweet chestnut agroforestry systems in the Iberian Peninsula  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSweet chestnut agroforestry systems make valuable contributions to the landscape and environment, fulfilling fundamental functions and processes. Net primary production (NPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) are commonly used as ecological indicators to evaluate the responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change. Nonetheless, although climate-induced primary production changes have been widely documented at the global scale, few studies have addressed this issue at local scale in relation to sweet chestnut forests. Data from 65 climate maps and MODIS remote-sensed data captured in the Iberian Peninsula between 2000 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Different statistical methods (Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Trees) were used to analyse the potential influence of climate change on sweet chestnut primary production, thus enabling assessment of ecosystem and ecosystem service (ES) supply and of the resilience of these systems in a future scenario of climate change in the Iberian Peninsula. The findings for the whole of the Iberian Peninsula show that NPP and CUE are negatively correlated with temperature variables and positively correlated with latitude. High NPP values mainly corresponded to northern Spain, which is characterised by cold, humid conditions. The CUE values were highest in northern Portugal, mainly in managed, monospecific forest. Overall, the fitted models showed a temporary response in which the monthly variables were particularly important and water availability was more important than temperature. The findings suggest that precipitation is not a limiting factor in Atlantic areas, but that water availability tends to be a limiting factor in Mediterranean areas. However, mean annual temperature (MAT) is also an important driver of sweet chestnut production and may be a limiting factor in a future scenario of climate change. Regions of Provenance (RoP) proved useful for explaining NPP and CUE and classifying the sweet chestnut agroforestry systems. Finally, the study findings also revealed that Iberian sweet chestnut ecosystems and the associated ES supplies are at risk of being seriously affected or even disappearing as a result of climate change, especially in some Mediterranean areas of southern and central Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aagroforestry 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3anet primary productivity 3aprovenance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3atemperature 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aCarbon use efficiency 0aClimate 0aEcosystem resilience 0aNet primary production 0aEcosystem services risks1 aÁlvarez-Álvarez, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6898-81371 aDíaz Varela, Emilio Rafael,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9360-03521 aMendes Lopes, Domingos Manuel0 tEcological indicators.g2020 June, v. 113 p.106199-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245017800175300001600353520184200369536008202211592002802293596007502321650002502396650001302421650001002434650002502444650001502469650001702484650001002501650001402511650001002525650001002535650001802545650001902563650000902582650001202591650001402603650001702617650001402634650003002648650001802678650001202696653001302708653001702721653002502738653001502763653001902778700002602797700001902823700002102842773011002863856008502973852000903058655001203067IND60594969920221122045609.0180525e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059496992DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2017.14012132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadani, Seyed Ahmad10aMolecular and morphological description of Isospora sp. from the common mynah (Acridotheres tristis) and a preliminary survey of two anticoccidial drugs in natural infection  ap. 206-212.  aCoccidian parasites, especially Isospora, are prevalent parasites in Passeriformes. Isosporan oocysts from common mynahs (Acridotheres tristis) are incompletely described. Detailed knowledge on biology, prevalence, pathogenesis and treatment of avian isosporiasis is scant. In this study, isosporan oocysts isolated from common mynahs were morphologically and molecularly characterized. The medication efficiencies of diclazuril and sulfadiazine-trimethoprim in isosporiasis in naturally infected mynahs were evaluated. Isosporan oocysts from common mynahs were described morphologically by microscopic imaging. The 18S rRNA and COI genes were amplified using PCR and the resultant products were sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. To evaluate the efficiencies of diclazuril and sulfadiazine-trimethoprim, two experimental treatment groups and a null control were assigned. General health status, weight and oocysts per gram of faeces were evaluated. Oocysts from all birds contained isosporan oocysts that were morphologically and dimensionally similar (P < 0.05). The oocysts were spherical; with no oocyst residuum, micropyle or polar granules. At both loci, phylogenetic analyses placed the Isospora isolate in the same clade with Isospora spp. from other Passeriformes. Both of the anticoccidials were well tolerated by the birds, a rapid reduction in oocyst excretion was noted at the commencement of treatment and 72 h after drug administration, oocyst excretion zeroed in all treated birds. Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate does not resemble any previously described isosporas, hence Isospora tristum n. sp. is proposed for the current species. Both evaluated anticoccidials seemed to be efficient in reduction of oocyst production and can be recommended for the treatment of mynah isosporiasis.  aThis work was supported by the University of Tehran [grant number 1/6/28864].  aPublisher supplied data  a1/6/28864cUniversity of Tehrandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004481 3aAcridotheres tristis 3aIsospora 3abirds 3acytoplasmic granules 3adiclazuril 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3afeces 3agenes 3ahealth status 3aimage analysis 3aloci 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asurveys 0aIsospora 0acommon mynah 0aAcridotheres tristis 0amorphology 0aanticoccidials1 aArabkhazaeli, Fatemeh1 aShakeri, Elyas1 aNabian, Sedigheh0 tAvian pathology.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 47, no. 2 p.206-212dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4833x1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2017.14012133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008600164506002800250520157900278592002801857506003701885650001801922650002201940650001001962650001601972650001001988650001901998650001302017650001202030650001802042650000902060650000702069650002102076650001502097650002302112650001402135653001702149653001102166653001402177653001502191653001202206700002002218700002102238773009202259856008002351852000902431655001202440IND60764471920221207143202.0211122e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076447192DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2108572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArpiwi, Ni Luh10aEssential oil from Cymbopogon nardus and repellant activity against Aedes aegypti  aResource is Open Access  aArpiwi NL, Muksin IK, Kartini NL. 2020. Essential oil from Cymbopogon nardus and repellant activity against Aedes aegypti. Biodiversitas 21: 3873-3878. Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle is an aromatic grass from the Poaceae family that produces essential oil mainly in the leaves. The essential oil from C. nardus is known as citronella oil has repellent activity. This research aimed to quantify the oil content of C. nardus leaves, to analyze the essential oil quality, to analyze the repellent activity of lotion with different concentrations of citronella oil against Aedes aegypti, and to examine the quality of formulated lotions. The oil was extracted from leaves using steam distillation, and the quality was examined according to the Indonesian National Standard. The citronella oil was formulated into a lotion with five concentrations (0, 2, 3, 4, 5% w/w). Repellent activity of the lotions against Ae. aegypti was tested using screened cage test method under laboratory conditions. Lotion quality was analyzed for pH, viscosity, homogeneity, and sensorial assessments. The result showed that the oil yield of C. nardus leaves was 0.9% w/w. The color of the oil was pale yellow, specific weight was 0.8819, the refraction index was 1.464, total geraniol was 72.71%, citronellal content was 49.14%, and solubility in 80% alcohol 1:2 was clear. The repellent activity of lotions with citronella oil was concentration-dependent, where a concentration of 5% gave the highest protection. The quality of formulated lotions met the standard and the lotions were nonirritant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aCymbopogon nardus 3acages 3acitronellal 3acolor 3aessential oils 3ageraniol 3agrasses 3alipid content 3aoils 3apH 3arefractive index 3asolubility 3asteam distillation 3aviscosity 0adistillation 0alotion 0aoil yield 0aprotection 0aquality1 aMUksin, I Ketut1 aKartini, Ni Luh 0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Aug., v. 21, no. 8dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2108573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245017400170300001800344520118900362592002801551596005201579596015601631650002101787650001501808650002901823650001301852650001901865650002101884650001801905650001901923650001301942650001501955650001701970650001401987650002202001650001702023700001502040700006002055773012102115856008102236852000902317655001202326IND60620722520221120040834.0181114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062072252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2982-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolanský, Jiří,10aMultifunctional polystyrene nanofiber membrane with bounded polyethyleneimine and NO photodonor: dark- and light-induced antibacterial effect and enhanced CO2 adsorption  ap. 2740-2753.  aHerein, we report the preparation, characterization and antibacterial evaluation of electrospun polystyrene nanofiber membrane with covalently bonded polyethyleneimine and NO photodonor. The nanofiber membranes were prepared by electrospinning, followed by two-step functionalization of the nanofiber surface by chlorosulfonic acid and then by polyethyleneimine (PEI) with or without NO photodonor. Nanofiber membranes with PEI and NO photodonor are characterized by a high hydrophilicity, photogeneration of NO radicals and CO₂ retention. Due to the photogeneration of highly antibacterial NO radicals, the nanofibers exhibited an efficient antibacterial effect toward Gram-negative Escherichia coli when activated by visible light. The functionalization of the nanofiber membranes by PEI was responsible for the antibacterial character of the surface of the nanofiber membranes even in the dark, showing low bacteria adherence and the retention of CO₂. The combination of the properties of the membranes including also protecting against pathogens passing through the nanofiber membrane suggests that these nanomaterials have a promising broad range of applications in medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-15020ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky  aOP VVV “Excellent Research Teams”, project No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000417 – CUCAMcMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy (CZ) 3aEscherichia coli 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3afree radicals 3ahydrophilicity 3amedicine 3ananofibers 3anitric oxide 3apathogens 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolystyrenes1 aDemel, Jan1 aMosinger, Jiří1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5173-27440 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Feb., v. 54, no. 3 p.2740-2753dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2982-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015300165300001600318520109600334592002801430650004401458650001101502650001701513650001801530650002601548650001801574650001101592650001501603650003301618650001501651650001301666651001201679653001801691653001101709653001901720653002101739653002601760653002601786653002601812653003301838653002501871653001201896653005101908653002201959700001601981700001401997700001602011700001402027773011302041856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60542738520221120082906.0190405e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054273852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassbasi, M.10aPrediction of the geographical origin of butters by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) applied to infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data  ap. 210-215.  aThis study examined the potential of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in combination with chemometric methods to discriminate among butters of different regions from Morocco. Chemometric analysis of the data provided by FTIR analysis made it possible to establish links to the food origin of 54 butter samples produced in the Fkih Ben Saleh, Kssiba and Kalaa Sraghna areas. The data of calibration set provided a characteristic pattern, or ‘fingerprint’, relating to the origin of the samples, with good discriminant power. Two models using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were built. The PCA model was able to describe the studied system by using four principal components with a value of explained variance of 98%. The PLS-DA model accurately classified the butter samples of an external validation subset with prediction ability of 100%. The proposed methods, if compared to other techniques, have the main advantage in allowing very rapid measurements and results characterized by high accuracy and precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abutter 3achemometrics 3adata analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3avariance 3aMorocco 0aFood analysis 0aButter 0aClassification 0aFood composition 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aPartial least squares 0aDiscriminant analysis 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aGeographical origins 0aTerroir 0aAgricultural and dairy practices and nutrition 0aRegulatory issues1 aDe Luca, M.1 aIoele, G.1 aOussama, A.1 aRagno, G.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2014 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.210-215dElsevier Inc.wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012600171300001800297520163900315536015001954592002802104596005302132650002202185650002202207650001302229650002602242650001302268650001202281650002502293650000902318650001202327650002802339650001002367650001802377650001602395650002902411650001302440650002502453650002902478650000902507650002402516650001702540650001202557651001302569653002102582653001702603653001102620653002902631653001802660700001502678700001502693773012502708856008502833852000902918655001202927IND60623932620221121223104.0181129e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062393262DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2018.14851612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkmal, Mohammad10aGrowth, radiation use efficiency and grain yield of wheat as influenced by nitrogen, tillage, and crop residue management  ap. 2032-2047.  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is one of the major agronomic measures to mitigate green house gas emission, enhance food security, and improve agriculture sustainability. The study, therefore, aimed to evaluate crop growth (CG) and radiation use efficiency in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) treated soil with residue type (RT), that is, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as legume (LR), maize (Zea mays L.) as cereal (CR) and no residue (NR) treatment applied (5 t ha⁻¹) on dry matter basis. The CR was subsequently incorporated with tillage depths (TD), that is, deep (DT = 35 cm) and shallow (ST = 15 cm) as main plot treatments. The N was applied in two splits starting from 0 to 160 kg ha⁻¹ as sub plot treatments. Experiment was conducted in two CG seasons 2009–11 at Agronomy Research Farm, the University of Agriculture Peshawar, Pakistan. Results showed the highest CG and RUE with LR incorporated than CR and/or NR with DT. Increasing N-rate resulted an increase in CG, RUE and biomass of wheat. Residue of LR or CR deeply incorporate into the soil has resulted healthy traits (i.e., tillers- and spikes number), which resulted higher biomass. Nitrogen applied 120 kg ha⁻¹ resulted in higher CG, RUE and grain yield for treatment LR, followed by CR and the lowest for the NR. Crop of second year showed higher grain yield, which was due to healthy traits including better CG and RUE. The study suggests that CR of LR or CR nature incorporated deep into the soil can optimize crop N-fertilizer demand for optimum production, which protects environment from the excessive use of N application.  aThe authors acknowledged and extend sincere thanks to Higher education Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan for financial assistance of this research.  aPublisher supplied data  cHigher education Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVigna unguiculata 3aZea mays 3aagricultural colleges 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acowpeas 3acrop residue management 3afarms 3afood security 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aradiation use efficiency 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3aspring wheat 3atillage 3aPakistan 0acrop growth rate 0acrop residue 0aN-rate 0aradiation use efficiency 0atillage depth1 aShah, Asad1 aAli, Johar0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 16 p.2032-2047dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.14851613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003300155245010600188500002200294500002200316520105000338592002801388650002001416650001801436650002101454650002701475650001501502650002601517650001201543650002601555650002901581650001301610650002401623650001901647650001901666650001801685650002201703650002201725650001101747650002101758650002201779650002101801650002401822650002101846650002501867650001601892650001401908650001501922650001101937650001501948653001801963653001401981653001501995653001002010653001802020700002402038700005802062773010602120856008902226852000902315655001202324IND60611214220221120204756.0180830s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061121422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-del-Río, Ignacio10aPlant nutraceuticals as antimicrobial agents in food preservation: terpenoids, polyphenols and thiols  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aSynthetic food additives generate a negative perception in consumers. Therefore, food manufacturers search for safer natural alternatives such as those involving phytochemicals and plant essential oils. These bioactive compounds have antimicrobial activities widely proven in in vitro tests. Foodborne diseases cause thousands of deaths and millions of infections every year, mainly due to pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. This review summarises industrially interesting antimicrobial bioactivities as well as their mechanisms of action for three main types of plant nutraceuticals, namely terpenoids (e.g. carnosic acid), polyphenols (e.g. quercetin) and thiols (e.g. allicin), which are important constituents of plant essential oils with a broad range of antimicrobial effects. These phytochemicals are widely distributed in fruits and vegetables and are especially useful in food preservation as microbial growth inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aCampylobacter 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aallicin 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abioactive compounds 3aessential oils 3afood additives 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3afoodborne illness 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3agrowth inhibitors 3ain vitro studies 3amechanism of action 3amicrobial growth 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3aterpenoids 3athiols 3avegetables 0aAntibacterial 0aTerpenoid 0aPolyphenol 0aThiol 0aEssential oil1 aFernández, Javier,1 aLombó, Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6680-67230 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016300166300001600329500001900345520138800364592002801752650001601780650002201796650001101818650001201829650001501841650001001856650001001866650001001876650001401886650001201900651001401912700001901926700002501945700001901970700001701989700001902006700001802025773010502043856004802148852000902196655001202205IND50066414820221119074815.0130515e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006641482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-012-9537-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichter, Anett10aMore than an empty case: a non invasive technique for monitoring the Australian critically endangered golden sun moth, Synemon plana (Lepidoptera: Castniidae)  ap. 529-536.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonitoring programs for butterflies and moths are focused on the adult stage, rarely considering other life stages. Transect-based counts of adults and searches for empty pupal cases have been suggested as standard monitoring protocols for the critically endangered golden sun moth Synemon plana in Australia. To date, surveys and monitoring have focused only on counts of adults. However, undertaking such counts is constrained by the short adult life of the species (1–2 days), and the fact that prevailing weather conditions can seriously influence detectability. We tested whether empty pupal cases of S. plana can be used to supplement the monitoring of adults and whether this technique can be undertaken by citizen scientists. Volunteers from Canberra (Australia) collected 650 pupal cases from 11 grassland areas. The cases were found in native grasslands and in grassland comprised entirely of the exotic Chilean needle grass (Nassella neesiana). Pupal cases of S. plana were found to be durable, with most persisting in the field for greater than 3 weeks after first sighting, and exhibited a male biased sex ratio. This study demonstrates that detection of empty pupal cases provides a potential additional tool to monitor S. plana that is not dependent on the restrictions of prevailing weather conditions and time of day, and can be undertaken by citizen scientists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aNassella neesiana 3aadults 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3amales 3amoths 3apupae 3asex ratio 3aweather 3aAustralia1 aWeinhold, Dana1 aRobertson, Geoffrey,1 aYoung, Matthew1 aEdwards, Ted1 aHnatiuk, Sarah1 aOsborne, Will0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2013 June, v. 17, no. 3 p.529-536dSpringer-Verlagx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-012-9537-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245019400163520131000357592002801667650001701695650001901712650000901731650002201740650001901762650003801781650000901819650002401828650001701852650002301869650004301892650001701935650001101952650000901963650001801972650000901990650002601999650001702025651001002042700002602052700002302078700002002101700002102121700002702142700002002169700002102189773011902210856007702329852000902406655001202415IND60745432920221120112438.0210723e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074543292DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100715292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoila, Rossana 12aA Study of the Occurrence of Aflatoxin M1 in Milk Supply Chain over a Seven-Year Period (2014–2020): Human Exposure Assessment and Risk Characterization in the Population of Central Italy  aAflatoxin food contamination represents a rising global issue that will continue to increase due to climate change. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is of high concern for the whole dairy industry. In light of AFM1′s harmful potential, a human health exposure assessment and risk characterization were performed for all age populations of central Italy with regard to milk and cheese consumption by means of the margin of exposure (MOE). In total, 16,934 cow and ewe’s milk samples were collected from 2014 to 2020 and analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening method, confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). The average concentration of AFM1 in cow’s milk ranged from 0.009 to 0.015 µg/kg, while in ewe’s milk, the average concentration ranged from 0.009 to 0.013 µg/kg. The average amount of AFM1 exposure ranged from 0.00005 to 0.00195 g/kg bw/day, with the main contributor represented by drinking milk, followed by the consumption of soft cheeses. A high level of public health concern related to the youngest consumers has arisen from risk characterizations highlighting the need for constant monitoring of AFM1′s occurrence in milk by inspection authorities, alongside regular updates with regard to exposure assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin M1 3aclimate change 3acows 3adairy consumption 3adairy industry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aewes 3aexposure assessment 3afluorescence 3afood contamination 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amilk 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk characterization 3asupply chain 3aItaly1 aBranciari, Raffaella 1 aVerdini, Emanuela 1 aRanucci, David 1 aValiani, Andrea 1 aPelliccia, Alessandro 1 aFioroni, Laura 1 aPecorelli, Ivan 0 tFoods.g2021 July 02, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100715293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011100163300001600274520067700290592002800967650000900995650001001004650001301014650001901027650001801046650001201064650003301076650002601109700002301135700002001158700002101178700002001199773010501219856007401324852000901398655001201407IND60574923420221121054053.0170728e199901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057492342DNAL7 a10.1007/PL000117442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakanishi, Koichi 10aRequisite Morphologic Interaction for Attachment between Ulva pertusa (Chlorophyta) and Symbiotic Bacteria  ap. 107-111.  aIn order to understand the morphogenesis-inducing mechanism of Ulva pertusa by symbiotic bacteria, we observed the requisite conditions of bacteria for attachment to U. pertusa for algal morphogenesis.

Overall, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model accurately simulated dry matter, grains per spike, grain yield, biomass P, and grain P for two years, for both genotypes in response to all P fertilizer treatments. NARC-2009 had 55% higher PUE compared to Chakwal-50. Information on PUE will be helpful in breeding high PUE cultivars. Modeling results showed that the production of wheat depends on growth as well as on P uptake of the plants. The close agreement between observed and simulated results confirmed the accuracy of the model which was validated with skill scores like R² and RMSE. APSIM simulation proved to be valuable tool to evaluate PUE under rainfed conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abreeding 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3amodels 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aproduction technology 3awheat 3aPakistan 0aAPSIM-SoilP-Wheat 0aphosphorus (P) 0aphosphorus use efficiency 0awheat1 aIjaz, Waqas1 aAhmad, Shakeel0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 16 p.2069-2084dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.14859333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001100145245006900156300001800225520078300243592002801026650001901054650001101073650002601084650001501110700001401125700001601139773010201155856004801257852000901305655001201314IND4483780020221119074729.0120510e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448378002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4965-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo10aWhat geometrical factors determine the in situ solar wind speed?  ap. 1409-1414.  aAt present it remains to address why the fast solar wind is fast and the slow wind is slow. Recently we have shown that the field line curvature may substantially influence the wind speed Î½, thereby offering an explanation for the Arge et al. finding that Î½ depends on more than just the flow tube expansion factor. Here we show by extensive numerical examples that the correlation between Î½ and field line curvature is valid for rather general base boundary conditions and for rather general heating functions. Furthermore, the effect of field line curvature is even more pronounced when the proton-alpha particle speed difference is examined. We suggest that any solar wind model has to take into account the field line shape for any quantitative analysis to be made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3awind speed1 aChen, Yao1 aXia, LiDong0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Apr., v. 57, no. 12 p.1409-1414dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4965-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010300165520102600268592002801294650003501322650003001357650002601387650001301413650001601426650001801442650001701460650001701477650002301494650001501517650000701532650002501539653002201564653001501586653001601601653001701617653000701634700001501641700001501656700001801671700001601689773009401705856008401799852000901883655001201892IND60686191320221119214622.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068619132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1018702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacroux, J.10aMixotrophic growth of microalgae on volatile fatty acids is determined by their undissociated form  aThe influence of pH and substrate concentration on the mixotrophic growth of five microalgae species in presence of acetate or butyrate was evaluated. Acutodesmus obliquus, Auxenochlorella protothecoïdes, two strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Chlorella sorokiniana were cultivated at pH from 5 to 10. Acetate was efficiently assimilated by all strains while butyrate uptake was greatly strain dependent. Growth rates at pH values above 8 were reduced while values below 5 or 6 inhibited growth on acetate and butyrate respectively. The influence of acetic and butyric acid concentration was tested. It was demonstrated that the main factor affecting microalgae growth is the concentration of undissociated acid, which can be controlled by pH adjustment. The strains exhibited inhibition threshold concentrations of 71–207 mg·L⁻¹ for acetic acid and of 13–25 mg·L⁻¹ for butyric acid. These findings are crucial for proper control of processes coupling bacterial fermentation and microalgae cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAuxenochlorella protothecoides 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3aalgae culture 3abutyric acid 3afermentation 3agrowth retardation 3amicroalgae 3apH 3avolatile fatty acids 0aDark fermentation 0aMicroalgae 0aAcetic acid 0aButyric acid 0apH1 aTrably, E.1 aBernet, N.1 aSteyer, J.-P.1 avan Lis, R.0 tAlgal research.g2020 May, v. 47 p.101870-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.1018703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245008700170300001600257520079200273592002801065650001201093650001601105650002501121650001701146650001101163650001401174650001101188653001501199653001701214653003201231653002401263653002501287700001801312700002101330773015201351856007801503852000901581655001201590IND60522749520221122233221.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052274952DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1986-1-2202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Ralf-Michael10aBiosynthesis of 4-Formyl-4-imidazoIine-2-on, the Heterocyclic Base of Nikkomycin X  ap. 135-140.  aThe nucleoside-peptide antibiotic nikkomycin X contains the unusual heterocyclic base 4-formyl-4-imidazoline-2-on. Investigations on the biosynthesis of this base were accomplished in a resting cell system which was optimized in respect to nikkomycin production. Incorporation experiments with [2-¹⁴C]adenine, [8-¹⁴C]adenine, [2-¹⁴C]glycine, [2-¹⁴C]uracil, [U-¹⁴C]histidine, and [2-¹⁴C]histidine revealed that only [2-¹⁴C ]adenine, [U-¹⁴C]-and [2-¹⁴C]histidine were specifically incorporated into nikkomycin X. An incorporation experiment with [2-¹³C]adenine resulted in a 31-fold enrichment of the carbon atom 2 of 4-formyl-4-imidazoline-2-on.

Chemical composition values were as follows: protein content ranged from 22.5 to 25.6%, starch 28.3 to 36.2%, fat 1.3 to 1.9%, insoluble fiber 1.7 to 3.0% and minerals 3.2 to 3.7%. The oil content was relatively low, but an extremely high content of biologically active compounds (tocopherols in the oils range from 3838 to 11,475mg/kg, phospholipids 12.2 to 27.4%) was noted. In oils from seeds of cowpea palmitic (35.1–47.1%) and linoleic acid (21.7–30.9%) dominated, followed by linolenic (7.3–16.8%) and oleic acid (6.9–10.6%). The main component in sterols composition was stigmasterol (42.1–43.3%), followed by β-sitosterol (27.6–39.5%). In the tocopherol fraction of oils from seeds of cowpea the main component γ-tocopherol varied from 44.0 to 66.6%, followed by δ-tocopherol (30.3–52.8%). Phospholipids in oils and seeds of various accessions of cowpea had similar qualitative and quantitative composition.

Crossing of the latter species with the former ones surprisingly resulted in hybrids showing blotchlessness. In contrast, the hybrid derived from the interspecific cross P. sommniferum x P. orientale forms relatively small but distinct basal blotches. The first parent has marked, white flowers and another basic number of the genome (x = 11) than P. orientale and its relatives have (x = 7). Chromatographic analysis confirm ed that pelargonidin and cyanidin are the anthocyanidins of poppy flowers. Basal blotches differ from the other parts of petals since they exclusively contain cyanidin glycosides. If they are absent, pelargonidin glycosides homogeneously colour the petals. It is concluded that in blotchless flowers of P. orientale and its hybrids the gene responsible for the 3′-hydroxylation of C15 molecules is repressed. This situation is obviously restricted to the basal areas of petals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapaver bracteatum 3achemical elements 3achromatography 3acolor 3acorolla 3acyanidin 3agenes 3aglycosides 3ahybrids 3apelargonidin 0aBasal Blotches 0aBlotchlessness 0aCyanidin 0aPelargonidin 0aPapaver species0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 41, no. 1-2 p.158-163dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1986-1-2233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012300174300001600297520104600313592002801359650000801387650001801395650002901413650002501442650002501467650001201492650002601504650001001530650001801540650001401558650001101572650001201583650002101595650002401616650001401640650002001654650001301674650001701687650001401704700002901718700002801747700003301775700003401808700002801842773010001870856008101970852000902051655001202060IND60120465620221122010659.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012046562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-013-0901-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Esparza, Adolfo10aIsolation of Sporothrix schenckii GDA1 and functional characterization of the encoded guanosine diphosphatase activity  ap. 499-506.  aSporothrix schenckii is a fungal pathogen of humans and the etiological agent of sporotrichosis. In fungi, proper protein glycosylation is usually required for normal composition of cell wall and virulence. Upon addition of precursor oligosaccharides to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycans are further modified by Golgi-glycosyl transferases. In order to add sugar residues to precursor glycans, nucleotide diphosphate sugars are imported from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen, the sugar is transferred to glycans, and the resulting nucleoside diphosphate is dephosphorylated by the nucleoside diphosphatase Gda1 before returning to cytosol. Here, we isolated the open reading frame SsGDA1 from a S. schenckii genomic DNA library. In order to confirm the function of SsGda1, we performed complementation assays in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gda1∆ null mutant. Our results indicated that SsGDA1 restored the nucleotide diphosphatase activity to wild-type levels and therefore is a functional ortholog of S. cerevisiae GDA1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA libraries 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSporothrix schenckii 3acell wall components 3acytosol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afungi 3aglycosylation 3aguanosine 3ahumans 3amutants 3aoligosaccharides 3aopen reading frames 3apathogens 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3atransferases 3avirulence1 aÁlvarez-Vargas, Aurelio1 aMora-Montes, Héctor M.1 aHernández-Cervantes, Arturo1 aDel Carmen Cano-Canchola, Ma.1 aFlores-Carreón, Arturo0 tArchives of microbiology.g2013 July, v. 195, no. 7 p.499-506dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-013-0901-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245020900174300001400383500001500397520111500412592002801527650002201555650002101577650002201598650002801620650001001648650001201658650001101670650001701681650001601698650002401714650001001738650002401748650001401772650001801786650001701804650002601821653001701847653001301864653002401877653003401901653002101935653002601956700001701982700001601999700001902015700001902034700001902053700001802072773009002090856009002180852000902270655001202279IND60603463920221120184118.0180716e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060346392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Tae-Eun10aEnhanced BBB permeability of osmotically active poly(mannitol-co-PEI) modified with rabies virus glycoprotein via selective stimulation of caveolar endocytosis for RNAi therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease  ap. 61-71.  a2019-12-06  aRNA interference (RNAi) holds one of the promising tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment by directly arresting the causative genes. For successful RNAi therapeutics for AD, limited access of therapeutic genes to the brain needs to be overcome by developing siRNA delivery system that could cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Here, we report a non-viral vector, rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG)-modified poly(mannitol-co-PEI) gene transporter (PMT), R-PEG-PMT. The RVG ligand directed the PMT/siRNA complexes toward the brain through binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on BBB. In mechanistic study using in vitro BBB model, we observed that osmotically-active PMT enhanced the receptor-mediated transcytosis by stimulating the caveolar endocytosis. The potential of RNAi therapeutics for AD using R-PEG-PMT/siBACE1 complexes was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that R-PEG-PMT is a powerful gene carrier system for brain targeted RNAi therapeutics with synergistic effect of RVG ligand and PMT on well-modulated receptor-mediated transcytosis through BBB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aRNA interference 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aphysiological transport 3abrain 3aligands 3amodels 3atherapeutics 3aendocytosis 3ablood-brain barrier 3agenes 3anicotinic receptors 3asynergism 3aglycoproteins 3apermeability 3asmall interfering RNA 0aRabies virus 0aMannitol 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aCaveolae-mediated endocytosis 0aPolyethylenimine 0aBlood–brain barrier1 aSingh, Bijay1 aLi, Huishan1 aLee, Jun-Yeong1 aKang, Sang-Kee1 aChoi, Yun-Jaie1 aCho, Chong-Su0 tBiomaterials.g2015 Jan., v. 38 p.61-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04057naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014700166520220100313592002802514650001502542650002502557650001202582650001702594650001902611650001802630650002502648650001302673650002602686650001202712650002702724650001702751650002002768650001002788650001802798650001502816650001302831650001302844650001402857650002102871650001502892650002802907650001402935650003302949650003302982650001303015650002103028653001203049653002603061653003103087653002303118653001403141653002803155700001203183700001903195700001803214773009403232856008403326852000903410655001203419IND60686191620221119214401.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068619162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1018772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aB, Jeyakumar10aNitrogen repletion favors cellular metabolism and improves eicosapentaenoic acid production in the marine microalga Isochrysis sp. CASA CC 101  aIsochrysis sp. is a marine microalga and is a potential source of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which possess several health benefits. In general, Isochrysis sp. grow well in nitrate-rich culture medium which influences fatty acid biosynthesis; therefore, this study focused on how nitrate influences cellular metabolism in the marine microalga Isochrysis sp. CASA CC 101. Initially, response surface methodology was performed to optimize the level of major nutrients: nitrate and phosphate. The results showed that Isochrysis sp. when grown with nitrate at a concentration of 593 mg.L⁻¹ produced higher eicosapentaenoic acid (7.3 mg.L¹), whereas Isochrysis sp. when grown with higher concentration of phosphate did not produce higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. The influence of nitrate on cellular metabolism was further confirmed by culturing Isochrysis sp. at higher nitrate conditions. The cellular metabolic activity was analyzed by reactive oxygen species staining assay and the results showed that the cells exhibited reduced oxidative stress with lower green fluorescence under nitrate-repleted conditions. Furthermore, live/dead staining and cell viability assay revealed that live cell population was higher in nitrate-repleted conditions. Nile red and scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the cell size and intracellular lipid droplets of microalgal cells grown under nitrate-repleted cells were low, whereas the cell size and intracellular lipid droplets of the microalgal cells grown under nitrogen-depleted conditions were high. Further, the fatty acid profile of Isochrysis sp. grown under nitrogen-repleted conditions showed an increased eicosapentaenoic acid (22.52 mg.g⁻¹ biomass). The mRNA expression of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic genes such as Δ5-desaturase (Δ5Des) was significantly elevated in nitrate-repleted conditions, whereas the expression of the Δ6-desaturase (Δ6Des) remained unaltered under all the conditions. This is the first study to demonstrate the correlation between nitrate repletion and cellular metabolic activity in terms of eicosapentaenoic acid production in Isochrysis sp.

However, there are doubts about the interaction of Si and SA in the physiology and yield of legume crop. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar application of Si and SA on the photosynthetic variables and yield of soybean and bean grains. The experiments were composed by four treatments: potassium silicate and stabilized sodium at a concentration of 3.6 g L⁻¹ Si in the absence and presence of SA (210 mg L⁻¹), only SA, and without Si or SA. The interaction of Si with foliar SA enhanced photosynthesis only in soybean; it did not affect the physiological variables of bean and did not alter the yield of the two crops. The results indicated that foliar Si application at high concentrations, independently of SA application, increased the physiological variables of the soybean without affecting the yield; however, the combined application of Si and SA had an adverse effect on the physiology and yield of bean.  aPublisher supplied data  cPROCAD 3aadverse effects 3abeans 3acrop yield 3acrops 3afoliar application 3agrains 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium silicates 3asalicylic acid 3asilicon 3asodium 3asoybeans 0aannual crops 0abeneficial element 0aexogenous hormone 0aplant physiology 0ayield1 aDe Mello Prado, Renato1 aGarcia Roque, Cassiano1 aRibeiro Barzotto, Gustavo1 aRoberto Wassolowski, Carlos0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 16 p.2116-2125dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.14971773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009200172300001400264520151200278592002801790650002001818650001601838650001601854650001101870650001701881650000901898650001001907650002301917650001101940650001401951650001001965650001201975700001601987700001702003700002002020773009502040856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60120465720221122010530.0150207e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012046572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12078-013-9141-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnoop, Janine Editha10aCombinatory Effects of Texture and Aroma Modification on Taste Perception of Model Gels  ap. 60-69.  aIn this study, the effects of texture modification and aroma-induced sweetness enhancement were systematically investigated in apple-flavored semi-solid Na-caseinate gels. Gels containing apple juice as a basic flavor were developed differing in stiffness, brittleness and serum release (texture modification), aroma, and sugar concentration (flavor modification). In a full factorial design (2 × 2 × 2), eight samples were evaluated by a sensory panel on ten attributes (five texture, five flavor). Sweetness was enhanced significantly by modification of texture, aroma, and sugar concentration. Texture modification was found to be by far the greatest contributor to overall sweetness. In comparison to texture modifications, aroma modification and changes of sugar concentration resulted only in small sweetness enhancement. When texture and aroma modifications are combined, a small additive effect of aroma modification on sweetness enhancement was found in addition to the sweetness enhancement caused by texture modification. This suggests that the relationship between texture (modification) and flavor (modification) and sweetness is additive in a nonlinear manner. It can be concluded that texture modification is a valid tool to enhance taste intensity. Hence, texture modification can compensate for a loss of sweet taste intensity induced by sugar reduction, while aroma-induced sweetness enhancement can contribute to further taste enhancement in order to develop healthier products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aapple juice 3ablood serum 3acasein 3afood quality 3agels 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3asugars 3asweetness 3ataste 3atexture1 aSala, Guido1 aSmit, Gerrit1 aStieger, Markus0 tChemosensory perception.g2013 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.60-69dSpringer-Verlagx1936-58027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12078-013-9141-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016500172300001600337520080500353592002801158650002801186650001301214650001501227650001001242650001301252650001401265773010601279856008201385990002301467852000901490655001201499IND60085557720221119180703.0141101e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008555772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaumann, Alberto J.10aPhosphodiesterases reduce spontaneous sinoatrial beating but not the ‘fight or flight’ tachycardia elicited by agonists through Gs-protein-coupled receptors  ap. 377-383.  aCyclic AMP (cAMP) steers the generation of basal heart beat in the sinoatrial node. It also induces sinoatrial tachycardia and increased cardiac force, elicited through activation of Gs-protein-coupled receptors (GsPCRs). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyse cAMP. In the heart mainly PDE3 and PDE4 would be expected to limit those functions, and the PDE isoenzymes do indeed reduce basal sinoatrial beating rate and blunt the positive inotropic effects of agonists, mediated by GsPCRs. By contrast, recent evidence shows that GsPCR-mediated sinoatrial tachycardia is not controlled by PDE1–5. A PDE-resistant cAMP pool in sinoatrial cells, generated through activation of GsPCRs, including β₁- and β₂-adrenoceptors, appears to guarantee unrestrained tachycardia during fight or flight stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aagonists 3acyclic AMP 3aheart 3aisozymes 3areceptors0 tTrends in pharmacological sciences.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.377-383dElsevier Ltdx0165-61477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009000159300001800249520062100267592002800888650001600916650002300932650002300955650002900978650001901007650002201026650001401048650003701062650002101099700002501120700002101145700002401166700002501190700002201215700002201237700002101259700002501280700002201305700002201327700002001349773012001369856007501489852000901564655001201573IND60550267520221119142857.0160910e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055026752DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501576e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Sara E.12aA Three-Step Process To Facilitate the Annulation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons  ap. 8324-8330.  aA new efficient three-step process to annulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been developed, providing access to PAHs with saturated rings that under current chemical methods would be difficult to produce in an efficient manner.

In this study overweight or obese men treated for prostate cancer were randomised to a self-help diet and activity intervention with telephone-based dietitian support or a wait-list mini-intervention group. The intervention group had an initial group meeting, a supporting letter from their urological consultant, three telephone dietitian consultations at 4-week intervals, a pedometer and access to web-based diet and physical activity resources. At 12 weeks, men in both groups were given digital scales for providing follow-up weight measurements, and the wait-list group received a mini-intervention of the supporting letter, a pedometer and access to the web-based resources. Sixty-two men were randomised; fifty-four completed baseline and 12-week measurements, and fifty-one and twenty-seven provided measurements at 6 and 12 months, respectively. In a repeated-measures model, mean difference in weight change between groups (wait-list mini-intervention minus intervention) at 12 weeks was −2·13 (95 % CI −3·44, −0·82) kg (P = 0·002). At 12 months the corresponding value was −2·43 (95 % CI −4·50, −0·37) kg (P = 0·022). Mean difference in global quality of life score change between groups at 12 weeks was 12·3 (95 % CI 4·93, 19·7) (P = 0·002); at 12 months there were no significant differences between groups.

This facilitates progress in multiple global efforts to ensure a synergistic contribution of forests and the forest sector to sustainability goals. In recent years, societal demands and expectations associated with forests and the forest sector have changed profoundly. Forests have traditionally been a key resource that contributes to people’s livelihoods; however, this has only been fully embraced among forest professionals within the past 30 years as one of the responsibilities of the sector’s role in society. Forests are the largest repository of carbon stocks and have been assigned a major role in global efforts related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The changing role of the forest sector is resulting in changes in forestry higher education programs and curricula; however, these changes are occurring unevenly in different regions of the world. One major effort to ensure that forestry professionals have the requisite training and skills, and the ability to implement technical management, public administration, and knowledge creation, are post-graduate training and higher education programs for early career forestry professionals. These programs aim to update a professional’s knowledge and skills to adjust to the changing societal demands on forests, and to address deficiencies in professionals’ undergraduate education. This paper reviews and compares five programs that aim to update and improve knowledge and skills among forest professionals, with a special focus on the Asia Pacific region. After reviewing and comparing several programs, the paper reflects on trends and their possible implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aforest industries 3aforestry 3aforests 3agovernment and administration 3ahigher education 3asociety 3aAsia1 aHuang, Kebiao 1 aZhuo, Yufang 1 aKleine, Michael 1 aWang, Guangyu 1 aLiu, Wei 1 aXu, Gongxin 0 tForests.g2021 June 23, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120708243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152024002200171024001900193040001800212100001700230245006700247300001600314520101400330592002801344650002001372650001401392650002501406650001601431650001101447650001301458650001901471650001101490650003501501650000901536650001101545650003601556650001801592700002701610700002301637700002101660773010601681856008201787990002301869852000901892655001201901IND60085557920221119180659.0141101e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008555792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0022doi7 aPMC31286832pmcid7 a216212812pmid7 aPMC31286832pmcid7 a216212812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAng, Yen-Sin10aStem cells and reprogramming: breaking the epigenetic barrier?  ap. 394-401.  aIncreasing evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is key to the maintenance of the stem cell state. Chromatin is the physiological form of eukaryotic genomes and the substrate for epigenetic marking, including DNA methylation, post-translational modifications of histones and the exchange of core histones with histone variants. The chromatin template undergoes significant reorganization during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming (SCR). Intriguingly, remodeling of the epigenome appears to be a crucial barrier that must be surmounted for efficient SCR. This area of research has gained significant attention due to the importance of ESCs in modeling and treating human disease. Here we review the epigenetic mechanisms that are key for maintenance of the ESC state, ESC differentiation and SCR. We focus on murine and human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells, and highlight the pharmacological approaches used to study or manipulate cell fate where relevant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3achromatin 3aembryonic stem cells 3aepigenetics 3agenome 3ahistones 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amice 3amodels 3apost-translational modification 3asomatic cells1 aGaspar-Maia, Alexandre1 aLemischka, Ihor R.1 aBernstein, Emily0 tTrends in pharmacological sciences.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.394-401dElsevier Ltdx0165-61477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009300168520119900261592002801460650002201488650002001510650001401530650001801544650001001562650002901572650001301601650002201614650001901636650002601655650003101681650001901712650001501731650002101746650001801767650001801785650001601803653003301819653002601852653002601878653004701904653002701951653002701978700001802005700002102023700002802044700001702072700001902089773011002108856008302218852000902301655001202310IND60651104120221119093359.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065110412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1003652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajić, Marijan10aNatural plant extracts as active components in chitosan-based films: A comparative study  aChitosan-based films with separately incorporated plant extracts obtained from oak (Quercus robur), hop (Humulus lupulus), and brown algae (Laminaria hyperborea) were evaluated and mutually compared regarding structural, physicochemical, and antibacterial properties.

First, apogossypolone (ApoG2) amphiphilic starch micelles (AASt MCs) were prepared by self-assembly process, and doxorubicin (DOX) hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (DHA NPs) were prepared by DOX absorption with excess HA by electrostatic absorption. MLDC NCs were obtained by adsorption of 8–9 DHA NPs around one AASt MC via electrostatic interaction. UV–visible and fluorescence spectrophotometers were used to measure the entrapment efficiency and loading efficiency of the two drugs. Transmission electron microscope and dynamic light scattering method were used to observe the size distribution and morphology of the particles. The tumor-targeting feature caused by HA-receptor mediation was confirmed by in vitro cell uptake and in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging. MLDC NCs were found to possess a mulberry-like shape with a dynamic size of 83.1 ± 6.6 nm. The final encapsulation efficiencies of ApoG2 and DOX in MLDC NCs were 94 ± 1.7% and 87 ± 5.8% with respect to drug-loading capacities of 13.3 ± 1.2% and 13.1 ± 3.7%, respectively. Almost no ApoG2 release was found within 80 h and less than 30% of DOX was released into the outer phase even after 72 h. In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that MLDC NCs had highly efficient targeting and accumulation at the tumor in vivo and was maintained for 96 h after being injected intravenously in mice. Low LD50 for the two drugs in MLDC NCs was found after acute toxicity test. One-fifth normal dosage of the two drugs in MLDC NCs exhibited significantly higher anti-tumor efficiency in reducing tumor size compared with free drugs combination or single drug-loaded nanoparticles individually, indicating that the mulberry-like dual-drug nanoplatform has a great potential in tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacute toxicity 3aadsorption 3adoxorubicin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3alethal dose 50 3alight scattering 3amice 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aspectrophotometers 3astarch 3atoxicity testing 3atransmission electron microscopes 0aMulberry-like dual-drug complicated nanocarriers 0aCombination therapy 0aApogossypolone 0aDoxorubicin 0aChemotherapy1 aLiu, Hao1 aGao, Wei1 aZhen, Mu,1 aZeng, Yun1 aLiu, Jiajun1 aXu, Liang1 aWu, Daocheng0 tBiomaterials.g2015 Jan., v. 39 p.131-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008100169300001600250500001900266500000900285520153000294592002801824650001701852650001601869650001301885650001301898650001501911650002501926650002801951650000901979650000901988650002001997650001502017700001602032700003402048700002402082773012202106856008302228852000902311655001202320IND60663560920221120040513.0191226e200007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066356092DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2000.924633x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobermann, Achim10aReversal of Rice Yield Decline in a Long-Term Continuous Cropping Experiment  ap. 633-643.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aIn a long-term continuous cropping experiment at Los Baños, Philippines, three rice (Oryza sativa L.) crops were grown each year with the goals of maximum annual grain production and high N use efficiency. Our objective was to identify the factors responsible for the restoration of yields occurring after 1991. From 1968 to 1991, grain yields declined at an annual rate of 1.4 to 2.0%. From 1991 to 1995, dry season (DS) yields in the highest N treatment increased to within 80 to 100% of the simulated yield potential; yields in the unfertilized control did not increase. Increased solar radiation, increased N rate, and improved timing of N applications accounted for the restoration of yields in the DS. Wet season yields increased in fertilized and unfertilized plots due to greater solar radiation, improved timing of N applications, and increased soil N supply due to dry fallow periods in three years. Residual benefits of soil aeration were short-term. Reducing preplant N fertilizer and increasing the number of split applications had a greater effect on increasing yield than the increase in the amount of N applied. Our results provide evidence that N deficiency caused the yield decline before 1991. However, the actual processes that caused a decline in soil N supply or plant N uptake remain to be determined. It is possible to sustain high yields and high N use efficiency if fertilizer regimes are updated regularly to maintain the congruence between crop N demand and the N supply from soil and fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aPhilippines 3aaeration 3aagronomy 3adry season 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3arice 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3awet season1 aDawe, David1 aRoetter, R.

Surprisingly, few studies have focused on flavor perception in relation to these labels. Thus, the present study rated the perceived intensity of flavors in Comté and Emmental cheeses in three groups named “tastiness group,” “healthiness group,” and “control group” (without label). Results showed a significant effect of the label with Comté cheese, i.e., the intensity of perceived flavors was rated higher with a “tastiness” label than with either no label or with a “healthiness” label and higher with no label than with a “healthiness” label. Furthermore, no significant difference in relation to label was observed in the case of Emmental cheese. Additionally, the effect of label on flavor perception appeared to be strongly dependent on age. These findings are discussed in terms of the possible subsequent influence of changed perception on eating behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmmental cheese 3aconsumer attitudes 3aeating habits 3aflavor 3afood labeling 3ahealth information 3ataste1 aBerthaud, L.1 aSghaïr, A.1 aDiep, C.1 aBrand, G.0 tChemosensory perception.g2013 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.53-59dSpringer-Verlagx1936-58027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12078-013-9146-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152024002200171024001900193040001800212100001800230245012000248300001600368520120700384592002801591650003201619650002001651650001701671650001101688650002301699650002401722700002201746773010601768856008201874990002301956852000901979655001201988IND60085558120221119180610.0141101e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008555812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0042doi7 aPMC31286472pmcid7 a214974042pmid7 aPMC31286472pmcid7 a214974042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Thomas10aEscaping the flatlands: new approaches for studying the dynamic assembly and activation of GPCR signaling complexes  ap. 410-419.  aDespite significant recent advances in molecular and structural studies of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), an understanding of transmembrane signal transduction with chemical precision requires new approaches. Simple binary receptor–ligand or receptor–G protein complex models cannot adequately describe the relevant macromolecular signaling machineries. GPCR signalosomes undergo complex dynamic assembly–disassembly reactions to create allosteric signaling conduits whose properties cannot necessarily be predicted from individual elements alone. The combinatorial possibilities inherent in a system with hundreds of potential components suggest that high-content miniaturized experimental platforms and computational approaches will be required. To study allosteric effects involved in signalosome reaction pathways, a bottom-up approach using multicolor single-molecule detection fluorescence experiments in biochemically defined systems and complemented by molecular dynamics models of macromolecular complexes is proposed. In bridging the gap between molecular and systems biology, this synthetic approach suggests a way forward from the flatlands to multi-dimensional data collection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3adata collection 3afluorescence 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3asignal transduction1 aSakmar, Thomas P.0 tTrends in pharmacological sciences.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.410-419dElsevier Ltdx0165-61477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2011.03.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01516naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245017300164300001800337520038900355592002800744650002300772650001400795650002000809650001100829650002200840700002600862700002100888700002200909700002200931700002100953773012000974856007501094852000901169655001201178IND60550267820221119142810.0160910e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055026782DNAL7 a10.1021/jo50160972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttanasi, Orazio A.,10aInterceptive [4 + 1] Annulation of in Situ Generated 1,2-Diaza-1,3-dienes with Diazo Esters: Direct Access to Substituted Mono-, Bi-, and Tricyclic 4,5-Dihydropyrazoles  ap. 8331-8338.  aIn situ derived acyclic and cyclic 1,2-diaza-1,3-dienes (DDs) were engaged in interceptive [4 + 1] annulation strategy with diazo esters (DEs).

To mitigate the tumorigenic risk of hPSC-based cell therapy, a variety of approaches have been examined to ablate the undifferentiated hPSCs based on the unique molecular properties of hPSCs. In the present review, we offer a brief overview of recent attempts at selective elimination of undifferentiated hPSCs to decrease the risk of teratoma formation in hPSC-based cell therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell death 3aclinical trials 3ahumans 3amacular degeneration 3arisk 3astem cells 3atherapeutics1 aCho, Seung-Ju1 aLee, Mi-ok,1 aCha, Hyuk-Jin0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 July, v. 74, no. 14 p.2601-2611dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2486-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011400172520085300286592002801139650002001167650002701187650001401214650001601228650001301244650001501257650001201272650001701284650001401301650001801315650001801333650001401351650001201365650001601377650001301393653004001406653002501446653002401471700002001495700002501515700001901540700006101559700002001620700001901640700002101659700002301680773009201703856008501795852000901880655001201889IND60710918520221120194039.0211227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071091852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChitara, Manoj K.10aImpact of the alkaloid colletotrichumine A on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum capsici in Capsicum annum L  aHerein we report a study examining the effects of colletotrichumine A, an indole-pyrazine alkaloid isolated from the anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum capsici, on chilli plants. A colletotrichumine A-pathogen combination was more toxic to the host than individual inoculations of colletotrichumine A or the pathogen. The colletotrichumine A-pathogen combination led to an increased activity of defense related enzymes viz. PPO and SOD, while levels of the lignification enzymes PAL and PO decreased. Higher levels of phenols including catechin and ferulic acid were also observed with the colletotrichumine A-pathogen combination compared to individual treatment. The likely role of colletotrichumine A during chilli anthracnose infection is supported by histochemical analysis of infected plants that showed increased cell death after infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aColletotrichum capsici 3aalkaloids 3aanthracnose 3acatechin 3acell death 3aenzymes 3aferulic acid 3ainfection 3alignification 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphenols 3arhizosphere 3atoxicity 0aColletotrichum capsici, anthracnose 0aPathogenicity factor 0aColletotrichumine A1 aKeswani, Chetan1 aVarnava, Kyriakos G.1 aBirla, Hareram1 aDilnashin, Hagera1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2684-47251 aSingh, Surya P.1 aSarojini, Viji1 aSperry, Jonathan1 aSingh, Harikesh B.0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 16 p.100247-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245005400161300001600215520079500231592002801026650001701054650001401071650004401085650001101129650002001140653001501160653001701175653001501192653001801207653002101225700002201246700002101268700003101289700002301320700002001343700002001363773015201383856007801535852000901613655001201622IND60522750720221116153639.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052275072DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1986-1-2322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xian-guo10aFurther Studies on the Biosynthesis of Granaticin  ap. 215-221.  aExperiments with cerulenin-inhibited cultures of 5. violaceoruber showed conversion of dihydrogranaticin (II) into granaticin (I), but not vice versa, confirming an earlier conclusion that II is the biosynthetic precursor of I.

Analysis of I biosynthesized from ¹³C²H₃COONa by ¹³C{¹H, ²H} triple resonance NMR spectro­scopy showed the incorporation of one atom of deuterium each at C-2 and C-4.

Relatively higher concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn were found in the stomach samples, while the highest Pb and Zn levels were noted in muscle and intestine samples, respectively. Correlation study exhibited diverse relationships among the metals in various tissues. Generally, the metal concentrations found during the summer were comparatively higher than the winter. Potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks related to the metals in C. carpio were evaluated using the US Environmental Protection Agency approved cancer risk assessment guidelines. The calculated daily and weekly intakes of Pb, Cd, Cr and Co through the fish consumption were significantly higher than the permissible limits. In relation to the non-carcinogenic risks to human, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co and Zn levels were higher than the safe limits; however, carcinogenic risks related to Cr (3.9 × 10⁻³ during summer and 1.1 × 10⁻³ during winter) and Pb (2.6 × 10⁻⁴ during summer and 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ during winter) clearly exceeded the safe limit (1 × 10⁻⁶). Consequently, the consumption of C. carpio from Rawal Lake on regular basis was considered unsafe.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aCyprinus carpio 3aguidelines 3asummer 3arisk 3alakes 3airon 3acadmium 3arisk assessment 3astomach 3acarcinogenicity 3acobalt 3awinter 3amuscles 3achromium 3aliver 3afish consumption 3azinc 3agills 2aAnimals 2aCarpsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumans 2aLakesxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeasons 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aUnited States 3aPakistan 0aPakistan 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aShah, Munir H.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Apr., v. 186, no. 4 p.2025-2037dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3515-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01278naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245008400182300001600266500001900282500000900301520029300310592002800603650002400631650001300655650001900668650001600687700001600703700001600719773012300735856009700858852000900955655001200964IND60663561120221120064323.0191122e196011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066356112DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1960.00021962005200110007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, B.

Curcuminoids (Cur, the principal component of turmeric) have shown neuroprotective qualities, however, their effects on overstimulated brain are unknown. This study aimed to determine the effects of audiovisual OS on cognitive functions in young mice, and to investigate if Cur offered neuroprotection. Ten day old mice were exposed to flashing lights and sound 8 h/day for 5 days/wk along with Cur (1 or 20 mg/kg in feed) for 42 days. Cognitive functions were measured using behaviour tests. Cholinergic function was determined using hippocampal and cortical acetylcholine levels and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1, M3 and M5) gene expression. It was observed that OS did not affect spatial learning and memory, but reduced cued and contextual fear learning (p < 0.001) and impaired short-term memory retrieval (p < 0.05) as compared to control. The OS led to elevated anxiety (p < 0.05), but did not alter acetylcholine levels in the cortex and hippocampus. The OS significantly reduced gene expression in the cortex (M1: p < 0.05 and M3: p < 0.001) and hippocampus (M1: p < 0.001, M3: p < 0.05 and M5: p < 0.001), compared to control. The Cur treatment along with OS not only worsened spatial learning, exploratory activity and social behaviour, but also reduced acetylcholine levels in the cortex and hippocampus, as compared to control and OS groups. It was concluded that OS has a negative impact on behaviour and cholinergic function. Further studies on Cur usage in developing children's brain are needed for its cautious use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aanxiety 3aaudiovisuals 3achildren 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acortex 3afearfulness 3agene expression 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3amice 3amuscarine receptors 3aneuroprotective effect 3asocial behavior 3aturmeric 0aSocial behaviour 0aTurmeric 0aCurcuma longa 0aMuscarinic receptors 0aDeveloping brain 0aDigital media1 aJaved, Sana1 aFarhat, Syeda Mehpara1 aAhmed, Touqeer0 tFood bioscience.g2020 June, v. 35 p.100565-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2020.1005653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245006400184300001600248500000900264500001500273520156200288592002801850650001101878650003701889653001101926700001901937700002001956700001801976773012101994852000902115856009702124655001202221991591421610742620221116184814.0191122e197105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191436942DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300030041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, G.

No beneficial effects of chemical seed treatments were found from a late planting at Experiment, Ga. At Savannah, Ga., in 1969, significantly more seedlings emerged from an early April planting of seed treated with tetrachloroisophthalonitrile (Daconil 2787)³ — sodium p-(dimethylamino) benzenediazosulfonate (Dexon)³ + 1,4-dichloro- 2,5-dimethoxybenzene (chloroneb) and bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) disulfide (thiram) than from the check. for combined 1969-70 data for ‘Everglades 71’, only N- (ethylmercury)-p-toluenesulfonanilide (Ceresan M)² + chloroneb was superior to the check. At Glenn Dale, Md., chemical seed treatment was beneficial in both 1969 plantings and in an early 1970 planting. In these tests Ceresan M + chloroneb was inferior to the other chemical treatments. Equally good results were obtained from thiram, thiram + chloroneb, and Daconil 2787-Dexon + chloroneb. Thiram gave the best results in a 1969 test at College Station, Texas. Seedling emergence from ‘Everglades 41b’ seeds, that had an initial laboratory germinatiou of 83%, was enhanced by chemical treatment. In field tests at Savannah and Glenn Dale, only 65% emergence was obtained for the untreated check compared to an average of 78% for the four chemical treatments. In general, differences among chemical treatments were small and all of them except Ceresan M could be used pending registration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aAdamson, W.

A considerable increase in the gas sensing ability of Fe-doped ZnO (ZnO:Fe) columnar films grown by chemical deposition is achieved via surface decoration with oxidized silver nanoparticles (AgO/Ag NPs) with a diameter of ∼7–10 nm. AgO/Ag-decorated ZnO:Fe (Ag/ZnO:Fe) samples showed an optimal operating temperature of 300 °C with fast recovery of the signal (∼7 s) and ultra-high sensitivity to ethanol vapor versus CH₄ and H₂ gases. The results presented demonstrate the potential for a significant increase in sensitivity to ethanol vapors by surface decoration with AgO/Ag NPs (density of ∼0.8 × 10⁹ cm⁻²) while maintaining extremely high selectivity. Quantum mechanical simulations show that the transition metal oxide clusters modify the surface chemistry of the doped zinc oxide ZnO (101̄0) surface to improve ethanol sensing. Using thermodynamic arguments, we have investigated the substitutional Fe doping of the symmetrically different Zn ions exposed at the surface. The most energetically favorable doped surface was decorated with (AgO)ₘ nanoparticles of different sizes (1 ≤ m ≤ 6) which were sited at different relative positions to the Fe atom. The simulated work function explains the reactivity trends of the surface models, while the scanning tunneling microscopy images are in agreement with experimental data when the (AgO)ₘ cluster is placed over the dopant. The interface formed between the substrate and the nanoparticle is essential to enable the ethanol conversion into ethanal, suggesting that dehydrogenation plays a key role in the alcohol detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adehydrogenation 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3aions 3airon 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avapors 3avolatile organic compounds 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aVahl, Alexander1 aStrobel, Julian1 aSantos-Carballal, David1 aLupan, Oleg1 aCadi-Essadek, Abdelaziz1 ade Leeuw, Nora H.1 aSchütt, Fabian1 aPolonskyi, Oleksandr1 aStrunskus, Thomas1 aBaum, Martina1 aKienle, Lorenz1 aAdelung, Rainer1 aFaupel, Franz0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2018 Nov. 27, v. 6, no. 46 p.23669-23682dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08985j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01761naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002400167245009900191300001600290500000900306500001500315520077300330592002801103650001101131650003701142653001101179700002301190700002001213773012101233852000901354856009601363655001201459991591421750742620221116184735.0191122e197105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191436952DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300030042x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Richard E.10aFactors Affecting the Spectral Properties of Leaves with Special Emphasis on Leaf Water Status  ap. 486-489.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aLeaf structure and water content constitute major factors affecting the interaction of radiant energy with leaves in the wavelength region from 800 to 2,600 mµ.

The EEP (energy expansion planning) is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem which is subjected to reduced I&O (investment and operation) costs as well as to improve the system reliability. As a result, apart from the total costs, the reliability measures of SAIFI (system average interruption frequency index), SAIDI (system average interruption duration index), and AENS (average energy not supplied) have been included in the objective function. Moreover the ability of the system reconfiguration in enhancing the system reliability has also been employed as a failure rate reduction strategy. The proposed EEP problem tries to minimize the objective function with respect to system constraints by means of rewiring, network reconfiguration, installation of new lines and also new electrical/thermal generating units. Such complex large-scale optimization problem mandates the utilization of an effective optimization tool to find the global optimum solution. The well-known TLO (Teaching Learning Optimization) is the core of exploited optimization method, ITLO (Improved TLO), in solving the proposed static EEP problem. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, two modified test systems are used as case studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aplanning 3asystem optimization 3athermal energy 0aEnergy expansion planning 0aReliability 0aReconfiguration 0aImproved teacher learning optimization 0aEEP 0aTLO 0aCHP 0aDFR 0aMOP 0aSAIFI 0aSAIDI 0aAENS1 aSeifi, Ali Reza0 tEnergy.g2015 May 01, v. 84 p.25-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164500002200269520114000291592002801431650002501459650001001484650001901494650002201513650001601535650001501551650002101566650001301587650001001600650001801610650003101628653002301659653002601682653003701708653001501745653002901760700002901789700002401818700002901842700001901871700002201890700006801912773006801980856008102048852000902129655001202138IND60583679320221120183213.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058367932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, David10aContinuous electromembrane extraction coupled with mass spectrometry – Perspectives and challenges  aPre-press version  aThis tutorial discusses continuous electromembrane extraction (c-EME) coupled directly to mass spectrometry (MS), and the applicability of such systems for on-line and real-time monitoring of in-vitro drug metabolism. Parent drug substances and corresponding drug metabolites are extracted from the metabolic reaction mixture, through a supported liquid membrane (SLM), and into an acceptor solution on the other side. Extraction is accomplished using an external electrical field sustained over the SLM. The acceptor solution is continuously pumped into the mass spectrometer, and the decline of parent drug as well as the development of metabolites is followed directly with the mass spectrometer. The purpose of the extraction is to avoid proteins and salts from the reaction mixture from entering the mass spectrometer. This tutorial first discusses the principles and theory of operation. Second, technical development is highlighted with special focus on major challenges associated with c-EME-MS systems. Third, operational parameters and performance are discussed, and finally future perspectives and challenges are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adrugs 3aelectric field 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3aproteins 3asalts 3aspectrometers 3asupported liquid membranes 0aSample preparation 0aContinuous extraction 0aElectromembrane extraction (EME) 0aMicro-chip 0aIn-vitro drug metabolism1 aHidalgo, Cristina Román1 aRamos Payán, Maria1 aPetersen, Nickolaj Jacob1 aJensen, Henrik1 aKutter, Jörg P.,1 aPedersen-Bjergaard, Stig1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1666-80430 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012900202300001800331500002000349520221100369592002802580596003202608650001002640650001702650650001102667650001302678650001702691650002102708651001402729700006502743700002302808700002102831700002202852773013502874856007303009852000903082655001203091IND60742909720221116140108.0210627e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074290972DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.133052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracewell, Sally A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0673-506210aLatitudinal variation in the diversity–disturbance relationship demonstrates the context dependence of disturbance impacts  ap. 1389-1402.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The shape of the diversity–disturbance relationship is context dependent, but the mechanisms driving this context dependence are unclear due to limited standardized empirical assessments across different environmental and ecological settings. At seven sites and over 20° of latitude, spanning both temperate and tropical systems, we measured community response to a fine‐scale experimental disturbance gradient in communities of benthic invertebrates. LOCATION: East coast of Australia (16.48–36.43° S). TIME PERIOD: Sixty‐six weeks (August 2012–November 2013). MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Benthic marine invertebrates. METHODS: Communities were grown on acrylic tiles and subjected to four experimental disturbance events over a 66‐week period. At the end of this period, the effect of increasing disturbance extent (from 0% to 100% community clearance) on measures of alpha and beta diversity were assessed. RESULTS: In the tropics, richness and diversity increased with disturbance because the creation of free space allowed for the colonization of new recruits. In temperate communities, increasing disturbance led to a monotonic loss in species richness and a more hump‐shaped relationship in evenness and diversity. In the tropics, compositional change with increasing disturbance was driven by changes in species identities and abundances as the cover of rare species increased. In temperate regions, however, differences in species abundances were primarily responsible for compositional changes, reflecting the shift to algal dominance in conditions of high disturbance. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The shape of the diversity–disturbance relationship changed over latitude, indicating that the concept of “intermediate” disturbance differs amongst these communities. Faster rates of increases in bare space, loss of species richness and a shift to algal dominance suggest that, in these systems, higher‐latitude communities are more susceptible to negative outcomes of high levels of disturbance than lower‐latitude communities. We discuss how differences in community dynamics, including competition, regional diversity and availability of propagules, help to explain this pattern.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Research Council 3aalgae 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3alatitude 3arare species 3aspecies richness 3aAustralia1 aDafforn, Katherine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8848-377X1 aLavender, James T.1 aClark, Graeme F.1 aJohnston, Emma L.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2021 July, v. 30, no. 7 p.1389-1402dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.133053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01139naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012900168300001400297520033100311592002800642650001600670650001600686650001000702650001200712773009200724856004800816852000900864655001200873IND50063869620221121032415.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006386962DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738130100902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatarinov, A.

Depending on the properties of a sample and its neutron irradiation history, 236U/238U ratios from different sources vary significantly. Therefore, this ratio can be treated as an important fingerprint for radioactive source identification, and in particular, affords a definitive means of discriminating between naturally occurring U and specific types of anthropogenic U. The development of mass spectrometric techniques makes it possible to determine ultra-trace levels of 236U in environmental samples.In this paper, we review the current status of mass spectrometric approaches for determination of 236U in environmental samples. Various sample preparation methods are summarized and compared. The mass spectrometric techniques emphasized herein are thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The strategies or principles used by each technique for the analysis of 236U are described. The performances of these techniques in terms of abundance sensitivity and detection limit are discussed in detail. To date, AMS exhibits the best capability for ultra-trace determinations of 236U. The levels and behaviors of 236U in various environmental media are summarized and discussed as well. Results suggest that 236U has an important, emerging role as a tracer for geochemical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3adetection limit 3ahydrology 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry 3aneutrons 3aoceanography 3aradionuclides 3auranium 0a236U activity 0a236U/238U isotopic ratio 0aMass spectrometry 0aChemical separation 0aGeochemical tracer1 aZheng, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0616-55701 aKetterer, Michael E.1 aHu, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6500-49831 aUchida, Shigeo1 aWang, Xiaolin0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245011500184300001600299520131500315592002801630650004401658650003201702650001601734650001601750650001201766650003701778650000901815650001301824650001101837650001101848650001301859650001101872650000701883650003301890650003301923650002301956650001601979650002001995653001602015653001802031653002502049653003202074653003302106700002602139700002202165700002802187773009102215856009002306852000902396655001202405IND60617645420221118012437.0181214e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061764542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoormohamadi, Hamid Reza10aPotentiality of white-rot fungi in biosorption of nickel and cadmium: Modeling optimization and kinetics study  ap. 124-130.  aThe present study aimed to analyze simultaneous biosorption of Cd+2 and Ni+2 by living Phanerochaete chrysosporium as low-cost and eco-friendly biosorbent following optimization by applying a central composite design. The effect of operating parameters such as solution pH (4.0–8.0), temperature (20–40 °C), contact time (3–15 h), initial Cd+2 and Ni+2 concentrations (15–35, 5–25 mg L−1, respectively) was evaluated by response surface methodology (RSM) for optimizing biosorption process. The Cd+2 and Ni+2 ions at 25 and 16 mg L−1 were accumulated in P. chrysosporium with the efficiency of 96.23% and 89.48%, respectively, at pH of 6 and 36 °C after around 9 h under well mixing. The equilibrium data were fitted well with Langmuir isotherm model with maximum biosorption capacity of 71.43 and 46.50 mg g−1 for Cd+2 and Ni+2, respectively. In addition, the pseudo-second order kinetic model could describe the kinetic data adequately. Further, possible interaction pathway among metals and P. chrysosporium functional groups were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were applied for morphology investigation and semi elemental analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aions 3akinetics 3amixing 3amodels 3amoieties 3anickel 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awhite-rot fungi 0aBiosorption 0aCd+2 and Ni+2 0aIsotherm and kinetic 0aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 0aResponse surface methodology1 aFat'hi, Mohammad Reza1 aGhaedi, Mehrorang1 aGhezelbash, Gholam Reza0 tChemosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 216 p.124-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01648naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245006100153300002000214520074100234592002800975650001401003650001501017650001701032700001801049700001401067700002001081700001801101773014401119856007401263852000901337655001201346IND60623799820221118063634.0181129e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062379982DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09070j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Min10aTwo-dimensional nanosheet-based gas separation membranes  ap. 23169-23196.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) materials of nanosized thickness are emerging building blocks for designing membranes with superior performance (i.e. high gas permeation flux and selectivity), as a result of their unique nanostructures.

Few are known about the temporal and spatial variations in the water quality of the reservoir. Up to now, the water quality has been analyzed only from the point of view of compliance with the limits required by Brazilian environmental legislation. Therefore, the integrated analysis of water quality parameters and water body dynamics may bring important information to support decision-making in reservoir management. An exploratory analysis of the limnological data series provided by the company in charge of the hydroelectric plant was then carried out. Univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were applied to analyze the data period from 2007 to 2017. The results identify four distinct limnological phases representing the transition of the environment. The first phase (2007 to 2009) characterized by the decomposition of the flooded vegetal organic matter and subsequent phases, after 8 years (2010 to 2017), have featured the transition process from the lotic condition to the consolidation of the lentic environment. The spatial analysis of the results demonstrates that tributaries influence the water quality of the reservoir differently, probably due to the different impacts suffered in the sub-basins (e.g., sewage discharges; runoff). Although it is possible to evidence the impact of anthropic activities on water quality, the reservoir still presents characteristics of an environment with low trophic status.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a23547.93.27555.30052018cFundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal 3acerrado 3acompliance 3adecision making 3aenvironmental law 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3aorganic matter 3arunoff 3asewage 3asurface water 3awater analysis 3awater quality 3aBrazil1 ade Almeida, Tati1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6387-82541 aCicerelli, Rejane Ennes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8199-51631 aGomes, Lenora Nunes Ludolf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5165-66030 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.247-247dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09039-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162500002200281520138800303592002801691650002501719650002001744650001701764650002101781650002101802650001901823650001101842650001501853650001501868650000701883650002001890650002401910650001101934650001601945653002101961653003301982653002602015700001702041700001802058700005802076700001502134773006802149856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60583679520221120182614.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058367952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yu-Jia12aA cell surface specific two-photon fluorescent probe for monitoring intercellular transmission of hydrogen sulfide  aPre-press version  aHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a new endogenously generated gasotransmitter and has implicated in many physiologies and pathologies closely related to its intracellular and intercellular signaling transduction. Although many fluorescent probes have been exploited to track and quantify H2S in living systems, none of them could be used for monitoring intercellular transmission of H2S. Herein, we developed a cell surface specific H2S probe, 4-azido-6-sulfo-N-hexadecyl-1,8-naphthalimide, sodium salt (ASNHN-N3), trying to investigate the behaviors of extracellular release of H2S. ASNHN-N3 is week fluorescent and could react with H2S at 37 °C in pH 7.4 buffer solutions to form product ASNHN-NH2 with strong fluorescence (Φ = 0.22). Using ASNHN-N3 as H2S probe, excellent linear correlation versus the concentration of NaHS was obtained ranging from 0 to 10 μM and the detection limit was 0.75 μM. With the lipid anchor and the hydrophilic sulfonic group introduced into the 1,8-naphthalimide (a skeleton of two-photon fluorescent probe), the amphiphilic probe is located at the surface of living cells which can record H2S efflux from the cell diffusing across the plasma membrane in living cells and deep-tissue by using two-photon microscopy. Thus we present a new strategy for further studying the mechanism of signaling molecules in cell communication and signal pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydrophilicity 3alipids 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3asignal transduction 3asodium 3asurfactants 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aTwo-photon fluorescent probe 0aCell surface specific1 aYao, Hui-Wen1 aZhu, Xiao-Yan1 aGuo, Xiao-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3389-36531 aWang, Hong0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013100169520237700300592002802677650001802705650002202723650001602745650001702761650001502778650002002793650002602813650001702839650002102856650002102877650001302898650001602911650001802927650000902945650001502954650001402969650001602983650000902999650001903008650002403027650001003051650001403061651001003075700001503085700001603100700001603116700001603132773013303148856008403281852000903365655001203374IND60763337520221119151312.0220120e20211228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076333752DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120100312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sicheng 10aEffects of the Rapid Construction of a High-Quality Plough Layer Based on Woody Peat in a Newly Reclaimed Cultivated Land Area  aTo implement the balance system of cultivated land in occupation and supplement and to adhere to the principle of “supplement the occupied cultivated land of high quality with the one bearing same quality”, in the thesis, a field experiment was conducted to study the effects of woody peat on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties of the plough layer and its crop yield. Furthermore, the correlation between soil indexes and crop yield under the best fertilization mode through the addition of the natural material of woody peat instead of lengthy cultivation of the plough layer to rapidly construct a high-quality plough layer and solve the practical problem that the natural endowment of newly reclaimed cultivated land is far less than the occupied high-quality cultivated land was explored. The land remediation project of Fuping County, Hebei Province, was taken as the experimental area, and the five most representative and effective datasets were selected and studied. The results demonstrated that the addition of woody peat and rotten straw could reduce soil particle size and bulk density and alleviate soil viscosity and acidification. An increase in soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium and a decrease in the heavy metal content were also observed. The results indicated that the application of woody peat achieved the expected effect of the rapid construction of a high-quality plough layer. The best mode of fertilization was A2, which provided a good reference for the rapid construction of a high-quality plough layer in the future. The analysis of the correlation between soil indexes and crop yield illustrated that the organic matter content, soil available nutrients, and crop yield had a significant positive correlation; the organic matter content and soil available nutrients showed the same tendency, which suggests that soil organic matter content and soil fertility level are closely related and that soil fertility plays a decisive role in crop yield under the same external conditions. Woody peat exerted an eminent influence on the organic matter content and soil available nutrients to determine the change in crop yield, which provides a reliable basis for future research on land improvement projects to increase crop yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3abulk density 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3afield experimentation 3aheavy metals 3aland improvement 3amicrobial carbon 3anitrogen 3aoccupations 3aparticle size 3apeat 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aremediation 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3astraw 3aviscosity 3aChina1 aZhao, Rui 1 aWu, Kening 1 aHuang, Qin 1 aKang, Long 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Dec. 28, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120100313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005000151245011600201500001900317520199500336592002802331650001502359650001102374650001102385650002102396650001502417650001802432650001802450650001102468650002302479650002702502650002302529650001502552651001002567651001802577653000802595653000902603653000802612653000802620653000902628653000802637653000902645653000802654653000802662653000902670653000902679653000902688653000902697653000802706653001002714653000802724653000902732653000802741653001002749653000902759653000902768653000802777653000902785653000702794653002702801653002502828653001102853700005602864700001302920700005302933773010102986856008603087852000903173655001203182IND60683083020221121030741.0200405e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068308302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0582-844310aLarge spatial variations in the distributions of and factors affecting forest water retention capacity in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe estimation of forest water retention based on observation and experimental data can be used to accurately analyze large variations in the spatial distributions of the water retention capacity across China and explore factors affecting these large spatial variations at different scales. Therefore, we reviewed the relevant peer-reviewed literature to extract water retention parameters and their influencing factors throughout China via a meta-analysis approach. Furthermore, an empirical model and path analysis were used to explore the spatial distributions of and significant factors affecting the canopy interception capacity (CIC), litter maximum water-holding capacity (LWHC), soil water storage capacity (SSC) and forest water retention capacity (WRC) at the national and basin scales. The results showed that the spatial distributions of the CIC and LWHC exhibited opposite trends in China. The average CIC values in the Pearl River Basin (PRB), Southeast Rivers Basin (SERB), Southwest Rivers Basin (SWRB) and Yangtze River Basin (YTRB) were two times higher than those in the Songhua River Basin (SHRB), Liao River Basin (LRB) and Northwest Rivers Basin (NWRB). In addition, the SSC values accounted for approximately 60–85% of the WRC values in the different basins, soil types and forest types. The average SSC values in semi-alfisol and ferralsol were 2.5 times higher than those in semi-hydromorphic soil and pedocal. Moreover, the effects of some factors such as location, terrain and canopy structure on the CIC, LWHC, SSC and WRC values were significant in only certain basins, but these effects were not significant throughout China. The indirect effects of some climatic, location and terrain factors on the CIC, LWHC, SSC and WRC values determined the total effects. These results can contribute to a better understanding of the large spatial variations in WRC and provide a scientific basis for the improvement of the forest water retention function across China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFerralsols 3abasins 3acanopy 3aempirical models 3alandscapes 3ameta-analysis 3apath analysis 3arivers 3asoil water storage 3awater holding capacity 3awater interception 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aCIC 0aLWHC 0aSSC 0aWRC 0aSHRB 0aLRB 0aNWRB 0aHRB 0aYRB 0aYTRB 0aHuRB 0aSERB 0aSWRB 0aPRB 0aCTMNF 0aTNF 0aTDBF 0aSNF 0aSTMNF 0aSDBF 0aSEBF 0aTMR 0aSTBF 0aSL 0aForest water retention 0aSpatial distribution 0aFactor1 aShi, Wenjiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6199-97331 aGuo, Bin1 aTao, Fulu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8576-40120 tEcological indicators.g2020 June, v. 113 p.106152-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008800181300001600269520160500285536010601890592002801996596006702024650002602091650002402117650001502141650001602156650001102172650001302183650003802196650002002234650001602254650002302270650001402293650004402307650001302351653002302364653001502387653002002402653001502422653001102437700002002448700002602468700002002494700002002514700002802534773011902562856008502681852000902766655001202775IND60594967420221120211031.0180525e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059496742DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2017.13760342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerasooriya, K.

An experiment was conducted to compare the natural resistance of an indigenous breed of local village chickens to Salmonella gallinarum with two commercial breeds: ISA Brown and ISA White layers under experimental conditions. 2. A total of 72 chickens from each of these breeds were randomly distributed to 4 pens to provide equal numbers of two replicate pens maintained as infected and control (uninfected). All chickens in infected groups were inoculated orally with 1 × 10⁸ CFU (1 ml dose) of a field isolate of S. gallinarum, at the age of 8 and 16 weeks given over 5 consecutive days. Growth performance, clinical signs, gross pathological lesions and antibody responses were measured. 3. A significantly higher mortality was observed in the brown layers compared with the white layers, and clinical signs and mortality were absent in village chickens. However, a large number of birds with gross lesions and high antibody titres were detected in village chickens, indicating that birds had the disease subclinically. Commercial breeds had a significantly higher body weight, feed intake and feed conversion efficiency. 4. There was a significantly lower proportion of positive reactors in village chickens in the whole-blood agglutination test (35%) compared to brown (100%) and white (90%) layers even after the second inoculation. Uninfected birds were negative in all groups. The indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed these observations. 5. These results suggest that the indigenous breed had superior natural resistance to S. gallinarum than the commercial breeds.  aThe authors are grateful to the Department of Animal Production and Health for the financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  a2502-12cDepartment of Animal Production and Health, Sri Lanka 3aSalmonella Gallinarum 3aagglutination tests 3aantibodies 3abody weight 3abreeds 3achickens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3amortality 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avillages 0aNatural resistance 0aSalmonella 0avillage chicken 0agallinarum 0alayers1 aFernando, P.

The structural framework of adenovirus fibre heads is conserved between the different adenovirus genera for which crystal structures have been determined (Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus), but genus-specific differences have also been observed. The only known siadenovirus fibre head structure, that of turkey adenovirus 3 (TAdV-3), revealed a twisted beta-sandwich resembling the reovirus fibre head architecture more than that of other adenovirus fibre heads, plus a unique beta-hairpin embracing a neighbouring monomer. The TAdV-3 fibre head was shown to bind sialyllactose. METHODS: Raptor adenovirus 1 (RAdV-1) fibre head was expressed, crystallized and its structure was solved and refined at 1.5 Å resolution. The structure could be solved by molecular replacement using the TAdV-3 fibre head structure as a search model, despite them sharing a sequence identity of only 19 %. Versions of both the RAdV-1 and TAdV-3 fibre heads with their beta-hairpin arm deleted were prepared and their stabilities were compared with the non-mutated proteins by a thermal unfolding assay. RESULTS: The structure of the RAdV-1 fibre head contains the same twisted ABCJ-GHID beta-sandwich and beta-hairpin arm as the TAdV-3 fibre head. However, while the predicted electro-potential surface charge of the TAdV-3 fibre head is mainly positive, the RAdV-1 fibre head shows positively and negatively charged patches and does not appear to bind sialyllactose. Deletion of the beta-hairpin arm does not affect the structure of the raptor adenovirus 1 fibre head and only affects the stability of the RAdV-1 and TAdV-3 fibre heads slightly. CONCLUSIONS: The high-resolution structure of RAdV-1 fibre head is the second known structure of a siadenovirus fibre head domain. The structure shows that the siadenovirus fibre head structure is conserved, but differences in the predicted surface charge suggest that RAdV-1 uses a different natural receptor for cell attachment than TAdV-3. Deletion of the beta-hairpin arm shows little impact on the structure and stability of the siadenovirus fibre heads.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3aproteins 3aReoviridae 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3aRaptor siadenovirus A 3aAtadenovirus 3aAviadenovirus 3aTurkey siadenovirus A 3aMastadenovirus 0aRaptor adenovirus A 0aTurkey adenovirus A1 aBallmann, Mónika Z.1 aDo, Huyen T.1 aTruong, Hai N.1 aBenkő, Mária1 aHarrach, Balázs1 avan Raaij, Mark J.0 tVirology journal.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.106-106dBioMed Centralx1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0558-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245009900218300001600317500001900333520225700352592002802609650001602637650001602653650001602669650001202685651001702697700002002714773015002734856008202884852000902966655001202975IND60733565920221118032217.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073356592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-020-09718-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemukula, Murendeni Maurel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2021-649612aA Point Process Characterisation of Extreme Temperatures: an Application to South African Data  ap. 163-177.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe point process (PP) modelling approach is considered a more elegant alternative of extreme value analysis. This is because of its capability in modelling both the frequency and intensity rates of the occurrence of extremes. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the PP modelling approach in which stationary and non-stationary models are used in modelling average maximum daily temperature (AMDT) in South Africa. The data constitutes average daily temperature observations that are collected by the South African Weather Services over the period 1 January 2000 to 30 August 2010. This study is interested on the occurrence of extreme high temperature and because of that the data for non-winter season (1 September to 30 April) of each year is used. A penalised regression cubic smoothing spline function is used for non-linear detrending of the data and determining a fixed threshold above which excesses are extracted and used. An extremal mixture model is then fitted to determine a threshold in which a boundary corrected kernel density is fitted to the bulk model and a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) fitted to the tail of the distribution. The data exhibits properties of short-range dependence and strong seasonality, leading to declustering. An interval estimator method is used to decluster data for the purpose of fitting PP models to cluster maxima. The models that are used in this paper are nested and, as a result, likelihood ratio tests are conducted using the deviance statistic. The tests support the fit of the stationary PP model. We further fitted the stationary GPD and used the formal tests which are the Cramér-von Mises test and the Anderson-Darling test to diagnose fit. These tests and the diagnostic plots support fit of the stationary GPD to cluster maxima. Uncertainty of the estimates of GPD parameters is assessed in this paper using bootstrap re-sampling approach. The stationary PP model was used with the reparameterisation approach to determine frequency of the occurrence of extremely hot days, which are found to be 15 times per year. The modelling framework and results of this study are important to power utility companies in scheduling and dispatching electricity to customers during a hot spell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aweather 3aSouth Africa1 aSigauke, Caston0 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.163-177dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870052x1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-020-09718-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520140100288592002801689650002501717650001301742650002501755650001301780650001201793650001601805650003601821650002201857650002301879650001501902650001701917650002601934650001501960650002501975650001302000650001702013653001302030653001702043653002602060653002102086653002802107700002902135700003502164773013202199856005102331852000902382655001202391IND50087475520221120084310.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008747552DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2010.5397082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasibi, Fatemeh10aEffect of exogenous arginine on alleviation of oxidative damage in tomato plant underwater stress  ap. 291-296.  aCompounds which are able to reduce the damaging effects of various stresses such as drought should be of great importance. In this research we have used arginine pretreatment and the effect of this compound on alleviation of oxidative damages under drought stress has been investigated. Our findings showed that arginine pretreatment reduced the lipid peroxidation when water stress was imposed. In drought stressed plants, H₂O₂ increased and the activity of antioxidative enzymes were elevated over the controls, while glutathione reductase (GR) activity decreased. When plants pretreated with arginine, activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase decreased while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase, and GR increased. Drought stress decreased ascorbate and reduced glutathione and increased dehydroascorbate. Opposite results were obtained after arginine pretreatment. When arginine was used as a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), the amelioration of the drought effects which was observed could well be the indication that these effects may be related to NO production. To prove that, we applied arginine + Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (LNAM) and on many parameters, arginine and arginine + LNAM pretreatment had the same effects and it seems that in these situations other pathways of arginine metabolism rather than nitric oxide synthase may be activated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aarginine 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3adrought 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aperoxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 3awater stress 0aarginine 0awater stress 0anitric oxide synthase 0aoxidative stress 0aLycopersicon esculentum1 aYaghoobi, Mohammad Mehdi1 aKalantari, Khosrow Manouchehri0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.291-296dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2010.539708  aDNAL 7aarticle01088naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245005900179300001600238520025300254592002800507650001500535650001500550650000800565650001600573700002300589773010500612856008400717852000900801655001200810IND60706873920221118002228.0200809e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070687392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-González, Belén10aLooping the (R) Loop in DSB Repair via RNA Methylation  ap. 361-362.  aIn this issue of Molecular Cell, Zhang et al.

Drawing on this, our study aims to analyze the environmental landscape quality using ecological indices in the Tietê-Jacaré Hydrographic Basin – SP, Brazil between 2007 and 2017. A set of Environmental Quality Indices was used to analyze the susceptibility of the ecological components to the effects of human activities. The Environmental Quality Index of Vegetation, the Environmental Quality Index of Water Resources and the Environmental Vulnerability Index were used to assess the condition of ecological sustainability of the landscape. It was identified a reduction in the areas with native vegetation with a loss of 2.72%, representing over 32,149 ha, an expansion of agricultural areas of 2.05% (24,507.53 ha) and consequently a reduction of the environmental quality in the landscape. These impacts compromise the ecosystem structure and ecosystem services, per example, through the impacts on soils that support vegetation cover as the major sources of energy for terrestrial life. The observed intensification of anthropogenic activities and the corresponding reduction of natural areas often lead to the loss of biodiversity and the benefits that its ecosystem services provided to people.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3apolitics 3asavannas 3avegetation cover 3aBrazil 0aEnvironmental planning 0aLandscape analysis 0aLandscape indices1 ada Conceição Bispo, Polyanna1 aAlmeida, Dayana1 aImani, Maryam1 aBalzter, Heiko1 aEduardo Moschini, Luiz0 tEcological indicators.g2020 May, v. 112 p.106163-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1061633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009600172300001600268500001900284520130500303592002801608650002101636650001901657650001101676650002101687650001601708650002401724650002001748650001401768650001901782650002001801651001101821700005801832773015001890856008202040852000902122655001202131IND60733566020221118032114.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073356602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-020-09701-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozoudis, Vasileios14aThe Carbon Footprint of Transport Activities of the 401 Military General Hospital of Athens  ap. 155-162.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is a scientifically accepted fact that climate change constitutes a major challenge for the future well-being of the whole humanity. Medical and hospital care facilities generate their own greenhouse emissions. Hospital transportation activities encompass not only the transportation of patients and medical personnel but also the operation of transportation assets associated with the logistical support of hospital operations. The present research focuses on the carbon footprint of the transportation functions and activities of the 401 Military General Hospital of Athens (401 MGHA), in order to serve as a starting point for the development of an action plan for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in the hospital-based healthcare of the Hellenic (Greek) Army. Based on this, a simple and easily operated monitoring scheme of the greenhouse gas emissions of the transport activities and a portfolio of mitigation actions are proposed. The estimation of the carbon footprint of the transport activities, and of the other stationary emission sources of the hospital (energy consumption, waste treatment, etc.) of the 401 MGHA, will be the starting point for the development of an action plan for the estimation and mitigation of GHG emissions in the hospital-based healthcare of Greece.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3ahealth care workers 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3atransportation 3awaste treatment 3aGreece1 aSebos, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4800-68930 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.155-162dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870052x1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-020-09701-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008800170520204600258592002802304650001802332650003602350650002602386650001302412650001202425650002702437650002002464650003102484650001002515650001402525650001802539650001402557650001602571650001802587650000902605650001202614650002202626650001602648650002002664650005202684650002002736650001902756653003602775653002102811653001502832653001702847653002102864700001702885700002002902700002602922700002402948700001702972773012102989856008203110852000903192655001203201IND60690588120221122051900.0210506e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069058812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2020.1108262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThornton, Kimberly10aDietary Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) could alter ovarian function in mice  aNutrition is an important source of exogenous AGEs and thermally processed foods present in western-style diets contain a large amount of these pro-inflammatory AGEs. Additionally, the intake of dietary AGEs could upregulate ovarian gene expression of inflammatory macrophage markers. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diet rich in AGEs on estrous cyclicity and ovarian function in a mouse model. Six-week old C57BL/6 J female mice were randomly subjected to either a diet low in AGEs (L-AGE) or a diet high in AGEs (H-AGE) for a total of 13 weeks. Experiments performed included daily vaginal smears to assess estrous cyclicity, ovarian superovulation with gonadotropins to assess the number of oocytes released, whole ovarian tissue mRNA quantification by RT-PCR to quantify genes involved in folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, and macrophage markers, and ovarian morphology for follicle count. Outcome measures included estrous cyclicity, number of oocytes following superovulation, expression of genes involved in folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, and macrophage infiltration as well as the number of primordial, primary, secondary, antral follicles and corpora lutea. Compared to mice on L-AGE diet, mice on H-AGE spent significantly longer time in the diestrus phase, had similar number of oocytes released following ovarian superovulation, and showed significant alterations in genes involved in steroidogenesis (increase in Star mRNA expression levels) and folliculogenesis (increase in Gdf-9 and Fshr mRNA expression levels). Mouse macrophage marker F4/80 mRNA expression was upregulated in mice on H-AGE diet compared to mice on L-AGE diet. Finally, mice on H-AGE diet had significantly fewer corpora lutea in their ovaries. These results indicate that the ingestion of high amounts of dietary AGEs could disrupt folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis that might lead to abnormal estrous cyclicity. Intake of dietary AGEs could also upregulate ovarian gene expression of inflammatory macrophage markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aanimal disease models 3adiestrus 3afemales 3afollicular development 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglycation 3agonadotropins 3aingestion 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3aperiodicity 3aprocessed foods 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asteroidogenesis 3asuperovulation 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aOvarian function 0aMacrophage 0aInflammation 0aFolliculogenesis1 aMerhi, Zaher1 aJindal, Sangita1 aGoldsammler, Michelle1 aCharron, Maureen J.1 aBuyuk, Erkan0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 June 15, v. 510 p.110826-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1108263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008800168300001600256520137100272592002801643650001501671650001701686650002101703650001201724650001001736650001301746650001501759650003201774650001001806650002101816650002001837650001301857650001801870650001101888650001401899650001801913650001801931650001401949650001001963650001301973653001901986653002702005653001502032653001802047653001702065700002002082700001702102773010602119856008302225852000902308655001202317IND60615085520221117162501.0181004e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061508552DNAL7 a10.1354/vp.08-VP-0265-N-REV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonahan, A. M.10aReview Paper: Host-Pathogen Interactions in the Kidney during Chronic Leptospirosis  ap. 792-799.  aPathogenic species of Leptospira cause leptospirosis, a global zoonotic disease. Leptospira colonize renal tubules of chronically infected maintenance hosts, from where they are shed in urine to the environment and survive in suitable moist conditions. Transmission of disease to new hosts is facilitated by contact with contaminated urine or water sources, because Leptospira can penetrate broken skin or mucosal surfaces of new hosts. Infection of new hosts may be asymptomatic, as with chronically infected maintenance hosts, or may result in an acute disease process in which clinical signs can include fever, jaundice, renal failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Those factors that determine if an animal will suffer an acute or a chronic infection are not fully understood but include host animal species, infecting serovar, and infecting dose. During chronic infection, renal colonization and leptospiruria persist despite cellular and humoral responses by the host. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most common lesion associated with chronic infection, and this may progress to fibrosis and subsequent renal failure.

Roe’s approximate Riemann solver, coupled with the drying-wetting boundary technique, was proposed to evaluate the interface fluxes and track the moving shoreline. In addition, the vegetation-induced drag force was added to the momentum equations as an internal source. Model validation based on two laboratory experiments demonstrated that the model results were in good agreement with the measured results. The model was then applied to evaluate the interactions between vegetation and tidal currents in the Liao River Estuary, China. The simulation results showed that vegetation played a critical role in attenuating flow velocities in vegetated waters. In the Liao River wetland, the reductions in the amplitudes of the peak depth-averaged velocities in Phragmites austral (P. australis) wetlands were significantly higher than those of the Suaeda heteroptera (S. heteroptera) wetlands. Moreover, the flow velocity changes in the wetland waters also impacted the kinetic energy, creating a new flow field structure. The simulation results also indicated that higher vegetation densities resulted in a larger flow velocity attenuation rate in the vegetated areas.  aPublisher supplied data  a51879028cthe National Nature Science Foundation of China  a2019YFC1407704cKey Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong (CN) 3aHeteroptera 3aSuaeda 3aestuaries 3akinetic energy 3amodel validation 3amomentum 3arivers 3ashorelines 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aChina1 aXu, Hui0 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.205-220dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870052x1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-020-09729-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245007300212300001200285506007600297520107200373592002801445506003701473650002101510650001501531650001901546650002201565650001001587650001001597650001501607650002501622650001401647650005201661650002201713651001101735700002401746700002801770700002701798700002001825700001501845700002801860773009001888856008101978852000902059655001202068IND60548985720221207110439.0170816e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054898572DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-016-0569-42doi7 aPMC49209882pmcid7 a273421952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsano, Karen Miyuki10aAlphacoronavirus in urban Molossidae and Phyllostomidae bats, Brazil  ap. 110.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bats have been implicated as the main reservoir of coronavirus (CoV). Thus the role of these hosts on the evolution and spread of CoVs currently deserve the attention of emerging diseases surveillance programs. On the view of the interest on and importance of CoVs in bats the occurrence and molecular characterization of CoV were conducted in bats from Brazil. FINDINGS: Three hundred five enteric contents of 29 bat species were tested using a panCoV nested RT-PCR. Nine specimens were positive and eight was suitable for RdRp gene sequencing. RdRp gene phylogeny showed that all CoVs strains from this study cluster in Alphacoronavirus genus, with one Molossidae and one Phlyllostomidae-CoV specific groups. Phylogenetic analyses of two S gene sequences showed a large diversity within the Alphacoronavirus genus. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a CoV-to-host specificity and draws attention for CoV detection in Cynomops sp, a potential new reservoir. The phylogenetic analyses indicate that diversity of CoV in bats is higher than previously known.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlphacoronavirus 3aMolossidae 3aPhyllostomidae 3aemerging diseases 3agenes 3ahosts 3amonitoring 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aBrazil1 aHora, Aline Santana1 aScheffer, Karin Côrrea1 aFahl, Willian Oliveira1 aIamamoto, Keila1 aMori, Enio1 aBrandão, Paulo Eduardo0 tVirology journal.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.110-110dBioMed Centralx1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0569-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245003500173300001600208520064300224592002800867650000800895650001000903650001300913650001600926650002900942700001700971773010500988856008401093852000901177655001201186IND60706874220221121055058.0200809e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070687422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKornberg, Roger D.10aPrimary Role of the Nucleosome  ap. 371-375.  aWhereas the core nucleosome is thought to serve as a packaging device for the coiling and contraction in length of genomic DNA, we suggest that it serves primarily in the regulation of transcription. A nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription. The association of nucleosomes with most genomic DNA prevents initiation from cryptic promoters. The nucleosome thus serves not only as a general gene repressor, but also as a repressor of all transcription (genic, intragenic, and intergenic). The core nucleosome performs a fundamental regulatory role, apart from the histone “tails,” which modulate gene activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3agenes 3ahistones 3anucleosomes 3atranscription initiation1 aLorch, Yahli0 tMolecular cell.g2020 Aug. 06, v. 79, no. 3 p.371-375dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009500208300001600303500001900319520151900338592002801857650001301885650002101898650002001919650001601939650002201955650001301977650003301990650002402023650001302047650001802060650001702078651001102095700005602106700005702162700002202219700001902241773015002260856008202410852000902492655001202501IND60733566320221118032149.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073356632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-020-09731-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerović, Marija1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2045-001X10aMachine Learning Models for Predicting the Ammonium Concentration in Alluvial Groundwaters  ap. 187-203.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConsidering the great importance of groundwater quality for water supply, in the last decade, significant scientific attention has been devoted to nitrate reduction transformation pathways and nitrogen conservation in groundwaters in the form of ammonium. To evaluate and assess the ability of machine learning models to predict the ammonium concentration, four machine learning models were applied: a three-layer neural network (NN), a deep neural network (DNN), and two variants of support vector regression (SVR) models: with linear and with Gaussian radial basis function kernel. A dataset of 322 samples with 13 predictor variables representing selected parameters responsible for oxidative/reductive nitrogen transformations in shallow alluvial groundwater was acquired from measurements in 55 monitoring wells during a 6-year monitoring period (2011–2016) in Serbia. Applied principal component analysis and cluster analysis gave an insight into conditionality and relations between the selected parameters, distinguishing four main factors, which explained 70.97% of total variance, and classifying examined objects by similarity. Extracted factors correlated the concentration patterns, implying the main nitrogen transformations in examined groundwater. The machine learning models were successfully applied for predicting the ammonium concentration with high determination coefficients (R²) in tests: 0.84 for DNN and 0.64 for NN, while the SVR did not prove to be adequate with the best R² of 0.24.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aSerbia1 aŠenk, Ivana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8296-78851 aTarjan, Laslo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9731-13041 aObradović, Vesna1 aDimkic, Milan,0 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.187-203dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870052x1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-020-09731-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014400165300001200309520122400321592002801545650002401573650002601597650001801623650002501641650002501666653002301691653003401714653003001748653002901778653002401807700001701831773008501848856008401933852000902017655001202026IND60603629420221116194413.0180716e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060362942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.02.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJilani, G.10aThermal performance characteristics of an absorber plate fin having temperature dependent thermal conductivity and overall loss coefficient  ap. 1-8.  aThe prime objective of the present numerical study is to analyze the thermal performance characteristics of an absorber plate fin of a sheet and tube type solar flat plate collector of fixed collector area. Considering temperature dependent thermal conductivity and overall loss coefficient and assuming cubic temperature profile along the tube, pseudo-transient form of two-dimensional, highly nonlinear partial differential equation governing the steady state temperature distribution in the absorber plate fin is solved using Alternating Direction Implicit finite difference scheme. Keeping ambient temperature, fluid inlet temperature and number of tubes fixed, numerical results are presented and discussed for wide range of values of aspect ratio of the absorber plate, fluid outlet temperature, overall loss parameter and solar flux. Finally, it is found that there exists an upper limiting value of solar flux beyond which increase in heat transfer rate is insignificant. Further, it is concluded that fin efficiency remains independent of aspect ratio of absorber plate whereas it increases significantly with decrease in overall loss parameter and decreases slightly with increase in fluid outlet temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adifferential equation 3aheat transfer 3atemperature profiles 3athermal conductivity 0aAbsorber plate fin 0aVariable thermal conductivity 0aCubic temperature profile 0aFinite difference scheme 0aThermal performance1 aThomas, Ciby0 tEnergy.g2015 June 15, v. 86 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.02.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245005300171506002800224520203300252592002802285506003702313650002202350650002102372650001502393650001702408650001902425650002002444650002102464650001602485650001502501650002102516650002602537650002002563650002602583650000802609650002902617650001502646650001802661650002302679650001002702650001002712650002802722650002602750650002502776651001402801653002702815653001402842653002102856653002602877653002002903700001102923700002202934700002002956700002602976773009203002856008003094852000903174655001203183IND60764469820221207140713.0211122e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076446982DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2203072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabisukan, Ummi Hiras10aDiversity of endophytic fungi in Syzygium aqueum  aResource is Open Access  aHabisukan UH, Elfita, Widjajanti H, Setiawan A, Kurniawati AR. 2021. Diversity of endophytic fungi in Syzygium aqueum. Biodiversitas 22: 1129-1137. Exploring endophytic fungi may provide alternative, plant-based ethnomedicines. The discovery of endophytic fungi can produce many plant-derived drugs that give new horizons to the pharmaceutical industry for the availability and production of such medicines on a large scale. Extracts from Syzygium aqueum Alston (jambu air), a fruit-bearing plant native to Indonesia, have long been used in traditional medicine. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify, and investigate, the antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi found in S. aqueum. Results revealed that total16 fungi were isolated . Fungal endophytes were identified through morphological characterization and subsequently compared with key fungal identification books. The ethyl acetate extracts of the isolated endophytic fungi were screened for their antimicrobial activity through paper disc diffusion assay fungi isolated from S. aqueum were identified as: Aspergillus niger (Isolate code R21, R41, T72), Cylindrocarpon sp. (Isolate code R11, R31), Trichoderma aureoviridae (Isolate code T11), Trichoderma harzianum (Isolate code T21), Trichoderma sp. (Isolate code T31), Pestalotia sp. (Isolate code T41and T62), Beltrania sp. (Isolate code T52), Chaetomium sp. (Isolate code L11), Cochliobolus sp. (Isolate code L22), Penicillium sp. (Isolate code L32), Cylindrocladium sp. (Isolate code L42), and an unidentified Ascomycota (T51). The values of Shannon-Weiner and Simpson diversity indexes for the overall fungal community were H?=2.133 and 1-D=0.859 respectively. All isolates showed potential antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus, but the lowest activity against Candida albicans. The results indicate that the bioactive compounds and secondary metabolites of these isolates should be further investigated for pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus niger 3aCandida albicans 3aChaetomium 3aCochliobolus 3aCylindrocarpon 3aCylindrocladium 3aEscherichia coli 3aPenicillium 3aPestalotia 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aSyzygium aqueum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aair 3aantimicrobial properties 3aendophytes 3aethyl acetate 3afungal communities 3afungi 3apaper 3apharmaceutical industry 3asecondary metabolites 3atraditional medicine 3aIndonesia 0aantimicrobial activity 0adiversity 0aendophytic fungi 0afungal identification 0asyzygium aqueum1 aELFITA1 aWIDJAJANTI, HARY 1 aSETIAWAN, ARUM 1 aKURNIAWATI, ALFIA R. 0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Feb., v. 22, no. 3dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2203073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009600172300001600268520145900284592002801743650001601771650002001787650001801807650001601825650003001841650002001871650001501891650003001906650001201936650002001948650001001968650001701978650002101995650001402016650001102030650003302041650004102074650002002115650002102135650001702156653001802173653001502191653001502206653004802221653001702269700001802286700001402304700002902318773011202347856005102459852000902510655001202519IND50087475820221120084347.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008747582DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2010.5419442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Arif Tasleem10aNovel approaches of beneficial Pseudomonas in mitigation of plant diseases – an appraisal  ap. 195-205.  aControl of plant diseases has always remained a challenge as diseases affecting plant health are a major and chronic threat not only to food production, but also to ecosystem stability worldwide. As agricultural production intensified over the past three decades, producers became dependent on agrochemicals as a relatively reliable method of crop protection. However, growing concerns regarding continued use of agrochemicals, posing adverse effects on human health besides posing the threat of environmental deterioration, has driven search for novel environment friendly methods to control plant diseases that in turn can contribute to the goal of sustainability in agriculture. Mitigation of plant diseases by naturally inhabiting antagonistic micro-organisms such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria has gained much importance as biocontrol agents seem to be the best possible measures for saving plants from phytopathogenic organisms without causing any harmful effect to mankind as well as to the environment. Mechanisms of microbial antagonism toward phytopathogenic organisms include competition for nutrients and space, production of siderophores, hydrogen cyanide, antibiotics, and/or production of fungal cell wall-degrading lytic enzymes. The present review is aimed at exploring benefits of natural alternatives for agrochemicals along with the study of their antagonistic mechanisms that makes them a novel substitute to agrochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aadverse effects 3aagrochemicals 3aantibiotics 3abiological control agents 3acontrol methods 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenzymes 3afood production 3afungi 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen cyanide 3anutrients 3apeople 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant pathogens 3aplant protection 3asiderophores 0aagrochemicals 0aantagonism 0abiocontrol 0aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) 0asiderophores1 aAzam, Mudsser1 aAli, Arif1 aHaq, Qazi Mohd.

Infection with HPAI caused significant morbidity and mortality in chickens, while in ducks the infection was asymptomatic. The HPAI viral mRNA load was higher in all investigated tissues of chickens compared with duck tissues. In the lung, brain and spleen of HPAI-infected chickens, a high, but delayed, pro-inflammatory response of IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA was induced, including up-regulation of IFN-β, IFN-γ, TLR3 and MDA-5 mRNA from 1 day post infection (p.i.). Whereas in ducks already at 8 h p.i., a quicker but lower response was found for IL-6, IL-1β and iNOS mRNA followed by a delayed activation of TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5 and IFN-γ mRNA response. Virus-infected areas in the lung of chickens co-localized with KUL-01⁺ (macrophages, dendritic cells), CD4⁺, and CD8α⁺ cells, during the first day after infection. However, only KUL-01⁺ cells co-localized with the virus after 1 day p.i. In ducks, CVI-ChNL-68.1⁺ (macrophage-like cells), CD4⁺ and CD8α⁺ cells and apoptosis co-localized with the virus within 8 h p.i. Apoptosis was detected in the brain and lung of HPAI-infected chickens after 2 days p.i. and apoptotic cells co-localized with virus-infected areas. In conclusion, excessive delayed cytokine inflammatory responses but inadequate cellular immune responses may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, while ducks initiate a fast lower cytokine response followed by the activation of major pattern recognition receptors (TLR7, RIG-I, MDA5) and a persistent cellular response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aavian influenza 3abrain 3acell-mediated immunity 3achickens 3adendritic cells 3aducks 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3areceptors 3aspleen 3aviruses1 aVervelde, L.1 aPost, J.1 aRebel, J.

Appropriate incorporation of this biomarker into environmental monitoring and assessment necessitates evaluation of its critical performance parameters. In this study, we characterize the sensitivity of both vitellogenin gene (vtg) mRNA transcripts in liver and protein (VTG) in plasma over a range of concentrations and exposure durations. Male fathead minnows were exposed to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) in a flow-through system for 2, 4 and 7 days at multiple EE2 concentrations in order to provide information regarding the sensitivity of each of these biomarkers to diagnose exposure to this representative estrogen. Measurements of the expression of the vitellogenin gene and protein both reliably detected exposures to EE2 at concentrations of 5ng/l and higher at all time points. Vtg mRNA and plasma VTG appear to have similar sensitivities, though the lower variability in VTG in control fish may make it more sensitive to small changes in expression compared to vtg. For lower concentrations, sensitivity may be improved by increasing exposure duration. A sample size of ∼12 fish was sufficient in many cases to produce a statistically significant increase in vitellogenin. Larger sample sizes may provide more sensitivity at low concentrations, but detecting exposure to estrogens in the lower range of environmentally relevant concentrations may need larger sample sizes. These data will assist in designing experiments that have sufficient statistical power necessary to determine if fish have been exposed to estrogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aestrogens 3aexposure duration 3agenes 3aliver protein 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aminnows 3avitellogenin 0a17α-Ethynylestradiol (EE2) 0aVitellogenin 0aEstrogens 0aFathead minnow 0aBiomarker1 aBencic, David C.1 aSee, Mary J.1 aBiales, Adam D.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 July, v. 152 p.353-360dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245019100156300002000347520119200367592002801559650001501587650002301602650001301625650001501638650001601653700001501669700001801684700004901702700001201751700001401763700001301777700002301790700001501813700001401828773014401842856007401986852000902060655001202069IND60623800520221120070704.0181129e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062380052DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09356c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Ruihao10aOvercoming the morphological and efficiency limit in all-polymer solar cells by designing conjugated random copolymers containing a naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole)] moiety  ap. 23295-23300.  aThe ternary concept based on two electron donors and one electron acceptor has been deployed to extend the absorption as well as photovoltaic performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve the delicate morphology of ternary blended bulk-heterojunction films through rational molecular design. To overcome these issues, herein, we designed and synthesized a series of narrow bandgap conjugated copolymers by combining two conjugated polymers with various molar ratios of the naphthobis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) unit (namely, NT00–NT100). All-PSCs were constructed by integrating these resultant copolymers with a commercially available electron-accepting copolymer N2200. The resultant all-PSCs based on the ternary copolymers NT40 exhibited an impressively high power conversion efficiency over 8.0%, which was clearly superior to that obtained for devices based on the NT00 : NT100 : N2200 blended films. Further characterization of the morphology of the films revealed that the incorporation of the NT unit improved π–π stacking and a degree of phase separation, which are conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3amoieties 3aseparation 3asolar cells1 aLi, Zhenye1 aZhong, Wenkai1 aLei, Yingc(Author of SSP Plus at 36 months)1 aHu, Qin1 aLiu, Feng1 aLi, Ning1 aRussell, Thomas P.1 aHuang, Fei1 aCao, Yong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2018 Nov. 27, v. 6, no. 46 p.23295-23300dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09356c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013000164300001200294520135300306592002801659650002301687650000801710650001501718650001601733650001101749650002201760650002101782650001101803650001801814650003301832650001801865650001301883650001801896653001701914653002301931653003301954653002501987653003502012653002502047700001902072700001602091700001802107700001902125773008902144856008002233852000902313655001202322IND60583680420221121020007.0171024e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058368042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junjun10aElectrochemical detection of C-reactive protein using Copper nanoparticles and hybridization chain reaction amplifying signal  ap. 1-7.  aIn this study, a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) is described. In design, Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were used for signal tag and hybridization chain reaction (HCR)amplified output signal. The immunosensor fabrication involved three steps: (i) primary antibodies (Ab1) were immobilized on the surface of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs); (ii) the sandwich-type structure formation contained “primary antibodies-antigen-secondary antibodies conjugated with primer (Ab2-S0)”; and (iii) long DNA concatemers intercalating amounts of Cu NPs was linked to the sandwich-type structure via hybridization reaction. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to record the response signal of the immunosensor in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Under optimal conditions, the anodic peak currents of Cu NPs at the peak potential of about 0.08V(VS.SCE) were linear with the logarithm of CRP concentration in the range of 1.0 fg mL−1 to 100 ng mL−1 with a detection limit of 0.33 fg mL−1 (at signal/noise [S/N] = 3). In addition, the practical application of immunosensor was evaluated by analyzing CRP in real human serum samples, the recoveries obtained were within 95.3%–103.8%, indicating the immunosensor possessed potential application ability for practical disease diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acopper 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ahybridization chain reaction 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 0aImmunosensor 0aC-reactive protein 0aHybridization chain reaction 0aCopper nanoparticles 0aDifferential pulse voltammetry 0aSignal amplification1 aZhang, Wenjuan1 aGuo, Jinjin1 aWang, Junchun1 aZhang, Yuzhong0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 539 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245005100207300001600258500001900274520118600293592002801479650002001507650001701527650001101544650001501555650001201570650001601582650001801598650001701616651001001633700005801643773015001701856008201851852000901933655001201942IND60733566720221118032045.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073356672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-020-09742-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Eiff, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3793-589210aDetermining an Optimal Water Mix for Hong Kong  ap. 221-236.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we adapt the decision-making model proposed by Leroux and Martin (2016) to include an additional water resources type to make it suitable for Hong Kong’s current and proposed water supply mix. More precisely, we broaden the model to account for purchased water (from China) which is currently the primary source of water for Hong Kong. In addition, purchased water price uncertainty has been integrated, which differs from the uncertainty on water inflows and quality. Harvested stormwater and manufactured water, although not currently used in Hong Kong, may be sources for the future and are therefore considered in a 4-pronged scenario. The objective is to derive the optimal shares for each water supply. We obtain the optimal water mix and consumption levels for several scenarios, the current scenario, the proposed 4-pronged scenario, a drop in water quality, and self-sufficiency. The 4-pronged scenario advocates for a large-scale development of desalination plants in Hong Kong; however, it is also significantly more expensive and therefore results in a lower optimal water consumption which has implications regarding the current water tariff approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adesalination 3aprices 3astormwater 3atariffs 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aChina1 aPommeret, Aude1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9160-20950 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.221-236dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870052x1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-020-09742-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245009000159520127700249592002801526650001601554650002101570650001401591650001601605700001801621700001701639700002001656700001601676700001701692700001601709700001701725700001701742700001701759700001901776700001801795773012001813856007601933852000902009655001202018IND60762515920221120154614.0220110e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076251592DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120100942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Mingming 10aEffects of Litter Size and Parity on Farrowing Duration of Landrace × Yorkshire Sows  aLitter size has increased and farrowing duration has also prolonged in recent years. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of litter size and parity on farrowing duration (FAR) to estimate the possibility of selecting a short farrowing duration. We recorded 32,200 parturitions of 8420 Landrace × Yorkshire sows, determined farrowing duration, litter size, parity, gestation length. Results showed that total number of born (TNB) and parity obeyed a cubic (p = 0.0004, p = 0.004) relationship while number born alive (NBA) and number born dead (NBD) obeyed a linear (p = 0.0239, p = 0.0035) relationship with FAR. Gestation length obeyed a linear (p = 0.02) relationship with FAR. FAR of sows with stillbirth was longer than that of sows without stillbirth. Stillbirth rate increased rapidly from about 2% to 4%, especially when FAR was over 240 min. FAR gradually prolonged with the parities. FAR of 7th parity sows was longer than that of 1st~6th parity sows (p < 0.05), but different parity sows had little difference in the same FAR interval except for gilts. Results indicated it was possible and necessary to consider FAR into pig breeding without worrying about decreasing of live litter size or negative effect of parity if FAR was shorter than 300 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3afetal death 3agestation period 3alandraces 3alitter size1 aWang, Xiaonv 1 aLi, Xinjian 1 aZhang, Menghao 1 aShi, Lidan 1 aHu, Panyang 1 aZhang, Ben 1 aHan, Xuelei 1 aWang, Kejun 1 aLi, Xiuling 1 aZhou, Lisheng 1 aQiao, Ruimin 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 31, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120100943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002700161245003900188300001400227500000900241520103300250592002801283650001301311650002001324650001901344650000901363650002301372650002101395700001901416773014601435856009601581852000901677655001201686IND60668174420221119175740.0191125e197301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1973.03615995003700010016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, I.q(Isao),10aMobility of Polyphosphates in Soil  ap. 36-41.  aepub  aAmmonium ortho-, pyro-, tripoly-, tetrapoly-, and long-chain polyphosphates and cyclic ammonium tri- and tetrametaphosphates were surface applied to soil columns.

The general features of the distribution patterns usually were established by the first week, after which soluble P moved much more slowly and the amount of immobilized P increased slowly. The total distance of movement and the distribution patterns of water-soluble P were similar for all the phosphates tested, but the polyphosphates differend markedly in the degree of immobilization of P and differed significantly in the positions of maximum retention of P in the soil columns. These positions of maximum retention had no apparent relation to the degree of condensation of the polyphosphates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aorthophosphates 3apolyphosphates 3asoil 3asoluble phosphorus 3awater solubility1 aLehr, James R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1973 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.36-41dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1973.03615995003700010016x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05074naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245021400173300001600387520230100403592002802704650001502732650001802747650001602765650001302781650002602794650002102820650001902841650001402860650001502874650002102889650002302910650002302933650001202956651001102968651002902979651002903008700001803037700002103055700002303076700001603099700001903115700002103134700001803155700001703173700001903190700002303209700002003232700002503252700002203277700002103299700002103320700003003341700002103371700002203392700002203414700002103436700001903457700002203476700001803498700002003516700002203536700001603558700002203574700002003596700001803616700001803634700002503652700002503677700001903702700002603721700001803747700002603765700001803791700002503809700002103834700002103855700001903876700002103895700002003916700001703936773008803953856008604041852000904127655001204136IND60089147720221123030057.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEeftens, Marloes10aSpatial variation of PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, PM₂.₅ absorbance and PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ concentrations between and within 20 European study areas and the relationship with NO₂ – Results of the ESCAPE project  ap. 303-317.  aThe ESCAPE study (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) investigates relationships between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and health using cohort studies across Europe. This paper analyses the spatial variation of PM₂.₅, PM₂.₅ absorbance, PM₁₀ and PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ concentrations between and within 20 study areas across Europe. We measured NO₂, NOₓ, PM₂.₅, PM₂.₅ absorbance and PM₁₀ between October 2008 and April 2011 using standardized methods. PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ was determined as the difference between PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅. In each of the twenty study areas, we selected twenty PM monitoring sites to represent the variability in important air quality predictors, including population density, traffic intensity and altitude. Each site was monitored over three 14-day periods spread over a year, using Harvard impactors. Results for each site were averaged after correcting for temporal variation using data obtained from a reference site, which was operated year-round. Substantial concentration differences were observed between and within study areas. Concentrations for all components were higher in Southern Europe than in Western and Northern Europe, but the pattern differed per component with the highest average PM₂.₅ concentrations found in Turin and the highest PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ in Heraklion. Street/urban background concentration ratios for PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ (mean ratio 1.42) were as large as for PM₂.₅ absorbance (mean ratio 1.38) and higher than those for PM₂.₅ (1.14) and PM₁₀ (1.23), documenting the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Correlations between components varied between areas, but were generally high between NO₂ and PM₂.₅ absorbance (average R² = 0.80). Correlations between PM₂.₅ and PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ were lower (average R² = 0.39). Despite high correlations, concentration ratios between components varied, e.g. the NO₂/PM₂.₅ ratio varied between 0.67 and 3.06. In conclusion, substantial variability was found in spatial patterns of PM₂.₅, PM₂.₅ absorbance, PM₁₀ and PMcₒₐᵣₛₑ. The highly standardized measurement of particle concentrations across Europe will contribute to a consistent assessment of health effects across Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3achronic exposure 3acohort studies 3aemissions 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3apopulation density 3atemporal variation 3atraffic 3aEurope 3aNorthern European region 3aSouthern European region1 aTsai, Ming-Yi1 aAmpe, Christophe1 aAnwander, Bernhard1 aBeelen, Rob1 aBellander, Tom1 aCesaroni, Giulia1 aCirach, Marta1 aCyrys, Josef1 ade Hoogh, Kees1 aDe Nazelle, Audrey1 ade Vocht, Frank1 aDeclercq, Christophe1 aDėdelė, Audrius1 aEriksen, Kirsten1 aGalassi, Claudia1 aGražulevičienė, Regina1 aGrivas, Georgios1 aHeinrich, Joachim1 aHoffmann, Barbara1 aIakovides, Minas1 aIneichen, Alex1 aKatsouyanni, Klea1 aKorek, Michal1 aKramer, Ursula,1 aKuhlbusch, Thomas1 aLanki, Timo1 aMadsen, Christian1 aMeliefste, Kees1 aMölter, Anna1 aMosler, Gioia1 aNieuwenhuijsen, Mark1 aOldenwening, Marieke1 aPennanen, Arto1 aProbst-Hensch, Nicole1 aQuass, Ulrich1 aRaaschou-Nielsen, Ole1 aRanzi, Andrea1 aStephanou, Euripides1 aSugiri, Dorothee1 aUdvardy, Orsolya1 aVaskövi, Éva1 aWeinmayr, Gudrun1 aBrunekreef, B.,1 aHoek, Gerard0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 62 p.303-317dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008800174300001600262520176000278592002802038650003102066650002002097650002802117650001702145650001202162650001902174650001402193650001202207650001302219650002102232650001502253650001602268651001602284773009102300856004802391852000902439655001202448IND50063825420221120075201.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006382542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-012-0605-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheppard, Christine S.10aPotential spread of recently naturalised plants in New Zealand under climate change  ap. 919-931.  aClimate change and biological invasions are major causes of biodiversity loss and may also have synergistic effects, such as range shifts of invaders due to changing climate. Bioclimatic models provide an important tool to assess how the threat of invasive species may change with altered temperature and precipitation regimes. In this study, potential distributions of three recently naturalised plant species in New Zealand are modelled (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Psidium guajava and Schefflera actinophylla), using four different general circulation models (CCCMA-CGCM3, CSIRO-Mk3.0, GFDL-CM2.0 and UKMO-HADCM3) with two emission scenarios (A2 and B1) each. Based on a maximum entropy approach, models were trained on global data using a small set of uncorrelated predictors. The models were projected to the country of interest, using climate models that had been statistically downscaled to New Zealand, in order to obtain high resolution predictions. This study provides evidence of the potential range expansion of these species, with potentially suitable habitat increasing by as much as 169 % (A. cunninghamiana; with up to 115,805 km² of suitable habitat), 133 % (P. guajava; 164,450 km²) and 208 % (S. actinophylla; 31,257 km²) by the end of the century compared to the currently suitable habitat. The results show that while predictions vary depending on the chosen climate scenario, there is remarkable consistency amongst most climate models within the same emission scenario, with overlaps in areas of predicted presence ranging between 81 % and 99.5 % (excluding CSIRO-Mk3.0). By having a better understanding of how climate change will affect distribution of invasive plants, appropriate management measures can be taken.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aPsidium guajava 3aSchefflera actinophylla 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aentropy 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aprediction 3atemperature 3aNew Zealand0 tClimatic change.g2013 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.919-931dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0605-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009900173300001800272520096500290592002801255650002101283650001501304650001601319650001001335650001701345650001601362650002001378650001801398650003101416650001801447650001801465650001401483650002001497700002201517700001901539700002801558700002501586700002301611700002301634700002801657773014601685856008101831852000901912655001201921IND60519357820221120214737.0160427e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051935782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-6029-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Tássia R.

The removal efficiency of the parameters, apparent color, turbidity, and compounds with UV₂₅₄ₙₘ absorption, was evaluated. The magnetic functionalized M. oleifera Lam coagulant could effectively remove 90 % of turbidity, 85 % of apparent color, and 50 % for the compounds with absorption at UV₂₅₄ₙₘ, in surface waters under the influence of an external magnetic field within 30 min.

The ECO 20 unit is sized to deliver a maximum electrical and thermal power of 20 kWe and 40 kWth, respectively. In order to highlight possible inefficiencies along the biomass-to-energy conversion chain, the global energy balance of the system under real working conditions is derived. Ultimate and proximate analyses of the processed biomass are performed, accompanied by temperature and mass flow rate measurements and gas chromatograph characterization of collected samples of the produced syngas. The greatest inefficiency is found in the gasification section with a value of the cold gas efficiency in the range of 57–60%. The low quality of the syngas (lower heating value equal to 3731 kJ/Nm3) affects the engine combustion efficiency, hence its electrical efficiency that does not exceed 22.5%. The global electrical efficiency of the plant is equal to about 13.5%. As a further analysis, waste heat recovery is considered under different conditions by decreasing the temperature of the water flowing in the secondary circuit from 68.35 °C to 20.50 °C for the use of the provided thermal energy. This determines an increase of the thermal efficiency of the engine from 11.3% to 56.2%, while the global thermal efficiency increases from 6.46% to 33.72%. A feature of the ECO 20 system is the cooling of the syngas delivered to the engine by its same cooling water, for a considerable advantage on volumetric efficiency with respect to other analogous systems, also in the cases the thermal power is not utilised.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acold 3acombustion efficiency 3acooling 3aenergy balance 3agas chromatography 3agasification 3aheat recovery 3ainternal combustion engines 3amass flow 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3aworking conditions 0aBiomass 0aGasification 0aMicro combined heat and power 0aImbert downdraft 0aEnergy balance1 aCosta, M.1 aCirillo, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1785-30641 aMassarotti, N.1 aVanoli, L.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 175 p.33-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013300165300001800298520045600316592002800772650001300800650000900813650001900822650001400841650000900855650001700864700002300881700002000904700002200924700001600946700002200962700002100984700002101005700002101026700002001047700002001067700002001087700002001107773011601127856008201243990002301325852000901348655001201357IND60090775320221121012136.0141102e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009077532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Liming10aDiscovery of N-methyl-1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)ethanamine, a novel triple serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor  ap. 1434-1437.  aNovel chiral cyclohexylaryl amines were developed with potent reuptake inhibition against the serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine transporters and activity at 10 and 30mpk PO in the mouse tail suspension test.

In the present study, oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and activities of different antioxidant enzymes and levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants were significantly differed among ecotypes, salinity, and PGPs. Supplementation with ascorbic acid and moringa leaf extract improved antioxidant defense machinery during the acclimation process against salinity, and milk thistle ecotypes represent their background of ecological zones and inherent tendency to face and confronting stress with improving antioxidant levels to a significant extent in varying ways. Ecotypic variations showed that QTA ecotype Followed by FSD, GUJ, and KK had more antioxidant capacity, with minimum reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, the correlation data revealed that MDA and H₂O₂ had a positive correlation with each other and showed a negative correlation with all the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilybum marianum 3aacclimation 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aecotypes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf extracts 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3astress tolerance 3athiourea 0aAntioxidants 0aBiostimulants 0aMedicinal herbs 0aReactive oxygen species 0aSalt stress 0aWeed ecotypes1 aWahid, Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6107-43401 aShaukat, Kanval1 aHafeez, Muhammad Bilal1 aBatool, Aaliya1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 166 p.53-65dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245007800219300001600297520106600313592002801379650001201407650001901419650001701438650002901455650002101484650002701505650001001532650001101542650002901553651001101582653001901593653002301612653002101635653003301656700002101689700001801710773009901728856008501827852000901912655001201921IND60546954820221121083355.0160903e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054695482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobaina-Alves, Margarita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7919-588812aA new frontier approach to model the eco-efficiency in European countries  ap. 562-573.  aThis study aims to evaluate the resource and environment efficiency problem of European countries. We specify a new stochastic frontier model where Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is considered as the desirable output and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions as the undesirable output. Capital, Labor, Fossil fuels and Renewable Energy consumption are regarded as inputs. GDP/GHG ratio is maximized given the values of the other four variables. The study is divided into two distinct periods: 2000–2004 and 2005–2011. This division is related to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, and will allow us to evaluate the difference between the levels of efficiency before and after the establishment of environmental targets. Since stochastic frontier models are typically ill-posed, a new maximum entropy approach to assess technical efficiency, which combines information from the data envelopment analysis and the structure of composed error from the stochastic frontier approach without requiring distributional assumptions, is presented in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aeco-efficiency 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agross domestic product 3alabor 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3aEurope 0aEco-efficiency 0aEuropean countries 0aRenewable energy 0aStochastic frontier approach1 aMoutinho, Victor1 aMacedo, Pedro0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 103 p.562-573dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001800312520141900330592002801749650001301777650001401790650001901804650001201823650002401835650001501859650002901874650001301903650002501916650001601941650003501957650001801992650001802010650001702028650001502045700001402060700001402074700001502088700001902103773014602122856008102268852000902349655001202358IND60519357920221120215124.0160427e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051935792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-6025-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Honglin10aInfluences of artificial root exudate components on the behaviors of BDE-28 and BDE-47 in soils: desorption, availability, and biodegradation  ap. 7702-7711.  aBehaviors of BDE-28 and BDE-47 in two distinct soils (Phaeozem and Acrisol) as affected by the separate addition of root exudate components (i.e., oxalic acid, glycine, and fructose) were investigated by a soil microcosm incubation experiment. The results showed that root exudate components promoted the desorption of BDE-28 (57.6–235.0 %) and BDE-47 (56.9–223.7 %) from the soils due to the enhancement of their water solubilities. The addition of root exudate components increased the n-butanol extractability of BDE-28 and BDE-47 by 20.3–72.5 and 48.6–169.2 %, respectively, which had a positive correlation with the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soils (p < 0.01), suggesting that the increase of DOC in the soils by root exudate components was the major factor to enhance the extractability. Fructose and oxalic acid promoted the desorption and increased the availability of BDE-28 and BDE-47 in the soils more efficiently than glycine. The addition of different root exudate components resulted in distinct shifts in soil microbial community structure (p < 0.05). Oxalic acid caused the greatest impacts on the soil bacterial communities and increased the degradation rates of BDE-28 and BDE-47 most obviously. The findings of this study clarified the roles of root exudate components in affecting the behaviors of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrisols 3aPhaeozems 3abiodegradation 3abutanol 3acommunity structure 3adesorption 3adissolved organic carbon 3afructose 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aoxalic acid 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aroot exudates 3asoil bacteria 3asoil ecology 3asolubility1 aWang, Sen1 aLv, Jitao1 aXu, Xuehui1 aZhang, Shuzhen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 8 p.7702-7711dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-6025-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245007000201300001800271520089300289592002801182650001701210650001401227650001901241650002601260650001401286650001301300650002101313650001801334650001401352700001501366773016401381856008101545852000901626655001201635IND60655883520221122224000.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065588352DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-2040-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünay, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0760-554X10aEnvironmental radiation dose rate arising from patients of PET/CT  ap. 5177-5184.  aOne of the most widely used methods for the screening of cancer patients today is PET/CT. The most widely used radiopharmaceutical in PET/CT imaging is fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (18F-FDG). PET/CT imaging is performed 40–60 min after intravenous injection of F18-FDG to the patient. After the FDG injection, the patients transmit radiation to the environment. The emitted radiation dose rate varies according to the activity of the radioactive substance given to the patient. In this study, the dose rate of radiation emitted from FDG-injected patients was determined both by distance and by time. The results obtained are compared with similar studies. In terms of radiation safety, the required distance between the patient and the radiation worker is calculated. This calculated distance varies according to the time of injection, since fluorine-18 radioisotope has 110-min half-life.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeoxyglucose 3ahalf life 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aradiation safety 3aradionuclides 3ascreening1 aAbamor, E.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 Sept., v. 16, no. 9 p.5177-5184dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-2040-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520209500300592002802395650002102423650001702444650001702461650001002478650002202488650001402510650001402524650002502538650002202563650001702585651001102602700001502613700001502628700001602643700001702659700001702676700001402693700001702707700001402724700001802738700001702756773011602773856008102889852000902970655001202979IND60340666420221123010243.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034066642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-014-0173-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacchetta, L.12aA multidisciplinary approach to enhance the conservation and use of hazelnut Corylus avellana L. genetic resources  ap. 649-663.  aDuring recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the importance of adopting a holistic view of biodiversity, including agricultural biodiversity, conservation for sustainable utilization and development. These principles have been underlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the European efficiency resources towards 2050. Thus critical issues are now to understand the distribution and extent of genetic diversity available to breeders and stakeholders, the kind and range of characterization, how to face the problem of continuous expanding of germplasm to be conserved. Focusing on the case study of hazelnut which is a crop of great importance for European countries, the paper describes a resourceful strategy for re-organizing and sharing hazelnut genetic resources through an upgrading of knowledge on their value and uses. The paper summarizes the progresses so far and provides a ‘launching pad’ for future researches. The brief review discusses also the recent progresses in recovery, characterization conservation and uses of European hazelnut germplasm achieved by 068 AGRI GEN RES SAFENUT which was one of the 17 Action financed by the European Commission—Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development. The current status on the morphological and molecular characterization of the in situ and ex situ of the most important European collections, the rescue and preservation of new accessions recovered on farm were discussed underling critical aspects. A better understanding of hazelnut genetic diversity and its distribution is essential for its conservation and use as well as the harmonization of the morphological and biochemical descriptors. The importance of traditional knowledge is also considered as integrated part of the multidisciplinary approach useful to rationalize genetic resources maintained in the collections. Thus improving the characterization on cultivated and wild forms through the development of a core collection, is the further step to achieve a more effective management and use of European nuts germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus avellana 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3ahazelnuts 3aindigenous knowledge 3arural development 3astakeholders 3aEurope1 aRovira, M.1 aTronci, C.1 aAramini, M.1 aDrogoudi, P.1 aSilva, A.

Soil P deficiency is one of the major limiting factors for sustainable crop production worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that silicon (Si), as a beneficial element, promotes plant nutrition, growth, development, and responses to low P (LP) stress; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Si-mediated LP tolerance remain largely unclear. Here, we found that LP + Si treatment increased the net photosynthetic rate and shoot fresh weight by 34.3%, and 121.3%, respectively compared with LP alone. RNA-sequencing and metabolomic analyses were subsequently performed with tomato plants grown under control and P depleted conditions with or without Si amendment. RNA-sequencing showed that Si supply alters not only the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and P but also phosphorylation processes and metabolism of glutathione and reactive active oxygen in tomato roots. Si also affected the expression of genes encoding major transcription factors such as WRKY and MYB under LP stress. Moreover, a set of genes encoding the enzymes or regulators of organic acid (OA) metabolism or secretion were differentially expressed in Si-treated P deficient roots compared with those in LP stress alone. Furthermore, the metabolomic analysis showed that the levels of several OAs were significantly elevated in Si-treated P deficient roots. Taken together, these results indicate that exogenous Si increases the secretion of OAs by modulating C/N metabolism in LP-treated tomato roots and thereby improving plant growth under LP stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aglutathione 3agrowth and development 3ametabolomics 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorylation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3asilicon 3asoil 3asustainable agriculture 3atomatoes 3atranscriptomics 0aTomato 0aSilicon 0aLow phosphorus 0aMetabolomics 0aOrganic acid 0aTranscription factors1 aChen, Haoting1 aLiang, Ying1 aLu, Tao1 aLiu, Zhiqian1 aJin, Xiu1 aHou, Leiping1 aXu, Jin1 aZhao, Hailiang1 aShi, Yu1 aAhammed, Golam Jalal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9621-84310 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 166 p.78-87dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009900171300001600270520118900286592002801475650002201503650002501525650001101550650002001561650001001581650001601591650001801607650002001625650001201645650002101657650002101678650001601699650002001715650002501735650001501760650001701775700002101792700002301813773011601836856008101952852000902033655001202042IND60340666520221123005901.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034066652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0249-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenna, Massimiliano10aCrenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forskal): prospects as a food product for human nutrition  ap. 795-802.  aCrenate broomrape is a parasitic plant, which can cause serious damage to the production of legume crops in much of the Mediterranean basin. However, some authors have reported its use as a food or in folk medicine, but the only information available on crenate broomrape potential as a valuable resource for human nutrition and not just as a pest is scarce and fragmented. This note contains some biological, historical, ethnobotanical and gastronomical knowledge, as well as describing the nutritional traits of Orobanche crenata, with the aim of evaluating whether this species has potential as a fresh or processed food product. Current knowledge suggests that crenate broomrape could be a refined food with interesting nutritional traits (i.e. high fibre content, good antioxidant capacity and presence of polyphenols such as verbascoside). Nevertheless, some aspects of O. crenata need to be better understood, such as its detailed nutritional composition or post-harvest strategies for preserving its quality and boosting consumer demand. Therefore, further research should be carried out in order to characterize this vegetable resource with a view to commercial exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanche crenata 3aantioxidant activity 3abasins 3aconsumer demand 3acrops 3aethnobotany 3afiber content 3ahuman nutrition 3alegumes 3anutrient content 3aparasitic plants 3apolyphenols 3aprocessed foods 3atraditional medicine 3avegetables 3averbascoside1 aSerio, Francesco1 aSantamaria, Pietro0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2015 June, v. 62, no. 5 p.795-802dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0249-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004400148245003900192300001600231520074000247592002800987650002101015650001601036650001401052650000901066650001301075650000901088650001101097650001401108650001701122650001401139650004401153700001601197700001801213773010501231856008201336852000901418655001201427IND60615481920221118023205.0181010e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061548192DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985869006006052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, L.

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible association of equine herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-4, EHV-5) with other causes of abortion, neonatal mortality or placental disorder. Sixty-seven abortions, 22 stillbirths, 14 cases of neonatal foal mortality and 3 cases of placental disease were investigated for infectious and non-infectious causes. Type-specific nested PCR assays and virus isolation were performed to detect EHV infections. A cause of fetal loss or placental disease was reached in 68 out 116 (58.7 %) cases. Twenty-seven cases were positive for EHV, and 22/27 (81.5 %) were positive for EHV-1 (16 neuropathogenic and 6 non-neuropathogenic strains), 4 (14.8 %) for EHV-2 and 3 (11.1 %) for EHV-5. The association between EHV infections and other etiological agents was statistically significant (two sided P = 0.002). The odds ratio of EHV DNA associated with other diagnoses, especially with bacterial infection and premature placental separation, was 10.88 (95 % confidence interval: 2.15-55.16). EHV-1 was the main viral cause of pregnancy loss in this study, also associated with other etiological agents, including EHV-2 and EHV-5. The latter viruses in particular need to be more fully investigated to elucidate what role either or both may play as co-infecting agents with other established infectious causes of reproductive disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoals 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aetiological agents 3aDNA 3afetal death 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aodds ratio 3aconfidence interval 3aviruses 3aneonatal mortality 2aAbortion, Veterinaryxetiologyxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aBacterial Infectionsxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHerpesviridaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHorse Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aHorses 2aPlacenta Diseasesxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPregnancy 0aEquid herpesvirus 11 aBietta, Annalisa1 aLepri, Elvio1 aCasagrande Proietti, Patrizia1 aCordioli, Paolo1 aCanelli, Elena1 aStefanetti, Valentina1 aColetti, Mauro1 aTimoney, Peter J.1 aPassamonti, Fabrizio0 tVeterinary research communications.g2013 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.311-317dSpringer-Verlagx0165-73807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-013-9578-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008400172300001800256500000900274520150800283592002801791650001201819650000901831650001601840650001301856650001601869650001701885650001901902650001901921650002101940650001801961650001801979650002501997650001602022700003702038700003402075700002402109700002402133773016002157856008202317852000902399655001202408IND60668175020221119175735.0191125e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066817502DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2013.06.02112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeão, Tairone Paiva10aOn Critical Coagulation Concentration Theory and Grain Size Analysis of Oxisols  ap. 1955-1964.  aepub  aStandard methods for soil grain size analysis are based on the sedimentation velocity of particles, described by Stokes’ law. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) is a concept in wastewater treatment and clay science that states that for a given colloid in suspension there is a concentration of electrolytes at and above which the suspension will begin to undergo rapid coagulation. Despite the fact that dispersions used in soil grain size analysis are for the most part colloidal suspensions, coagulation theory has been overlooked. The objective of this research was to investigate the CCC of two Oxisols and its potential implications in grain size analysis. Soil samples with and without organic matter were dispersed in solution at 0.05% concentration and left to settle in sedimentation cylinders. Solution samples were collected after 3 and 24 h. The NaOH at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 200, and 400 mmol L–¹ was used for evaluating soil dispersion or coagulation behavior. The amount of particles in suspension was evaluated by transmittance at the wavelength of 420 nm. This study shows that the amount of particles in suspension is not a function of time alone, as proposed by Stokes’ law, but also of the ionic strength of the solution, which can control fast or slow coagulation, presence of organic matter and type and mineralogical constitution of the soil. Standard grain size analysis need to be adapted based on the effects of the ionic strength on coagulation rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aclay 3acoagulation 3acolloids 3adispersions 3aelectrolytes 3aionic strength 3aorganic matter 3asodium hydroxide 3asoil sampling 3atransmittance 3awastewater treatment 3awavelengths1 aBarros Guimarães, Thalita Luzia1 ade Figueiredo, Cícero Célio1 aGalba Busato, Jader1 aSato Breyer, Harumi0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2013 Nov., v. 77, no. 6 p.1955-1964dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.06.02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245013200171520151100303592002801814650001301842650002201855650001601877650002301893650001901916650000901935650002501944650001401969650001001983650001501993650001602008650002602024650001602050650000902066650001402075651001002089653001502099653001702114653002502131653002202156653002202178700002502200700001502225773010402240856008902344852000902433655001202442IND60740215520221118025554.0210727e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074021552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajesh, K.M.10aEleocharis dulcis (Burm.f) as a promising trap plant for the biocontrol of rice white stem borer, Scirpophaga innotata (Walker)  aThe rice white stem borer, Scirpophaga innotata Walker (Family: Crambidae) is a major lepidopteran pest of rice from seedling to ear setting stage. Due to their hidden life style, no satisfactory means of control other than systemic pesticide application, habitat management, and egg parasitism have been prescribed yet. It is observed that S. innotata use a plant, the Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis (Burm. F.)) (Family: Cyperaceae) for oviposition. We investigated why and how S. innotata is benefited by using E. dulcis for oviposition to prescribe it as a trap plant for managing the pest. We surveyed moths and egg clutches, and studied functional traits of eggs, egg hatching, and egg parasitism in eggs deposited on rice and the chestnut for three years in Kaipad rice fields of peninsular India. We observed 20 times more egg clutches on the chestnut than on rice. The egg density in clutches and hatching rate were high in eggs deposited on the chestnut. Egg parasitism was meager and restricted only to the eggs deposited on rice. However, no larvae hatched on the chestnut in the lab survived. The results suggest that E. dulcis could be a dead-end trap plant for biological control of S. innotata. We do not rule out the probability of the moth using E. dulcis for oviposition, escaping from egg parasitoids, and most importantly for rapid spread of neonates to rice. We recommend using E. dulcis as a trap plant to trap the eggs and removing them to manage this pest in rice fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3aEleocharis dulcis 3aScirpophaga 3abiological control 3aboring insects 3aeggs 3ahabitat conservation 3alifestyle 3amoths 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apesticide application 3aprobability 3arice 3aseedlings 3aIndia 0aTrap plant 0aOryza sativa 0aScirpophaga innotata 0aEleocharis dulcis 0aKaipad rice field1 aSinu, Palatty Allesh1 aNasser, M.0 tBiological control.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.104676-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013900173520154400312592002801856650002301884650001101907650001401918650002301932650002101955650001401976650001401990650002202004650000902026650001302035650001302048650001402061650000702075650001502082650001302097650002102110650001602131653002402147653002002171653002602191653002402217653002602241700001502267700001502282700001602297700001602313700001902329773009102348856009002439852000902529655001202538IND60671673020221122215612.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067167302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Qianqian10aFabrication of iron-dipicolinamide catalyst with Fe–N bonds for enhancing non-radical reactive species under alkaline Fenton process  aIron dipicolinamide (Fedpa), as an efficient Fenton-like catalyst, was fabricated to excite hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) for the removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). The unique structures and the electronic properties of Fedpa were contributed to its excellent catalytic performance in alkaline Fenton process. Fe was chelated with dpa by four Fe–N bonds leaved two labile sites, which reduced the oxidation potential of dpa[Feᴵᴵᴵ/Feᴵᴵ], dpa[Feⱽ/Feᴵᴵᴵ] or dpa[Feᴵⱽ/Feᴵᴵ] to 0.316 V and 1.189 V respectively, and made it easily be bound with H₂O₂ to initiate the reaction. The results showed that 99.5% removal rate of 2,4-DCP (0.58 mM) was achieved by using 0.027 g/L Fedpa and 5.8 mM H₂O₂ in 60 min at pH 9.9. The coordination between Fe and dpa enhanced the catalytic efficiency of Feᴵᴵ. The active species generated in Fedpa/H₂O₂ system contained the iron-oxo species (dpaFeⱽ = O or dpaᴵⱽ = O), O₂⁻ and HO. The iron-oxo species was the main non-radical reactive species for the degradation of 2,4-DCP and some degradation intermediates were detected by GC-QTOF. Furthermore, the influence of factors, such as Fedpa loading, solution pH, temperature and anions (F⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻ and PO₄³⁻) on the catalytic performance of Fedpa were also discussed. This process of complexation between Fe and dpa combined with a green oxidant H₂O₂ presents a new insight for the use of Fenton-like system in the degradation of refractory organics.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aanions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3afluorides 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3anitrates 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3asulfates 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 0aIron dipicolinamide 0aH2O2 activation 0aCatalytic performance 0aNon-radical species 0aDegradation mechanism1 aChen, Qian1 aKang, Jing1 aShen, Jimin1 aGuo, Fang.,1 aChen, Zhonglin0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.125005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011600165520131300281592002801594650001901622650001201641650001801653650001501671650001201686651001201698651001101710700002301721700002101744700002201765700001901787773011901806856007801925852000902003655001202012IND60762516620221122004730.0220110e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076251662DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110100102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatkovski, Bojan 10aExport Competitiveness of Agri-Food Sector during the EU Integration Process: Evidence from the Western Balkans  aTrade agreements with the European Union (EU) and Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) significantly influenced the liberalisation of agri-food products in Western Balkan (WB) countries. In all Western Balkan countries, there has been an intensification of the trade of agri-food products and a partial change in the regional and commodity structures of trade. This paper aims to identify comparative advantages of agri-food sectors and consider its tendencies during the EU integration process. Additionally, this paper will discuss some opportunities for improvement of the export positions of agri-food products. In that context and based on the literature review, the indexes of revealed comparative advantages and its modified version will be used as a main method for analysis in this research. Results showed that all Western Balkan countries, except Albania, have comparative advantages in exporting agri-food products. It is evident that Serbia has the highest level of comparative advantages in this sector. Moreover, this paper suggests that all countries should aim to provide the best possible positions for their agri-food products during pre-accession negotiations for EU membership and take the necessary steps towards increasing the level of competitiveness in the common EU market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aexports 3afood industry 3afree trade 3amarkets 3aAlbania 3aSerbia1 aZekić, Stanislav 1 aĐokić, Danilo 1 aJurjević, Žana 1 aĐurić, Ivan 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110100103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008200201300001600283520108300299592002801382650002301410650002201433650002201455650001901477650001401496650001101510653005901521653002501580653001901605653002001624653002601644700001601670700001601686700001501702773013901717856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60604390820221119063715.0180717e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060439082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrati, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9974-731X14aThe use of laser pyrolysis–GC–MS for the analysis of paint cross sections  ap. 327-334.  aThe ability to analyse layers within a paint sample is important both for historical studies as well as determining the most suitable method for restoration. The difficulty in physically separating these very thin layers makes detailed analysis difficult, and a combination of destructive and non-destructive techniques are needed. Laser pyrolysis/gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (LaPy/GC–MS) is a technique that has proved successful in the analysis of geological samples which pose the same difficulties for analysis, but it has not yet been tried on paint cross sections. This study presents preliminary results of applying LaPy/GC–MS on standard mock-ups for identification of organic compounds used as varnishes, binders and colourants.The technique was shown to be particularly effective for the identification and localisation of natural resins and synthetic colourants. Moreover, the integration between this technique and other stratigraphical analyses may allow the complete characterisation of the composition of organic substances in paint cross-sections.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic compounds 3aorganic matter 3apyrolysis 3aresins 0aLaser pyrolysis/gas chromatography - mass spectrometry 0aPaint cross sections 0aNatural resins 0aLipidic binders 0aProteinaceous binders1 aFuentes, D.1 aSciutto, G.1 aMazzeo, R.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Jan., v. 105 p.327-334dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009100177300001600268520161000284592002801894650001601922650002301938650002601961650001101987650001901998650001102017650000902028650001002037650002002047650002302067651001602090651001002106700002002116700003402136700002002170700002902190700001802219700002602237773008802263856008602351852000902437655001202446IND60089148320221121222309.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmato, F.q(Fulvio),10aEffect of rain events on the mobility of road dust load in two Dutch and Spanish roads  ap. 352-358.  aIn spite of the high air quality and health relevance of PM emissions from road dust resuspension in large cities, very little is known on their temporal variability, severely hampering a reliable description of population exposure by dispersion models. We have experimentally monitored the mobile dust load (only inhalable fraction) in two different European urban environments resulting in the first empirical description of the temporal variation of road dust emission strength. In Central (The Netherlands) and Southern (Spain) European environments the loadings of mobile road dust particles <10 μm were found to be generally constant on a day-to-day scale, except during and in the hours immediately after rain events when the mobility of particles drops dramatically to values close to zero. After the rain event the mobile dust load increases exponentially tending to reach again the maximum value, result of the equilibrium between mobilization/buildup of dust and moistening/resuspension processes. The mobilization/buildup of particles smaller than 10 μm was found to be three times faster in Barcelona than in Utrecht, in relation to higher solar radiation. In Barcelona the recovery of mobile road dust reached 50%, 75%, and 90% of the maximum value after 8, 16 and 27 h, respectively. These values were independent of amounts of rain. In Utrecht the same thresholds were reached after, 28, 55 and 90 h, respectively. Our observations may suggest that, for reducing road dust emissions, light but frequent moistening of roads might be more effective than intensive occasional cleanings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aat-risk population 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acities 3adust emissions 3amodels 3arain 3aroads 3asolar radiation 3atemporal variation 3aNetherlands 3aSpain1 aSchaap, Martijn1 aDenier van der Gon, Hugo A.C.1 aPandolfi, Marco1 aAlastuey, A.q(Andrés),1 aKeuken, Menno1 aQuerol, X.q(Xavier),0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 62 p.352-358dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006200154245008800216520123600304592002801540650002601568650001601594650002501610650001901635650002301654650003001677650001401707650001501721650001701736653001901753653001401772653001601786653002501802653001501827653002601842700003101868700002201899700006201921773010401983856008902087852000902176655001202185IND60740215620221118025610.0210727e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074021562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNachimuthu, Ramesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8350-180910aApplication of bacteriophages and endolysins in aquaculture as a biocontrol measure  aAquaculture being a prime source of food for the majority of the global population, the industry is facing enormous loss due to infectious diseases. The use of antibiotics in combating infections is a breakthrough for aquaculture in the past, but the rising antibiotic resistance is posing an immense threat to their livelihood due to strict regulatory guidelines. Alternative therapeutic measures are required to continue the aquaculture production to meet the global need. There is anticipation in using bacteriophages, especially as a biocontrol agent. In this review, we have focused on collecting pieces of evidence to support the application of bacteriophages or phage-derived endolysins in aquaculture to fight bacterial infections in a post-antibiotic era. We have also summarised the prospects of phage applications in aquaculture and highlighted the importance of government initiatives in regulating and escorting the reliable method as a biocontrol strategy in a comprehensive manner in the aquaculture industry. In the future, studies have to be accomplished in aquaculture to prove the effectiveness of phages or phage-derived endolysins to intensify their use on a large scale as a prime source of biocontrol agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3abacteriophages 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aendolysin 3alivelihood 3atherapeutics 0aBacteriophages 0aEndolysin 0aAquaculture 0aBacterial infections 0aBiocontrol 0aApplication of phages1 aMadurantakam Royam, Madhav1 aManohar, Prasanth1 aLeptihn, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4847-46220 tBiological control.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.104678-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013200173300001600305520107600321592002801397650001801425650002301443650001301466650001301479650001901492650001101511650002701522650001501549653002101564653002801585653002801613700002501641700002401666700001801690700002701708700002001735700002201755773009001777856009001867852000901957655001201966IND60607484820221118053003.0180904e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060748482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahrami, Amir10aSynergistic local toughening of high performance epoxy-matrix composites using blended block copolymer-thermoplastic thin films  ap. 398-405.  aA new block copolymer-thermoplastic dual toughening concept for high performance RTM6 epoxy matrix composites is elaborated through a comprehensive microstructural study of well-defined model systems. A blend of phenoxy and MAM (copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(butyl acrylate)) increases the toughness of the corresponding carbon fiber reinforced composite by 125%, a five-fold synergistic improvement over the situation where the tougheners are used alone at the same total concentration. Selective intercalation of blended toughener thin films in the preform gives rise to a diffusion-induced composition gradient during the RTM process, which generates a morphology gradient upon curing. The observed microstructures results from MAM self-assembly in the miscible mixture of phenoxy and the epoxy resin precursor, followed by reaction induced phase separation, forming wormlike micelles, interconnected micelles and co-continuous morphologies. The resulting microstructures activate different toughening mechanisms responsible for the observed synergy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acomposite polymers 3aepoxides 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aseparation 0aEpoxy toughening 0aMicrostructure gradient 0aAtomic force microscopy1 aCordenier, François1 aVan Velthem, Pascal1 aBallout, Wael1 aPardoen, T.q(Thomas),1 aNysten, Bernard1 aBailly, Christian0 tComposites.g2016 Dec., v. 91 p.398-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245018600162300001600348520061200364592002800976650001201004650002101016650001301037650001901050650001301069650001201082650001501094650001301109700001401122700001901136773010501155856008201260852000901342655001201351IND60615482320221118023228.0181010e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061548232DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985869006006092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakob, W.10aVergleichende Untersuchungen über das histochemische Verhalten amyloider, fibrinoider und hyaliner Ablagerungen in der Gefässwand verschiedener Säugetiere und Vögel.

Here, we report the multigenerational stimulatory effects of deltamethrin in a factitious laboratory host, Corcyra cephalonica, and the subsequent performance of its parasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor. The effects of sublethal (LC₁₀), low lethal (LC₁₅, LC₂₀, LC₂₅ and LC₃₀) and median lethal (LC₅₀) concentrations of deltamethrin along with the control were evaluated on biological traits and nutrient reserves of the host for three consecutive generations (G0, G1, and G2). The biological traits of C. cephalonica (fecundity, developmental duration and larval weight gain) did not differ significantly in the parental generation (G0), whereas in the later generation (G2), significant differences were observed with the control. Nutrient reserves (protein and lipid content) in C. cephalonica were significantly influenced by sublethal concentrations in all three generations (G0, G1, and G2). The performance of H. hebetor on the factitious host C. cephalonica (G2) revealed a significant increase in parasitoid fecundity of 65% when host larvae were exposed to LC₁₅. However, no difference in hatch and pupation rates of parasitoids were observed across treatments. The emergence of both males and females and the longevity of only female wasps were significantly different. No effects were observed on male longevity. Taken together, insecticide-induced hormesis in host C. cephalonica, especially at LC₁₅ exposure, stimulates the development of parasitoid H. hebetor without obvious major trade-off. The results might be helpful in mass rearing of H. hebetor as a biocontrol agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorcyra cephalonica 3aHabrobracon hebetor 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3adeltamethrin 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahormesis 3alarvae 3alipid content 3alongevity 3amales 3aparasitoids 3apupation 3aweight gain 0aDeltamethrin 0aLow lethal 0aMass rearing 0aSublethal 0aParental generation1 aSahu, Madhusmita1 aUllah, Farman1 aPatil, Naveenkumar B.1 aPandi G, Guru Pirasanna1 aAdak, Totan1 aPokhare, Somnath1 aMahendiran, Annamalai1 aRath, Prakash Chandra0 tBiological control.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.104680-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001400242500001500256520234700271592002802618650001102646650001902657650001002676650001302686650002202699650001102721650002602732650001102758650002002769650002502789650001302814653000902827653000802836653000902844653002002853653000902873653003702882653000702919653001102926653000702937653001902944653000702963653000902970653002102979653001503000653000803015653000803023653000703031653001203038653001703050653000803067653000603075653000703081653000703088700002003095700001803115700001803133700001803151773009503169856008503264852000903349655001203358IND60546955620221121063221.0160903e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054695562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrist, Ellen R.14aThe environmental credentials of hydraulic lime-pozzolan concretes  ap. 26-37.  a2019-12-06  aThis research considers the compressive strength, embodied CO2, embodied energy and binder intensity of hydraulic lime-pozzolan concretes, in comparison with those of Portland-cement based concretes of equivalent 28-day compressive strength.Production of a lime-pozzolan concrete with a 28-day cube strength of approximately 50 MPa and an elastic modulus of 20 GPa has demonstrated the feasibility of producing modern, structural grade hydraulic lime-pozzolan concretes. Furthermore, construction and testing of two reinforced lime-pozzolan concrete beams has demonstrated the possibility of producing structural elements with a finished appearance and flexural behaviour similar to Portland cement concrete. This paper reflects on the value of this new material's technological progress in the context of the industry wide search for low carbon cements.Results of the research reported in this paper demonstrate that the use of aluminosilicate by-products, specifically ground granulated blastfurnace slag and silica fume, in combination with naturally hydraulic lime can realise savings in environmental impact; but that the savings are both future-orientated and highly dependent on the boundaries of the analysis. When considering only the secondary impacts of ground granulated blastfurnace slag and silica fume production, a ternary combination was observed to result in a lime-pozzolan concrete with a 28-day cube strength of 33 MPa and an embodied-CO2 of 95 kgCO2/m3, 64% lower than a CEMI, and 41% lower than a CEMIII/A concrete of equivalent strength. Both mass and economic allocation procedures were, however, shown to have a very detrimental effect on the environmental credentials of silica fume and thus also on hydraulic lime-concretes containing this pozzolanic addition.It is recognised that technical performance alone cannot be used to assess or compare the merits of any new material. This paper focus on the production, environmental impact and long-term availability of individual constituents of this novel binder, with a view to addressing important questions about the viability and desirability of re-producing this novel cementitious system in a commercial setting. Such information is acknowledged to be critical in the dialogue about the potential adoption and development of this emerging binder technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3acarbon dioxide 3aslags 3aindustry 3along term effects 3acement 3amodulus of elasticity 3acarbon 3aembodied energy 3aenvironmental impact 3aconcrete 0aGGBS 0aPCE 0aLCCs 0aEmbodied energy 0aCEMI 0aHydraulic lime-pozzolan concrete 0aEC 0afcm,28 0aEE 0aSustainability 0aSF 0aNHL5 0aBinder intensity 0abyproducts 0aw/b 0aNHL 0aSP 0afcyl,28 0aEmbodied CO2 0aCO2 0at 0aCm 0aCe1 aPaine, Kevin A.1 aHeath, Andrew1 aNorman, James1 aPinder, Henry0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 93 p.26-37dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.01.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009500171300001600266520096600282592002801248650001001276650001301286650002101299650001401320650002201334650001401356650001601370650000701386650001001393650001101403650002501414651000901439700002401448700003201472773011601504856008101620852000901701655001201710IND60340667220221123010109.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034066722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0241-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, Khoshnood10aVariation in the fruit characteristics of local pear (Pyrus spp.) in the Northwest of Iran  ap. 635-641.  aThe Northwest of Iran has a high diversity of endemic Pyrus species. In this study, considerable variability in morphological and chemical characteristics was observed in the fruit of 19 local Pyranshahr pear accessions. Fruit samples of three accessions (14, 7 and 10) had higher contents of total soluble solids (TSS > 23 %) and total sugar (SC ~11.5 %) than other accessions with a mean SC of 9 %. There was significant positive correlation between SC and TSS (r = 0.40) as well as between SC and pH (r = 0.46). Cluster analysis of the studied parameters, which were used to ascertain the level of diversity, differentiated accessions into seven clusters with significant variability among them.

Although the root-feeding Longitarsus basutoensis Bechyné (Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae: Alticini) was prioritised for assessment, similar flea beetle taxa were also considered. We first investigated the seasonal abundance of L. basutoensis and related taxa on S. madagascariensis populations in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Second, we assessed their host-plant affinities by surveying 17 non-target native Senecio species in the region. We used DNA CO1 barcoding to differentiate flea beetle taxa and their root-feeding larvae in both studies. Monthly sampling revealed three root-feeding taxa associated with S. madagascariensis, with L. basutoensis the most abundant. Longitarsus basutoensis was recorded throughout the year, with no clear patterns in seasonal abundance but significantly higher numbers at sites with deep, well drained soils that have high water holding capacity. Two unidentified flea beetle taxa, represented by larval specimens only, were recorded infrequently and in low numbers. The host-range study revealed 18 flea beetle taxa on 11 Senecio species, with L. basutoensis the most abundant species and recorded mostly on S. madagascariensis. Longitarsus basutoensis was also detected on four non-target Senecio species which, together with the results of preliminary host-specificity tests, indicated insufficient host-range restriction for countries like Australia that host a diverse Senecio flora. However, L basutoensis may have potential for release in Hawaii, due to a lack of native Senecio species on any of its islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHawaii 3aLongitarsus 3aSenecio madagascariensis 3aSiphonaptera 3abiological control 3aflora 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3ainsects 3alarvae 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa 0aAgent ecology 0aCOI gene sequencing 0aField host range 0aFireweed 0aRoot-feeding agents 0aWeed biocontrol1 aEgli, Daniella1 aGooden, Ben1 aOlckers, Terence0 tBiological control.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.104681-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1046813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006100171300001600232520245100248592002802699650001502727650001102742650001502753650002202768650001502790700002002805773009402825856005502919852000902974655001202983IND4470764620221120210844.0120925e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447076462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07319.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodani, János12aA comparative evaluation of pairwise nestedness measures  ap. 889-900.  aThis paper deals with nestedness measures that are based on pairwise comparisons of sites, evaluates their performance and suggests improvements and generalizations. There are several conceptual and technical criteria to judge their ecological applicability. It is of primary concern whether the measures 1) have a clear mathematical definition, 2) are influenced by the ordering of the data matrix, 3) incorporate similarity alone or similarity together with a dissimilarity component, 4) consider site pairs with identical species number negatively or positively, 5) show sensitivity to small changes in the data, and 6) are not vulnerable to type I and type II error rates. We performed a detailed comparison of the nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill (NODF), the percentage relativized nestedness and the percentage relativized strict nestedness functions (PRN and PRSN, respectively), based on analytical results as well as on artificial and actual examples. We show that NODF is in fact the average Simpson similarity of sites with different species totals, and that its value depends on how the matrix is actually ordered. NODF is modified to always produce the maximum possible result (NODFmax), independently of the order of columns and rows. Being based on similarities, NODF and NODFmax overemphasize the overlap component of nestedness and underrate richness difference which is also an important constituent of nested pattern in meta‐community data. This latter feature is reflected adequately by PRN and PRSN. However, PRSN is similar to NODF and NODFmax in sharing the disadvantages that 1) complete agreement and segregation in species composition are not distinguished, 2) a random matrix can have a higher value than truly nested patterns, and 3) they are ill‐conditioned statistically. These problems are rooted mostly in that site pairs with tied totals affect the result negatively. We emphasize that PRN is free from these difficulties. PRN, PRSN, and NODFmax, together with mean Simpson similarity exhibit highly similar statistical performance: they are resistant to type I and type II errors for the less constrained null models, although there are subtle differences depending on matrix fill and algorithm of randomization. The most constrained null model, with all marginal totals fixed, makes all statistics more sensitive to type I errors, although vulnerability depends greatly on matrix fill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3anestedness 3aspecies diversity 3astatistics1 aSchmera, Denes,0 tEcography.g2012 Oct., v. 35, no. 10 p.889-900dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07319.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012300153300001600276520147400292592002801766650002401794650002101818650001201839650001101851650002501862650002301887650001201910650001701922650001001939650002801949650000901977650002701986650001002013650001402023650004302037650001102080650001802091653002502109653003002134653002702164653002402191653002802215700001202243700001702255700001802272700001802290700001902308700001102327700001602338773014202354856007402496852000902570655001202579IND60772070420221119014251.0220331e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077207042DNAL7 a10.18474/JES21-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Di,10aCloning and Expression Analysis of Glutathione S-transferase Genes from Agrilus zanthoxylumi (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)  ap. 173-181.  aHost adaptability and insecticide resistance of insects are closely related to detoxification metabolism-related proteins. In this study, the distribution and expression of glutathione s-transferase (GST) in Agrilus zanthoxylumi Hou (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) were studied. Based on the transcriptome data of A. zanthoxylumi, five GST genes were screened and cloned. The transcription levels of the five GST genes in male and female adult head, thorax, abdomen, legs and wings were determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in order to provide a theoretical basis for the functional study of the gene. The results showed that all five GST genes had highly conserved N-terminal domain or C-terminal domain, belonging to two subfamilies of Delta or Sigma. The phylogenetic tree results showed that the evolutionary relationship of GST genes between A. zanthoxylumi, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), and Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) was the closest; RT-qPCR results showed that the five GST genes were differentially expressed in different tissues and sexes, and its expression level in each tissue of the male was higher than that of the female as a whole, especially in the head. The results of this study can provide basic data for analyzing the mechanism of detoxification resistance of A. zanthoxylumi and provide reference for its biological control and resistance research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aTenebrio molitor 3aabdomen 3aadults 3aamino acid sequences 3abiological control 3afemales 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3ahead 3ainsecticide resistance 3amales 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athorax 3atranscriptome 0aAgrilus zanthoxylumi 0aglutathione s-transferase 0adetoxification enzymes 0aexpression analysis 0abioinformatics analysis1 aLi, Guo1 aShou-An, Xie1 aXiao-Jin, Gao1 aRen-Hang, Jia1 aZe-Teng, Zhang1 aYu, Qi1 aShu-Jie, LV0 tJournal of entomological science.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 57, no. 2 p.173-181dGeorgia Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl43038x0749-80047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18474/JES21-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009000168300001800258520118100276592002801457650000801485650001101493650001301504650002601517650001501543650000901558650002001567650001401587650002201601650001401623700002601637700002301663700002001686700002201706773010601728856008101834852000901915655001201924IND60121079120221120130806.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012107912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8238-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ching-Fong10aLamination of magnesium oxide spacers to barium strontium zirconium titanate ceramics  ap. 5218-5226.  aWe propose an innovative idea to bond the dielectric barium strontium zirconium titanate (BSTZO) plates with magnesium oxide (MgO) as the spacers to achieve a hermetic module without any air gaps between the dielectric and the spacer. The gold metallization can be applied across the whole assembly to create an integrated electrode. The gold metallization also eliminates pressure contact by external copper plates assemblies, which are required to achieve good contacts between the copper plates and the metallized surfaces of the BSTZO. The MgO spacers are processed using a dry-pressing and pressureless-sintering method. The thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of BSTZO and MgO spacer was measured. In addition to matching the CTE between BSTZO dielectric and the MgO spacer, it is also critical to develop a good bonding material with CTE matching to BSTZO and MgO spacer. The effect of CTE for various bonding compositions on the dielectric properties was thoroughly studied and reported. The mechanism explaining the high and low dielectric constants for the laminates is proposed and discussed based on the CTE results and their effect on microstructural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abarium 3aceramics 3adielectric properties 3aelectrodes 3agold 3amagnesium oxide 3astrontium 3athermal expansion 3azirconium1 aMarksteiner, Quinn R.1 aReiten, Matthew R.1 aWynn, Thomas A.1 aGuidry, Dennis R.0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 July, v. 49, no. 14 p.5218-5226dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8238-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245010900211520151600320592002801836650001301864650001701877650002801894650001401922650002001936650001501956650002001971650002001991650002502011650001702036650001102053650001102064651001102075653002402086653002102110653002502131653001702156653001802173653001102191700002102202700001802223700001902241700005802260773012002318856008802438852000902526655001202535IND60653774220221121141730.0200318e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065377422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.1044162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesana, Joshua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1970-624110aMeasuring food and nutritional losses through value stream mapping along the dairy value chain in Uganda  aThe growing burden of food losses has intensified the need for reliable and comparable data. This study extends the application of lean manufacturing practices and uses Value Stream Mapping (VSM) analysis with the Food Loss and Waste (FLW) Accounting and Reporting Standard to identify hotspots and analyze the magnitude of both food and nutritional losses in the food value chain. A case study on the dairy value chain in Uganda is utilized to understand the production configuration (primary production, processing and distribution). Through linking hotspots where food loss in milk production takes place to specific salient reasons, this case provides an estimation of the magnitude of losses occurring in yogurt and UHT milk production lines. Findings reaffirm the processing stage as a principle hotspot for discarding yogurt as well as UHT milk products. Throughout processing, from start to finish, food losses at chain level are estimated to be in the magnitude of up to 14%. This also translates to a substantial nutritional value disappearing from the food system, which compromises the ability of people to meet their nutrient recommendations. The case study represents a pragmatic assessment that combines the mapping advantages of VSM with accounting and reporting guidelines of FLW Accounting and Reporting Standard to contribute to a detailed assessment of food and nutritional losses. Thereby, reinforcing initiation of evidence-based and targeted reduction strategies along food supply chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT milk 3acase studies 3adietary recommendations 3afood loss 3afood processing 3aguidelines 3amilk production 3anutritive value 3aprimary productivity 3asupply chain 3awastes 3ayogurt 3aUganda 0aFood loss and waste 0aNutritional loss 0aValue stream mapping 0aFLW standard 0aMilk products 0aUganda1 aGellynck, Xavier1 aDora, Manoj K1 aPearce, Darian1 aDe Steur, Hans1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1340-08820 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Nov., v. 150 p.104416-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.1044163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009900169300001800268520090200286592002801188650002701216650002501243650001901268650001101287650002101298650001401319650001101333650001201344650001101356650002001367651001001387651001701397651001501414653002901429653001401458653002401472700001801496700001801514700001801532773010801550856008801658852000901746655001201755IND60611415520221122061119.0190628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061141552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fuxia10aLong-term variations and influence factors of nutrients in the western North Yellow Sea, China  ap. 1026-1034.  aThis study investigated the long-term variations and compositions of nutrients and the associated controlling factors in the western North Yellow Sea on the basis of historical data. The NO3-N and DIN concentrations and N/P showed continuous increases over the past two decades, which were dominantly affected by riverine inputs, such as inputs from the Yellow River, Yalujiang River and Jia River and atmospheric deposition. However, due to human activities, such as dam construction in rivers and climate change, the SiO3-Si concentrations and Si/P ratios decreased before the early 1990s and then gradually increased. The vertical distributions of nutrients displayed higher concentrations at the bottom than those at the surface in summer, which was attributed to the combined influence of the thermocline, the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass, the Yellow Sea Warm Current and biological activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3abioactive properties 3aclimate change 3ahumans 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrients 3arivers 3asilicon 3asummer 3awater pollution 3aChina 3aYellow River 3aYellow Sea 0aWestern North Yellow Sea 0aNutrients 0aLong-term variation1 aWei, Qinsheng1 aChen, Hongtao1 aYao, Qingzhen0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Oct., v. 135 p.1026-1034dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06045naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245012600200506007600326520361600402592002804018506003704046650002304083650002304106650001904129650001604148650002804164650002004192650002404212650002804236650001804264650002704282650001204309650001204321650000904333650001604342650001704358650001204375650002104387650001704408650001204425650002304437650001904460650001204479650003204491650001404523650002504537650003004562650000904592650001204601650002404613650002404637650001704661650001304678650003004691650003204721650002604753650001304779650001704792650001704809650001004826700002004836700002604856700002604882700002304908700001904931700002504950700002204975700002304997773012405020856007405144852000905218655001205227IND60674537520221207105217.0191025e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067453752DNAL7 a10.3390/nu111022782doi7 aPMC68362202pmcid7 a315475622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrea, Luigi 10aAdherence to the Mediterranean Diet, Dietary Patterns and Body Composition in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder and is characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Obesity, low-grade chronic inflammatory status, and insulin-resistance (IR) often coexist in PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and high in monounsaturated fat. There is a close association among obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, IR, and hormonal derangements in PCOS. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the adherence to MD, the dietary intake, and the body composition and their association with PCOS clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-na&iuml;ve women with PCOS when compared with a control group of healthy women matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 112 patients with PCOS and 112 controls. PREvenci&oacute;n con DIetaMEDiterr&aacute;nea (PREDIMED) and seven-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. Testosterone levels and Ferriman-Gallwey score assessed the clinical severity of PCOS. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high sensitivity. PCOS women showed higher testosterone levels, Ferriman-Gallwey score, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HoMA)-IR when compared with the control group (p < 0.001). In addition, we found that the PCOS women consumed less extra-virgin olive oil, legumes, fish/seafood, and nuts compared with control group. Despite no differences in energy intake between the two groups, the PCOS women consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fatty acid (SFA), PUFA and n-6 PUFA than the control group. The PCOS women have an adverse body composition when compared with controls, with the lowest values of phase angle (PhA) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001). Additionally, after adjusting for BMI and total energy intake, testosterone levels showed significant negative correlations with PREDIMED score (p < 0.001) and consumption of protein (p = 0.005), complex carbohydrate (p < 0.001), fiber (p < 0.001), MUFA (p < 0.001), n-3 PUFA (p = 0.001), and positive associations with CRP levels, simple carbohydrate, SFA, n-6 PUFA (p < 0.001, respectively), and PUFA (p = 0.002). The cut-off for PREDIMED score &le; 6 (p < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.848, standard error 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.768 to 0.909) could serve as a threshold for significantly increased risk of high value of testosterone levels. In conclusion, a novel direct association between the adherence to MD and the clinical severity of the disease was reported in women with PCOS. This association could support a therapeutic role of foods and nutrients of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in the PCOS pathogenesis likely involving their inflammatory status, IR, and hyperandrogenemia. In addition, we reported a different body composition that is characterized by lower PhA and fat-free mass than controls. These data suggested a role of PhA as a useful marker of the clinical severity of this syndrome and provided strong evidence regarding the strategic relevance of the nutritional assessment in the management of women with PCOS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3aMediterranean diet 3aanimal ovaries 3aanovulation 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afasting 3afemales 3afish 3afood intake 3afood records 3aglucose 3ahyperandrogenism 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alean body mass 3alegumes 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutrients 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition risk assessment 3anuts 3aobesity 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3aseafoods 3atestosterone 3atherapeutics 3awomen1 aArnone, Angela 1 aAnnunziata, Giuseppe 1 aMuscogiuri, Giovanna 1 aLaudisio, Daniela 1 aSalzano, Ciro 1 aPugliese, Gabriella 1 aColao, Annamaria 1 aSavastano, Silvia 0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu111022783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012300167300001800290520102900308592002801337650001901365650001201384650001001396650002501406650002601431650001501457650001101472650001501483650000901498650001301507650002001520650003001540650002001570650000901590651001001599651001501609653002401624653001701648653002601665653001801691700005601709700001401765700001801779700001601797700001401813773010801827856008801935852000902023655001202032IND60611415620221122061049.0190628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061141562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Song12aA study of the environmental factors influencing the growth phases of Ulva prolifera in the southern Yellow Sea, China  ap. 1016-1025.  aMacroalgal blooms of U. prolifera in the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) have become an ecological disaster.

Blooms of U. prolifera were mainly distributed in the central SYS, drifting from the southern Yellow Sea Radial Sand Ridges. Three growth phases were defined (initial phase, outbreak phase and dissipation phase) to facilitate analysis of the relationship between the environmental factors and growth conditions of U. prolifera. Seaweed cultivation, sea surface temperature (SST) and available radiation influenced the algal biomass during the initial phase; the seawater transparency, precipitation and wind activity affected the algae during the outbreak phase; and SST, intense radiation and cleanup operations increased the rate of algal extinction in the dissipation phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva prolifera 3abiomass 3acolor 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3ahumans 3amacroalgae 3asand 3aseawater 3aseaweed culture 3asurface water temperature 3awater pollution 3awind 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aSouthern Yellow Sea 0aU. prolifera 0aEnvironmental factors 0aGrowth phases1 aLiu, Yongxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6837-50151 aSun, Chao1 aWei, Xianglin1 aLi, Huiting1 aHan, Zhen0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Oct., v. 135 p.1016-1025dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167300001400275520089300289592002801182650002801210650001301238650002301251650001201274650001001286650002401296650001301320650001401333653002801347653002401375653001301399653001501412700001801427773010301445856005101548852000901599655001201608IND50087622420221120112733.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008762242DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2011.5625592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Xue-Mei10aArthrobotrys oligospora: a model organism for understanding the interaction between fungi and nematodes  ap. 59-78.  aArthrobotrys oligospora, a predacious fungus of nematodes, has been very useful in understanding the relationship between nematophagous fungi and their nematode hosts. Arthrobotrys oligospora is by far the most common nematode-trapping fungus with the characteristic ability of forming adhesive trapping nets once in contact with nematodes. This review highlights the versatility and development of A. oligospora as a system to identify and characterize the ecology and biology of nematode-trapping fungi. Using A. oligospora, advances in our knowledge of nematophagous fungi have been made through the discovery of special traits and virulence determinants involved in the pathogenic process, or by creating new ways of presenting these factors to the target nematodes. We argue for an increased role for A. oligospora in complementing other model systems in biological control research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobotrys oligospora 3aNematoda 3abiological control 3aecology 3ahosts 3anematophagous fungi 3atrapping 3avirulence 0anematode-trapping fungi 0anematophagous fungi 0anematode 0abiocontrol1 aZhang, Ke-Qin0 tMycology.g2011 June 1, v. 2, no. 2 p.59-78dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2011.562559  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010400173300001300277520100900290592002801299650001401327650000801341650001401349650001601363650002401379650001701403650001901420650002201439650001601461650001301477650002201490650002101512650002201533653001701555653004001572653002301612653002901635700001401664773008801678856009001766852000901856655001201865IND60612157520221118225059.0181015e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061215752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2017.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yongkang12aA fast water-induced shape memory polymer based on hydroxyethyl cellulose/graphene oxide composites  ap. 9-16.  aHerein, a fast water responsive shape memory polymer composites based on hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) has been fabricated by crosslinking with graphene oxide (GO) and citric acid (CA). The swelling behavior, mechanical properties, micro-topography, thermal stability, as well as water and moisture induced shape memory performance of this composite were all fully investigated to demonstrate its functions. After crosslinking with GO and CA, the composite exhibited excellent mechanical properties with tensile strength over 100MPa, which was nearly 4 times higher than pure HEC. Moreover, the pre-deformed composite was able to fully recover to its original shape in aqueous environment, which not only quickly happened in water (14s), but also occurred in wet air with relative humidity about 70 within only 5min.

Identification of circRNAs is an important part of circRNA research. The circRNA prediction methods can predict the circRNAs with start and end positions in the chromosome but cannot identify the full-length circRNA sequences. We present an R package FcircSEC (Full Length circRNA Sequence Extraction and Classification) to extract the full-length circRNA sequences based on gene annotation and the output of any circRNA prediction tools whose output has a chromosome, start and end positions, and a strand for each circRNA. To validate FcircSEC, we have used three databases, circbase, circRNAdb, and plantcircbase. With information such as the chromosome and strand of each circRNA as the input, the identified sequences by FcircSEC are consistent with the databases. The novelty of FcircSEC is that it can take the output of state-of-the-art circRNA prediction tools as input and is applicable for human and other species. We also classify the circRNAs as exonic, intronic, and others. The R package FcircSEC is freely available.  aPublisher supplied data  cShenzhen Discipline Construction Project for Urban Computing and Data Intelligence, Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS  a2011DP173015cCAS Key Lab  a2019M653132cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aJCYJ20170413093358429 JCYJ20180507182818013cShenzhen Basic Research Fund  a61433012 U1813203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFB0201305 2018YFB0204403cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenomics 3aprediction1 aPeng, Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9649-249X1 aFeng, Shengzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6225-28151 aWei, Yanjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4791-75400 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2020 June 1, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/90849013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001600265500001500281520089700296592002801193650002601221650002101247650001001268650001701278650001201295650002601307650002801333650002601361650001601387650001301403650002301416650002001439650002501459650001601484650001101500650001301511650002401524653002401548700001901572700001901591700002401610700002301634773010801657856008101765852000901846655001201855IND60481137220221118152717.0170717e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048113722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-015-0525-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Jitendra10aUV-B induces biomass production and nonenzymatic antioxidant compounds in three cyanobacteria  ap. 131-140.  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study, the impact of low fluence rate of UV-B (0.045 W.m⁻²) on biomass production, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins), chlorophyll fluorescence, nonenzymatic antioxidants: proline, ascorbate, cysteine, and nonprotein thiols, total phenolic contents, and antioxidant potential (radical scavenging activity) was investigated in three cyanobacteria, viz.

A severe outbreak of ovine anaplasmosis was diagnosed for the first time in Spain in 2014 and, subsequently, a research was developed in order to increase de knowledge of this not-well-known disease.An experimental infection with Anaplasma ovis was carried out in three lambs and the evolution of the disease was assessed during a period of three years and two production cycles (gestation, birth and lactation). Clinical and haematological parameters were analyzed through all the period and detection of Anaplasma ovis by qPCR and Giemsa staining of blood smears was performed periodically as well as cELISA test for the detection of antibodies against Anaplasma spp. Finally, Anaplasma ovis vertical transmission and transfer of immunity through the colostrum were studied and evaluation of the immune response against infection of lambs born from infected dams was likewise analyzed by means of a new experimental infection.The results showed that A. ovis induces a severe normocytic and normochromic anaemia, however, evident clinical signs were not observed until the first lambing. Molecular identification of Anaplasma ovis by qPCR revealed that the three animals started to test positive between day 4 and 8 post-infection and afterwards, the bacterial load increased progressively until reaching a peak on day 36 post-infection. The presence of antibodies against A. ovis was detected from day 10 after inoculation in the three animals.Ruminal atony, paleness of mucous membranes, weakness and fever were observed after the first delivery, followed by a chronic condition with a relevant loss of body weight that led to a state of cachexia. The three animals showed severe anaemia after delivery, coinciding with a peak in the bacterial load and relevant decrease in the humoral response. In the second production cycle, the animals presented very slight clinical signs, with minor variations in the erythrocyte count, however, the high percentage of inhibition of the humoral response was not modified at the time of delivery, indicating in this case, a good immune response of the animals against A. ovis.All the blood samples taken to the lambs born from infected dams tested negative to A. ovis by qPCR in all the analyzed period, discarding the vertical transmission of the disease. Further, the analysis performed by cELISA test to the colostrum taken from the infected sheep evidenced the presence of antibodies against A. ovis, thus, all the lambs born from these ewes and naturally nursed showed antibodies against A. ovis after colostrum intake.Finally, in the experimental infection carried out in lambs born from infected ewes no clinical findings were observed and only a slight anaemia with a fast erythrocytic regenerative response was detected. In contrast with the first experimental infection, these animals tested antibody positive by cELISA the first day after infection.The studies shown in this article shed some light on how A. ovis infection occurs and how immunity is generated at the flock level. However, new studies are needed with a greater number of animals to be able to corroborate all these promising results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma ovis 3aanaplasmosis 3aanemia 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acachexia 3acolostral immunity 3acolostrum 3adisease transmission 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aerythrocyte count 3aewes 3afever 3aflocks 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3alactation 3alambing 3alambs 3amicrobial load 3amucosa 3apregnancy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3astaining 3aweight loss 3aSpain 0aSheep 0aOvine anaplasmosis 0aExperimental infection 0aVertical transmission 0aColostral immunity1 aBenito, A.1 aArnal, J.L.1 aOrtín, A.1 aGomez, M.,1 aLópez, A.1 aVillanueva-Saz, S.1 aLacasta, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7822-66460 tSmall ruminant research.g2019 Sept., v. 178 p.7-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2019.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010900170300001600279520107100295592002801366650001601394650002201410650002101432650001501453650001601468650001501484650002101499650001501520650003201535650001401567650001301581650002401594650002201618650003301640650001701673650001101690650001701701653002101718653001401739653001901753653002201772700001201794700001401806700001801820700001501838700001201853700001901865773010801884856008501992852000902077655001202086IND60561300820221119211821.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056130082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huai-Hao10aEffect of potassium sulfate in mineral precursor on capacitance behavior of as-prepared activated carbon  ap. 235-241.  aActivated carbon (AC) used as supercapacitor electrode materials was successfully synthesized from analog sulfur-containing precursors (ASCPs). The materials were characterized by means of X-ray adsorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ion chromatography and N2 physical adsorption/desorption. The capacitance behavior was performed by electrochemical measurements. The results indicate that as the mass ratio of KOH to petroleum coke (PC) is 3:1 and 4:1, the synergistic activation effect from K2SO4 and KOH can increase pore volume and capacitance performance of AC. However, as for KOH/PC mass ratio is 5:1, the pore structure generated during activation process is destroyed due to K2SO4 over-activation, namely, the specific surface area, porosity and capacitance performance of AC decreased. Comparatively, the role of K2SO4 is quite different from those of other sulfur species, such as organic dibenzothiophene (DBT) and inorganic FeS2 during AC activation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aion exchange chromatography 3apetroleum 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3apotassium sulfate 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 3asurface area 0aActivated carbon 0aPrecursor 0aSupercapacitor 0aPotassium sulfate1 aMa, Chi1 aTong, Jie1 aHu, Yong-Feng1 aZhao, Jing1 aHu, Bin1 aWang, Chen-Yin0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Feb., v. 142 p.235-241dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012600159300001600285520179700301592002802098650002102126650002602147650001102173650001502184650002102199650002602220650002302246650001202269650001502281650003102296650001402327650001502341650001002356650001502366650001702381653001802398653001502416653001302431653001702444700002402461700001902485773014202504856007402646852000902720655001202729IND60772070820221119014602.0220331e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077207082DNAL7 a10.18474/JES21-312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarroll, Elijah10aResidues and Routes of Exposure of Insecticides in Turfgrass for Control of Fall Armyworm Larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 182-193.  aFall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a generalist pest of food crops and turfgrasses. Insecticides such as diamides provide longer residual control of some grass-feeding caterpillars relative to pyrethroids. The objective was to compare the responses of fall armyworm larvae to residues of commonly used insecticides on hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy). A field experiment determined mortality of free-ranging fall armyworms exposed for 1–3 h on turfgrass at 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 d after a foliar application. A laboratory experiment determined the mortality of larvae fed grass clippings harvested from treated plots at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 d after application. Larvae crawled similar or greater distances across bermudagrass treated with bifenthrin and permethrin relative to nontreated grasses. After crawling on bermudagrass treated with chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole 14 d after application, larval mortality was ≥77%. Mortality of larvae fed pyrethroid-treated clippings was ≤40% and no different from control larvae regardless of residue age. Larvae fed bermudagrass with 1 to 7 d old residues of cyantraniliprole or indoxacarb resulted in significantly greater mortality than larvae fed nontreated clippings. No residues of cyantraniliprole or indoxacarb older than 7 d resulted in mortality significantly greater than larvae fed nontreated clippings. Larvae fed chlorantraniliprole-treated clippings of all residue ages produced larval mortality greater than larvae fed nontreated clippings. These experiments support previous reports of extended residual control from chlorantraniliprole against other grass-feeding caterpillar species. The diamides protect turfgrass from larvae better than pyrethroids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aamides 3abifenthrin 3acyantraniliprole 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3ahybrids 3aindoxacarb 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3apermethrin 3apests 3apyrethrins 3aturf grasses 0afall armyworm 0atoxicology 0abehavior 0abermudagrass1 aCarson, Kendra M.H.1 aHeld, David W.0 tJournal of entomological science.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 57, no. 2 p.182-193dGeorgia Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl43038x0749-80047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18474/JES21-313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013200166520170600298592002802004650001502032650001102047650002102058650001102079650001502090650002402105653004302129653003402172653004902206653003802255700001402293700001602307700001502323773009802338856008702436852000902523655001202532IND60749665920221122094346.0211017e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074966592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jian10aLight-stacking strengthened fusion based building energy consumption prediction framework via variable weight feature selection  aBuilding energy consumption prediction plays an irreplaceable role in energy resource management and planning. Continuous improvement in the performance of predictive models is the key to ensure energy management and deployment operations. The imbalance between the speed and the accuracy for hyperparameter optimization is an important factor that limits the performance of the model. A Light-Stacking Strengthened Fusion Framework (LSStFu) is proposed to solve this problem. The optimization and fusion of the multi-type hyperparameter model obtained by random search can greatly improve the accuracy of the model prediction. This process can also assure a reduction in time consumption when compared with grid search. Moreover, a feature selection algorithm can only describe a single aspect of a bunch of multiple types of data sets, which limits the generalization performance ability of the algorithm. In order to address the above limitation, a Variable Weight Feature Selection (VWFS) method is proposed to fuse the contribution of three feature selection algorithms based on particle swarm optimization. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed LSStFu algorithm, it is compared with other algorithms through eight evaluation indicators. This evaluation process verifies the reliability and stability of the Light-Stacking framework to provide an efficient, accurate, and stable hyperparameter optimization framework for energy predictive models. From the ablation analysis, it can be observed that with the optimal subset of features obtained through the VWFS, the accuracy of the prediction models is improved. In addition, the model construction process has also sped up at the same time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresource management 0aShort-term building energy forecasting 0aIntegrated learning algorithm 0aLight-Stacking Strengthened Fusion Framework 0aVariable Weight Feature Selection1 aLiu, Gang1 aSun, Boyang1 aXiao, Gang0 tApplied energy.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 303 p.117694-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1176943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012800157300001800285500001900303520169100322592002802013650001602041650001702057650001402074650002302088650001102111650002102122650001802143650001502161700005902176773014702235856007602382852000902458655001202467IND60737072520221119131907.0210514e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073707252DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c038292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoja, Ali10aComputational Insights into Privileged Stereocontrolling Interactions Involving Chiral Phosphates and Iminium Intermediates  ap. 7209-7215.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe precise design of a catalyst for a given reaction is extremely difficult, often requiring a significant empirical screening campaign to afford products in high yields and enantiomeric excess. Design becomes even more challenging if one requires a catalyst that performs well for a diverse range of substrates. Such “privileged” catalysts exist, but little is known why they operate so generally. We report the results of computations which show that when substrate and catalyst features are conserved between significantly different mechanistic regimes, similar modes of activation can be invoked. As a validating case study, we explored a Hantzsch ester hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated iminiums involving BINOL-derived chiral phosphates and find they impart asymmetric induction in an analogous fashion to their acid counterpart. Specifically, DFT calculations at the IEFPCM(1,4-dioxane)-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level predicted enantioselectivity to be close to the experimental value (82% ee calculated, 96% ee experimental) and showed that the reaction proceeds via a transition state involving two hydrogen-bonding interactions from the iminium intermediate and nucleophile to the catalyst. These interactions lower the energy of the transition structure and provide extra rigidity to the system. This new model invokes “privileged” noncovalent interactions and leads to a new explanation for the enantioselectivity outcome, ultimately providing the basis for the development of general catalyst design principles and the translation of mechanistically disparate reaction profiles for the prediction of enantioselectivity outcomes using statistical models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acase studies 3acatalysts 3aenantioselectivity 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrogenation 3aprediction1 aReid, Jolene P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2397-00530 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 143, no. 18 p.7209-7215dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c038293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002100184245012300205300001800328506007600346520176300422592002802185506003702213650002102250650001202271650001602283650001002299650002202309650002002331650001202351650003502363650002402398650001602422650001402438650002502452650001002477650001402487650001602501650002202517650001502539650003502554650004602589650001102635650003702646650003602683650001102719650001802730650002502748650004902773650003602822650001402858650002402872650003902896700002302935700002402958700002402982700001803006700001903024700002403043773013803067856004603205852000903251655001203260IND4470572320221207133237.0120423e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447057232DNAL7 a224923802pmid7 aPMC33258352pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0238612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Bridget E10aMaternal vitamin D status and calcium intake interact to affect fetal skeletal growth in utero in pregnant adolescents  ap. 1103-1112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Maternal calcium intake and vitamin D status may affect fetal bone development. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine relations between maternal calcium intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status, and fetal bone growth across pregnancy. DESIGN: This was a prospective longitudinal design. Maternal 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] were determined at midgestation (∼26 wk) and at delivery in 171 adolescents (≤18 y). Dietary recalls and fetal sonograms were performed up to 3 times across gestation, and fetal femur and humerus z scores were generated. RESULTS: Fetal femur and humerus z scores and neonatal birth length were significantly greater (P < 0.03) in adolescents consuming ≥1050 mg than in those consuming <1050 mg Ca/d. Maternal 25(OH)D >50 nmol/L was significantly positively associated with fetal femur and humerus z scores (P < 0.01). When maternal smoking, height, race, weight gain, and gestational age were controlled for, these relations remained significant. Interactions between calcium intake and 25(OH)D were evident. Calcium intake was associated with fetal femur z scores and birth length only when maternal 25(OH)D was ≤50 nmol/L (P < 0.05). Similarly, maternal 25(OH)D was associated with fetal femur and humerus z scores only when maternal calcium intake was <1050 mg/d (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Optimal calcium intake and adequate maternal vitamin D status are both needed to maximize fetal bone growth. Interactions between these nutrients were evident when either calcium or vitamin D status was limited. Improving maternal calcium intake and/or vitamin D status during pregnancy may have a positive effect on fetal skeletal development in pregnant adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdequate Intakes 3acalcium 3adiet recall 3afemur 3afetal development 3agestational age 3ahumerus 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aparathyroid hormone 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3apregnant adolescents 3araces 3avitamin D 3aweight gain 3ayouth development 2aAdolescent 2aBone Developmentxdrug effects 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFemurxdrug effectsxembryology. 2aFetal Developmentxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aParathyroid Hormonexmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aProspective Studies 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosage1 aMcNanley, Thomas J1 aCooper, Elizabeth M1 aMcIntyre, Allison W1 aWitter, Frank1 aHarris, Z Leah1 aO'Brien, Kimberly O0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 May, v. 95, no. 5 p.1103-1112dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.023861  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016500165300001600330500001900346520194100365592002802306650001402334650001102348650001102359650001102370650001102381650001002392650001202402650001402414650002202428650001102450650001102461651001302472653001402485653001302499653001702512653001402529653002302543653003102566653001702597653001002614700002002624773008202644856008102726852000902807655001202816IND60737072720221119131805.0210514e20210503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073707272DNAL7 a10.1163/15685403-bja100752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJugovic, Jure12aA seasonal dynamics and population status of the steno-endemic karst fairy shrimp Chirocephalus croaticus (Steuer, 1899) (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) from Slovenia  ap. 529-549.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated the presence and ecology of Chirocephalus croaticus (Steuer, 1899) during three successive seasons (spring and autumn 2018, spring 2019) at Lake Petelinje (SW Slovenia). Although the presence (duration, abundance) of this fairy shrimp strongly differs among different seasons and both years, we showed that in a season with favourable conditions (spring 2018) its abundance increases rapidly at the end of the season as the shrimps persist in small pools until the water dries out. The species may appear again during the autumn, however, its abundance and persistence seem to be much lower and shorter than during the spring, respectively. Nevertheless, persistence and abundance may also differ strongly among the two successive spring seasons (less shrimps found during the shorter season of 2019 than in 2018). Larvae appear first, and are most abundant at the beginning of the season, and are followed by adult males (protandry) and females, which become most abundant at the end of the season. Also, larvae seem to be more abundant on exposed bottom (gravel path), while adults are much more abundant in the shelter of a submerged meadow. Ovigerous females had 9-37 cysts (fertilized eggs) in their brood pouch, and the position of differently developed eggs changed during the season; the presence of females without eggs during mid- and at the end of season indicates the production of thin-shelled summer, and thick-shelled winter cysts, respectively. In contrast with the water decrease that is in strongly negative association with the abundance of the fairy shrimps (lake size — abundance: r=−0.56, P<0.001), no other environmental parameters were highly associated (r⩽|0.38|) with species abundance. Although the local population (one of only two currently known) seems to be in good condition, appropriate conservation action should be taken to prevent the decrease of this population in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnostraca 3aadults 3aautumn 3agravel 3akarsts 3alakes 3ameadows 3aprotandry 3aspecies abundance 3aspring 3asummer 3aSlovenia 0aAbundance 0aendemism 0aextremophile 0afecundity 0ahabitat preference 0aintermittent/seasonal lake 0alife-history 0aPivka1 aJeklar, Martina0 tCrustaceana.g, v. 94, no. 5 p.529-549dBrillwJournal:21399x0011-216X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-bja100753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017200164300001600336500001900352520104900371592002801420650002401448650001601472650001201488650001201500650001901512650001601531650001401547650002001561650001101581650001701592650001601609700001801625700001901643700001801662700002201680773008201702856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60737072820221119131734.0210514e20210503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073707282DNAL7 a10.1163/15685403-bja101112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jin Ah10aComparison of the effect of red light exposure and eyestalk ablation for inducing sexual maturation and improving egg quality in the cleaner shrimp Lysmata amboinensis  ap. 551-571.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFemale cleaner shrimps Lysmata amboinensis either underwent eyestalk ablations (EA), or were treated with two different wavelength intensities of red light (peak at 630 nm), and then their sex maturation and the effects on their egg quality parameters were compared.

VTG-R expression (in situ) levels that caused the EA and red irradiation to induce the synthesis of VTG-R were assessed, and the triglycerides (TG) and glucose levels in the eggs were analysed. VIH expression was decreased in all experimental groups, but VTG and VTG-R expressions were increased.

In contrast to traditional, time independent assessments of risk, this new formulation relays information on when the risk occurs, how long the duration of risk is, and how risk changes with time. Because the true exposure duration (ED) is often uncertain in a risk assessment, we also investigate how varying the magnitude of fixed size durations (ranging between 5 and 70years) of this parameter affects the distribution of risk in both the time independent and dependent methodologies. To illustrate this new formulation and to investigate these mechanisms for sensitivity, an example of arsenic contaminated groundwater is used in conjunction with two scenarios of different environmental concentration signals resulting from rate dependencies in geochemical reactions. Cancer risk is computed and compared using environmental concentration ensembles modeled with sorption as 1) a linear equilibrium assumption (LEA) and 2) first order kinetics (Kin). Results show that the information attained in the new time dependent methodology reveals how the uncertainty in other time-dependent processes in the risk assessment may influence the uncertainty in risk. We also show that individual susceptibility also affects how risk changes in time, information that would otherwise be lost in the traditional, time independent methodology. These results are especially pertinent for forecasting risk in time, and for risk managers who are assessing the uncertainty of risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aexposure duration 3ahuman health 3arisk 3arisk assessment process 3arisk managers 3auncertainty 2aArsenicxtoxicity 2aDrinking Water 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNeoplasmsxchemically induced 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aRisk Management 2aStochastic Processes 2aTime Factors 2aUncertainty 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aMaxwell, Reed M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 431 p.221-232dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245020500159300001600364520180100380592002802181650003102209650002502240650001502265650002302280650002002303650001202323650001902335650002702354651001102381651000902392651001702401653001902418653001602437653004902453653001902502653001302521700004002534773014202574856007402716852000902790655001202799IND60772071120221120051408.0220331e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077207112DNAL7 a10.18474/JES21-392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMnguni, Sandiso10aLaboratory-Based Mate Choices of Two Eccritotarsus Species (Hemiptera: Miridae) Used as Biological Control Agents of Water Hyacinth, Pontederia (Eichhornia) crassipes (Pontederiaceae), in South Africa  ap. 267-280.  aMany biological control agents have been released to manage the water hyacinth, Pontederia (Eichhornia) crassipes (C. Martius) Solms-Laubach (Pontederiaceae). They include two Eccritotarsus sources from Brazil and Peru. Distinguishing features between the two were found, necessitating their redescription. The Brazil source remained Eccritotarsus catarinensis (Carvalho), whereas the Peru source is Eccritotarsus eichhorniae Henry. Our objectives in this laboratory study were to assess the mate choice in the two species and, thus, determine which species performs better than the other. Mate choice in the form of no-choice, bichoice, and multichoice tests were conducted within and between species in a 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 sex ratios. The E. catarinensis pair had short copula latency but long copula duration in multichoice experiments, whereas the E. eichhorniae pair had short copula latency but long copula duration in no-choice experiments. In no-choice and bichoice experiments, E. eichhorniae♀ and E. eichhorniae♂ outcompeted E. catarinensis♀ and E. catarinensis♂. In multichoice experiments, E. catarinensis♂ outcompeted E. eichhorniae♂, whereas E. eichhorniae♀ outcompeted E. catarinensis♀. Despite being shown to be more fecund, E. eichhorniae is likely not to outcompete E. catarinensis where the two species co-occur and that E. catarinensis♂ and E. eichhorniae♀ will outcompete their counterparts. Previous research indicated that when E. catarinensis♂ and E. eichhorniae♀ are crossed, they produce few offspring, underscoring the need to confirm if the two species will coexist, compete, or displace each other in their natural habitats. Our findings further support that prezygotic reproductive isolation mechanisms led to the speciation of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEccritotarsus catarinensis 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aPontederia 3abiological control 3amating behavior 3aprogeny 3aredescriptions 3areproductive isolation 3aBrazil 3aPeru 3aSouth Africa 0awater hyacinth 0amate choice 0aprezygotic reproductive isolation mechanisms 0acopula latency 0aduration1 aPeter Heshula, Lelethu Unathi-Nkosi0 tJournal of entomological science.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 57, no. 2 p.267-280dGeorgia Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl43038x0749-80047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18474/JES21-393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017400157300001800331520076500349592002801114650001401142650001301156650001101169650001701180650001301197650001101210650001701221650001401238650001101252700002101263700001601284773013401300856007401434852000901508655001201517IND60617783920221119155531.0181026e20180726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061778392DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04562c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuz, Ignacio10aTransformation of single MOF nanocrystals into single nanostructured catalysts within mesoporous supports: a platform for pioneer fluidized-nanoreactor hydrogen carriers  ap. 8462-8465.  aWell-dispersed nanostructured catalysts along mesoporous materials have been systematically prepared via a novel multistep approach involving either the pyrolysis under nitrogen, the calcination under oxygen or the reduction under hydrogen of MOF nanocrystals decorated with transition metal complexes and previously confined within the mesoporous cavities via novel solid state synthesis.

Five test diets had similar protein and lipid levels (42 % crude protein and 8.5 % crude lipid), control diet without U. lactuca meal, four diets were added 5, 10, 15, and 20 % U. lactuca meal to investigate the effects of U. lactuca on growth performance, carcass composition, and enzyme activities of the fish. Each diet was assigned to triplicate groups of 30 fish for 60 days in 15 floating sea cages. At the end of feeding trail, final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) of the fish fed 5 % UL diet were significantly higher than that of 10 and 20 % groups (P < 0.05). Pepsin activities in the stomach were significantly suppressed for the fish received 20 % U. lactuca diet (P < 0.05), lipase activity in stomach and intestinal decreased with increasing U. lactuca inclusion level in diet. The enzyme activities of aspartate amino transferase (AST) in liver and alanine amino transferase (ALT) in serum increased significantly from 5 to 20 % U. lactuca level (P < 0.05). These results indicate that incorporation of the U. lactuca in the diet at 5 % for juvenile white spotted snapper does beneficial effects on the growth performance but higher level of incorporation reduce fish performance and physiological state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLutjanus 3aUlva lactuca 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acages 3acarcass composition 3acrude protein 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3alipids 3aliver 3apepsin 3aphysiological state 3asnapper 3aspecific growth rate 3astomach 3aweight gain1 aWen, Xiaobo1 aXuan, Xiongzhi1 aLi, Shengkang1 aLi, Yuanyou0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2016 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.703-711dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0545-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245003900209520102200248592002801270650002301298650001501321650001401336650001101350650002001361650000901381650001901390650001601409650002201425653002201447653001801469653001301487653002901500653003301529700006401562700002001626773010201646856008701748852000901835655001201844IND60653774920221122000812.0190801e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065377492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1063882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuaas, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0812-882910aInsurance value of natural capital  aNature-based solutions to insurance are in high demand. We explore the idea that natural capital has an insurance value insofar as it can mitigate the effects of uncertainty on human well-being. We present a formal model that substantiates this claim. We propose a definition for the insurance value of natural capital for a stochastic and dynamic ecosystem that provides ecosystem services for a risk-averse user. The insurance value of natural capital depends on the properties of ecosystem dynamics as well as on the risk and time preferences of the ecosystem user. It can be positive or negative. We relate the natural insurance value to conservative use of the ecosystem and precautionary investment in the natural capital stock. For the case of logarithmic per-period utility we find that optimal management becomes more conservative with increasing uncertainty if and only if the insurance value of natural capital is positive. We qualify this finding for more general forms of the per-period utility function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ainsurance 3amodels 3anatural capital 3arisk 3asocial welfare 3auncertainty 3autility functions 0aNatural insurance 0aRisk aversion 0aPrudence 0aPrecautionary investment 0aEcological-economic modeling1 aBaumgärtner, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8314-84621 aDe Lara, Michel0 tEcological economics.g2019 Nov., v. 165 p.106388-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1063883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011400174520098900288592002801277650002101305650001101326650003401337650001501371650001401386650002201400653003701422653001501459653000901474700003601483700003001519700001801549773011401567856008401681852000901765655001201774IND60776013020221118085501.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077601302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2022.1064762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Flores, Roberto10aMicrobiome analysis from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues: Current challenges and future perspectives  aFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues stored in thousands of human and animal pathology laboratories around the globe represent mines of stored genetic information. In recent years, the use of FFPE tissues as a viable source of DNA for diverse genetic studies has attracted attention for interrogating microbiomes from this sample type. These studies have proven that 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing-based microbiome studies are possible from FFPE samples but present some particular challenges. In this review, we summarize all aspects of microbiome studies from FFPE tissues including the challenges associated with working highly degraded DNA, best practices for reducing environmental contamination, and we propose solutions to address these issues. Finally, we discuss how the combination of FFPE microbiome studies and Laser Capture Microdissection and/or Laser Microdissection could enable to determine the spatial heterogeneity underlying complex bacterial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3ahumans 3alaser capture microdissection 3amicrobiome 3apollution 3aspatial variation 0aformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 0aMicrobiome 0aFFPE1 aLópez-Carvallo, Jesús Antonio1 aCáceres-Martínez, Jorge1 aDhar, Arun K.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2022 May, v. 196 p.106476-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2022.1064763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245016900190300001400359520163200373592002802005650001402033650001502047650003802062650001002100650001302110650002102123650002602144650001902170650001902189650001302208650001602221650002502237650001202262650001202274650003402286650007102320650007802391650001102469650005702480650001102537650000902548650007902557650002602636650003802662650003002700651001302730651001502743651000902758651003302767700001702800700001902817700001802836700001902854700001802873700001902891773009402910856004803004852000903052655001203061IND50071834720221120073225.0140113e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007183472DNAL7 a238846352pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1795-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Christopher10aRetrospective serosurveillance of bovine norovirus (GIII.2) and nebovirus in cattle from selected feedlots and a veal calf farm in 1999 to 2001 in the United States  ap. 83-90.  aThere is a dearth of information on the seroprevalence of bovine norovirus (BoNoV) and nebovirus in cattle of the US. In this retrospective study, serum IgG antibodies to two bovine enteric caliciviruses, GIII.2 BoNoV (Bo/CV186-OH/00/US) and genetically and antigenically distinct nebovirus (Bo/NB/80/US), were evaluated in feedlot and veal calves from different regions of the US during 1999-2001. Three groups of 6- to 7-month-old feedlot calves from New Mexico (NM) (n=103), Arkansas (AR) (n=100) and Ohio (OH) (n=140) and a group of 7- to 10-day-old Ohio veal calves (n=47) were studied. Serum samples were collected pre-arrival or at arrival to the farms for the NM, AR and OH calves and 35 days after arrival for all groups for monitoring seroconversion rates during the period. Virus-like particles of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US and Bo/NB/80/US were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and were used in ELISA to measure antibodies. A high seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 78-100 % was observed for antibodies to GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus, respectively, in the feedlot calves tested. In the Ohio veal farm, an antibody seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 40-66 % was found for GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus, respectively. Increased seropositive rates of 38-85 % for GIII.2 BoNoV and 26-83 % for nebovirus were observed at 35 days after arrival and commingling on farms for all groups. Infection of calves with either GIII.2 BoNoV or nebovirus, or both viruses, appeared to be common in the regions studied in the US during 1999-2001. These two viruses likely remain endemic because no commercial vaccines are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aantibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3afeedlots 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aretrospective studies 3aseroconversion 3aseroprevalence 3avaccines 3aveal calves 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aCaliciviridaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxvirology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNorovirusxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSentinel Surveillancexveterinary 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 3aArkansas 3aNew Mexico 3aOhio 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aJung, Kwonil1 aHan, Myung-Guk1 aHoet, Armando1 aScheuer, Kelly1 aWang, Qiuhong1 aSaif, Linda J.0 tArchives of virology.g2014 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.83-90dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1795-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245008800206300001800294520063400312592002800946650002500974650002300999650001801022650001301040650001401053650001601067650003701083700001401120700001501134700001701149700002001166700001401186700001201200700001501212773013401227856007401361852000901435655001201444IND60617784020221119155150.0181026e20180731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061778402DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04574g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhangThese two authors contributed equally to this work., Xun10aUnexpected refacetting of palladium nanoparticles under atmospheric N₂ conditions  ap. 8587-8590.  aWe demonstrate an unexpected refacetting process of Pd nanoparticles, induced by N₂ under atmospheric pressure at elevated temperatures, by in situ TEM observations. The morphology changes, with a notable increase in the fraction of Pd{110} facets, were visualized by atomic-scale TEM images and further explained by theoretical calculations. Firm evidence and rational understanding revealed that the “inert” gas N₂ has the ability to modify the structure of metal nanoparticles. This surprising effect should be considered seriously in vast chemical applications that use N₂ as a carrier gas or protective atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3achemical reactions 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apalladium 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMeng, Jun1 aZhu, Beien1 aYuan, Wentao1 aYang, Hangsheng1 aZhang, Ze1 aGao, Yi1 aWang, Yong0 tChemical communications.g2018 July 31, v. 54, no. 62 p.8587-8590dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc04574g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006400160300001800224500001500242520111100257592002801368650002601396650002101422650002501443650002001468650001501488650004301503650002101546650000901567650003701576650002401613650001701637650002701654650001201681650002801693650002401721650001701745700002101762700002001783773012601803856007401929852000902003655001202012IND60719115420221121204030.0201126e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071911542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo01975e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Kaho10a6-Paradol and its glucoside improve memory disorder in mice  ap. 9892-9902.  agolden set  aIn this study, the effects of 6-paradol (6P) and 6-paradol-β-glucoside (6PG) on neuritogenesis were investigated using PC12 cells. Treatment with 200 μM 6P or 6PG and nerve growth factor (NGF) (5 ng mL⁻¹) increased the number of elongated dendritic cells 8.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, compared to that with NGF (5 ng mL⁻¹) treatment alone. 6P and 6PG did not stimulate the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) pathway as their activities were suppressed by the pathway inhibitor, k252a. 6P enhanced Ca²⁺ influx into the cells, whereas 6PG had no effect on Ca²⁺ influx, although it stimulated PC12 cell differentiation. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 6PG in PC12 culture medium suggested that 6PG was deglycosylated to generate 6P, which exhibited the effect. Furthermore, the bioactivities of 6P and 6PG were investigated in mice, and the results revealed that they ameliorated short-term memory loss in animals during behavioral testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3abinding proteins 3acell differentiation 3adendritic cells 3aglucosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amemory disorders 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anerve growth factor 3aneurogenesis 3aneuroprotective effect 3aphenols 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atropomyosins1 aMitsunaga, Tohru1 aYamauchi, Kosei0 tFood & function.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 11 p.9892-9902dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01975e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01947naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002300150245014000173300001600313520085900329592002801188650001101216650001001227650000901237650001401246650000801260650001901268650001101287700002201298700001601320700001901336700002301355700002201378773009001400856008601490852000901576655001201585IND4444564720221121202144.0141111e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444456472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Donna, Leonardo10aRecycling of industrial essential oil waste: Brutieridin and Melitidin, two anticholesterolaemic active principles from bergamot albedo  ap. 438-441.  aBergamot albedo, the white tissues between the skin and the pulp, is a polluting waste in the production of the renowned fragrance and is easily available by simple industrial processes. Brutieridin and melitidin are found in bergamot albedo and possess statin-like activity. Their anticholesterolaemic effect has been proved in vitro. Different procedures were exploited to assay the presence of brutieridin and melitidin and to evaluate their availability in water extracts. The best results in terms of simplicity and accessibility of the method were obtained with hot water at 65°C. Interestingly, tea beverages enriched with the two active principles have been obtained by simple addition of dried albedo into commercial tea bags. This is the first report on the availability of methodologies to extract active principles from citrus albedo wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aodors 3apulp 3arecycling 3atea 3atea (beverage) 3awastes1 aGallucci, Giselda1 aMalaj, Naim1 aRomano, Elvira1 aTagarelli, Antonio1 aSindona, Giovanni0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 125, no. 2 p.438-441dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245006500166300001600231520123500247592002801482650002101510650002201531650001301553650000901566650002501575650001201600650001901612650001001631650001501641650001301656650001401669650001601683650001101699650000901710650002001719650001401739650001401753650001601767700001901783700002301802700002101825700002501846773010301871856008201974852000902056655001202065IND4469743920221121033259.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446974392DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2012.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Ovidio, Dario10aSubcutaneous Liposarcoma in a Ferret (Mustela putorius furo)  ap. 238-242.  aA 6-year-old spayed female ferret (Mustela putorius furo) exhibiting clinical signs of weakness, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, and frequent urination was presented for a veterinary evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the aforementioned abnormal behavior and clinical condition. Physical examination revealed a large, firm, painless, movable subcutaneous mass at the base of the tail. Radiographic and ultrasound images confirmed the presence of a soft tissue mass compressing the sacrococcygeal vertebrae, but there was no evidence of metastatic lesions. Because of the poor prognosis and progressive deterioration of the animal's clinical condition, the ferret was humanely euthanized. Gross necropsy revealed a 4 × 4 × 3.5 cm, firm, yellow-tan, ovoid, subcutaneous mass wrapped around the rectum and the anus. The mass did not appear to breach the serosa. Evaluation of the abdominal cavity revealed a pale yellow liver, possibly associated with hepatic lipidosis with no gross evidence of metastasis in the body cavity. The histopathological features of the mass were consistent with a liposarcoma. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of subcutaneous liposarcoma reported in a ferret.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal cavity 3aabnormal behavior 3aanorexia 3aanus 3aclinical examination 3aferrets 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3ametastasis 3anecropsy 3aprognosis 3aradiography 3aserosa 3atail 3aultrasonography 3aurination 3avertebrae 3aweight loss1 aRossi, Giacomo1 aMelidone, Raffaele1 aMenna, Francesca1 aFioretti, Alessandro0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2012 July, v. 21, no. 3 p.238-242dElsevier Inc.x1557-50637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2012.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015800167300001400325520168100339592002802020650000802048650002302056650002102079650002102100650002102121650001802142650001802160650001902178650002302197650001302220650002002233650002202253650002402275650002702299650000902326650001402335650004702349650001102396650002002407650000902427650001802436650001602454700002202470700002102492773008002513856008102593852000902674655001202683IND60121080320221122023503.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012108032DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-014-0107-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSāha, Saumena,10aMolecular and phytochemical analyses to assess genetic stability in alginate-encapsulated microshoots of Ocimum gratissimum L. following in vitro storage  ap. 33-43.  aAn efficient protocol was developed for short term storage and conservation of Ocimum gratissimum L., using encapsulated micro shoots. The encapsulation of micro shoots was significantly affected by the concentrations of sodium alginate and calcium chloride. A gelling matrix of 3 % sodium alginate and 75 mM calcium chloride was found most suitable for formation of ideal calcium alginate beads. Re-growth ability of encapsulated shoot tips explant was evaluated after storage at 4 and 25 °C for 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days. Preservation at 25 °C being significantly more resistant compared to that stored in 4 °C. Maximum shoot re-growth (98.62 %) was recorded on 0.8 % agar solidified full strength MS basal medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/l BA. Micro shoots, recovered from encapsulated shoot tips (capsule) were best rooted on ½ MS medium containing 1.5 mg/l IBA. Complete plantlets (with shoot and root) were transferred to plastic pots containing soil: vermiculite (1:1) showed 83.31 % survival rate in field condition. The genetic stability of synseed-derived plantlets (following 4 and 25 °C of storage) was assessed and compared with mother plant using two PCR based molecular markers namely random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR). Both types of markers revealed high degree of monomorphism, similar to those of the mother plants. Essential oil composition of the synseed-derived plants and the mother plant were determined by GC-FID analysis and insignificant differences were found in the oil composition, thereby confirming the stability of plants derived from synthetic seeds following short term storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOcimum gratissimum 3aartificial seeds 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3aculture media 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography 3agelation 3agenetic markers 3agenetic stability 3aindole butyric acid 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoils 3aplantlets 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ashoots 3asodium alginate 3asoil 3asurvival rate 3avermiculite1 aSengupta, Chandan1 aGhosh, Parthadeb0 tNucleus.g2014 Apr., v. 57, no. 1 p.33-43dSpringer-Verlagx0029-568X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13237-014-0107-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245014200175300001600317520145800333592002801791650002301819650002401842650001501866650001101881650000801892650001001900650000901910650001201919650001701931650001101948650001401959650001101973650001601984653002802000653001802028653001002046653000902056700003802065700002702103700002902130700003502159700002602194773014202220856007402362852000902436655001202445IND60772071520221120043652.0220331e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077207152DNAL7 a10.18474/JES21-532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Rivera, Sandra Edith10aTemperature-Mortality Response of Eggs, Larvae, Protonymphs, Deutonymphs, and Adult Females of Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae)  ap. 248-257.  aThe two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is one of the most important pests of cultivated plants. Its control is mainly based on the application of acaricides with concomitant adverse environmental and human health effects. Consequently, we examined the potential of using temperature as an alternative. To that end, we conducted bioassays of the temperature-mortality response of eggs, larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and adult females of T. urticae. Groups of 20 individuals from each stage were placed on 4-cm diameter bean leaf (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) discs. A stream of air at the designated temperature was passed over the disc at a rate of 3.7 ± 1 m s–¹) for 2 ± 1 s. Mortality was evaluated at 24 h (larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and female) or 72 h (egg) after exposure. Based on preliminary mortality responses, we selected 10 temperatures with a response range between 0 and 100% mortality. Those were 30, 35, 40, 45, 47, 50, 53, 55, 60, and 65°C [SD, ± 1.5 for each]). In total, 30 replications were conducted, and each repetition included these temperatures and untreated controls. The median lethal temperature ranged from 41.8°C for adult females to 46.9°C for eggs. The lethal temperature to kill 95% of the exposed individuals ranged from 55°C for females to 62.5°C for eggs. There were no survivors at 65°C (eggs), 60°C (larva, protonymph, and deutonymph), or 55°C (adult females).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacaricides 3aadults 3aair 3abeans 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahuman health 3aleaves 3amortality 3anymphs 3atemperature 0atwo-spotted spider mite 0aTetranychidae 0aAcari 0amite1 aRodríguez-Maciel, J.

However, sustainable hydrogen production remains challenging. The most elegant approach is to utilize photosynthesis for water splitting and to subsequently save solar energy as hydrogen. Cyanobacteria and green algae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms that contain hydrogenases and thereby possess the enzymatic equipment for photosynthetic hydrogen production. These features of cyanobacteria and algae have inspired artificial and semi-artificial in vitro techniques, that connect photoexcited materials or enzymes with hydrogenases or mimics of these for hydrogen production. These in vitro methods have on their part been models for the fusion of cyanobacterial and algal hydrogenases to photosynthetic photosystem I (PSI) in vivo, which recently succeeded as proofs of principle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3abiotechnology 3acoal 3aequipment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar energy 3avision 0acyanobacteria 0agreen algae 0asolar hydrogen1 aAppel, Jens1 aBoehm, Marko1 aSchuhmann, Wolfgang1 aNowaczyk, Marc M.1 aYacoby, Iftach1 aGutekunst, Kirstin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4366-423X0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2022, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2022.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245013600199506007600335520130400411592002801715506003701743650001301780650001201793650001801805650001901823650000801842650002001850650001001870651001201880700001801892700001901910700001601929700001701945773012401962856007402086852000902160655001202169IND60674538620221207110826.0191025e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067453862DNAL7 a10.3390/nu111022612doi7 aPMC68356452pmcid7 a315469942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKS, Salminen 10aEnergy Intake and Severity of Dementia Are Both Associated with Health-Related Quality of Life among Older Long-Term Care Residents  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur aim was to investigate how energy intake modifies the association of the stage of dementia with health related quality of life (HRQoL) among institutionalized older people. A cross-sectional sample of 538 older long-term care residents with dementia in Helsinki, Finland were assessed with HRQoL (15D), energy intake (from one to two days), and the stage of dementia by the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. The energy intakes were standardized by z-scores to include both men and women in the same analyses. Severity of dementia was associated with HRQoL (15D index in CDR 0.5&ndash;1: 0.65 (0.11), CDR 2: 0.60 (0.10), CDR 3: 0.52 (0.10)). When the three groups of dementia severity were divided according to their energy intake quartiles, there was an association between the HRQoL and the stage of dementia (p < 0.001) and energy intake (p = 0.013); however, no interaction was observed (p = 0.30). While partial correlation analysis showed that energy intake correlated with HRQoL among residents with very mild/mild or moderate dementia, this was not observed among those with severe dementia. In moderate dementia, the dimensions of mobility and usual activities correlated significantly with higher energy intake. Both energy intake and severity of dementia are associated with HRQoL.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adementia 3aelderly 3aenergy intake 3along term care 3amen 3aquality of life 3awomen 3aFinland1 aMH, Suominen 1 aH, Kautiainen 1 aHM, Roitto 1 aKH, Pitkala 0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu111022613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008200167300001600249500001500265520136500280592002801645650001901673650001901692650001001711650002201721650002101743650001001764650002001774650001501794650001701809650001701826650001701843650002101860651001001881653001501891653001801906653002301924653001801947653002501965653004001990653003602030653001802066700001902084700001602103700001502119700001802134773010502152856005102257852000902308655001202317IND50087623820221120123219.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008762382DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2011.6027262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Li-Wei10aComparison of ecological patterns of polypores in three forest zones in China  ap. 260-275.  a2019-12-05  aPolypores produce poroid basidiocarps and have the capacity to degrade lignocelluloses. Their ecological patterns are generally related to the type of forest ecosystem. Here, we investigated diversity and preferences for hosts and substrates for polypores from a boreal forest zone, a temperate and warm temperate forest zone, and a tropical and subtropical forest zone in China. The tropical and subtropical forest zone harbored the highest polypore diversity. The temperate and warm temperate forest zone showed a greater similarity of polypore diversity to the boreal forest zone than to the tropical or subtropical forest zone, although the representative areas of temperate and warm temperate forest and tropical and subtropical forest zones are geographically closer. The species number and proportion of brown rot polypores decreased from the boreal forest to tropical and subtropical forest zone by 22 and 21.8%, respectively. Fallen trunks were the most attractive substrate for polypores in all three zones, but the proportion of polypores on fallen trunks decreased from the boreal forest to tropical and subtropical forest zone by 20%. Generally, these distinctions could be explained by the varied proportion of gymnosperm and angiosperm trees, as well as different substrate diversity in the three forest zones with different climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3alignocellulose 3aboreal forests 3ahosts 3atemperate forests 3atropical forests 3atrees 3atemperate zones 3aecosystems 3aforest types 3aGymnospermae 3aAngiospermae 3aclimatic factors 3aChina 0ahost range 0aConiferophyta 0apolypore diversity 0aMagnoliophyta 0asubstrate preference 0atemperate and warm temperate forest 0atropical and subtropical forest 0aboreal forest1 aHao, Zhan-Qing1 aWang, Zheng1 aWang, Bing1 aDai, Yu-Cheng0 tMycology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 2, no. 4 p.260-275dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2011.602726  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245020100169300001600370520141500386592002801801650001001829650002001839650001401859650001401873650001401887650002701901650002901928650001301957650001801970650001801988650001802006650001702024650001102041650001102052650000902063650001102072650002202083650001602105650001902121650002402140650002102164653004602185653003602231653003202267653002302299653003402322653003102356700001802387700001702405773010802422856008502530852000902615655001202624IND60561301920221119211857.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056130192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLikozar, Blaž10aTransesterification of oil to biodiesel in a continuous tubular reactor with static mixers: Modelling reaction kinetics, mass transfer, scale-up and optimization considering fatty acid composition  ap. 326-336.  aSimulations of the methanolysis of lipids in a mixer-packed bed heterogeneous flow process were performed based on the thermodynamics (equilibrium) as well as mechanism and chemical kinetics of glycerides and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) containing different combinations of gadoleic (G), linoleic (L), linolenic (Ln), oleic (O), palmitic (P) and stearic (S) acids, bonded as glycerol (alcohol) substituents. Transport phenomena and fluid dynamics were established for emulsion interface films and through axial dispersion coefficients (Péclet number) in a fixed bed for both transient and stationary operation. Alcoholysis was also studied experimentally within a broad range of temperatures, hydrodynamic conditions in terms of volumetric flow rates, phase ratios and base catalyst concentrations. Diffusion resistance proved to be negligible, temperature was proven as a prevalent factor, while steady state was reached only after a few residence times elapsed. Process economics were finally evaluated in terms of cost and price breakdown, allowing methodology extension to other waste oil resources. Sensitivity analysis revealed high LLL triglyceride content in oil having the greatest positive, and OOL negative effect on FAME yield. Process intensification with static mixers was proven feasible upon scaling-up from 5 to 10mm internal diameter with no deterioration in overall process progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadverse effects 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aemulsions 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aglycerol 3ahydrodynamics 3alipid content 3amass transfer 3amethanolysis 3amixers 3amodels 3aoils 3aprices 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols 0aBiodiesel production process optimization 0aReaction mechanism and kinetics 0aMass transfer and diffusion 0aMathematical model 0aWaste oil transesterification 0aRenewable energy and fuels1 aPohar, Andrej1 aLevec, Janez0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 Feb., v. 142 p.326-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245012200202300001800324500001900342520144400361592002801805650002501833650002601858650002501884650001101909650001501920650001401935650002901949700005901978700001102037700001602048700005402064700005602118700005402174773012802228856008402356852000902440655001202449IND60699007220210419000000.0200616e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069900722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c001112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiva, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0054-413110aCapability of CI-Orbitrap for Gas-Phase Analysis in Atmospheric Chemistry: A Comparison with the CI-APi-TOF Technique  ap. 8142-8150.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChemical ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometry (CI-Orbitrap) represents a promising new technique for gas-phase analysis in analytical and atmospheric chemistry mainly due to its very high mass resolving power. In this work, we performed the first side-by-side comparison between a CI-Orbitrap and the widely used atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CI-APi-TOF) using two different chemical ionization methods, i.e., acetate-ion-based (CH₃COO–) and aminium-ion-based (n-C₃H₇NH₃⁺) schemes. The capability of the CI-Orbitrap at accurately measuring low concentrations of gaseous species formed from the oxidation of α-pinene was explored. Although this study reveals a lack of linearity of the CI-Orbitrap when measuring product ions at very low concentrations (<1 × 10⁶ molecules cm–³), very good agreement between both techniques can be achieved by applying a newly developed linearity correction. It is experimentally shown that the correction function is independent of the reagent ion used. Thus, accurate quantification of organic compounds at concentrations as low as 1 × 10⁵ molecules cm–³ by the CI-Orbitrap can be achieved. Finally, by means of tandem mass spectrometry, the unique capability of the Orbitrap allows the direct determination of the binding energy of cluster ions between analyte and reagent ions, that is needed for the assessment of a chosen ionization scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aatmospheric pressure 3aenergy 3aionization 3aoxidation 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aBrüggemann, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2106-96911 aLi, D.1 aPerrier, S.1 aGeorge, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1578-70561 aHerrmann, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7044-21011 aBerndt, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2014-60180 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 May 13, v. 92, no. 12 p.8142-8150dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c001113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100001800185245014700203300001200350506007600362520189400438592002802332506003702360650001102397650002102408650002502429650002002454650000902474650001602483650001702499650002702516650001002543650002502553650001102578650001802589650001802607650002202625700001602647773009602663856004502759852000902804655001202813IND50058768520221207082423.0121003e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005876852DNAL7 a216636412pmid7 aPMC31327042pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-8-362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRett, Brian S10aIncreasing dietary linoleic acid does not increase tissue arachidonic acid content in adults consuming Western-type diets: a systematic review  ap. 335.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Linoleic acid, with a DRI of 12-17 g/d, is the most highly consumed polyunsaturated fatty acid in the Western diet and is found in virtually all commonly consumed foods. The concern with dietary linoleic acid, being the metabolic precursor of arachidonic acid, is its consumption may enrich tissues with arachidonic acid and contribute to chronic and overproduction of bioactive eicosanoids. However, no systematic review of human trials regarding linoleic acid consumption and subsequent changes in tissue levels of arachidonic acid has been undertaken. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we reviewed the human literature that reported changes in dietary linoleic acid and its subsequent impact on changing tissue arachidonic acid in erythrocytes and plasma/serum phospholipids. DESIGN: We identified, reviewed, and evaluated all peer-reviewed published literature presenting data outlining changes in dietary linoleic acid in adult human clinical trials that reported changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition (specifically arachidonic acid) in plasma/serum and erythrocytes within the parameters of our inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Decreasing dietary linoleic acid by up to 90% was not significantly correlated with changes in arachidonic acid levels in the phospholipid pool of plasma/serum (p = 0.39). Similarly, when dietary linoleic acid levels were increased up to six fold, no significant correlations with arachidonic acid levels were observed (p = 0.72). However, there was a positive relationship between dietary gamma-linolenic acid and dietary arachidonic acid on changes in arachidonic levels in plasma/serum phospholipids. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the concept that modifying current intakes of dietary linoleic acid has an effect on changing levels of arachidonic acid in plasma/serum or erythrocytes in adults consuming Western-type diets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aarachidonic acid 3abioactive properties 3aclinical trials 3adiet 3aeicosanoids 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acid composition 3afoods 3agamma-linolenic acid 3ahumans 3alinoleic acid 3aphospholipids 3asystematic review1 aWhelan, Jay0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.335-335dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-8-36  aDNAL 7aarticle04078naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010500172520241100277592002802688650002002716650002602736650002302762650001602785650001902801650001202820650001602832650001802848650001102866650001902877650001202896650002302908650002102931650001302952650001502965650001702980650001502997650001703012650002803029650002103057650001403078650001003092653000803102653000703110653001803117653001203135653001203147653001203159653001603171653003403187653002403221700002503245773012603270856008303396852000903479655001203488IND60776013620221118085527.0220531e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077601362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwodele, Stephen O.10aSoil biota legacies of alfalfa production vary with field conditions and among varieties and species  aPlants can have strong effects on soil biota and thus subsequent plant growth in those soils. In agroecosystems, these microbe-mediated plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) can have strong positive or negative effects on subsequent crop growth, but how multiple factors including the identity of the species involved, crop diversity and soil characteristics influence PSF is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we focus on alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the globally most common forage legume. We sampled plants and soils from 24 alfalfa stands evenly split between alfalfa monocultures and grass-alfalfa mixtures of varying ages. Using the soils from these sites, we conducted an experiment to quantify how the conditioning plant community and soil characteristics altered PSF effects on four alfalfa varieties and five additional native and non-native grass and legume forage species. Alfalfa monocultures generated more negative PSF than mixtures overall, indicating dilution of antagonistic soil biota in more diverse stands. Differences among varieties and species were idiosyncratic: one alfalfa variety had positive PSF in mixture soils, whereas one legume species (Trifolium pratense) had positive PSF in monoculture and another (Onobrychis viciifolia) had positive PSF in mixture. Among varieties, PSFs were mediated by soil texture, soil phosphorus, and alfalfa fiber content. Similarly, PSFs among species were mediated by alfalfa fiber and nitrogen content, stand age, plant species richness and weed abundance. These relationships, however, were highly dependent on the variety or species selected and whether the field was seeded to monoculture or mixture. Interestingly, PSFs of native species were negatively impacted by weed abundance, suggesting that weeds may have deleterious effects on native plants via soil biota legacies, thus limiting the utility of native species when reseeding pastures to restore productivity (i.e., pasture rejuvenation). Combined, these results show that the impacts of soil biota on crop productivity depend on previous cropping practices and the variety or species of subsequent crops. As plant-soil feedback is context dependent, variety and species selection combined with diversity-related management practices are critical for successful pasture rejuvenation. Such an approach may sustainably reduce the impact of negative soil biota in agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3aTrifolium pratense 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3aalfalfa 3aenvironment 3afiber content 3aforage 3aforage legumes 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3anitrogen content 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asoil biota 3asoil texture 3asoil-plant interactions 3aspecies richness 3astand age 3aweeds 0aPSF 0aPC 0aAgroecosystem 0aGrasses 0aLegumes 0aMixture 0aMonoculture 0aNative and non-native forages 0aPlant-soil feedback1 aBennett, Jonathan A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 335 p.107994-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03938naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002100172245011600193300001600309520159100325592002801916650001801944650003001962650002001992650001502012650001302027650002402040650002302064650001902087650001702106650001902123650001802142650002302160650002202183650001602205650001502221650001802236650001302254650002002267650005502287650003802342650001202380650003002392650002702422650002602449650004102475650005502516650001802571650002202589650001502611650002702626650003802653650006102691650003202752653002002784653001502804653002202819653001302841653001802854700002702872700002102899700002202920700002002942700002802962773010602990856008703096852000903183655001203192IND50066835920221120142436.0160902e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006683592DNAL7 a237077232pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouissi, Yasmine10aIdentification and ecotoxicity of degradation products of chloroacetamide herbicides from UV-treatment of water  ap. 527-534.  aThe widespread occurrence of chlorinated herbicides and their degradation products in the aquatic environment raises health and environmental concerns. As a consequence pesticides, and to a lesser degree their degradation products, are monitored by authorities both in surface waters and drinking waters. In this study the formation of degradation products from ultraviolet (UV) treatment of the three chloroacetamide herbicides acetochlor, alachlor and metolachlor and their biological effects were investigated. UV treatment is mainly used for disinfection in water and wastewater treatments. First, the chemical structures of the main UV-degradation products were identified using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The main transformation reactions were dechlorination, mono- and multi-hydroxylation and cyclizations.The ecotoxicity of the mixed photoproducts formed by UV-treatment until 90% of the original pesticide was converted was compared to the toxicity of chloroacetamides using the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacean Daphnia magna and the marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri as test organisms. UV-treatment of alachlor and metolachlor increased the toxicity compared to the parent compounds while an equal toxicity was found for photolysis products of acetochlor. This suggests that toxic photodegradation products are generated from chloroacetamides under UV-treatment. An important perspective of this finding is that the photolysis products are at least as toxic as the parent compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacetochlor 3aalachlor 3aaquatic environment 3achemical structure 3adechlorination 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3aecotoxicology 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametolachlor 3aphotolysis 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 2aAcetamidesxanalysisxradiation effectsxtoxicity. 2aAliivibrio fischerixdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChlorophytaxdrug effects 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxradiation effectsxtoxicity. 2aHydroxylation 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPhotolysis 2aSolid Phase Extraction 2aUltraviolet Raysxadverse effects 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aChloroacetamide 0aPhotolysis 0aMass spectrometry 0aToxicity 0aPhotoproducts1 aBouchonnet, Stéphane,1 aBourcier, Sophie1 aKusk, Kresten Ole1 aSablier, Michel1 aAndersen, Henrik Rasmus0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 458-460 p.527-534dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245008400200300001800284520109800302592002801400650002201428650001201450650001701462650001901479650002001498700001701518700002201535700005301557700005701610700005701667700005801724773017101782856008101953852000902034655001202043IND60772072020221120051446.0220331e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077207202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c044992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuai, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1440-498410aStructural Design and Performance of a Jet-Impinging Type Microbubble Generator  ap. 4445-4459.  aA jet-impinging type microbubble generator is designed, including a liquid nozzle and a gas nozzle with the disc-baffle closely arranged along the same axis. When the disc-baffle diameter is greater than the jet width at the gas nozzle position, the impingement zone and radial wall-jet region are formed, thereby promoting the generation and dispersion of microbubbles. As the dissipation rate in the impingement zone increases, the mean bubble diameter decreases, and the number fraction of microbubbles increases. The bubble radial dispersion width is dependent on the radial wall-jet velocity and the time for the bubble to follow the radial wall-jet. Reducing the surface tension is beneficial to the generation of microbubbles but has little effect on the state or width of the microbubble dispersion. Empirical correlations for predicting the d₃₂ and dispersion width are proposed, and the relative error is less than 20%. The results show that the jet-impinging type microbubble generator has better energy efficiency than most bubble generating systems reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aliquids 3amicrobubbles 3aprocess design 3asurface tension1 aWang, Xinyan1 aHuang, Zhengliang1 aYang, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3611-28591 aSun, Jingyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8876-99511 aWang, Jingdai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8594-42861 aYang, Yongrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5598-69250 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 61, no. 12 p.4445-4459dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c044993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001400285520155900299592002801858650002201886650001201908650001601920650001201936650001001948650001301958650001001971650001801981650001601999650001202015650001302027650004102040650000902081650001602090700002002106700002002126700001902146700002302165700002002188700002002208773010402228856008602332852000902418655001202427IND60611417120221120211504.0181025e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061141712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolley, Amanda10aInhibition of lysine-specific demethylase enzyme disrupts sexually conditioned mate guarding in the female rat  ap. 78-83.  aAlthough female rats are typically described as having a promiscuous mating strategy, if sexually naïve females have their formative sexually rewarding experiences paired with the same male, they will recognize that male and display mate-guarding behavior towards him in the presence of a female competitor. Female rats that display mate guarding behavior also show enhanced activation of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Here, we examined the potential role that histone demethylation might have in establishing this pair-bonded behavior, and whether the corresponding changes in oxytocin and vasopressin neuronal activation depended on demethylation. To accomplish this, we examined the effect of a lysine-specific demethylase-1 inhibitor to block the action of demethylase enzymes and maintain the methylation state of corresponding genes. Female rats treated with the demethylase inhibitor failed to show any measure of mate guarding, whereas females treated with vehicle displayed mate guarding behavior. Demethylase inhibitor treatment also blocked the ability of familiar male cues to activate oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, whereas vehicle-treated females showed this enhanced activation. These data indicate that histone demethylation is a crucial component in the epigenetic modification of neural circuitry that underlies conditioned mate guarding in female rats. These results are the first to demonstrate the role of histone demethylation underlying changes in mating strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3afemales 3agenes 3ahistones 3amales 3amate guarding 3amethylation 3aneurons 3aoxytocin 3aparaventricular hypothalamic nucleus 3arats 3avasopressin1 aJoulakian, Lara1 aWenzel, Kerstin1 aRoorda, Sieger1 aGonzalez, Brunella1 aSparks, Lindsay1 aPfaus, James G.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 196 p.78-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245008000171300001600251520136900267592002801636650002601664650002101690650001101711650001001722650001901732650001201751650002801763650001901791650001101810650001501821650001901836650002501855650001501880650002001895650001801915650000901933650001601942650001601958650001001974650001401984650001701998650001702015650001102032650001702043650001002060700002302070700002502093773010202118856008502220852000902305655001202314IND4459103420221121033452.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445910342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarkanis, Anestis10aCultivation of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.), a medicinal weed  ap. 825-830.  aMilk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.) is the most researched plant for the treatment of liver disease. Its therapeutic properties are due to the presence of silymarin, a mixture of three flavonolignans (silybin, silydianin and silycristin). The seeds contain the highest amount of silymarin, but the whole plant is used medicinally. Milk thistle is grown successfully on a range of soil types, from sandy soils to much heavier clay soils. Milk thistle is directly seeded in soils. Sowing occurs in autumn and spring, and row spacing is usually 40–75cm, with 20–30cm between plants in the row. Nutrient requirements of this crop are low to moderate since it is adapted to poor quality soils and many different growing conditions. A limiting factor in milk thistle production is weed interference. Pendimethalin and metribuzin herbicides are safe for weed control in milk thistle, both alone and in combination. Milk thistle is considered drought resistant and normal rainfall will often suffice. In a Mediterranean environment, under severe drought conditions, the crops should be irrigated during seed growth and filling. Moreover, a few varieties of milk thistle have been developed. The silymarin content most often ranges from 1.0% to 3.0% of achene dry matter but can exceed 8%. Efforts should be made to develop varieties with high silymarin content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aSilybum marianum 3aautumn 3acrops 3adirect seeding 3adrought 3afertilizer requirements 3afilling period 3afruits 3airrigation 3aliver diseases 3amedicinal properties 3ametribuzin 3amilk production 3apendimethalin 3arain 3arow spacing 3asandy soils 3aseeds 3asilymarin 3asoil quality 3asoil texture 3aspring 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aBilalis, Dimitrios1 aEfthimiadou, Aspasia0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 July, v. 34, no. 1 p.825-830dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007800158300001800236520087200254592002801126650001601154650002301170650002301193650002401216700002101240773013301261856007401394852000901468655001201477IND60617430420221120153155.0181025e20180308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061743042DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09122b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Anthony,10aRecent advances in molecular rearrangements involving aryne intermediates  ap. 2580-2594.  aThis Feature Article is aimed at highlighting the recent developments in the transition-metal-free molecular rearrangements involving arynes. The chemistry of arynes has shown incredible developments especially in transition-metal-free carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bond-forming reactions in the last three decades. The rapid growth in this field is mainly due to the development of mild methods for the generation of arynes. One aspect of the recent developments in the chemistry of arynes involves the molecular rearrangements proceeding via this electrophilic intermediate. The molecular rearrangements have provided direct access to a library of valuable molecules, which cannot be accessed in a single step through other synthetic routes. Herein, we present a concise account on the developments that occurred in this field over the last three decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical reactions 3areaction mechanisms1 aBiju, Akkattu T.0 tChemical communications.g2018 Mar. 8, v. 54, no. 21 p.2580-2594dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cc09122b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009400211300001600305520090400321592002801225650002401253650002101277650001201298651001201310653002801322653001701350653002101367653001201388653002201400653001701422700002001439773009801459856008501557852000901642655001201651IND60546892020221120030326.0160903e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054689202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFikar, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3885-930712aA matheuristic for routing real-world home service transport systems facilitating walking  ap. 300-310.  aThis paper provides a solution procedure for a state-dependent real-world routing and scheduling problem motivated by challenges faced in the urban home service industry. A transport service delivers staff members of different qualification levels to clients and picks them up after completion of their services. The possibility to walk to clients, interdependencies, time windows, assignment constraints as well as mandatory working time and break regulations are considered. The introduced matheuristic consists of two stages, identifying potential walking-routes and optimising the transport system. The presented numerical studies are performed with real-world based instances from the Austrian Red Cross, a major home health care provider in Austria. The results show that implementing walking and pooling of trips in solution procedures decreases the number of required vehicles substantially.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahealth care workers 3aservice industry 3awalking 3aAustria 0aVehicle routing problem 0aMatheuristic 0aHome health care 0aWalking 0aInterdependencies 0aTrip pooling1 aHirsch, Patrick0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 105 p.300-310dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009400173300001600267520131600283592002801599650001901627650001801646650001601664650002601680650001401706650001001720650001501730650001001745650001101755650001901766700002201785700002101807700002401828700002101852700001801873700001501891700001701906700001601923773008801939856008602027852000902113655001202122IND60089145620221122055952.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchembari, Clara10aImpact of a European directive on ship emissions on air quality in Mediterranean harbours  ap. 661-669.  aShips have been found to be major sources of air pollution in harbours. However, from January 1, 2010, a European Union directive requires that all ships at berth or anchorage in European harbours use fuels with a sulphur content of less than 0.1% by weight while previously, outside of Sulphur Emission Control Areas, up to 4.5% were allowed. The impact of this directive on air quality in some Mediterranean harbours was investigated based on observations made from August to October 2009 and 2010 at a monitoring station placed on a cruise ship, Costa Pacifica, following a fixed weekly route in the Western Mediterranean. The concentrations of SO₂ were found to decrease significantly from 2009 to 2010 in three out of the four EU harbours; the average decrease of the daily mean concentrations in the different harbours was 66%. The decrease of SO₂ was not statistically significant in the harbour of Barcelona because of large day-to-day variations, however measurements from monitoring stations in the harbour zone of Barcelona as well as downwind of the harbour of Palma de Mallorca confirm a strong decrease in the SO₂ concentrations from 2009 to 2010. No decrease was observed in the non-EU harbour of Tunis. Neither NOₓ nor BC concentrations showed significant changes in any of the harbours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3afuels 3amonitoring 3aships 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide1 aCavalli, Fabrizia1 aCuccia, Eleonora1 aHjorth, J.q(Jens),1 aCalzolai, Giulia1 aPérez, Noemi1 aPey, Jorge1 aPrati, Paolo1 aRaes, Frank0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 61 p.661-669dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03927naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245014100198506007600339520209800415592002802513506003702541650001102578650001302589650002102602650001402623650002802637650001502665650002402680650002302704650001202727650003102739650002102770650001102791650001002802650001702812650001302829650001502842650001502857650001902872650001902891650001302910651001002923700001602933700001702949700001602966700001702982700001502999700001403014700001503028700001603043700001603059700002003075773012303095856007403218852000903292655001203301IND60650623920221207072322.0190710e20181112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065062392DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101117332doi7 aPMC62662042pmcid7 a304244932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Weiyan10aNutrient Supplement Use among the Chinese Population: A Cross-Sectional Study of the 2010–2012 China Nutrition and Health Surveillance  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrient supplements play a key role in managing malnutrition/chronic diseases and are commonly used in the world, but few studies described the prevalence of nutrient supplement use at the national level in China. To our knowledge, this study provides the first detailed investigation of nutrient supplement use in a nationally representative sample of the Chinese population. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of the nutrient supplement use among the Chinese population aged 6 years or older in 2010&ndash;2012. A stratified multistage cluster sampling method was conducted to recruit participants from 150 surveillance sites. The demographic characteristics and information about nutrient supplement use were collected through an interview-administrative questionnaire. A total of 74,501 children and adults (excluding the pregnant women) were included in the study (mean age, 35.7 years; male, 47.0%, female, 53.5%). Only 0.71% of the participants reported using nutrient supplements in the previous month. Participants aged 6&ndash;11 years and 60 years and above, female, living in large urban, with higher education level and higher family incomes were more likely to use nutrient supplements than their counterparts (p < 0.05). The prevalence of nutrient supplement use increased with age in Chinese adults. The highest usage among the nutrient supplements was multi-vitamins and minerals with 0.37%. More females used single vitamin, multi-mineral, multi-vitamins and minerals than males (p < 0.05). The nutrient supplement use proportion was highest amongst the participants with a health problem, and the participants who had no idea about their health conditions were the least likely to use the nutrient supplements (p < 0.05). The prevalence of nutrient supplement use was low among the Chinese population in 2010&ndash;2012. Further research is required to understand the social cognition, usage reasons, dosage and consumption motivation of NS, and the relationships with health effects, to ensure that the nutrient supplements can be appropriately promoted in China.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3acognition 3across-sectional studies 3ademography 3adietary supplements 3aeducational status 3afemales 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahigher education 3aincome 3amales 3amalnutrition 3aminerals 3amonitoring 3amotivation 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3asampling 3aChina1 aLiu, Ailing1 aYao, Yecheng1 aMa, Yanning1 aDing, Caicui1 aSong, Chao1 aYuan, Fan1 aZhang, Yan1 aFeng, Ganyu1 aChen, Zheng1 aDing, Gangqiang0 tNutrients.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101117333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024002700159040001800186100001600204245011700220300001600337506007600353520147600429592002801905506003701933650002601970650002001996650002702016650001302043650002002056650001202076650001402088650002002102650003102122650001002153650003002163650001102193650001302204650001902217650001502236650002502251650003002276650001102306650002002317650002202337700001702359700001502376700001802391700001602409773011702425856007302542852000902615655001202624IND60114212420221207085614.0141112e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011421242DNAL7 a247124512pmid7 aPMC4192108 [Available on 12/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1111/mve.120562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFLEMING, A.10aTemporospatial fate of bacteria and immune effector expression in house flies fed GFP‐Escherichia coli O157:H7  ap. 364-371.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe house fly Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae) harbours and transmits a variety of human enteropathogens including Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriales: Enterobacteriaceae) O157:H7. Interactions between ingested bacteria and the fly gut directly impact bacterial persistence, survival and ultimately fly vector competence. We assessed the temporospatial fate of green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐expressing E. coli O157:H7 (GFP‐ECO157) in house flies along with fly antimicrobial responses up to 12 h post‐ingestion. In flies fed GFP‐ECO157, culture and microscopy revealed a steady decrease in bacterial load over 12 h, which is likely to be attributable to the combined effects of immobilization within the peritrophic matrix, lysis and peristaltic excretion. However, flies can putatively transmit this pathogen in excreta because intact bacteria were observed in the crop and rectum. Quantitative reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lysozyme gene expression showed minimal upregulation in both the gut and carcass of house flies fed GFP‐ECO157. However, these genes were upregulated in fly heads and salivary glands, and effector proteins were detected in the gut in some flies. Collectively, these data indicate that house flies can serve as reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 for up to 12 h, and factors in addition to AMPs and lysozyme may contribute to bacteria destruction in the gut.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aMusca domestica 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3aenteropathogens 3aexcreta 3aexcretion 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3alysozyme 3amicrobial load 3amicroscopy 3aperitrophic membrane 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arectum 3asalivary glands 3avector competence1 aKUMAR, H.

CPSB4 and Enterobacter sp. CPSB49 in luxuriant growth of tomato plants under chromium stress  aThe present study explores the potential of two chromium tolerant and plant growth promoting bacterial strains, Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. in luxuriant growth of tomato plants under chromium stress conditions. For the assessment of potentiality of the two selected strains, a pot scale experiment was setup with tomato plant under different levels of chromium contamination. In pot experiment, different plant growth parameters, oxidative stress tolerance and chromium bioremediation potential were studied upon inoculation of the selected bacterial strains. The results of pot experiment showed that both the strains were effective in promotion of plant growth and enhanced the plant biomass but Enterobacter sp. was more prominent in enhancement of root length, shoot length, fresh and dry weight, and nutrient uptake in tomato plant. The enhancement of enzymes to combat oxidative stress in tomato plant under chromium stress was also observed for both the strains. Both strains enhanced the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, total phenolic, and ascorbic acid in tomato plant under different levels of chromium stress conditions. The chromium phytoremediation potential of tomato plant upon inoculation of both the strains was also studied. The results of phytoremediation showed greater chromium accumulation in roots with poor translocation in shoot upon inoculation of Klebsiella sp. while no significant enhancement in chromium uptake by tomato plant was observed on inoculation of Enterobacter sp. compared to control.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L) is the most consumed cereal crop in the world; therefore, it is an excellent target for Zn biofortification programs. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular processes that regulate Zn concentration in the wheat grain is restricted, inhibiting the success of genetic Zn biofortification programs. This review helps break this nexus by advancing understanding of those processes, including speciation regulated uptake, root to shoot transport, remobilisation, grain loading and distribution of Zn in wheat grain. Furthermore, new insights to genetic Zn biofortification of wheat are discussed, and where data are limited, we draw upon information for other cereals and Fe distribution. We identify the loading and distribution of Zn in grain as major bottlenecks for biofortification, recognising anatomical barriers in the vascular region at the base of the grain, and physiological and molecular restrictions localised in the crease region as major limitations. Movement of Zn from the endosperm cavity into the modified aleurone, aleurone and then to the endosperm is mainly regulated by ZIP and YSL transporters. Zn complexation with phytic acid in the aleurone limits Zn mobility into the endosperm. These insights, together with synchrotron‐X‐ray‐fluorescence microscopy, support the hypothesis that a focus on the mechanisms of Zn loading into the grain will provide new opportunities for Zn biofortification of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abioavailability 3abiofortification 3aendosperm 3afood intake 3ahumans 3amicroscopy 3aphytic acid 3awheat 3azinc1 aNeate, Stephen M.1 aGunasinghe, Niroshini1 aMilham, Paul J.1 aPaterson, David J.1 aKopittke, Peter M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4948-18801 aSeneweera, Saman1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5147-99880 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2022 Jan., v. 174, no. 1 p.e13612-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.136123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245014200187300001600329520171500345592002802060650001802088650001302106650002502119650001802144650002102162650001602183650003702199650001302236650002202249650001802271650001502289650001002304650001402314650001202328650003502340650002502375650004502400650003002445650001302475650007202488650003502560650001402595650004702609650001002656700001702666700001502683700002102698773010902719856004802828852000902876655001202885IND50070539820221121222910.0131109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053982DNAL7 a239756852pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-013-9574-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyung Mee,10aGeneration of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells and evaluation of their major histocompatibility complex protein expression in vitro  ap. 293-301.  aInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are thought to be highly beneficial in the field of regenerative medicine and are believed to overcome immunogenic barriers to cell transplantation. However, issues remain regarding their safety and efficiency for medical use. Furthermore, some recent reports have suggested that iPSCs could be targeted by the autologous immune system. To promote practical applications of iPSCs, in depth research using appropriate animal models is needed and porcine species appear to provide an ideal model. Recent studies have focused on the generation of porcine iPSC cells, but no investigations of their immunological properties have been conducted to date. In the present study, we generated putative iPSCs from porcine somatic cells and measured major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on the iPSCs and their derivatives. Compact colonies that expressed pluripotent markers appeared 11 days after viral infection. Embryonic bodies (EB) were produced and differentiated into three germ layers in vitro. Karyotyping and swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) typing showed that the iPSCs were identical to parental somatic cells. Porcine iPSCs expressed only low levels of MHC class I and moderately increased levels on their differentiated derivatives, whereas MHC class II was rarely expressed. In the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), the expression of MHC class I was elevated on differentiated iPSCs, and gradually decreased after withdrawal of the cytokine. Our data suggest that porcine iPSCs could be useful for preclinical studies of the efficiency and viability of iPSCs, and for devising strategies to rescue transplanted cells from the autologous immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3acell transplantation 3aimmune system 3ainterferon-gamma 3akaryotyping 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amedicine 3aprotein synthesis 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 3aswine 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aAntiviral Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Differentiation 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aInduced Pluripotent Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInterferon-gammaxpharmacology 2aKaryotype 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aSwine1 aCha, Sang-Ho1 aAhn, Cheol1 aWoo, Heung-Myong0 tVeterinary research communications.g2013 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.293-301dSpringer-Verlagx0165-73807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-013-9574-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009500172300001600267520063500283592002800918650002400946650001700970650002800987650001101015650001501026653002001041653001501061653003601076653002301112700001901135700002301154773009001177856009001267852000901357655001201366IND60607481520221118053025.0180904e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060748152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xuesen10aModelling VARTM process induced variations on bending performance of composite Omega beams  ap. 371-379.  aFinite element simulation with cohesive contact is presented, to correlate the vacuum assisted RTM process and the bending performance of Omega beams. The model considers the process induced variations, including part thickness, resin rich pockets and voids. The bending performance prediction relies on cohesive contact to model delamination initiation and propagation. Computing efficiency is achieved by mesh scaling. The modelling approach applies to three variations of Omega beams with the different mode-mixture ratios. The finite element predictions result in a high degree of agreement with the experimental measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3adelamination 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 0aB.

Agardh (Fucales, Phaeophyceae) from Southeast Asia  ap. 1301-1308.  aSargassum polycystum C. Agardh is one of the most abundant marine brown algae and is distributed widely in warm and temperate waters, particularly in the Indo-west Pacific region and Australia. Although its commercial potential and ecological and evolutionary importance are recognized, many pivotal aspects of its biology remain unexplored. Current knowledge of the historical biogeographical affinities and patterns is limited, but some data are available about its genetics, the genetic variation among populations, and spatial patterns. This study aimed to analyze the genetic population structure and distribution patterns of S. polycystum populations in 13 different locations from Indonesia to Japan using the mitochondrial gene cox3. The seven haplotypes of cox3 identified in this study indicated a low level of genetic diversity. Homogeneity of this haplotype was observed particularly in the Gulf of Thailand, Cambodia, and Japan, whereas higher haplotype diversity was found in Phuket (Thailand), Bali (Indonesia), and Singapore. Those data suggest that S. polycystum is likely to have expanded from the south of Indonesia and the west of the Malay Peninsula towards the northeast of the region. Geological studies showed that Sundaland, now corresponding to the Gulf of Thailand, was submerged due to sea level rises after the last glacial period. Therefore, the decrease in the genetic diversity of S. polycystum populations is interpreted here as a population expansion after the rise in sea levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum polycystum 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amacroalgae 3apopulation structure 3asea level 3aAustralia 3aCambodia 3aIndonesia 3aJapan 3aSingapore 3aThailand1 aUwai, Shinya1 aNoiraksar, Thidarat1 aKomatsu, Teruhisa0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.1301-1308dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0175-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245015000187300001600337520092400353592002801277650002701305650001601332650002101348650002201369650001301391650002701404650002001431650001901451650001501470650006201485650004801547650003801595650003001633650003001663650002401693650004501717650001301762650002501775650001501800650001601815650001701831653003001848653003901878653003301917653002701950653002201977700002001999700002202019700001802041700002002059773010602079856008702185852000902272655001202281IND50071039520221121230710.0190409e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007103952DNAL7 a241771532pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavitha, S.10aEffect of enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment on enhancement of aerobic digestion potential of waste activated sludge interceded through EDTA  ap. 210-219.  aIn this study, the effect of Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) on Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) removal tailed with bacterial enzymatic pretreatment on aerobic digestion of activated sludge was studied.

EDTA efficiently removed the EPS with limited cell lysis and enhanced the sludge enzyme activity at its lower concentration of 0.2g/g SS. The sludge was then subjected to bacterial pretreatment to enhance the aerobic digestion. In aerobic digestion the best results in terms of Suspended solids (SS) reduction (48.5%) and COD (Chemical oxygen demand) solubilization (47.3%) was obtained in experimental reactor than in control.

Six commercial ILs, formed by combination of 1–Butyl–3–methylimidazolium (Bmim⁺) and N,N,N–trimethylethanolammonium (Choline⁺) cations and chloride (Cl⁻), acetate (Ac⁻) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf₂–) anions were evaluated, all representative counter–ions with markedly different toxicity and biodegradability. Inherent and fast biodegradability tests were used to evaluate both the microorganism inhibition and the IL biodegradability. In addition, the ecotoxicological response (EC₅₀) of the ILs was studied using activated sludge and Vibrio fischeri (Microtox® test). Bmim⁺ and NTf₂– can be considered as non–biodegradable, whereas aerobic microorganisms easily degraded Choline⁺ and Ac⁻. The biodegradation pattern of each cation/anion is nearly unaffected by counter–ion nature. Moreover, concentrations of CholineNTf₂ higher than 50 mg/L caused a partial inhibition on microbial activity, in good concordance with its low EC₅₀ (54 mg/L) measured by respiration inhibition test, which alerts on the negative environmental impact of NTf₂–containing ILs on the performance of sewage treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacetates 3aactivated sludge 3aanions 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acations 3achlorides 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental impact 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amedian effective concentration 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3asewage treatment 3atoxicity 0aCholine 0aEcotoxicity 0aImidazolium1 aDíaz, E.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1020-62401 aPalomar, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-05151 aRodriguez, J.J.1 aMohedano, A.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0912-77130 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 240 p.124947-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1249473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001200268520171800280592002801998650002202026650001202048650001202060650001802072650003002090650000902120650001302129650001702142650001002159650002002169650001102189650001902200650001402219700001802233773009002251856008102341852000902422655001202431IND60340664120221122235219.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034066412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-014-9145-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaweewan, Yeetoh10aAnatomical Assessment of Root Formation and Tuberization in Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)  ap. 1-8.  aFormation of storage root organs in cassava (Manihot esculenta) is poorly understood, but considered to occur when a subset of fibrous roots receive unknown signals to undergo secondary thickening. Large amounts of secondary xylem parenchyma are then produced in which starch is synthesized and stored. Anatomical studies were undertaken to examine rhizogenesis from greenhouse-grown cassava stem cuttings. Root formation was observed from the stem cut end (basal) and from close to the buried nodes (nodal) 5–10 days after planting. Transverse sectioning of the stem provided evidence that the basal roots were initiated from the cambium, while the nodal-derived roots developed from tissues deeper within the stem, at the boundary of the xylem and pith. Basal root anatomy remained constant with age, with minimal development of metaxylem. No tuberization was seen to occur from the basal roots. In contrast, nodal roots produced significant amounts of metaxylem and subsequently secondary xylem to form a large central stele. Further development established the storage organ in which secondary xylem parenchyma, tracheids and vessels were produced from the cambium. As a result, the nodal-derived roots were seen as precursors of the storage organs. It is proposed that nodal-derived and basal-derived fibrous roots are fundamentally different organs, that they originate through different rhizogenic processes and are committed to their respective developmental fates from the earliest stages of their initiation. These anatomical investigations offer new insight into root tuberization in cassava and should guide better focused studies into the underlying molecular and developmental control mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3acambium 3acassava 3afibrous roots 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3apith 3aplanting 3arhizogenesis 3aroots 3asecondary xylem 3astarch 3astorage organs 3atracheids1 aTaylor, Nigel0 tTropical plant biology.g2015 June, v. 8, no. 1-2 p.1-8dSpringer USx1935-97567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-014-9145-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245010200170520157100272592002801843650001501871650001201886650001601898650001701914650001201931650002301943650001201966650001301978700002801991700002102019700002802040700003002068700003502098700002502133773012002158856007602278852000902354655001202363IND60762514020221120120240.0220110e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076251402DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120100772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes-Romero, Beatriz 10aMeasurement of Plasma Resistin Concentrations in Horses with Metabolic and Inflammatory Disorders  aObesity and its associated complications, such as metabolic syndrome, are an increasing problem in both humans and horses in the developed world. The expression patterns of resistin differ considerably between species. In rodents, resistin is expressed by adipocytes and is related to obesity and ID. In humans, resistin is predominantly produced by inflammatory cells, and resistin concentrations do not reflect the degree of obesity, although they may predict cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of resistin and its relationship with ID and selected indicators of inflammation in horses. Seventy-two horses, included in one of the four following groups, were studied: healthy controls (C, n = 14), horses with inflammatory conditions (I, n = 21), horses with mild ID (ID1, n = 18), and horses with severe ID (ID2, n = 19). Plasma resistin concentrations were significantly different between groups and the higher values were recorded in the I and ID2 groups (C: 2.38 ± 1.69 ng/mL; I: 6.85 ± 8.38 ng/mL; ID1: 2.41 ± 2.70 ng/mL; ID2: 4.49 ± 3.08 ng/mL). Plasma resistin was not correlated with basal insulin concentrations. A significant (r = 0.336, p = 0.002) correlation was found between resistin and serum amyloid A. Our results show that, as is the case in humans, plasma resistin concentrations in horses are predominantly related to inflammatory conditions and not to ID. Horses with severe ID showed an elevation in resistin that may be secondary to the inflammatory status associated with metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aamyloid 3ablood serum 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aresistin1 aMuñoz-Prieto, Alberto 1 aCerón, José J.1 aMartín-Cuervo, María 1 aIglesias-García, Manuel 1 aAguilera-Tejero, Escolástico 1 aDíez-Castro, Elisa 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120100773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007500171300001500246520096200261592002801223650001501251650001301266650002601279650001201305650001401317650001601331650001101347650001601358650001901374650001101393651001001404700001801414700002201432700001801454773008701472856008601559852000901645655001201654IND60089146020221121022403.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008914602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Pyung-Rae10aAtmospheric particulate mercury: Concentrations and size distributions  ap. 94-102.  aIn this study, the size distributions of atmospheric particulate mercury (PHg) were measured in both urban and rural areas during the summer, fall, and winter. Both PHg concentrations and the contribution of PHg to total PM aerosol were higher at the urban (PHg = 6.8 ± 6.5 pg m⁻³, PHg/total PM = 0.18 pg μg⁻¹) than at the rural site (PHg = 4.6 ± 2.7 pg m⁻³, PHg/total PM = 0.06 pg μg⁻¹). Based on size-distribution measurements, the fine mode was the dominant size at both sites in winter while the coarse mode became more important during summer. In winter PHg concentrations in the fine mode increased because of the effective adsorption of gaseous Hg onto the fine particles at the low temperature and increased Hg oxidation reactions in the presence of high particles concentrations. During winter elevated concentrations of total PHg were measured when the prevailing winds were northwesterly originating in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3amercury 3aoxidation 3arural areas 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind direction 3awinter 3aChina1 aHan, Young-Ji1 aHolsen, Thomas M.1 aYi, Seung-Muk0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Dec., v. 61 p.94-102dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
