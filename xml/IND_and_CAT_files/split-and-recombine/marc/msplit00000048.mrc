Middle Eastern Phoenix dactylifera (MEPD) is a flowering plant of palm family with potent antioxidant feature. Due to the increasing use of herbs in medicine, this study was designed to assess the effects of MEPD and MC on inflammatory apoptogenic, oxidative and histomorphometric alterations in liver. Sixty-four male rats were assigned to 8 groups including: control groups (normal group and MC (50 mg/kg)), MEPD groups (30, 90, 270 mg/kg) and MC + MEPD treated groups. All experimental groups were treated intraperitoneally and orally daily for 5 weeks. The relative expression level of apoptotic genes (p53, Bcl2 and Bax) and hepatocyte apoptotic index were analyzed. Also, Nitrite oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation (LP), Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) assays were conducted to assess the antioxidant levels. Cytokines involved in inflammation, hepatic enzymes and histomorphometric parameters (hepatocytes diameter (HD) and central hepatic vein (CHV)) were evaluated. All factors showed incremental trends following MC administration (else FRAP level and Bcl2, which were decreased) in MC group than normal group (P < 0.05). In comparison with the MC group, total values in MEPD and MEPD + MC groups were decreased (P < 0.05) (except FRAP level and Bcl2, which were increased). According to the obtained data, the administration of MEPD extract has potent antioxidant property that attenuates the destructive hepatic effects of MC by initiation of cellular antioxidant pathways and restoration of pathological changes into the physiological form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acytokines 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amales 3amedicine 3amercuric chloride 3amolecular biology 3anitrites1 aAbdolmaleki, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5097-79741 aSalahshoor, Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5362-99350 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.6053-6065dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05680-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011200167300002000279520142500299592002801724650001501752650001501767650001201782650001401794650001101808650002401819650002001843650001501863650001801878650001701896650001701913650001401930650001301944650002001957653002001977653001501997653002002012653002102032653001502053700001902068700001902087700001502106700001702121700001502138700001602153700002202169700001702191700001902208773013002227856007802357852000902435655001202444IND60550903320221119161206.0161011e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055090332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b083222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurwajanti, Swasmi10aMesoporous Magnesium Oxide Hollow Spheres as Superior Arsenite Adsorbent: Synthesis and Adsorption Behavior  ap. 25306-25312.  aArsenic contamination in natural water has posed a significant threat to global health due to its toxicity and carcinogenity. Adsorption technology is an easy and flexible method for arsenic removal with high efficiency. In this Article, we demonstrated the synthesis of mesoporous MgO hollow spheres (MgO-HS) and their application as high performance arsenite (As(III)) adsorbent. MgO-HS with uniform particle size (∼180 nm), high specific surface area (175 m² g–¹), and distinguished mesopores (9.5 nm in size) have been prepared by hard-templating approach using mesoporous hollow carbon spheres as templates. An ultrahigh maximum As(III) adsorption capacity (Qₘₐₓ) of 892 mg g–¹ was achieved in batch As(III) removal study. Adsorption kinetic study demonstrated that MgO-HS could enable As(III) adsorption 6 times faster as a commercial MgO adsorbent. The ultrahigh adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics were attributed to the unique structure and morphology of MgO-HS that enabled fast transformation into a flower-like porous structure composed of ultrathin Mg(OH)₂ nanosheets. This in situ formed structure provided abundant and highly accessible hydroxyl groups, which enhanced the adsorption performance toward As(III). The outstanding As(III) removal capability of MgO-HS showed their great promise as highly efficient adsorbents for As(III) sequestration from contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3acarbon 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amagnesium oxide 3ananosheets 3aparticle size 3aporous media 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aarsenic removal 0amesoporous 0amagnesium oxide 0ahollow structure 0aadsorption1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aHuang, Xiaodan1 aSong Hào,1 aYang, Yannan1 aZhang, Jun1 aNiu, Yuting1 aMeka, Anand

The model is verified against the round trip efficiency of various plant configurations reported in the literature, and the design space exploration entails quantifying the effects of plant mass flow rates, operating pressures, and heat exchanger inventory allocation on the global performance. The multi-objective optimization consists of maximizing both the round-trip and exergy efficiency and identifying their trade-offs via the Pareto front. Results demonstrate the presence of a critical liquid air mass flow rate beyond which reverse cooling is instigated and the plant performance is degraded. Furthermore, the two objective functions in the optimization are shown to compete against each other, although the round trip efficiency is deemed as a more practical performance metric while the maximum exergy efficiency design better exploits solar energy as a high-grade heat source. The best design for the plant layout under analysis yields the round trip and exergy efficiency of 20% and 59%, respectively, with the critical mass flow rate of 0.8 kg/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acooling 3aexergy 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3ainventories 3aliquids 3amass flow 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aDesign space exploration 0aExergy 0aHybrid power plant 0aLiquid air 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aSolar energy0 tEnergy.g2022 May 01, v. 246 p.123324-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006200170520084600232592002801078650002201106650001201128650001101140650002101151653001201172653003101184653002401215653002001239700002601259700002301285700001501308700001801323700002201341773010401363856008401467852000901551655001201560IND60696224720221122050727.0200830e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069622472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1045292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroucher, Adrian10aWaiwera: A parallel open-source geothermal flow simulator  aWaiwera is a new reservoir simulator designed to address the current and future challenges posed by modelling geothermal systems.

Both their taxonomic and phylogenetic histories are confused. Until recently, the family included genera now allocated to the Rhinonycteridae and was recognized as a subfamily of Rhinolophidae. Evidence that Hipposideridae diverged from both Rhinolophidae and Rhinonycteridae in the Eocene confirmed their family rank, but their intrafamilial relationships remain poorly resolved. We examined genetic variation in the Afrotropical hipposiderids Doryrhina, Hipposideros, and Macronycteris using relatively dense taxon-sampling throughout East Africa and neighboring regions. Variation in both mitochondrial (cyt-b) and four nuclear intron sequences (ACOX2, COPS, ROGDI, STAT5) were analyzed using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. We used intron sequences and the lineage delimitation method BPP—a multilocus, multi-species coalescent approach—on supported mitochondrial clades to identify those acting as independent evolutionary lineages. The program StarBEAST was used on the intron sequences to produce a species tree of the sampled Afrotropical hipposiderids. All genetic analyses strongly support generic monophyly, with Doryrhina and Macronycteris as Afrotropical sister genera distinct from a Paleotropical Hipposideros; mitochondrial analyses interpose the genera Aselliscus, Coelops, and Asellia between these clades. Mitochondrial analyses also suggest at least two separate colonizations of Africa by Asian groups of Hipposideros, but the actual number and direction of faunal interchanges will hinge on placement of the unsampled African-Arabian species H. megalotis. Mitochondrial sequences further identify a large number of geographically structured clades within species of all three genera. However, in sharp contrast to this pattern, the four nuclear introns fail to distinguish many of these groups and their geographic structuring disappears. Various distinctive mitochondrial clades are consolidated in the intron-based gene trees and delimitation analyses, calling into question their evolutionary independence or else indicating their very recent divergence. At the same time, there is now compelling genetic evidence in both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences for several additional unnamed species among the Afrotropical Hipposideros. Conflicting appraisals of differentiation among the Afrotropical hipposiderids based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci must be adjudicated by large-scale integrative analyses of echolocation calls, quantitative morphology, and geometric morphometrics. Integrative analyses will also help to resolve the challenging taxonomic issues posed by the diversification of the many lineages associated with H. caffer and H. ruber.  aJRS Biodiversity Foundation; Field Museum’s Council on Africa, Marshall Field III Fund, and Barbara E.

The 3D structure of MiAMP2 was constructed for the first time by ab initio modelling using the TrRosetta server. The results showed that MiAMP2 was highly hydrophilic and had seven disulfide bonds and higher α-helix and β-sheet/turn contents. Molecular simulation showed that the hydrophobic pocket of MiAMP2 created a favourable environment for the binding of POA and OA. Free energy landscape and independent gradient model (IGM) analyses revealed that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces were the major driving forces stabilizing complexes formed by MiAMP2 and POA or OA. The present study provides a theoretical basis and new insight for the future development and utilization of macadamia nut protein in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3aantimicrobial proteins 3adisulfides 3afood chemistry 3afood industry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amacadamia nuts 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apalmitoleic acid 3aprediction 3avan der Waals forces 0aMacadamia nut 0aAntimicrobial protein 0aMonounsaturated fatty acids 0aMolecular modelling and simulation 0aInteraction1 aZhao, Lei1 aCai, Shengbao1 aTang, Xiaoning1 aMehmood, Arshad1 aAlnadari, Fawze1 aTuersuntuoheti, Tuohetisayipu1 aZhou, Na1 aAi, Xin0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 367 p.130677-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1306773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003000135040001800165100001900183245012600202500002000328506007600348520141500424592002801839596006301867596002101930596002801951596005901979596004702038596002802085596003002113596003502143506003702178650002602215650001102241650002202252650001702274650002202291650001602313650001102329650001502340650001002355650000902365651001102374700002102385700002102406700001902427773013302446856007702579961001202656852000902668655001202677IND60568831820221207050214.0220821e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056883182DNAL7 a285298312pmid7 aPMC54354042pmcid7 a10.3732/apps.16001582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinch, Kristen10aSource identification of western Oregon Douglas‐fir wood cores using mass spectrometry and random forest classification  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: We investigated whether wood metabolite profiles from direct analysis in real time (time‐of‐flight) mass spectrometry (DART‐TOFMS) could be used to determine the geographic origin of Douglas‐fir wood cores originating from two regions in western Oregon, USA. METHODS: Three annual ring mass spectra were obtained from 188 adult Douglas‐fir trees, and these were analyzed using random forest models to determine whether samples could be classified to geographic origin, growth year, or growth year and geographic origin. Specific wood molecules that contributed to geographic discrimination were identified. RESULTS: Douglas‐fir mass spectra could be differentiated into two geographic classes with an accuracy between 70% and 76%. Classification models could not accurately classify sample mass spectra based on growth year. Thirty‐two molecules were identified as key for classifying western Oregon Douglas‐fir wood cores to geographic origin. DISCUSSION: DART‐TOFMS is capable of detecting minute but regionally informative differences in wood molecules over a small geographic scale, and these differences made it possible to predict the geographic origin of Douglas‐fir wood with moderate accuracy. Studies involving DART‐TOFMS, alone and in combination with other technologies, will be relevant for identifying the geographic origin of illegally harvested wood.  aPublisher supplied data  cCronn Laboratory at the Pacific Northwest Research Station  cJones Laboratory  cOregon State University  cUSDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station  cU.S. Forest Service International Programs  cHardman Foundation Inc.  cWorld Resources Institute  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aadults 3achemical elements 3agrowth rings 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aprovenance 3atrees 3awood 3aOregon1 aEspinoza, Edgard1 aJones, F.

Effective new vaccines are urgently needed. Autonomously replicating plant virus-based vector provides attractive means for producing chimeric virus particles (CVPs) in plants that can be developed into vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate the potential for vaccine development of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) epitope-presentation system, where the antigen from vvIBDV VP2 was fused to the N-terminus of BaMV coat protein. Accordingly, an infections plasmid, pBIBD2, was constructed. Inoculation of the recombinant BaMV clone pBIBD2 enabled the generation of chimeric virus, BIBD2, and stable expression of IBDV VP2 antigen on its coat protein. After intramuscular immunization with BIBD2 CVPs, chickens produced antibodies against IBDV and were protected from vvIBDV (V263/TW strain) challenges. These results corroborate the feasibility of BaMV-based CVP platform in plants for the development and production of vaccines against IBDV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBamboo mosaic virus 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aantibodies 3achickens 3achimerism 3acoat proteins 3afinancial economics 3aimmunity 3aimmunization 3aplasmids 3apoultry industry 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3avirion 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aChen, Ten-Hong1 aHu, Chung-Chi1 aLiao, Jia-Teh1 aChin, Shirley Wei Lee,1 aLiao, Jiunn-Wang1 aLin, Maw-Yeong1 aLiu, Hung-Jen1 aWang, Min-Ying1 aLin, Nasheng,1 aHsu, Yau-Heiu0 tVirus research.g2012 June, v. 166, no. 1-2 p.109-115dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006800171300001600239500001900255520100500274592002801279650001201307650001501319650003001334650002001364650001401384650001701398650001901415651001401434651001301448651001401461653001801475653002201493653001401515653001201529653001601541653001401557653001601571653001301587700001701600773010001617856008101717852000901798655001201807IND60705910720221120070736.0200807e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070591072DNAL7 a10.1163/1876312X-000023052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepúlveda, Tatiana10aTaxonomy and phylogeny of the Eoneria-group (Diptera, Neriidae)  ap. 637-671.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Eoneria-group was proposed to gather species with opaque antennal base from all biogeographical regions.

Success in sediment control measures depends, in particular, on proper identification of sediment sources. Since observations alone are normally not adequate for source prioritization/contribution in relation to the downstream sediment loads, hydrological simulation tools may be applied for spatial prioritization of runoff and sediment yield in basins. In this paper, subbasin prioritization was conducted for the Gharasu basin, located in southwestern Iran. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated and validated against observed stream flow and sediment data measured at the outlet of the basin. Then, the Unit Response Approach (URA) was applied to prioritize subbasins in terms of their share to the runoff and sediment yield of the main basin outlet. In this technique, two indices were assigned to each contributing unit to determine the degree of changes in the outlet response, i.e. runoff and sediment, caused by the removal of that unit. Within the URA, not only the runoff and sediment load is considered at subbasin scale, but also the effect of runoff and sediment routing throughout the basin up to the main outlet are incorporated. Results showed that subbasins 16 and 3 have the highest runoff and sediment production at their own subbasin outlet, respectively. However, according to the URA-based simulated runoff and sediment yield indices, subbasins 2 and 4 contribute the largest share in the main outlet runoff and sediment yield, respectively. Thus planning for sediment control should primarily focus on subbasin 4 while subsequent plans may be devoted to the subbasin with the next highest sediment contribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abasins 3acontrol methods 3aplanning 3apollution load 3aprioritization 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3astream flow 3awater quality 3aIran1 aSima, Somayeh1 aSadeghi, Sajjad1 aJeirani, Farzin0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 June, v. 109 p.36-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245010700156300001600263500001400279520141900293592002801712650001801740650002101758650001301779650001401792650002001806650002601826650001201852650001001864650001801874650000901892650001101901653003501912653002401947653001201971653000801983773010901991856007702100852000902177655001202186IND60726980120221121124522.0210209e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072698012DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2013-035762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKita, K.14aThe spleen accumulates advanced glycation end products in the chicken: Tissue comparison made with rat  ap. 429-433.  aNAL-light  aGlycation starts from nonenzymatic amino-carbonyl reaction that binds carbonyl group of reducing sugars to the amino group of amino acids. Glycation leads to further complex reactions to form advanced glycation end products (AGE). Because AGE are implicated in the gradual development of diabetic complications, tissue accumulation of AGE has been widely examined in various tissues of rats. Avian species are known to have high body temperature and blood glucose concentration compared with mammals. Although these characteristics enabled chickens to be used as experimental models for diabetes mellitus, the information of AGE accumulation in various tissues of chickens has not been limited so far. In the present study, therefore, the radioactive AGE prepared by reacting ¹⁴ C-glucose and amino acids were intravenously administrated, and comparison of tissue accumulation of ¹⁴ C-labeled AGE was made between chickens and rats. At 30 min after administration, tissues (18–20) were collected, and the radioactivity incorporated into tissues was determined. High levels of radioactivity per gram of tissue in the liver and kidney were observed in both rats and chickens. In chickens but not rats, a large amount of ¹⁴ C-labeled AGE incorporated into 1 g of spleen was observed, and the specific accumulation of AGE in the avian spleen might have a particular role in immune response in avian species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3abody temperature 3achickens 3aglycation 3aimmune response 3aintravenous injection 3akidneys 3aliver 3aradioactivity 3arats 3aspleen 0aadvanced glycation end product 0atissue accumulation 0achicken 0arat0 tPoultry science.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 93, no. 2 p.429-433dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2013-035763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009100164300001800255520110600273592002801379650001501407650001301422650002601435650001401461650001901475650001101494650001301505700001301518700001801531700001801549700001701567773010201584856008101686852000901767655001201776IND60575195220221122000819.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057519522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1138-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuang10aDielectric properties of MgO–ZnO–TiO2-based ceramics at 1 MHz and THz frequencies  ap. 9335-9343.  aThe dielectric properties (ε and tan δ) of MZT-based ceramics can be tailored at both 1 MHz and the terahertz (THz) frequencies (0.2–2 THz) by CaTiO₃ (CT) doping. CT was formed liquid phase during the sintering process and accelerated the densification of the ceramics. Doped with CT, the increase of the ε at 1 MHz could be explained by Lichtenecker expressions equation, and the tan δ is decreased at 1 MHz due to the high density. By doping with CT, the THz dielectric properties of ceramics can be modified, due to the variation of the lattice parameter and microstructure (porosity). At THz frequencies, ion displacement polarization is difficult to achieve, so that ε at THz is smaller than ε at 1 MHz according to Clausius–Mosotti equation. According to the four-parameter factorized oscillator model, the tan δ is increased with frequency up to THz frequencies. The power absorption of the MZT-based ceramics is lower than 10 cm⁻¹ below 1 THz, and it is a good choice as a transparent material at terahertz domain, which may promote the development of terahertz devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aceramics 3adielectric properties 3aequations 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aporosity1 aLi, Quan1 aGu, Jianqiang1 aHan, Jiaguang1 aZhang, Weili0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Aug., v. 52, no. 16 p.9335-9343dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1138-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245016400204300001100368506007600379520183400455592002802289506003702317650002202354650001602376650002402392650001502416650001302431650001602444650001202460650001802472650001302490650001802503650002202521700001402543700001902557700005002576700001402626773010802640856008202748852000902830655001202839IND60632651820221207133152.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063265182DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-019-1140-x2doi7 aPMC64194622pmcid7 a308715662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingshu10aSofosbuvir-based regimen is safe and effective for hepatitis C infected patients with stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Whether sofosbuvir is suitable for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with severe renal impairment is inconclusive. This systematic review aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SOF-based regimen in the setting of stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Google Scholar with searching strategy: (sofosbuvir OR Sovaldi OR Harvoni OR Epclusa OR Vosevi) AND (severe kidney impairment OR severe renal impairment OR end-stage renal disease OR dialysis OR renal failure OR ESRD OR renal insufficiency OR hepatorenal syndrome OR HRS). Sustained virological response (SVR12/24) rate and serious adverse event (SAE) rate with 95% confidence intervals were aggregated. Subgroup analysis was implemented to evaluate the impact of treatment strategy and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria, totaling 717 HCV infected patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 (58.4% on dialysis). Pooled SVR12/24 was 97.1% (95% CI 93.9–99.3%), and SAE rate was 4.8% (95% CI 2.1–10.3%). There was no significant difference at SVR12/24 (97.1% vs 96.2%, p = 0.72) or SAE rate (8.8% vs 2.9%, p = 0.13) between subgroups applying full or decreased dose of sofosbuvir. Cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients achieved comparable sustained virological response (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85–1.02). Four studies reported eGFR/serum creatinine pre- and post- treatment, with no significant modification. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests SOF-based regimen might be used safely and effectively in patients living with HCV infection/stage 4–5 CKD, with normal and reduced dose of sofosbuvir. Prospective and well-controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

To widen the adaptability of the insurance throughout the country, key determinants of insurance adoption need proper investigation. We designed this study to identify the factors that influence farmer’s decisions in adopting livestock insurance. Primary data were collected from 415 respondents including 245 livestock insured and 170 non-insured farmers. Probit regression model using STATA15 was employed to analyze factors influencing livestock insurance adoption. The regression result revealed that the probability of insurance adoption significantly increases with farmers having membership in groups or cooperatives, raising awareness, and rearing improved animal. Intensifying public awareness campaigns through a combined effort of all the stakeholders including local government authorities, broadcasting media, insurance companies, and farmer’s groups or cooperatives is necessary for insurance uptake in the farming community. Provision of insurance through farmers’ group or cooperatives making them a formal insurer agent is required for wider adoption of livestock insurance in Nepal.  aThe authors received no direct funding for this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3afarmers 3ainsurance 3alivestock 3alivestock insurance 3alocal government 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3aNepal 0aadoption 0aawareness 0amembership1 aGhimire, Yuga N.1 aTimsina, Krishna P.1 aSubedi, Sanjiv1 aPoudel, Hema Kumari1 aGonzález-Redondo, Pedro0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 7, no. 1 p.1952012-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.19520123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015700160520153800317592002801855650002001883650002501903650002401928650002001952650002701972650002201999650001102021650003302032650002802065651001302093700001902106700001902125700001802144700002502162700001702187773012702204856007502331852000902406655001202415IND60652800720221121053242.0190713e20190213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065280072DNAL7 a10.3390/su110409542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaramat, Jawad 10aDeveloping Sustainable Healthcare Systems in Developing Countries: Examining the Role of Barriers, Enablers and Drivers on Knowledge Management Adoption  aKnowledge management (KM) adoption is crucial to integrating sustainable development within the healthcare sector. Different barriers, enablers, and drivers affect KM adoption. Identifying these barriers, enablers, and drivers and their role in KM adoption is the core of successful KM adoption. However, there is scarcity of studies applying quantitative models and combing barriers, enablers and drivers to check their effect on KM adoption, especially form a developing country&rsquo;s perspective such as Pakistan. Therefore, this study explores the role of barriers, enablers and drivers on KM adoption in Pakistan. Healthcare professionals participated in the data collection process, and results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings described that: (1) organizational and strategic barriers have significant negative association with KM adoption; (2) government related enablers have significant positive association with KM adoption; (3) healthcare related drivers, and performance-based drivers have significant positive association with KM adoption. This study concludes that government intervention to promote KM adoption is necessary especially in developing countries. These findings will be helpful for the healthcare professionals and policy makers to promote KM adoption in healthcare sector. Current study contributes to the healthcare literature and body of knowledge by providing the empirical evidence of checking the quantitative effect of barriers, enablers and drivers on KM adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3ahealth care workers 3ahealth services 3ainformation management 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3astructural equation modeling 3asustainable development 3aPakistan1 aShurong, Tong 1 aAhmad, Naveed 1 aAfridi, Sana 1 aK̲h̲ān, Shahbāz,1 aKhan, Nidha 0 tSustainability.g2019 Feb. 13, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110409543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245012400201300002000325520138300345592002801728650001101756650001601767650001101783650001601794650002301810650001601833650001801849650002001867700002001887700001601907700001901923700001901942700001701961700002001978773013801998856008002136852000902216655001202225IND60747286120220217000000.0210812e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074728612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c042052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPflug, Theo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8887-727410aFluence-Dependent Transient Reflectance of Stainless Steel Investigated by Ultrafast Imaging Pump–Probe Reflectometry  ap. 17363-17371.  aThe ablation efficiency during laser processing strongly depends on the initial and transient reflectance of the irradiated material surface. This article reports on the transient relative change of the reflectance ΔR/R of stainless steel during and after ultrashort pulsed laser excitation (800 nm, 40 fs) by spatially resolved pump–probe reflectometry. The spatial resolution of the setup in combination with the spatial Gaussian intensity distribution of the pump radiation enables a fluence-resolved detection of ΔR/R. Within the first picosecond after irradiation with a peak fluence of 2 J/cm², the spatially resolved ΔR/R of stainless steel evolves into an annular shape, in which the center almost remains at its initial reflectance, whereas the outer region features a decreased reflectance. The decreasing trend of ΔR/R is qualitatively supported by applying a two-temperature model, considering the transient optical properties of stainless steel from the literature. At larger fluences and thus higher electron temperatures, the experimental data deviate from the transient reflectance given in the literature. A drastically decreased occupation of the states below the Fermi energy and the subsequent excitation of electrons into these new vacant states by the probe radiation are considered being the most probable origin for this behavior at high fluences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3airradiation 3amodels 3aoccupations 3aphysical chemistry 3areflectance 3areflectometry 3astainless steel1 aOlbrich, Markus1 aWinter, Jan1 aSchille, Jörg1 aLöschner, Udo1 aHuber, Heinz1 aHorn, Alexander0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 03, v. 125, no. 31 p.17363-17371dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c042053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012100171300001600292500001900308520169800327592002802025650001202053650001402065650003002079650002002109650001502129650001602144650002402160653001702184653001702201653001302218700003002231700002602261773010002287856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60705910920221120070703.0200807e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070591092DNAL7 a10.1163/1876312X-000010232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Marcelli K.12aA taxonomic revision of the Canthon subgenus Pseudepilissus Martínez, 1954 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae)  ap. 696-752.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe subgenus Canthon (Pseudepilissus) Martínez, 1954 is revised.

One possible way to suppress the production of IS and pCS is to increase dietary fiber intake. The aim of the present study was to assess whether increasing dietary fiber, as high amylose diet, can affect the level of conventional and protein bound nitrogenous products. METHODS: Fifty patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis were randomly assigned to receive a diet containing resistant starch (HAM-RS2) or placebo over 8 weeks spanning February and September 2017 in the 29 Bahman hospital hemodialysis ward in Tabriz, Iran. Of these, 44 patients (23 from HAM-RS2 and 21 control) completed the study. Plasma levels of urea, creatinine, uric acid and other routine parameters were measured at the beginning and after 8 weeks of starting the supplementation. The levels of IS and p-cresol in the collected serum samples were also determined by HPLC at baseline and after intervention. RESULTS: There was significant reduction of creatinine and uric acid levels in HAM-RS2 supplemented patients when compared with control group (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IS was not changed significantly in both HAM-RS2 treated and control patients, whereas p-cresol level was reduced significantly during the study period in HAM-RS2 treated patients (P = 0.039). The change of other parameters including Hb, lipids, bone markers and hs-CRP were non-significant during the study in both groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of fermentable high fiber diet as HAM-RS2 decreased serum levels of some nitrogenous products such as serum creatinine and p-cresol as a gut derived nitrogenous product without change in IS levels in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Due to safety, without important side effects the administration of diet enriched with fermentable fiber is suitable for patients on maintenance dialysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aamylose 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adialysis 3adietary fiber 3adigestive system 3afibrosis 3ahemodialysis 3ahigh fiber diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahospitals 3akidney diseases 3alipids 3ap-cresol 3apatients 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aresistant starch 3asulfates 3atoxins 3aurea 3auric acid 3aIran1 aAbedi, Behzad1 aGhojazadeh, Morteza1 aSamadi, Azam1 aJouyban, Abolghasem0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-019-0343-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013300170300001800303520095300321592002801274650001901302650003501321650002601356650001401382650002701396650002901423650001301452700002801465700003001493700002201523700003001545700002701575700002601602700001901628700002401647700002401671700002701695700003401722773011701756856008201873990002301955852000901978655001201987IND60091081720221120223504.0141103e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009108172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaro, Letícia V.10aOxoquinoline acyclonucleoside phosphonate analogues as a new class of specific inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1  ap. 5055-5058.  aThe emergence of a multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strain and the toxicity of anti-HIV-1 compounds approved for clinical use are the most significant problems facing antiretroviral therapies. Therefore, it is crucial to find new agents to overcome these issues. In this study, we synthesized a series of new oxoquinoline acyclonucleoside phosphonate analogues (ethyl 1-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylates 3a–3k), which contained different substituents at the C6 or C7 positions of the oxoquinoline nucleus and an N1-bonded phosphonate group. We subsequently investigated these compounds’ in vitro inhibitory effects against HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The most active compounds were the fluoro-substituted derivatives 3f and 3g, which presented excellent EC₅₀ values of 0.4±0.2μM (3f) and 0.2±0.005μM (3g) and selectivity index values (SI) of 6240 and 14675, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiretroviral agents 3achemistry 3amononuclear leukocytes 3amultiple drug resistance 3atoxicity1 ade Almeida, Jéssica M.1 aCirne-Santos, Cláudio C.1 aGiongo, Viveca A.1 aCastello-Branco, Luís R.1 aOliveira, Ingrid de B.1 aBarbosa, Juliana E.F.1 aCunha, Anna C.1 aFerreira, Vítor F.1 ade Souza, Marcos C.1 aPaixão, Izabel C.N.P.1 ade Souza, Maria Cecília B.V.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 22, no. 15 p.5055-5058dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.06.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011700175300001600292500001900308520135500327592002801682650002501710650003501735650002601770650001601796650001901812653004301831653008301874653000801957653001001965700001901975700002801994773009902022856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60726021620221120191516.0210305e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072602162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorkayesh, Ali Ebadi10aSustainable waste disposal technology selection: The stratified best-worst multi-criteria decision-making method  ap. 100-112.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWaste disposal technology selection is a key problem in the field of municipal solid waste (MSW). This decision may have long-term impacts on environmental development and economic growth. The literature suggests using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to address this problem. MCDM techniques commonly require decision makers to assign weightings of importance to the decision criteria based on which, the available technologies are ranked. However, this technology selection problem is concerned with selecting a technology to be used for a relatively long period of time. It is important to take into consideration any uncertainty the decision maker may have with regard to the weightings of the criteria in the future. To take this uncertainty into consideration, this study suggests utilizing a recently developed MCDM technique, namely the stratified MCDM. This technique is designed to help decision makers structure the uncertain future through the consideration of a set of states, which are placed in different strata. The paper shows how the stratified MCDM technique in combination with the best-worst method (labelled stratified BWM) can be employed to compute the ranking of the available technologies. This research is expected to stimulate future applications of the stratified BWM to facilitate long-term decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3amulti-criteria decision making 3amunicipal solid waste 3auncertainty 3awaste disposal 0aMunicipal Solid Waste Management (MSW) 0aSustainable Waste Disposal Selection, Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) 0aBWM 0aSMCDM1 aMalmir, Behnam1 aRajabi Asadabadi, Mehdi0 tWaste management.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 122 p.100-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006900166300001600235520178100251592002802032650001902060650001602079650001202095650001002107650001902117650000902136650001302145650000902158650002002167650001602187650000902203650001102212650001502223650001602238650002502254650001602279651001602295700002302311700002502334773009402359856008102453852000902534655001202543IND4467653820221121001450.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446765382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2012.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Oort, P.A.J.10aWhy farmers’ sowing dates hardly change when temperature rises  ap. 102-111.  aPrevious studies have shown that temperature rise leads to an earlier onset of spring in wild plant species and that farmers are not keeping track of climate change. Crop growth models and experiments show yield gains to be obtained from earlier sowing. Why do farmers not sow earlier? We propose simple models on the relation between several weather variables and farmers’ sowing dates and test these models with 392 observed weekly sugar beet sowing percentages in the Netherlands. Data showed no correlation between spring temperature and sowing dates. However when we corrected for number of frost days in spring, we clearly saw earlier sowing at higher temperatures. Frost causes crumbling of the soil resulting in a nice seedbed; farmers sow later when there have been less frost days. Temperature rise “makes” farmers sow earlier, but the number or frost days simultaneously decreases and this “makes” farmers sow later. The combined effect is that temperature rise leads to only a small net advance in sowing date, 2 days per 1°C according to our model. Many climate change studies have assumed advances in sowing date are often larger than likely based on historical trends and models developed in this paper. Such studies may well be overly optimistic in projected yield gains that follow from earlier sowing. Our results also revealed that sowing dates were correlated with the sum of solar radiation over the preceding 7–10 months. This correlation remained significant also when other weather variables (rain, temperature, frost days) were accounted for. Our work raises the question what is the process causing this correlation and does such correlation with radiation sum also show up in other time series of phenological events or human behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3afarmers 3afrost 3ahuman behavior 3arain 3aseedbeds 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asowing date 3asows 3aspring 3asugar beet 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awild plants 3aNetherlands1 aTimmermans, B.G.H.1 avan Swaaij, A.C.P.M.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 July, v. 40 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2012.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008200174300001800256500002000274500001900294500000900313520143800322592002801760596001501788596003801803650002001841650001301861650001301874650001201887650002101899650000901920650002601929650002201955650001601977650002501993650002502018650001402043650001102057651001402068700002102082700001802103773013502121856008302256961001302339852000902352655001202361IND60663337020221118045455.0220803e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066333702DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2017.09.05642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsterholz, William R.10aAdjuvants for Prohexadione‐Calcium Applied to Alfalfa Interseeded into Corn  ap. 2687-2690.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Optimal adjuvant selection for ensuring effectiveness of prohexadione‐Ca applied to interseeded alfalfa is unknown. All adjuvants tested provided equivalent effectiveness for prohexadione‐Ca applied to interseeded alfalfa. Supplemental ammonium sulfate did not further enhance the effectiveness of prohexadione‐Ca. Application of the growth retardant prohexadione‐calcium (calcium 3‐oxido‐5‐oxo‐4‐propionylcyclohex‐3‐enecarboxylate; PHD) on interseeded alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) improves its establishment under silage corn (Zea mays L.). This study evaluated the relative effectiveness of crop oil concentrate (COC), high surfactant oil concentrate (HSOC), methylated seed oil (MSO), and nonionic surfactant (NIS) as adjuvants for commercially formulated PHD (Apogee) when applied with and without supplemental ammonium sulfate (AMS). Acidified solutions of PHD (0.25 kg a.i. ha⁻¹) plus adjuvants were sprayed on 23 to 27 cm tall glyphosate‐resistant alfalfa seedlings that were interseeded immediately after corn planting at two sites in Wisconsin. All PHD–adjuvant–AMS combinations were equally effective, reducing alfalfa height by an average of 16% within 4 wk after treatment and increasing alfalfa stand counts after corn harvest by 30% compared with the non‐PHD treated control. The results suggested a variety of adjuvants may be used when applying PHD to interseeded alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA‐ARS  cUniversity of Wisconsin‐Madison 3aMedicago sativa 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aalfalfa 3aammonium sulfate 3acorn 3aglyphosate resistance 3agrowth inhibitors 3amethylation 3anonionic surfactants 3aprohexadione calcium 3aseed oils 3asilage 3aWisconsin1 aGrabber, John H.1 aRenz, Mark J.0 tAgronomy journal.g2018 Nov., v. 110, no. 6 p.2687-2690dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2017.09.05643Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008800165300001600253520176200269592002802031650000802059650001502067650002402082650001702106650000902123650001702132650001102149650001102160650001202171700002402183773013702207856007702344852000902421655001202430IND60521288020221120221140.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052128802DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1967-02102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunnebacke, T.

Areas of the monolayer were transferred to support films, rotary shadowed, and observed in the electron microscope. Filaments of RNA obtained by extraction prior to spreading were similar in appearance and in distribution of contour lengths (0.2 to 1.2 μ) to those obtained by phenol extraction of the virus. Most of the filaments resulting from extraction of the virus suspension during spreading on a sodium perchlorate solution, however, were longer than 1 μ. The lengths of the longest filaments exceeded the 5 μ length predicted from chemical data for one single piece of complementary-stranded RNA in the reovirus particle.The short filaments, 1.2 μ and less in length, fell into a tri-modal pattern of length distribution with peaks at 0.35 μ, 0.60 μ and 1.10 μ. These shorter lengths probably resulted from breakage of the intact RNA during the extraction procedures. The consistently observed pattern of length distribution suggests that they represent relatively stable subunits of the molecule.Sodium perchlorate extracted reovirus RNA was thermally denatured in formaldehyde prior to spreading by the protein monolayer technique. Length distributions and relative numbers of filaments in the peaks of the tri-modal distribution pattern were similar to those found for unheated material when extracted prior to spreading. This similarity indicates that heating subsequent to extraction produced no further filament breakage. The thin, kinky appearance of the heated filaments, and the appearance of congruent pairs, indicated that heating had separated the strands of the complementary-stranded RNA subunits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aReoviridae 3aelectron microscopy 3aformaldehyde 3aheat 3aperchlorates 3aphenol 3asodium 3aviruses1 aKleinschmidt, A.

Distributions with heaps and censoring points can be found in many social science applications. For example, such distributions can be the result of sequential or multistep rating processes. Our model is a combination of a Craggit model and a generalized ordered probit model. It can account for multiple heaps and censoring points in distributions. We used this model to analyze a factorial survey experiment on earnings justice attitudes in the SOEP-Pretest 2008. In this experiment, a three-step rating instrument was used, which resulted in a rating distribution with heaps and censoring. Our generalized Craggit model fits the data of this experiment much better than a hierarchical linear model, which is the method that is usually implemented to analyze factorial survey experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aattitudes and opinions 3alinear models 3aprobit analysis 3asurveys 0aGeneralized Craggit Model 0aCensored data 0aHeaped data 0aCraggit model 0aStructural equation model 0aRating instruments 0aResponse scales 0aSequential responses 0aSurvey experiments1 aGross, Martin,0 tMethodsX.g2020, v. 7 p.100868-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.1008683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018800168300001600356500001900372520111600391592002801507650001301535650001301548650001401561650003001575650001401605650002001619650001001639650002601649650001201675650001901687653001801706653001701724653001901741653001501760700001901775700002401794773010001818856008101918852000901999655001202008IND60705911120221120070720.0200807e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070591112DNAL7 a10.1163/1876312X-000010102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnyder, Julia L.10aEvidence for the dissolution of the Calyptra minuticornis novaepommeraniae (Strand) and C. minuticornis minuticornis (Guenée) sub-species distinction (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Erebidae)  ap. 784-809.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe species Calyptra minuticornis is divided into two subspecies: C. minuticornis novaepommeraniae (Strand) and C. minuticornis minuticornis (Guenée) based on minor morphological differences, geographic distribution, and differential feeding behaviors in the adults. In this study, museum specimens were examined, including the holotypes of C. novaepommeraniae and C. minuticornis. A comprehensive distribution map was generated for C. minuticornis. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance provided some statistical evidence for minor differences between the male genitalic morphology. Additionally, the maximum parsimony analysis of the C. minuticornis subspecies complex resulted in a polytomy and did not represent natural groupings. From these results, it can be concluded that C. minuticornis novaepommeraniae and C. minuticornis minuticornis should be synonymized. A redescription of the species and a revised checklist for the genus is also provided. This includes synonymization of Wolframmeyia Behounek, Hacker & Speidel with Calyptra and evidence that Percalpe Berio is an unavailable name.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalyptra 3aErebidae 3aevolution 3ageographical distribution 3aholotypes 3ainsect taxonomy 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3amuseums 3aredescriptions 0avampire moths 0anomenclature 0afruit piercing 0amorphology1 aZilli, Alberto1 aZaspel, Jennifer M.0 tInsect systematics & evolution.g, v. 51, no. 4 p.784-809dBrillwJournal:2156x1399-560X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1876312X-000010103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245007700204300001600281500002000297520145100317592002801768596009201796650001401888650001201902650002001914650001201934650001801946650002201964650001101986650001601997650001002013651002202023700002302045700002002068773011102088856007502199852000902274655001202283IND60786674920221119215016.0220805e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078667492DNAL7 a10.1002/cche.101402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Richard M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0176-411X10aUsing big data to predict the likelihood of low falling numbers in wheat  ap. 411-420.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preharvest sprouting in wheat reduces quality and impacts farmer profitability. The international recognized falling number test can be used to measure that damage. Trying to understand the complex interactions that cause a reduction in wheat quality, equating to low falling number levels, is challenging. An alternative research approach to replicated experiments was to use a multiseason dataset of load‐by‐load delivery information to investigate whether correlations between falling number levels and 40 climate measurements could be identified. FINDINGS: This study used over 250,000 falling number data points from individual truckloads tested during seven harvests in Western Australia. The analyses identified relative humidity measured at the maximum temperature and daily temperature range as having consistent correlations with falling number levels over multiple seasons. Other climate measurements were also observed to have significant correlations with falling number, but these were less consistent within and between seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The linkage of humidity and temperature range levels in the period before harvest commences to the occurrence of low falling number levels helps to further understand the complex interactions that change starch quality. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: The findings demonstrate that value can be obtained from the use of a large, nonexperimentally designed dataset.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Agribusiness Innovation Fund 3achemistry 3aclimate 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aprofitability 3arelative humidity 3astarch 3atemperature 3awheat 3aWestern Australia1 aDiepeveen, Dean A.1 aEvans, Fiona H.0 tCereal chemistry.g2019 May, v. 96, no. 3 p.411-420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cche.101403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016300171300001800334500001500352520068800367592002801055650002401083650002601107650001401133650002101147653001701168700002401185700001201209700002501221700001701246700002601263700002501289700002101314700002301335773011701358856008201475990002301557852000901580655001201589IND60091081920221121022049.0141103e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009108192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulakayala, Naveen10aInCl₃-catalysed synthesis of 2-aryl quinazolin-4(3H)-ones and 5-aryl pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-ones and their evaluation as potential anticancer agents  ap. 5063-5066.  a2019-12-06  aA convenient and practical methodology for the synthesis of 2-aryl quinazolin-4(3H)-ones by the condensation of o-aminobenzamides with aromatic aldehydes under mild conditions using catalytic InCl₃ with good yields and high selectivities.

Specifically, shifts in gluten structure from β‐turns to β‐sheets in doughs with bran may be partially responsible for quality defects in whole grain bread. This study aimed to further that knowledge by monitoring gluten secondary structure in soft and hard wheat refined and whole grain bread at different stages during processing. Commercial hard red spring (HW) and soft red winter wheat (SW) flours were used to make breads with whole grain doughs created by substituting bran for 15% of the refined flour. ATR‐FTIR spectra were collected from samples and analyzed for gluten secondary structural content. FINDINGS: Freshly mixed doughs demonstrated the greatest β‐sheet content (53%–57%) compared to any other dough stage. Refined HW doughs demonstrated continual relaxation of β‐sheets to β‐turns through dough processing (−13% to panning), whereas relaxed SW doughs (−6% to 10%) partially reverted to sheets during punching and panning (1%–3%). The data also confirmed earlier findings that the presence of bran triggers the formation of additional β‐sheets (+4% to 5%) in both HW and SW doughs. Doughs with bran exhibited less structural relaxation (−3% to 6% β‐sheets) during processing. Interestingly, HW doughs exhibited only 1%–2% more β‐turns and only 1%–4% fewer β‐sheets than SW doughs. Analysis of the bread during baking revealed that SW generates a larger sheets:turns ratio compared to HW in refined bread, 21.3 versus 3.6, respectively, that grows to 129 versus 5.3 on addition of bran. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten structural relaxation takes place during proofing in optimally hydrated doughs and largely follows water relaxation trends. The ratio of sheets:turns increases rapidly as water is lost during baking. The extent of this build‐up in the ratio is dependent on the wheat source for the flour (hard vs. soft wheat), presence/absence of bran, and the water loss (i.e., denaturation). SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: These results show that the ability of gluten to resist significant loss of bulk water during baking is related to better bread making performance. Additionally, the ability of gluten to resist substantial secondary structural alteration during baking, specifically formation of excessive β‐sheets, may be a key factor in high‐quality bread.  aPublisher supplied data 3abran 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3adenaturation 3adough 3aflour 3agluten 3asoft red winter wheat 3aspring 3awhole grain foods0 tCereal chemistry.g2019 May, v. 96, no. 3 p.520-531dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cche.101523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245018200171300001600353500001400369520114600383592002801529650002001557650001301577650002201590650001001612650001601622650001501638650001001653650001201663653001801675653003001693653005801723653002401781653002401805700002701829773010901856856007701965852000902042655001202051IND60726980520221121124515.0210209e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072698052DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2013-034772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarıçoban, Cemalettin10aEffect of thyme/cumin essential oils and butylated hydroxyl anisole/butylated hydroxyl toluene on physicochemical properties and oxidative/microbial stability of chicken patties  ap. 456-463.  aNAL-light  aIn this study, effects of thyme/cumin essential oils (EO) and butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA)/butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) on physicochemical properties and storage stability of chicken patties were compared in different storage periods (0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d). It was found that there were significant (P < 0.05) differences between physicochemical properties of patty samples treated with EO and the synthetic antioxidants. The EO showed similar performance to those of BHA and BHT in limiting TBARS values of chicken patty samples. Similarity in performance was also the case for microbial stability (total aerobic mesophilic, psychrotrophic, lactic acid, and coliform bacteria as well as molds and yeasts); namely, their effects were significant (P < 0.05). Effect of thyme EO was significant (P < 0.05) and remarkable, not allowing any coliform bacteria to grow in the samples. Given that EO were obtained from natural sources, the data suggested that the EO might be more useful than their synthetic counterparts, BHA and BHT, as additives for chicken patties to maintain oxidative/microbial stability and increase shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken patties 3achickens 3acoliform bacteria 3acumin 3alactic acid 3ashelf life 3athyme 3atoluene 0achicken patty 0athyme/cumin essential oil 0abutylated hydroxyl anisole/butylated hydroxyl toluene 0aoxidative stability 0amicrobial stability1 aYilmaz, Mustafa Tahsin0 tPoultry science.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 93, no. 2 p.456-463dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2013-034773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013600206300001100342506007600353520214200429592002802571596005102599506003702650650002802687650001902715650001802734650001202752650002602764650001302790650001902803650001402822650002202836650000902858650002302867650001002890650001202900650001202912650002502924650001602949650001602965650001302981700002702994700001703021700001503038773011903053856008203172852000903254655001203263IND60632652320221207133150.0200220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063265232DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-019-0449-12doi7 aPMC64170182pmcid7 a308669912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWistedt, Anna10aAge-related changes in the shell gland and duodenum in relation to shell quality and bone strength in commercial laying hen hybrids  ap. 14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: During the production period of laying hens, the number of cracked eggshells increases and the skeleton becomes brittle. Both these problems are related to ageing of the hen and cause economic problems for egg producers and impaired animal welfare. This study investigated key factors in the shell gland and duodenum related to eggshell quality and bone strength in laying hens during the production period. Five Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and five Lohmann Brown (LB), common hybrids in commercial egg production, were euthanized at 21, 29, 49 and 70 weeks (wk) of age. Blood samples for analysis of total calcium were taken at euthanization. Right femur and humerus were used for bone strength measurements and tissue samples from shell gland and duodenum were processed for morphology, immunohistochemical localisation of oestrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ), plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) and histochemical localisation of carbonic anhydrases (CA). Eggs were collected for shell quality measurements. RESULTS: At age 49 week, shell and bone strength had both deteriorated, but the hens were then able to maintain the level until 70 week of age and femur bone strength even improved. The main physiological findings associated with the effects seen at 49 week were reduced gland density and a shift in balance between ERα and ERβ in the shell gland, which coincided with a reduction in CA activity in the duodenum. Somewhat surprisingly, capillary density and capillaries with CA activity both increased in the shell gland over time, the latter possibly mediated via ERβ. These findings were independent of hybrid. PMCA was found in both shell gland and duodenum, but appeared unrelated to the age-related changes in shell and bone quality. CONCLUSIONS: In hens around half-way through the production period, both shell quality and bone strength had deteriorated. Decreased gland density and a shift in the balance between ERα and ERβ in the shell gland, co-occurring with a dramatic drop in duodenal CA activity, are suggested as possible factors involved in age-related changes in shell and bone quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a221-2006-2029cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3ablood sampling 3abone strength 3acalcium 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aduodenum 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aegg shell quality 3aeggs 3aestrogen receptors 3afemur 3ahumerus 3ahybrids 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alaying hens 3ashell gland 3askeleton1 aRidderstråle, Yvonne,1 aWall, Helena1 aHolm, Lena0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2019 Dec., v. 61, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-019-0449-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008700159520108500246592002801331650002501359650002001384650002101404650001101425650001801436650003001454650002601484650001601510650001201526650001301538651001001551700001801561700001901579773012701598856007501725852000901800655001201809IND60652801220221121044307.0190713e20190213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065280122DNAL7 a10.3390/su110409602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Meijing 10aDestination Service Encounter Modeling and Relationships with Tourist Satisfaction  aTourists are in contact with two types of services at destinations: enterprise services offered by tourism enterprises (e.g., hotels, shops, restaurants, etc.) and public services (public transportation, public information, public safety, etc.) provided by the local government. Following Churchill&rsquo;s (1979) procedures, a model of destination service encounters (DSEs), including four dimensions (i.e.,enterprise personal interaction encounters (EPIEs), enterprise physical environment encounters (EPEEs), public personal interaction encounters (PPIEs), public physical environment encounters (PPEEs), and 10 subdimensions, was constructed. Then, the effects of DSEs on tourist satisfaction (TS) were tested with data collected in Shaoshan Township, China. The results revealed that EPIEs, PPIEs, and PPEEs had significant positive effects on TS. This model promotes the application of service encounter (SE) theory in destination management, and it offers implications for the synergy management of public and private sectors at destinations to improve tourist experiences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adata collection 3alocal government 3amodels 3apublic safety 3apublic services and goods 3apublic transportation 3arestaurants 3atourism 3atourists 3aChina1 aWang, Fuyuan 1 aWang, Kaiyong 0 tSustainability.g2019 Feb. 13, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110409603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009000174300001800264520030300282592002800585650001000613650001600623650001600639650003700655650002300692700001600715700001700731700002300748700002000771700001900791700002000810700001600830700002400846773011700870856008200987990002301069852000901092655001201101IND60091082120221121045902.0141103e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009108212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.05.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsufuji, Tetsuyoshi10aDiscovery and optimization of novel fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) inhibitors  ap. 5067-5070.  aThe discovery, optimization and structure–activity relationship of novel FATP1 inhibitors have been described.

Despite demonstrated relationships between such traditional indices and yield, NDVI saturates at larger leaf area index (LAI) values, and it is affected by soil background. We present results obtained with several new narrow-band hyperspectral indices calculated from the Airborne Visible and Near Infrared (AVNIR) hyperspectral sensor flown over a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field in California (USA) collected over an entire growing season at 1-m spatial resolution. Within-field variability of yield monitor spatial data collected during harvest was correlated with hyperspectral indices related to crop growth and canopy structure, chlorophyll concentration, and water content. The time-series of indices calculated from the imagery were assessed to understand within-field yield variability in cotton at different growth stages. A K means clustering method was used to perform field segmentation on hyperspectral indices in classes of low, medium, and high yield, and confusion matrices were used to calculate the kappa (κ) coefficient and overall accuracy. Structural indices related to LAI [Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Modified Triangular Vegetation Index (MTVI), and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI)] obtained the best relationships with yield and field segmentation at early growth stages. Hyperspectral indices related to crop physiological status [Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Index (MCARI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption Index (TCARI)] were superior at later growth stages, close to harvest. From confusion matrices and class analyses, the overall accuracy (and kappa) of RDVI at early stages was 61% (κ = 0.39), dropping to 39% (κ = 0.08) before harvest. The MCARI chlorophyll index remained sensitive to within-field yield variability at late preharvest stage, obtaining overall accuracy of 51% (κ = 0.22).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aabsorption 3aagronomy 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acotton 3aleaf area index 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphysiological state 3asoil 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awater content 3aCalifornia1 aUstin, S.

Efficient planning methodologies can assist forest engineers in either preventing or reducing the environmental impacts of forest roads. In this study, we first prepared an inclusive landslide susceptibility map for our study area using a Bayesian model. We next designed 12 road network alternatives using PEGGER, an ArcView GIS extension. We extracted the values of these alternatives from the susceptibility map to evaluate their environmental feasibility. We also evaluated the alternatives from an economic perspective using a model for conducting cost estimates of the forest roads. Our results show that this approach is useful for identifying the alternative that meets environmental and economic goals. The policy implications of this study suggest that if the development of road networks in mountainous areas is an important forestry goal, mechanisms should be aimed primarily at controlling slope instability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acase studies 3acost estimates 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest roads 3aforestry 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aissues and policy 3alandslides 3amodels 3aplanning 3aIran 0aCaspian forest 0aLandslide susceptibility assessment 0aCost estimation model 0aWeight of evidence model 0aPEGGER1 aNajafi, Akbar1 aRezaeian, Javad1 aSattarian, Ali1 aGhajar, Ismael0 tLand use policy.g2015 Sept., v. 47 p.198-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245012100208300001100329506007600340520120000416592002801616506003701644650001501681650001601696650000901712650001201721650001101733650001101744650001601755651001201771651001201783651001101795700002401806700002001830773011901850856008201969852000902051655001202060IND60632652420221207133202.0200220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063265242DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-019-0450-82doi7 aPMC64194152pmcid7 a308716412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaila, Marianne10aComparative study of rabies antibody titers of dogs vaccinated in Finland and imported street dogs vaccinated abroad  ap. 15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeventy-two canine serum samples were analyzed for post-vaccination serum titers of rabies antibodies. The samples were divided into two groups: Group 1 dogs (n = 36) were imported dogs from the Russian Federation (n = 31) or Romania (n = 5), with a mean serum antibody titer value of 1.54 IU/mL. Group 2 dogs (n = 36) were Finnish dogs vaccinated in Finland, with a mean titer of 4.19 IU/mL. Altogether, 14 (39%) dogs (CI 95% 23–56) were without detectable antibodies (≤ 0.1 IU/mL) in Group 1, whereas in Group 2, all dogs had an antibody titer greater than 0.1 IU/mL. A statistically significant difference was observed between these groups when comparing the proportions of dogs with antibody levels less than or exceeding 0.5 IU/mL. In Group 1, 19 out of the 36 dogs (CI 95% 36–70) had serum titer values < 0.5 IU/mL, while in Group 2, only 2 dogs had serum titer values < 0.5 IU/mL. Despite the small sample size, this raises concern over the imported dogs having insufficient antibody levels required for international travel and implies that these dogs had perhaps not been vaccinated, even though they had documentation of vaccination upon arrival.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adogs 3aimports 3arabies 3atravel 3avaccination 3aFinland 3aRomania 3aRussia1 aMarjoniemi, Jasmine1 aNokireki, Tiina0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2019 Dec., v. 61, no. 1 p.15-15dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-019-0450-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015500164300001800319520075300337592002801090650001201118650002101130650002101151650001701172650001001189650001701199650001801216650002601234650001501260650002001275700001601295700001701311700001201328700001501340773010401355856008101459852000901540655001201549IND60576945820221118041610.0170806e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057694582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2367-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiaofan10aApplication of biodegradable 3D-printed cage for cervical diseases via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF): an in vitro biomechanical study  ap. 1433-1439.  aOBJECTIVES: To design and fabricate a 3D-printed cervical cage composite of polylactic acid (PLA)/nano-sized and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP).

In the present study DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) was identified as interacting partner of VP8. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with VP8 identified DDB1 as a protein interacting with VP8. The interaction between VP8 and DDB1 was confirmed based on co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization in both VP8-transfected and BHV-1 infected cells. DDB1 was distributed both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm with some nuclear speckles prior to BHV-1 infection, became perinuclear by 4h and was predominantly nuclear at 5h post infection, where it co-localized with VP8. In contrast, in cells infected with a UL47 deletion mutant DDB1 remained cytoplasmic throughout the course of infection. This suggests that VP8 mediates nuclear re-localization of DDB1. Finally, VP8 was shown to be monoubiquitinated both in VP8-transfected and BHV-1-infected cells. These data suggest that BHV-1 VP8 interacts with DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which correlates to monoubiquitination of this viral protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aDNA damage 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3abinding proteins 3acytoplasm 3amutants 3amass spectrometry 0aBovine herpesvirus 11 aSnider, Marlene1 aLabiuk, Shaunivan L.1 aLobanov, Vladislav A.1 aBabiuk, Lorne A.1 avan Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, Sylvia0 tVirus research.g2012 July, v. 167, no. 1 p.56-66dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03975naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016400164520178800328592002802116650002302144650005202167650001102219650001502230650001402245650002102259650001202280650001102292650001402303650002502317650001302342650001102355650000902366650001502375653002702390653004002417653003402457653001402491653002602505653002402531700003202555700002202587700001302609700002002622700002202642700002002664700002702684700001602711700002102727700002102748700001702769700001702786700002002803700001302823700001602836700001602852700001402868700002502882700002002907700001902927700001902946700002402965700001802989700001503007773012703022856008303149852000903232655001203241IND60726022420221120180926.0220321e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072602242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1130082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, He S.10aTesting-on-a-probe biosensors reveal association of early SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies and surrogate neutralizing antibodies with mortality in COVID-19 patients  aThe association of mortality with the early humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection within the first few days after onset of symptoms (DAOS) has not been thoroughly investigated partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive antibody testing methods. Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0–7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aadults 3abiosensors 3ahospitals 3ahumoral immunity 3aliquids 3amodels 3amortality 3aneutralization tests 3apatients 3aquartz 3arisk 3aviral load 0aAcute humoral response 0aCoronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) 0aTesting-on-a-probe biosensors 0aMortality 0aNeutralizing antibody 0aSARS-CoV-2 antibody1 aRacine-Brzostek, Sabrina E.1 aKarbaschi, Mohsen1 aYee, Jim1 aDillard, Alicia1 aSteel, Peter A.D.1 aLee, William T.1 aMcDonough, Kathleen A.1 aQiu, Yuqing1 aKetas, Thomas J.1 aFrancomano, Erik1 aKlasse, P.J.1 aHatem, Layla1 aWestblade, Lars1 aWu, Heng1 aChen, Haode1 aZuk, Robert1 aTan, Hong1 aGirardin, Roxanne C.1 aDupuis, Alan P.1 aPayne, Anne F.1 aMoore, John P.1 aCushing, Melissa M.1 aChadburn, Amy1 aZhao, Zhen0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 178 p.113008-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1130083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245004500172300001800217520036400235592002800599650001400627650003200641650002900673650002600702650001600728700002200744700001900766700001900785700002300804700002000827700001800847700001400865700001900879773011700898856008201015990002301097852000901120655001201129IND60091082420221121045933.0141103e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009108242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.05.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEissenstat, Michael10aEnamino-oxindole HIV protease inhibitors  ap. 5078-5083.  aWe have designed and synthesized a series of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with enamino-oxindole substituents optimized to interact with the S2′ subsite of the HIV protease binding pocket.

Five sampling sites were selected along the gradient of the river. Fish sampling was carried out using Frame net of 3-mm stretched mesh size from February through April, 2018. There was a considerable variation in river depth and width at all sites. A total of 3018 fish categorized under three species belonging to the Family Cyprinidae, namely, Garra quadrimaculata, Garra dembeensis and Labeobarbus beso were identified. Garra quadrimaculata was numerically the most dominant species in all sampling sites. Perhaps, there was no fish specimen caught from S-I. Similarly, the highest and lowest number of G. dembeensis was collected from S-V (42.73%) and S-II (2.51%), respectively. The composition of L. beso was higher at S-IV (49.1%), but no L. beso collected from S-I and S-II. High number of fish was caught from the pool parts at all sites. Shannon diversity index (H’) varied between 0.14 and 0.80, and evenness index (J’) varied from 0.2 to 1.7, but H’ and J’ of S-I were zero due to the absence of species in the area. Based on Shannon index, the upper Awash River was categorized as an impacted river. Therefore, effective management of the river is very imperative for sustainable utilization of fish resources.  aThis work was supported by Ambo University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarra 3aLabeobarbus 3aagriculture 3adominant species 3afish 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia 0aAbundance 0aDiversity 0aUpper Awash Basin1 aZenebe Tadesse,1 aTemesgen, Mathewos1 aGonzález-Redondo, Pedro0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 7, no. 1 p.1974181-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.19741813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014200157300001800299500001400317500002000331520114200351592002801493596005901521596005901580596007401639650002501713650001401738650001401752650001001766650001401776650001801790650001801808650002101826650003101847650001801878650003101896650001501927650000901942650000901951650001301960650001401973700001601987700002002003700005102023773012802074856007302202852000902275655001202284IND60717043520221121050821.0201107e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071704352DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.229972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yeqian10aComparative assessment of neurotoxicity impacts induced by alkyl tri‐n‐butyl phosphate and aromatic tricresyl phosphate in PC12 cells  ap. 1326-1333.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOrganophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have become a growing concern due to their potential environmental and health risk. However, limited studies have described the toxicity, particularly neurotoxicity of alkyl and aromatic OPFRs. This study investigated the neurotoxicity of alkyl tri‐n‐butyl phosphate (TnBP) and aromatic tricresyl phosphate (TCP) to rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells for 24 h. Viability detection showed dose‐response toxicity effect of TCP and TnBP to PC12 cells. The half‐maximal inhibitory concentration of 24 h (24 h‐IC₅₀) of TCP and TnBP were 2415.61 and 338.09 μM, respectively. Both TnBP and TCP significantly changed the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and TnBP is more likely to cause neurotoxicity to PC12 cells compared to TCP. Also, The results of LDH and caspase‐3 activity detection as well as Hoechst staining suggested that cell apoptosis induced by TCP and TnBP may be the primary pathway. These findings provide a toxicity data of aromatic and alkyl‐substituted OPFRs to PC12 cells, and a new insight into the toxicity of OPFRs on health risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  a41571468cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41773115cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBE2016736cScience and Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acells 3adetection 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3aflame retardants 3ahealth effects assessments 3aneurotoxicity 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3arats 3arisk 3astaining 3aviability1 aCui, Haiyan1 aJiang, Xiaofeng1 aLi, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0127-91730 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2020 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.1326-1333dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.229973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015900181300001800340520159800358592002801956650002101984650001002005650001802015650001602033650002402049650000902073650000902082650001802091650001402109650002002123650001602143650001802159650001202177650001402189650002302203650001302226650001202239650001002251650001002261650001002271650002402281650002102305653001002326653002702336653001802363653002702381653001402408700001402422700001302436700001202449700001602461700001502477773011502492856008202607852000902689655001202698IND60539992820221118025413.0190804e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053999282DNAL7 a269481812pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111600032X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Z.

Fifty-six 91-day-old male Mule ducks with similar BW were randomly assigned to seven treatments, with eight birds per treatment. Birds were housed in individual pens. At 102 days of age, final BW was measured and BW gain and feed conversion ratio of ducks from each treatment were calculated from day 91 to 102, and then all ducks were slaughtered to evaluate the yields of skin with subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, breast meat (including pectoralis major and pectoralis minor), leg meat (including thigh and drum stick), and liver. Significant differences in BW gain, total liver weight and liver relative weight were observed among the treatments (P<0.001). According to the broken-line regression analysis, the optimal feed consumption levels of male Mule ducks from 91 to 102 days of age for maximum BW gain, total liver weight and liver relative weight were 217, 227 and 216 g feed/kg BW⁰.⁷⁵·per day, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCairina moschata 3aPekin 3aabdominal fat 3abreast meat 3acarcass composition 3acorn 3adiet 3adose response 3aducklings 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeding level 3afemales 3afoie gras 3agrowth performance 3ahatching 3ahybrids 3aliver 3amales 3amules 3aregression analysis 3asubcutaneous fat 0aducks 0afeed consumption level 0aforce-feeding 0aproduction performance 0afoie gras1 aJiang, Y.1 aTang, J.1 aXie, M.1 aYang, P.

While APV is thought to have increased in prevalence in recent years, no study has carefully evaluated the threat this pathogen poses to the Galápagos avifauna. In this paper, we examine the course of the APV epidemic in seven species of Galápagos finch on Santa Cruz Island (Geospiza fuliginosa, G. fortis, G. magnirostris, G. scandens, Camarhynchus parvulus, Cactospiza pallida, and Certhidea olivacea). We describe temporal changes in the prevalence of the avian pox disease (AP) caused by APV and the proportion of individuals that have recovered from AP from 2000 to 2009. Then we examine species differences in susceptibility to AP and how this variation correlates with differences in innate immune function. We show that AP prevalence has increased dramatically from 2000 to 2009. However, this increase in prevalence varied by species; specifically, we found that prevalence increased rapidly in G. fuliginosa, C. parvulus, G. scandens, and C. olivacea, but not at all in G. fortis. Furthermore, innate immune function varies between years and species, and this variation correlates with increased prevalence and species variation in susceptibility to APV. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate significant interannual variation in innate immune function in wild birds, and to show that this immune variation correlates with susceptibility to an introduced disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3ainterspecific variation 3aislands 3aFringillidae 3aviruses 3adisease resistance 3awild birds 3abird diseases 3apathogens 3aHawaii 0aspecies differences1 aLee, Kelly A.1 aKlasing, Kirk C.1 aWikelski, Martin0 tBiological conservation.g2012 Sept., v. 153 p.72-79dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014300175520166800318536006801986592002802054596001302082650001902095650001602114650002502130650001402155650001902169650002402188650002202212650001602234650001802250650001202268650001702280650001302297650001302310650001402323650001602337650001302353651001302366653002902379653002002408653002902428700002602457700002002483700002502503773010902528856008602637852000902723655001202732IND60761477720221120075913.0211229e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076147772DNAL7 a10.1080/23311932.2021.20058962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesfa, Ephrem Worku10aVariance components in recombinant inbred lines of Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter L.]: Estimation and their implications in selection  aTef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter L.] is an indigenous and important cereal crop in Ethiopia. Its improvement is dependent on the presence and magnitude of genetic variation among traits in a given environment. Forty-nine tef genotypes (RILs and checks) were evaluated in 2019 to assess the nature of genetic variability, broad sense heritability and genetic advance of traits using 7 × 7 simple lattice design. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences among the genotypes except for thousand seed weight. About 53% of the genotypes provided higher yield than the latest improved variety (Ebba), implied that most of the studied RILs varied for grain yield. Higher phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation found for main shoot panicle weight, main shoot panicle grain yield, fertile tiller number and days to heading, grain-filling period, main-shoot panicle length, total-tiller number, fertile-tiller number, main-shoot panicle weight, main-shoot panicle grain yield, grain yield and harvest index, implying the presence of adequate variability within the genotypes for these traits. High values of broad sense heritability coupled with high genetic advance as percent of the mean were observed for days to heading, grain-filling period, peduncle length, fertile-tiller number and grain yield indicating the contribution of additive genes for trait expression and possibility of traits improvement through direct selection. Generally, this considerable genetic variability among the RILs confirmed the possibility of improving tef productivity, while most of these RILs should further be studied on more test locations.  aThis work was supported by the University of Gondar [Plsc1122].  aPublisher supplied data  aPlsc1122 3aEragrostis tef 3aagriculture 3aanalysis of variance 3acultivars 3afilling period 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aheading 3aheritability 3apanicles 3apeduncle 3aphenotype 3aseed weight 3avariance 3aEthiopia 0aCoefficient of variation 0agenetic advance 0arecombinant inbred lines1 aDejene Abebe, Tiegist1 aWorede, Fisseha1 aMoral, Manuel Tejada0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 7, no. 1 p.2005896-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.20058963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002300162245005400185300001400239500001900253500000900272520043200281592002800713650002300741650002100764650001300785650001200798650001400810650000900824650002100833650001600854700001800870773012000888856009701008852000901105655001201114IND60663337820221118045403.0191122e196401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066333782DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1964.00021962005600010004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchillinger, J.

To date, only a few cases have been described in Asia. In this study, we describe the clinical features of two Chinese patients with EPP, with diagnosis confirmed by the increase of free protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, detection of plasma fluorescence peak at 630–634 nm, and analysis of FECH gene mutations. Using gene scanning, we identified a small deletion in the FECH gene (c.973 delA) in one proband (patient A) and a pathogenic FECH mutation (c.1232 G>T) in the other (patient B) and also observed some nucleotide variations (c.798 C>G, c.921 A>G, IVS1−23 C>T, IVS3+23 A>G, IVS9+35 C>T, and IVS3−48 T>C) in these patients. The family pedigree of patient A was then established by characterization of the genotype of the patient’s relatives. We also analyzed the potential perniciousness of the missense mutation with bioinformatic software, Polyphen and Sift. In summary, Chinese EPP patients have similar manifestations to those of Caucasians, and identification of the Chinese FECH gene mutations expands the FECH genotypic spectrum and may contribute to genetic counseling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWhites 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer software 3acounseling 3aerythrocytes 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenotype 3aheme 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amissense mutation 3apatients 3apedigree 3aprotoporphyrin 3aChina1 aWang, Yong-wei1 aYang, Chen1 aLiu, Gang1 aDu, Ya-li1 aNie, Guang-jun1 aChang, Yan-Zhong,1 aHan, Bing0 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2016 Oct., v. 17, no. 10 p.813-820dZhejiang University Pressx1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B16000853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015400178300001600332500001900348520140800367592002801775650001301803650001001816650001801826650001201844650002201856650001801878650001601896650001501912650000901927650001101936650002401947650002001971650001601991650001602007650000902023650001502032650001302047650001602060650001602076650001902092650001502111653002102126653002502147653002102172653001102193700002102204700002102225700002202246700002502268700002902293700002702322773011702349856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60717043620221121050740.0201107e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071704362DNAL7 a10.1080/10495398.2019.16225562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Tawab, Ahmed M.

A week after parturition, cows were grouped into three treatments of 10 cows each and fed a control treatment containing corn silage at 300 g/kg DM. In the other treated diets, 50% or 100% of the control corn silage was substituted with beet tops silage treated with LAB included at 150 g or 300 g per kg diet. Ensiling of beet tops with LAB decreased its contents of oxalic acid and neutral detergent and acid detergent fibers but increased its contents of non-structural carbohydrate and calcium. Without affecting daily milk production and feed efficiency, beet tops silage treated with LAB diets decreased (p < 0.05) feed intake, total ruminal volatile fatty acids, acetate and propionate concentrations, energy-corrected milk yield and concentrations of milk total solids, fat, protein and energy. In conclusion, beet tops silage treated with LAB can replace corn silage in diets of lactating cows. An inclusion rate of 15% of beet tops silage treated with LAB (replacing 50% of corn silage) in the diet was the most suitable level for lactating cows under the current experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abeets 3abiotechnology 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbohydrates 3acorn silage 3adetergents 3adiet 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alactic acid 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amolasses 3aoxalic acid 3aparturition 3apropionic acid 3asugar beet 0aBeet tops silage 0alactic acid bacteria 0arumen parameters 0acattle1 aKholif, Ahmed E.1 aHassan, Ayman M.1 aMatloup, Osama H.1 aEl-Nor, Salah A.

Peri-urban agriculture plays a key role in this dynamic, functioning in a complex system that includes a large and diverse set of stakeholders which act to provide environmental and economic services to cities. The work described in this paper was undertaken to develop a methodology to map land use competition in terms of vulnerability to urbanization of agricultural lands, based on explicit spatial indicators set up in a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis (hereafter GIS-MCDA). The applied indicators are generated from an analysis of existing drivers of land use competition within the peri-urban area of Meknes (Morocco). This area is particularly interesting because of its agricultural characteristics, and because of recent changes in the dynamics of land use and tenure. This case study indicates a high risk of land competition in 37% of the area examined, and a very high risk in 16% of the area. The highest risk areas are located in the southern part of the peri-urban region, which is also considered the most valuable in terms of agricultural production. The map we have developed can be considered a preliminary tool for improving new planning strategies to manage land resource competition in rural–urban fringe zones. The approach presented is particularly useful as a simplified methodology to obtain spatialized indicators for the drivers of land use competition when data are limited, as often found in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3acities 3adeveloping countries 3ageographic information systems 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aplanning 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3aurban agriculture 3aurbanization 3aMorocco 0aVulnerability to urbanization 0aLand use planning 0aPeri-urban areas 0aSpatial multi-criteria analysis 0aGIS-MCDA 0aSpatial explicit indicators1 aValette, Élodie,1 aFrançois, Marie,1 aChéry, Jean-Pierre0 tLand use policy.g2015 Sept., v. 47 p.373-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04556naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245012000205300001100325506007600336520260200412592002803014596006803042506003703110650000803147650002203155650001803177650002003195650002303215650001003238650002803248650001903276650002603295650002603321650001903347650001103366650001503377650001303392650001503405650001903420650002203439650002003461700001403481700001403495700001503509700001603524700001303540700001903553700001503572700002303587700001803610700001103628700001403639700005603653773011803709856008203827852000903909655001203918IND60632653020221207133154.0200304e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063265302DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-019-1399-62doi7 aPMC64172182pmcid7 a309113322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yongfu10aPrediction and characterization of promoters and ribosomal binding sites of Zymomonas mobilis in system biology era  ap. 52.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Zymomonas mobilis is a model bacterial ethanologen with many systems biology studies reported. Besides lignocellulosic ethanol production, Z. mobilis has been developed as a platform for biochemical production through metabolic engineering. However, identification and rigorous understanding of the genetic origins of cellular function, especially those based in non-coding region of DNA, such as promoters and ribosomal binding sites (RBSs), are still in its infancy. This knowledge is crucial for the effective application of Z. mobilis to new industrial applications of biotechnology for fuels and chemicals production. RESULTS: In this study, we explored the possibility to systematically predict the strength of promoters based on systems biology datasets. The promoter strength was clustered based on the expression values of downstream genes (or proteins) from systems biology studies including microarray, RNA-Seq and proteomics. Candidate promoters with different strengths were selected for further characterization, which include 19 strong, nine medium, and ten weak ones. A dual reporter-gene system was developed which included appropriate reporter genes. These are the opmCherry reporter gene driven by the constitutive PlacUV5 promoter for calibration, and EGFP reporter gene driven by candidate promoters for quantification. This dual reporter-gene system was confirmed using the inducible promoter, Ptet, which was used to determine the strength of these predicted promoters with different strengths. In addition, the dual reporter-gene system was applied to determine four synthetic RBSs with different translation initiation rates based on the prediction from bioinformatics server RBS calculator. Our results showed that the correlations between the prediction and experimental results for the promoter and RBS strength are relatively high, with R² values more than 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only identified and characterized 38 promoters and four RBSs with different strengths for future metabolic engineering in Z. mobilis, but also established a flow cytometry-based dual reporter-gene system to characterize genetic elements including, but not limited to the promoters and RBSs studied in this work. This study also suggested the feasibility of predicting and selecting candidate genetic elements based on omics datasets and bioinformatics tools. Moreover, the dual reporter-gene system developed in this study can be utilized to characterize other genetic elements of Z. mobilis, which can also be applied to other microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018ACA149cTechnical Innovation Special Fund of Hubei Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aZymomonas mobilis 3abinding sites 3adata collection 3aethanol production 3afuels 3aindustrial applications 3alignocellulose 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroarray technology 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3areporter genes 3asequence analysis 3asystems biology1 aShen, Wei1 aHuang, Ju1 aLi, Runxia1 aXiao, Yubei1 aWei, Hui1 aChou, Yat-Chen1 aZhang, Min1 aHimmel, Michael E.1 aChen, Shouwen1 aYi, Li1 aMa, Lixin1 aYang, Shihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9394-91480 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.52-52dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1399-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001200287500001500299520137500314592002801689650002301717650001701740650001201757650001701769650001401786650001001800650002101810650002301831650002201854650001601876650001901892650002701911650001101938650001101949650001301960650002001973650001201993650004402005650001302049650001102062650002102073650001202094650001002106653001702116700002102133700001802154700002602172700002102198700002702219700002502246700001902271773011402290856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60556116920221119004118.0161104e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055611692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-016-2279-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Shafaqat10aPhysiological and biochemical mechanisms of silicon-induced copper stress tolerance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  ap. 262.  a2019-12-06  aAccumulation of excess copper (Cu) in agricultural soils can decrease growth and quality of crops grown on these soils and a little information is available on the role of silicon (Si) in reducing Cu toxicity in plants. A hydroponic study was conducted to investigate the effects of Si (1.0 mM) on growth and physiology of cotton seedlings grown on different Cu (0, 25, and 50 µM) concentrations. Elevated levels of Cu decreased growth, biomass, photosynthetic pigments, and gas exchange characteristics, and increased the electrolyte leakage (EL), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) contents in leaf, stem, and roots of cotton seedlings. Cu stress alone decreased the activities of key antioxidant enzymes in cotton seedlings. Exogenous application of Si alleviated the toxic effects of Cu on cotton seedlings by improving growth, photosynthetic pigments, and gas exchange characteristics under Cu stress. The Si application decreased Cu concentrations in leaves, stem, and roots as compared with the control plants. Furthermore, Si decreased oxidative stress as evidenced by decreased EL, H₂O₂, and TBARS contents, and increased the antioxidant enzyme activities in cotton seedlings. This study provides evidences of Si-mediated reduction of Cu toxicity in cotton seedlings at physiological and biochemical levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aelectrolytes 3aenzymes 3agas exchange 3aseedlings 3aroots 3aoxidative stress 3aGossypium hirsutum 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroponics 3aphotosynthesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aleaves 3acopper 3atoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3abiomass 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3apigments 3acotton 3astress tolerance 3asilicon 3acrops 0aantioxidants1 aRizwan, Muhammad1 aUllah, Najeeb1 aBharwana, Saima Aslam1 aWaseem, Muhammad1 aFarooq, Muhammad Ahsan1 aAbbasi, Ghulam Hasan1 aFarid, Mujahid0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 Nov., v. 38, no. 11 p.262-262dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-016-2279-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012300178520185500301592002802156650001402184650001502198650001302213650001502226650001602241650002202257650002502279650002002304650002802324650002102352650001502373650001902388650000902407650001102416650001802427650001502445650001902460650001302479650001102492650001602503653001902519653002702538653002802565653003302593653001202626653000802638700002302646700002502669700006102694700005902755700006002814773011202874856008302986852000903069655001203078IND60726022920221120191503.0220321e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072602292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1130132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsuddin, Shazana Hilda10aReagentless Affimer- and antibody-based impedimetric biosensors for CEA-detection using a novel non-conducting polymer  aPolyoctopamine (POct), an amine-functionalised non-conducting polymer, as the transducer layer in an electrochemical biosensor, is presented. This polymer offers versatile covalent coupling either through thiol linker conjugation, carboxyl or aldehyde functional groups without the requirement of pre- or post-surface activation. The colorectal cancer biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was selected as the target analyte, whilst an antibody and a synthetic binding protein, an Affimer, were used as distinct bioreceptors to demonstrate the versatility of polyoctopamine as a transducer polymer layer for oriented immobilisation of the bioreceptors. The electrodeposited polymer layer was characterised using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and on-sensor chemiluminescent blotting. The performance of optimised POct-based biosensors were tested in spiked human serum. Results showed that the electropolymerisation of octopamine on screen printed gold electrode generates a thin polymer film with low resistance. Close proximity of the immobilised bioreceptors to the transducer layer greatly enhanced the sensitivity detection. The sensitivity of the smaller monomeric bioreceptor (Affimer, 12.6 kDa) to detect CEA was comparable to the dimeric antibody (150 kDa) with limit of detection at 11.76 fM which is significantly lower than the basal clinical levels of 25 pM. However, the Affimer-based sensor had a narrower dynamic range compared to the immunosensor (1–100 fM vs. 1 fM – 100 nM, respectively). All electrochemical measurements were done in less than 5 min with small sample volumes (10 μl). Hence, polyoctopamine features a simple fabrication of impedimetric biosensors using amine-functionalisation technique, provides rapid response time with enhanced sensitivity and label-free detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectroplating 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunosensors 3aoctopamine 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3athiols 3avoltammetry 0aPolyoctopamine 0aNon-conducting polymer 0aOriented immobilisation 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aAffimer 0aCEA1 aGibson, Timothy D.1 aTomlinson, Darren C.1 aMcPherson, M.

Reuse of this waste would reduce the environmental and social impacts of construction. One potential bulk use of such waste is as a cementing agent for soil stabilization. However, this is currently limited by the need to mill the residue to a particle size below 0.035 mm. In this study, the behavior of two soil types stabilized using alkali-activated brick dust was investigated. The unconfined compression strength at different curing temperatures and moistures and the use of different types and concentrations of alkaline activators were investigated. It was found that the addition of brick dust resulted in an increase in the soil strength between 1.7&ndash;2.3 times with respect to the non-stabilized material, suggesting that the resulting materials will find practical applications in construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abricks 3acompression strength 3aconstruction materials 3adust 3aparticle size 3asocial impact 3asoil stabilization 3asoil strength 3asoil types 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3awastes1 aCarvajal, Gloria 1 aMuñoz, Fredy 0 tSustainability.g2019 Feb. 14, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110409673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013400206520148900340592002801829650001401857650001601871650001301887650001501900650001601915650001101931650002801942650001201970650002001982650001102002653002502013653003202038653002702070653002402097700002102121700002402142700001502166700002202181773011202203856008302315852000902398655001202407IND60726023020221120181029.0220321e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072602302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1130142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShitanda, Isao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9751-016X10aAnalysis of porous carbon biocathodes via three-dimensional impedance spectroscopy using a double channel transmission line model  aPorous carbon electrodes have considerably improved the performance of biofuel cells and biosensors in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel in-situ analysis method for porous enzyme electrodes. By combining three-dimensional (3D) impedance measurement and a double-channel transmission line model, the stability of porous enzyme electrodes during operation can be evaluated. The proposed method can distinguish between the functional stability of the enzyme and mediator reaction and the general structural stability of the electrode. We demonstrated this method by evaluating bilirubin oxidase-modified carbon cloth (CC) electrodes with and without a magnesium oxide (MgO)-templated carbon coating. In case of the CC electrode, a remarkable increase in the charge transfer resistance within the first 500 s indicated the elution of the enzyme and mediator. When the CC was coated with MgO-templated carbon before enzyme modification, the charge transfer resistance remained constant, indicating an effective suppression of the elution of the enzyme and mediator. The electric double-layer capacitance values of both electrodes indicated that their general electrode structures were stable during the analysis. Thus, the proposed analytical method, based on 3D impedance, can be a powerful tool for simultaneously detecting possible changes in the general electrode structure of enzyme electrodes and in the amount of active enzymes and mediators on the electrode surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3abiocathodes 3abiofuels 3abiosensors 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenzymes 3amagnesium oxide 3amodels 0aMgO-Templated carbon 0aThree-dimensional impedance 0aCarbon cloth electrode 0aElectrode stability1 aInoue, Hiromichi1 aYoshihata, Yukihiro1 aLoew, Noya1 aItagaki, Masayuki0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 178 p.113014-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1130143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245008700159300001600246500001400262520110000276592002801376650002101404650001401425650001001439650002301449650001401472650002501486650001001511650002001521650001001541650001701551650004301568650001401611650001101625650001201636653000901648653003401657700001601691700001601707700001301723700001301736700001601749773010901765856007701874852000901951655001201960IND60726981420221122121239.0210209e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072698142DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2013-035102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, X.D.10aApoptosis induction in duck tissues during duck hepatitis A virus type 1 infection  ap. 527-534.  aNAL-light  aTo investigate the role of apoptosis in duck viral hepatitis pathogenesis, 4- and 21-d-old ducks were inoculated with duck hepatitis A virus serotype 1 and killed at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was used to detect apoptosis cells. Expression profiles of apoptosis-related genes including caspase-3, -8, -9, and Bcl-2 in spleen, bursa of Fabricius, liver, and the quantity of virus in blood were examined using real-time PCR. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling analysis indicated there was a significant difference of apoptotic cells between treatments and controls. The same difference also appeared in virus amount variation in blood during infection. Gene expression analysis revealed that the apoptosis-related gene expression profile was different in the 2 groups, and also different between various organs. This study suggested that apoptosis may play an important role in duck hepatitis A virus serotype 1 infection, and apoptosis suppression might facilitate virus multiplication, resulting in the highest virus concentration in the host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvihepatovirus A 3aapoptosis 3ablood 3abursa of Fabricius 3acaspase-3 3aduck virus hepatitis 3aducks 3agene expression 3aliver 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aspleen 3aviruses 0aduck 0aduck hepatitis A virus type 11 aZhang, W.P.1 aZhang, Q.R.1 aGu, C.Q.1 aHu, X.Y.1 aCheng, G.F.0 tPoultry science.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 93, no. 3 p.527-534dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2013-035103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001800250520112500268592002801393650001601421650001101437650002101448650001501469650001901484650001001503650002401513650001501537650001101552700001201563700001901575700001701594700001301611700001801624773010201642856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60575196920221120132008.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057519692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1119-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aFacile fabrication of flower-like CuCo2S4 on Ni foam for supercapacitor application  ap. 9531-9538.  aElectrochemical performance and production cost are the main concerns of electrode materials for the practical supercapacitor applications. Here we use a simple and universally applicable two-step hydrothermal treatment process to prepare the flower-like CuCo₂S₄ nanosheet arrays directly grown on Ni foam and employ it as binder-free and conductive-agent-free electrode for pseudocapacitors. The electrode at a current density of 5 mA cm⁻² exhibits an ultrahigh capacitance of 908.9 F g⁻¹ and at 30 mA cm⁻² delivers an outstanding cycling stability with retaining 91.1% after 2000 cycles compared with its initial capacity. Furthermore, the assembled flower-like nanostructured CuCo₂S₄//active carbon asymmetric supercapacitor displays a specific capacitance of 93.5 F g⁻¹ at 1 mA cm⁻², an energy density of 29.2 Wh kg⁻¹ at 127 W kg⁻¹, as well as 126.39% capacitance retention through 2000 cycles at the high current density of 25 mA cm⁻², suggesting the flower-like CuCo₂S₄ nanosheet arrays hold promise for practical application of high-performance supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3afoams 3ahot water treatment 3ananosheets 3anickel1 aXu, Jie1 aZhang, Yingjiu1 aZheng, Yayun1 aHu, Xing1 aLiu, Zhongxia0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Aug., v. 52, no. 16 p.9531-9538dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1119-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245006800174300001600242520164400258592002801902650001701930650001501947650002701962650002001989650002002009650001802029650001002047650002602057650002002083650001202103650001602115650001502131650001402146650003202160650001802192651001902210653001702229653002002246653002202266653002502288653002502313700003402338700002002372700002102392700001802413700001702431700002502448773009602473856008902569852000902658655001202667IND60541743720221120101330.0190401e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054174372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSklenicka, Petr10aOwner or tenant: Who adopts better soil conservation practices?  ap. 253-261.  aLand tenure security is widely considered to be a fundamental factor in motivating farmers to adopt sustainable land management practices. This study aims to establish whether it is true that owner-operators adopt more effective soil conservation measures than tenant-operators, and whether well-designed agro-environmental instruments can provide sufficiently strong motivation to compensate for the differences between these two groups.An analysis of the level of adoption of four types of erosion control measures on 263 blocks of arable land endangered by water erosion in the Czech Republic has proved that all measures were adopted by owners significantly more frequently than by tenants. Compared to tenants, owners applied wide-row crops in crop rotation schemes 2.4 times less frequently in the last 5 years, while they applied soil-improving crops 1.9 times more frequently. Contour farming was adopted 1.8 times more often by owners, and the slope length in production blocks farmed by owners was on an average 2.4 times shorter than in blocks farmed by tenants. However, the study has also shown that, in cases where conservation measures are supported by incentives based on Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standards cross compliance, the differences in the approach to soil conservation between owners and tenants were minimized or eliminated, due to the adoption of responsible practices by tenants. The study has proved that a well-designed system of environmentally determined subsidies can compensate otherwise substantial differences in the attitude of owners and tenants towards soil conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3acompliance 3aconservation practices 3acontour farming 3acontrol methods 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3aerosion control 3afarmers 3aland tenure 3amotivation 3asubsidies 3asustainable land management 3awater erosion 3aCzech Republic 0aSoil erosion 0aTenure security 0aRural development 0aSustainable land use 0aFarmland degradation1 aMolnarova, Kristina Janeckova1 aSalek, Miroslav1 aŠimová, Petra,1 aVlasak, Josef1 aSekac, Pavel1 aJanovska, Vratislava0 tLand use policy.g2015 Sept., v. 47 p.253-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011900171500001900290520164700309592002801956650001101984650002501995650001202020650001902032650001602051650002302067650003102090650002902121650001502150650001502165650002502180653001002205653002302215653001202238653000802250700001802258700001802276700001402294700001702308700002002325700001902345700001202364700001702376700001602393700005402409700001502463700005602478773012002534856008802654852000902742655001202751IND60696220620221119175756.0200719e20200920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069622062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Fenghui10aRising vegetation activity dominates growing water use efficiency in the Asian permafrost region from 1900 to 2100  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPermafrost play an important role in regulating global climate system. We analyzed the gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), and evapotranspiration (ET) derived from MODIS and three earth system models participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in the Asian permafrost region. The water use efficiency (WUE) was further computed. The simulated GPP, NPP, and ET show slightly increasing trends during historical period (1900–2014) and strong increasing trends in projection period (2015–2100), and projected impacts of climate change on all variables are greater under high-emission scenarios than low-emission scenarios. Further analysis revealed higher increases in GPP and NPP than that of ET, indicating that vegetation carbon sequestration governs the growing WUE under historical and projected periods in this region. The GPP, NPP and ET showed higher changing rates in western, central and southeast areas of this region, and WUE (WUEGPP, and WUENPP) shows the similar spatial pattern. Compared to MODIS-derived GPP, NPP, and ET during 2000–2014, Earth system models yield the best estimates for NPP, while slight underestimations for GPP and ET, and thus slight overestimations for WUEGPP and WUENPP. This study highlights the predominant role of vegetation activity in regulating regional WUE in Asian permafrost region under future climate change. Vegetation domination of the growing water use efficiency implies that the permafrost region may continue acting efficiently in sequestrating atmospheric carbon in terms of water consumption throughout the 21st century.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironment 3aevapotranspiration 3agross primary productivity 3anet primary productivity 3apermafrost 3avegetation 3awater use efficiency 0aCMIP6 0aEarth system model 0aSiberia 0aWUE1 aLiu, Jianzhao1 aZuo, Yunjiang1 aGuo, Ziyu1 aWang, Nannan1 aSong, Changchun1 aWang, Zongming1 aSun, Li1 aGuo, Yuedong1 aSong, Yanyu1 aMao, Dehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3101-91531 aXu, Feifan1 aXu, Xiaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6553-65140 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 736 p.139587-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012600186300001600312500001500328520069700343592002801040650002201068650001101090650001001101650001401111650002801125650001301153650002501166650002401191650001001215650001201225650001201237650002101249650001301270650002801283650003201311650006501343650001401408650001201422650003101434650002501465650002701490650002201517651001301539651001301552653002801565700001901593700002601612700001701638773009601655856004801751852000901799655001201808IND4473711820221120131430.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447371182DNAL7 a222189682pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-1220-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunīr, Muhammad,10aSequencing and analysis of the complete genome of Newcastle disease virus isolated from a commercial poultry farm in 2010  ap. 765-768.  a2019-12-06  aNewcastle disease virus (NDV) infects wild and domestic birds but causes contagious and lethal disease in domestic poultry.

However, confined by the spin-forbidden nature of triplet state transitions, the highest theoretical value of external quantum efficiency (EQE) of fluorescent CQDs is merely 5%, which fundamentally limits their further application in electroluminescent light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Soluble phosphorescent CQDs offer a means of breaking the shackle to achieve efficient monochromatic electroluminescence, especially red emission, which is a pivotal constituent in full-color displays. Here, the synthesis of red (625 nm) phosphorescent carbon quantum dot organic frameworks (CDOFs) with a quantum yield of up to 42.3% and realization of high-efficiency red phosphorescent electroluminescent LEDs are reported. The LEDs based on the CDOFs exhibited a red emission with a maximum luminance of 1818 cd m–² and an EQE of 5.6%. This work explores the possibility of a new perspective for developing high-performance CQD-based electroluminescent LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3afluorescence 3alighting 3aphosphorescence1 aWang, Zhibin1 aMeng, Ting1 aYuan, Ding,1 aNi, Ruihao1 aLi, Yunchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5554-72521 aLi, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2043-12061 aZhang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3002-43671 aTan, Zhan’ao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2700-47251 aLei, Shengbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2483-52861 aFan, Louzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0958-70150 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 06, v. 143, no. 45 p.18941-18951dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c070543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011200156300002000268500001500288520123300303592002801536650001601564650001901580650001201599650001401611650001701625650001701642650001301659650002301672650001701695650001801712653001901730653003101749653001801780653001201798653003401810653001701844700001901861700001701880700001701897700001201914700001601926700002001942700001501962700001901977773012701996856008002123852000902203655001202212IND60550900720221119161308.0161011e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055090072DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b072152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Kun10aUp-Conversion Y2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ Hollow Spherical Drug Carrier with Improved Degradability for Cancer Treatment  ap. 25078-25086.  a2019-12-06  aThe rare earth hollow spheres with up-conversion luminescence properties have shown potential applications in drug delivery and bioimaging fields. However, there have been few reports for the degradation properties of rare earth oxide drug carriers. Herein, uniform and well-dispersed Y₂O₃:Yb³⁺,Er³⁺ hollow spheres (YOHSs) have been fabricated by a general Pechini sol–gel process with melamine formaldehyde colloidal spheres as template. The novel YOHSs with up-conversion luminescence has good drug loading amount and drug-release efficiency; moreover, it exhibits pH-responsive release patterns. In particular, the YOHSs sample exhibits low cytotoxicity and excellent degradable properties in acid buffer. After the sample was loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), the antitumor result in vitro indicates that YOHS-DOX might be effective in cancer treatment. The animal imaging test also reveals that the YOHSs drug carrier can be used as an outstanding luminescent probe for bioimaging in vivo application prospects. The results suggest that the degradable drug carrier with up-conversion luminescence may enhance the delivery efficiency of drugs and improve the cancer therapy in clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3aimage analysis 3aanimals 3aneoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3aluminescence 3amelamine 3asol-gel processing 3aformaldehyde 3adrug carriers 0acancer therapy 0aup-conversion luminescence 0adegradability 0areports 0aY2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ hollow spheres 0adrug carrier1 aZhang, Cuimiao1 aSun, Wentong1 aLiu, Huifang1 aJin, Yi1 aLi, Zhenhua1 aLiang, Xing-Jie1 aJia, Guang1 aZhang, Jinchao0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 8, no. 38 p.25078-25086dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b072153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017000171300001600341520101900357592002801376650002101404650001101425650003501436650001501471650001301486650001901499651001001518653002401528653001001552653001301562653002301575653001901598653001801617700001701635700002701652700002501679700002201704700002101726773010001747856008501847852000901932655001201941IND60568828620221118031144.0170517e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056882862DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2016.11788132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Kuntal10aOptimization of spatial statistical approaches to identify land use/land cover change hot spots of Pune region of Maharashtra using remote sensing and GIS techniques  ap. 777-796.  aThis study investigated land use/land cover change (LULCC) dynamics using temporal satellite images and spatial statistical cluster analysis approaches in order to identify potential LULCC hot spots in the Pune region. LULCC hot spot classes defined as new, progressive and non-progressive were derived from Gi* scores. Results indicate that progressive hot spots have experienced high growth in terms of urban built-up areas (20.67% in 1972–1992 and 19.44% in 1992–2012), industrial areas (0.73% in 1972–1992 and 3.46% in 1992–2012) and fallow lands (4.35% in 1972–1992 and −6.38% in 1992–2012). It was also noticed that about 28.26% of areas near the city were identified as new hot spots after 1992. Hence, non-significant change areas were identified as non-progressive after 1992. The study demonstrated that LULCC hot spot mapping through the integrated spatial statistical approach was an effective approach for analysing the direction, rate, spatial pattern and spatial relationship of LULCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3afallow 3ageographic information systems 3aland cover 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3aIndia 0aLand use/land cover 0aLULCC 0ahot spot 0aspatial statistics 0aremote sensing 0aGetis-Ord Gi*1 aKumar, Rajiv1 aMruthyunjaya Reddy, K.1 aJagadeeswara Rao, P.1 aRaj Saxena, Manoj1 aRavi Shankar, G.0 tGeocarto international.g2017 July 3, v. 32, no. 7 p.777-796dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2016.11788133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245013500170300001400305520105200319592002801371650001301399650001801412650001701430650001401447650001201461650001601473651001101489653001301500653001301513653001601526653003301542700002401575700001801599700002701617700001901644773009401663856008101757852000901838655001201847IND60699291220221119103035.0210117e20140729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069929122DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.429.74202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeubauer, Thomas A.10aReplacement names and nomenclatural comments for problematic species-group names in Europe's Neogene freshwater Gastropoda.

In particular, the promising Li-excess materials are known to exhibit significant vulnerability toward oxygen release, which can cause surface densification and impede Li intercalation. Here we focus on the end member, Li₂MnO₃, as a Li-excess, Mn-rich representative of this class of materials and systematically elucidate all possible stoichiometric low Miller index surfaces with various cation ordering on each surface. We apply surface cation reconstruction rules that depend on the local environment, including target Mn–Li site exchanges, and optimize the resulting surface Li configurations using metadynamics. The equilibrium Wulff shape shows dominant (001), (010) surface facets, and almost all facets exhibit favorable Mn reconstruction. Most importantly, we find that while all equilibrium LiₓMnO₃ surfaces become unstable toward oxygen release for x < 1.7, some facets are consistently more resistant than others which may provide a design metric for more stable particle morphologies and enhanced surface oxygen retention.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acations 3alithium 3amanganese 3aoxygen 0aLi-ion battery 0acathode 0alayered Li-excess 0asurface morphology 0aoxygen evolution1 aPersson, Kristin A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 8, no. 38 p.25595-25602dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b072593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010000173300001100273520185100284592002802135650001702163650002202180650001502202650002302217650002902240650002602269650002402295650001602319650002302335650002202358650002402380650002502404650001702429650001302446650001602459651001402475700002802489700001702517700001802534773009902552856008302651852000902734655001202743IND60769327320221120153427.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076932732DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-022-00513-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoe, Levina Chandra10aAssessment of the obesogenic environment in primary schools: a multi-site case study in Jakarta  ap. 19.  aBACKGROUND: Childhood overweight and obesity have increasingly been recognized as a significant global public health crisis, including in Asia. This study aimed to assess the obesogenic environment in primary schools in Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: A qualitative, multi-site, case study design was used to capture different elements of the school environment and policies related to obesity, with a focus on nutrition and physical activity. An adaptation of the Primary School Environmental Assessment tool was used. Six primary schools in Jakarta were purposively selected based on their location, socioeconomic status, and type (public or private). In addition to direct observation at each school, interviews were conducted with the principal, physical education teacher, canteen staff, street food vendors, and students. RESULTS: Among the six schools, two were private and four were public. The most popular foods consumed by students were unhealthy, such as deep-fried foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Students had easy and constant access to unhealthy foods, whereas only limited variation of healthy foods were available in the school canteen. Some schools also allowed the student to have access to street food vendors. School policies related to healthy eating and physical activities had been implemented, mainly in the form of teaching these topics as part of the school curriculum. However, promotion of healthy eating and physical activities by the schools was still limited. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the usefulness of the Primary School Environmental Assessment tool in identifying obesogenic factors in urban area of Indonesia. Effective implementation of guidelines to foster good nutritional practices and healthy lifestyles at school should be prioritized to improve the health and nutritional status of the students.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achildhood obesity 3acurriculum 3aelementary schools 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperimental design 3afried foods 3anutritional status 3aphysical activity 3aschool food service 3asocioeconomic status 3astreet foods 3ateachers 3aurban areas 3aIndonesia1 aWidyahening, Indah Suci1 aAli, Syougie1 aKhusun, Helda0 tBMC nutrition.g2022 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.19-19dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-022-00513-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245016300166300001600329520102900345592002801374650002201402650002501424650001601449650001401465650001801479650001201497650001501509650002301524650001501547650001901562650001901581650001101600650002101611650002201632653002701654653002201681653003101703653002701734700002901761700001301790700001501803700005701818700001501875773010001890856008701990852000902077655001202086IND60639384820221122161135.0190606e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063938482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.04.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yalan10aModification of peanut protein isolate in glucose-containing solutions during simulated industrial thermal processes and gastric-duodenal sequential digestion  ap. 120-128.  aThis research investigated the effects of commonly practiced thermal treatments (simulated pasteurization, retort sterilization and UHT sterilization) on peanut protein isolate (PPI)-glucose solution. Results showed that thermal treatment on PPI-glucose solution from mild to drastic conditions would lead to a more ordered and compact protein structure, greater extent of Maillard reaction, higher degree of graft, stronger in vitro antioxidant activities, but decrease in vitro digestion especially lower degree of hydrolysis in two-step enzymolysis by pepsin and then pancreatin.

In this study, we hypothesized that land use and land cover change patterns in the Lake Chivero catchment, Zimbabwe, were related to its human population dynamics. Using nonparametric correlation coefficients (Spearman’s rho, ρ), we found that bareland, cropland and built-up land had positive relations with human population growth of ρ = 0.7, ρ = 0.9 and ρ = 1, respectively. Grassland/shrubland, water and forest, on the other hand, had a negative relationship with human population growth of ρ = −0.9, ρ = −0.7 and ρ = −0.667, respectively. However, these relationships were only significant (p < 0.05) for cropland, grassland/shrubland and built-up land. Human population dynamics in the Lake Chivero catchment could be one of the major drivers of land use and land cover change in the catchment between 1986 and 2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahuman population 3alakes 3aland cover 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3apopulation growth 3ashrublands 3asocioeconomic factors 3awatersheds 3aZimbabwe 0aLanduse landcover change 0ahuman population 0acatchment 0aLake Chivero1 aMagadza, Christopher Hilary Dennis1 aMurwira, Amon0 tGeocarto international.g2017 July 3, v. 32, no. 7 p.797-811dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2016.11788153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007600167300001600243520167500259592002801934650006001962650001102022650001202033650001102045650001202056650000902068650001102077650001002088650001902098650001202117650001302129650002002142650002302162700001902185773009102204856004802295852000902343655001202352IND4472177020221122220239.0120726e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447217702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-012-9407-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValladares, Sonia10aNon-lethal dorsal fin sampling for stable isotope analysis in seahorses  ap. 363-370.  aSampling collection for stable isotope analysis has traditionally involved the sacrifice of the animal. Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are listed as threatened by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( http://www.cites.org ) and consequently lethal sampling is undesirable. We evaluated the adequacy of dorsal fin tissue of adult seahorses Hippocampus guttulatus for stable isotope analysis as an alternative to lethal tissue sampling. Three seahorse tissues (dorsal fin, muscle, and liver) were analyzed for comparisons of δ15N and δ13C values. Similarities found between δ15N and δ13C values in dorsal fin and muscle tissue of H. guttulatus suggest that both tissues are adequate for stable isotope analysis to understand feeding ecology of seahorses. However, considering the threatened status of the species, dorsal fin tissue would be recommended in adult seahorses as a non-lethal sampling. The effect of lipid extraction on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values was also evaluated in each seahorse tissues. Significant effects of lipids extraction did only occur for δ13C values in muscle and liver. It was found that lipid removal was not necessary to perform SIA in dorsal fin tissues. Due to the limited availability of fin tissue obtained from fin-clipping in seahorses, the relationship between the mass/surface of dorsal fin clip and stable isotope values was analyzed. δ15N and δ13C values in fin samples were found to be independent of the size of fin analyzed. According to our study, the use of fin-clipping sampling, with a minimum surface analyzed of 12.74 mm2, was found to be an adequate method for SIA in seahorses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species 3aadults 3aanimals 3acarbon 3aecology 3afins 3alipids 3aliver 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes 3athreatened species1 aPlanas, Miquel0 tAquatic ecology.g2012 Sept., v. 46, no. 3 p.363-370dSpringer-Verlagx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-012-9407-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245009400188300001600282520086800298592002801166650002601194650001501220650001501235650002201250650001701272650001301289650002001302650001601322650000901338650001301347650004701360650002701407650002301434650002301457650002901480650002401509700002401533700002601557700002401583773010101607856008201708961001201790852000901802655001201811IND4475975420221120023443.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447597542DNAL7 a214588782pmid7 a10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlather, Curtis H.10aMinimum viable populations: is there a ‘magic number’ for conservation practitioners?  ap. 307-316.  aEstablishing species conservation priorities and recovery goals is often enhanced by extinction risk estimates. The need to set goals, even in data-deficient situations, has prompted researchers to ask whether general guidelines could replace individual estimates of extinction risk. To inform conservation policy, recent studies have revived the concept of the minimum viable population (MVP), the population size required to provide some specified probability of persistence for a given period of time. These studies conclude that long-term persistence requires ≥5000 adult individuals, an MVP threshold that is unaffected by taxonomy, life history or environmental conditions. Here, we re-evaluate this suggestion. We find that neither data nor theory supports its general applicability, raising questions about the utility of MVPs for conservation planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3alife history 3aplanning 3apopulation size 3aresearchers 3arisk 3ataxonomy 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aExtinction, Biological 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Density 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aSpecies Specificity1 aHayward, Gregory D.1 aBeissinger, Steven R.1 aStephens, Philip A.0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2011 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.307-316dElsevier Ltdx0169-53477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001400185245012400199300001800323506007600341520040900417592002800826506003700854650001600891650002300907650001200930650001600942650001600958650001500974650001400989650001301003700001601016700001901032700001701051700001401068700001501082700001701097700002001114773010801134856007801242852000901320655001201329IND60171811520221207142630.0150602e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017181152DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.114.1245862doi7 aPMC40365672pmcid7 a247694802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ling12aA Receptor-Like Kinase Mediates Ammonium Homeostasis and Is Important for the Polar Growth of Root Hairs in Arabidopsis  ap. 1497-1511.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmmonium (NH ₄⁺) is an important nutrient and signal, but can be toxic in excess.

Their thermal catalytic performances were evaluated by toluene degradation. The physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized using a series of characterization methods. The catalytic activity of catalysts remained essentially unchanged in the high weight hourly space velocity, stability and water resistance test, which also indicated good catalytic performance. In the reusability test, the catalytic performance was found to be enhanced after the reaction, because of the catalyst might follow a Pt⁰-PtO synergistic catalytic mechanism (similar to Mars-van Krevelen mechanism) and there was a phase transition between Pt⁰ and PtO during the reaction. Firstly, the toluene adsorbed on the catalyst surface was oxidized by the activated lattice oxygen of the PtO. Then, consumption of oxygen atoms led to formation of oxygen vacancies, and finally the molecular oxygen adsorbed by Pt⁰ was activated and passed to the PtO to supplement the oxygen vacancies, forming a redox cycle. In addition, the possible catalytic oxidation mechanism of toluene was also revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3aoxygen 3aphase transition 3aplatinum 3atoluene 0aCatalytic oxidation 0aPt/UiO-66 catalysts 0aPt0-PtO 0aSynergistic catalytic mechanism1 aZhang, Dongfeng1 aJi, Wenqing1 aBi, Fukun1 aSong, Liang1 aZhang, Xiaodong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 606 p.1811-1822dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245018600188300001600374520162000390592002802010650003202038650001902070650001102089650001702100650002002117650001202137650003002149650002902179650001302208650001202221650001302233650001902246650001202265650002702277650001802304650002902322650005402351650003002405650002402435650004102459650002902500650002502529650002802554650002302582650004902605650004002654650003402694650005202728650002402780650003402804650003702838700002202875700002002897700002202917773009502939856004803034852000903082655001203091IND50065103420221122150106.0130416e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006510342DNAL7 a231794562pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-012-9488-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsushima, Ryoji10aAnalysis of Extracellular Alginate Lyase (alyA) Expression and its Regulatory Region in a Marine Bacterial Strain, Pseudoalteromonas atlantica AR06, Using a gfp Gene Reporter System  ap. 349-356.  aExtracellular alginate lyase (alyA) has an important role in the use of alginate in the marine bacterial strain Pseudoalteromonas atlantica AR06. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a convenient, useful tool for visualization of gene expression, and here we introduced the gfp gene at the end of alyA by homologous recombination in AR06. The gfp gene was expressed as a polycistronic transcript in reporter strain ARAG (AR06 alyA-gfp). The analysis of GFP fluorescence of ARAG in minimal medium containing a carbon source (sucrose, mannitol, glucose, or glucuronate) revealed that the alyA was induced by alginate and regulated by carbon catabolite repression by the coexistence of each carbon substrate (sucrose, mannitol, and glucose). The transcription start site of alyA was identified 192 bp upstream from translation start site of alyA and the 10-bp sequence was a palindrome in which the transcription start site [G] was at the end. Thirteen kinds of plasmids were constructed for promoter analysis of alyA, which contains between 215 and 618 bp of upstream sequence from the translation start and gfp. Longer sequences than 339 bp were capable to increase the GFP fluorescence responding to alginate in the homologous recombination alyA deletion mutant strain ARAΔ (AR06 ΔalyA). The 339-bp upstream sequence was proved sufficiency for reproduction of the catabolite repression of alyA. These results indicate that (a) transcription of alyA is probably regulated by substrate recognition systems driven by multiple factors and (b) regulation of alyA requires a cis element on the upstream region of alyA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoalteromonas atlantica 3aalginate lyase 3acarbon 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aglucose 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahomologous recombination 3amannitol 3amutants 3aplasmids 3areporter genes 3asucrose 3atranslation (genetics) 2aBase Sequence 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxgenetics 2aGenes, Reporterxgenetics 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aHomologous Recombination 2aMannitolxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aPseudoalteromonasxenzymology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aTranscription Initiation Site 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics1 aWatanabe, Ryuichi1 aTsuda, Masataka1 aSuzuki, Toshiyuki0 tMarine biotechnology.g2013 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.349-356dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-012-9488-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014500178300001600323520215300339592002802492650002202520650001002542650001102552650002502563650001102588650001302599650001602612650001202628650002102640650001302661650001502674651001202689651000902701653002202710653002302732653002102755653002102776700002302797700002402820700002102844700001902865773012502884856008603009852000903095655001203104IND60792971520221118164456.0220914e20221102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079297152DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2021.20127312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmirchakhmaghi, Narjes10aEvaluating responses of Caucasian apple (Malus orientalis) from Hyrcanian forests to fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) using an in vitro assay  ap. 789-800.  aFire blight, caused by the necrogenic gram-negative Erwinia amylovora, is one the most destructive bacterial diseases of apple. The wild Caucasian apple (Malus orientalis) is grown throughout Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Russia and the Hyrcanian forest in the northern part of Iran. So far, no studies on resistance to fire blight in M. orientalis from the Hyrcanian forest have been conducted. We therefore evaluated the response of four different populations of M. orientalis (two individual trees per population) eight individuals of M. orientalis from four different populations in this region for fire blight resistance, using an in vitro shoot-inoculation assay. The fire blight susceptible MM.106 and partly resistant MM.111 rootstocks were included as references. Two one-year old trees were selected from each population, which were then micropropagated and inoculated with the fire blight bacterial strain ‘Ea273ʹ. Necrosis growth along the shoots was measured every 24 h for 10 consecutive days. Selected individuals from Soordar, Asalem and Siahbil populations did not differ in the final necrosis growth from susceptible MM.106. However, the MM.111 and Afratakhteh individuals showed the lowest necrosis growth. The largest final necrosis growth was observed in the Siahbil individuals. The capacity of main scavenging enzymes and antioxidant activity were monitored in the Siahbil and the Afratakhteh individuals. The largest difference in the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity was observed at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) between resistant Afratakhteh and susceptible Siahbil individuals. The highest activity of catalase (CAT) enzyme occurred in the Afratakhteh individuals after 168 hpi. The peroxidase (POD) activity increased in both Afratakhteh and Siahbil individuals. The two Afratakhteh individuals were more resistant to fire blight compared to Asalem, Siahbil and Soordar individuals. Our results suggested that large differences in fire blight resistance existed in natural populations of M. orientalis. Potential fire blight-resistant individuals should be of interest for future apple-breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErwinia amylovora 3aMalus 3aRussia 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3acatalase 3afire blight 3aforests 3amicropropagation 3anecrosis 3aperoxidase 3aArmenia 3aIran 0aforest protection 0aIn vitro selection 0aHyrcanian forest 0aMalus orientalis1 aYousefzadeh, Hamed1 aHosseinpour, Batool1 aAbdollahi, Hamid1 aLarsen, Bjarne0 tJournal of crop improvement.g2022 Nov. 02, v. 36, no. 6 p.789-800dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl923723x1542-75367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2021.20127313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170520110700319592002801426650002501454650001301479650001801492650001701510650001901527650001401546650001901560650001901579653002501598700001401623700001801637700002101655700001901676700001601695773010001711856008701811852000901898655001201907IND60745860020221119192943.0220205e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074586002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1306512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Jing-jing10aNanocomplexes of curcumin and glycated bovine serum albumin: The formation mechanism and effect of glycation on their physicochemical properties  aBovine serum albumin (BSA) and BSA-glucose conjugates (GBSAⅠ and GBSAⅠI) with different extent of glycation were complexed with curcumin (CUR). The formation mechanism of BSA/GBSA-CUR complexes and the effect of glycation on their physicochemical properties were investigated. Fluorescence quenching and FTIR analysis indicated that the BSA/GBSA–CUR nanocomplexes were formed mainly by hydrophobic interactions. XRD analysis demonstrated that CUR was present in an amorphous state in the nanocomplexes. BSA with a greater extent of glycation (BSA < GBSAⅠ<GBSAⅠI) displayed a higher binding affinity for CUR. The highest CUR encapsulation efficiency (86.77%) and loading capacity (7.81 mg/g) were obtained in the GBSAⅠI-CUR nanocomplex. The zeta-potential varied from −17.45 to −27.65 mV, depending on the extent of glycation. Furthermore, the physicochemical stability of BSA/GBSA-CUR nanocomplexes increased with the increasing extent of glycation of BSA. Thus, the obtained GBSAⅠI have the potential to become new delivery carriers for encapsulating hydrophobic food components.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3acurcumin 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3afood chemistry 3aglycation 3ahydrophobicity 3azeta potential 0aBovine serum protein1 aSun, Cong1 aTan, Zhi-feng1 aZhang, Guang-yao1 aChen, Gui-bing1 aSong, Liang0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 368 p.130651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1306513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008400162300001600246500001900262520111600281592002801397650001401425650001301439650001301452650001601465650001301481650001401494650002501508650001701533650002501550653002701575653002701602653002001629700005901649700002001708773012401728856007701852961001201929852000901941655001201950IND60673507920221119191325.0191018e20181103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067350792DNAL7 a10.1093/jofore/fvy0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchelhas, John10aStrategies for Successful Engagement of African American Landowners in Forestry  ap. 581-588.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEngaging African American landowners in forestry has been an enduring challenge because of historical discrimination, ownership issues such as heirs’ property, lack of experience with, and distrust of, the forestry profession, limited use of technical and financial assistance, and difficulties and predatory practices associated with harvesting timber. The Sustainable Forestry and African American Land Retention Program has achieved success through eight long-term, community-based projects in seven states in the US South. We conducted qualitative research with a diverse range of participants and stakeholders in the three longest-running projects to identify lessons for success. These lessons include addressing obstacles and constraints identified by prior research, establishing community-based networks to provide coordinated education and outreach, linking legal assistance for heirs’ property with forestry assistance, patiently engaging landowners through a process of forestry awareness and action, and resolving difficulties and maintaining momentum with regular feedback and problem solving.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3aforestry 3amomentum 3aoccupations 3aoutreach 3aownership 3aqualitative analysis 3astakeholders 3asustainable forestry 0aminority forest owners 0aoutreach and extension 0afamily forestry1 aHitchner, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0407-62321 aDwivedi, Puneet0 tJournal of forestry.g2018 Nov. 03, v. 116, no. 6 p.581-588dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl42349x1938-37467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvy0443Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008400166300001800250520039000268592002800658650001600686650001800702650003600720650002100756650002300777650002500800650001100825650001200836700002000848700001800868700001700886700001800903773013400921856007401055852000901129655001201138IND60639639320221122001708.0190502e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063963932DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc05145j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwamy, V.

Cells of strain DA2T were Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, sporulating rods that were motile by means of peritrichous flagella; they were able to grow at pH 5–8. The major isoprenoid quinone of strain DA2T was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and its cellular fatty acid profile consisted mainly of iso-C15 : 0 (18.6 %) and anteiso-C15 : 0 (69.1 %). The DNA G+C content was 54.1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny suggested that strain DA2T is a member of the genus Brevibacillus, with highest sequence similarities (in parentheses) to the type strains of Brevibacillus choshinensis (99.7 %), B. formosus (99.4 %), B. brevis (99.4 %), B. agri (99.0 %), B. reuszeri (98.8 %), B. parabrevis (98.7 %), B. centrosporus (98.6 %), B. limnophilus (97.4 %), B. panacihumi (97.3 %) and B. invocatus (97.3 %). DNA–DNA hybridization showed less than 60 % relatedness between strain DA2T and type strains of the most closely related species given above. Given the significant differences in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA sequence and DNA–DNA relatedness data, the isolate merits classification as a novel species, for which the name Brevibacillus nitrificans is proposed; the type strain of this species is DA2T ( = JCM 15774T = NCIMB 14531T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevibacillus choshinensis 3aDNA 3achemotaxonomy 3adigestion 3afatty acid composition 3aflagellum 3anitrifying bacteria 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asewage treatment 3atanks1 aHirota, Kikue1 aNodasaka, Yoshinobu1 aYumoto, Isao0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Sept., v. 62, no.

However, very limited information is available on the influence of processing conditions on the resulted synergism. In this work, C.I. reactive green 12 (RG12), a refractory textile dye, has been selected as a pollutant model to examine the synergism dependence of operational conditions in UV/chlorine AOP. Initial tests conducted with 500 μM of chlorine and 20 mg L⁻¹ of RG12 have resulted in a high synergy index (SI) of 3. Operating conditions sensitively affect the value of SI. This latter increased with increasing initial chlorine and RG12 concentrations up to certain optimums at 500 μM of chlorine and 20 mg L⁻¹ of RG12 and decreased afterward. The best SI value, i.e. 3, was obtained at pH 5, followed by pH 7 (SI = 2.2) and then pH 9–10.5 (SI ~ 2). On the other hand, the synergistic index decreased importantly from 3 at 25 °C to only 1.2 at 55 °C. Finally, by using different radical scavengers, it was found that among various suspected oxidants, only ●OH and Cl₂●⁻ play a key role in the synergistic effect between UV and chlorine toward RG12 degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3adyes 3aenvironment 3afabrics 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3apollutants 3asynergism 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV/chlorine process 0aDegradation 0aC.I. reactive green 12 (RG12) 0a•OH radical 0aChlorinated reactive species (CRS)1 aMerouani, Slimane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8182-83411 aHamdaoui, Oualid1 aAlghyamah, Abdulaziz1 aBouhelassa, Mohammed0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 736 p.139623-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1396233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001200185245009100197300001800288506007600306520038700382592002800769506003700797650001600834650001700850650001200867650001000879650001600889650001100905650001800916650002600934700001700960700002500977700001701002700001701019700001601036700003001052700002101082700001901103700001801122773010801140856007801248852000901326655001201335IND60171812020221207141608.0150602e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017181202DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.114.1229862doi7 aPMC40365702pmcid7 a247811162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jie10aABORTED MICROSPORES Acts as a Master Regulator of Pollen Wall Formation in Arabidopsis  ap. 1544-1556.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe bHLH protein, AMS, acts as a master transcriptional regulator directly modulating the expression of 23 genes related to pollen wall development and sporopollenin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis .

Bonding properties of CNF were first confirmed through a series of peeling tests. Composite laminates were manufactured from sheets of paper bonded together using CNF at two different consistencies, press times, and press temperatures. Mechanical properties of the laminates in tension and bending were characterized and the results were statistically analyzed. Elastic modulus and strength results met or exceeded those of a short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene and various natural fiber-filled polypropylene composites as well as some wood and paper based laminates. Stiffness properties, assuming perfect bonding within the laminates, were successfully estimated through a classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) with only 2–10% variation compared to experimental results. Laminates, together with CNF-peeled surfaces, were observed and qualitatively analyzed by SEM imaging. Physical properties, namely, water absorption and thickness swelling were measured. Swelling was controlled by the addition of a small percentage of a cross-linking additive.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917 3aabsorption 3acellulose microfibrils 3acrosslinking 3aglass fibers 3aimage analysis 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3apaper 3apeeling 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awood 0acellulose nanofibrils 0apaper 0amechanical properties 0alaminate 0abinder1 aTajvidi, Mehdi1 aBousfield, Douglas W.1 aGardner, Douglas J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 8, no. 38 p.25520-25528dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:28023x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b076553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245019100169300001600360500001900376520102500395592002801420596003401448596012001482650001501602650001501617650001501632650001401647651001101661653002601672653002201698653003701720653002601757653001801783700002301801700006601824700002301890773012401913856007702037852000902114655001202123IND60673508020221119190907.0191018e20181103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067350802DNAL7 a10.1093/jofore/fvy0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAscanio-Lárraga, J A10aLogging Pattern and Landscape Change in Southern Mexico: Identifying Potential Weaknesses and Strengthening Conservation in Community-Based Management Programs through Landscape Analysis  ap. 539-546.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe assessment of landscape dynamic changes under community-based management schemes represents a key step to assess the viability of alternative forest sustainable models. We evaluated changes in structure and composition of a forested landscape subject to a community-based management scheme in southern Mexico over the past 30 years. Forest use and history in the study landscape coupled with relatively intense silvicultural practices have led to a significant replacement of mature forests by a complex mixture of early successional vegetation stages. An analysis of land cover changes (1986–2001 and 2001–2016) reveals that closed forests experienced a high rate of change (-3%) and high levels of fragmentation, whereas secondary forests (3%), bare soils and low vegetation (3%), and scrub (0.4%) have recorded important increases in land cover. A monitoring scheme is urgently needed to evaluate landscape modification and to strengthen conservation and sustainability in community-based management programs.  aPublisher supplied data  cEl Colegio de la Frontera Sur  a658892/573305a258792: CB-2015-01cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologíadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003141 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3ashrublands 3aviability 3aMexico 0aforest sustainability 0alandscape history 0aSilvicultural Development Method 0aspatial heterogeneity 0afragmentation1 aLeón-Cortés, J L1 aCastillo-Santiago, M A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3024-55141 aRamírez-Segura, E0 tJournal of forestry.g2018 Nov. 03, v. 116, no. 6 p.539-546dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl42349x1938-37467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvy0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011600168500001900284520120400303592002801507650001801535650001001553650001001563650001401573650001001587650001801597650002201615650001401637650001901651650001201670650001501682650001801697650001901715653001801734653001901752653001401771653001301785700002001798700001801818700001301836773011601849856009001965852000902055655001202064IND60670245420221121045957.0200113e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067024542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2019.1048322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ze10aDesign, synthesis and evaluation of liposomes modified with dendritic aspartic acid for bone-specific targeting  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBone diseases are notoriously difficult diseases to treat due to the comparatively low blood flows in bone tissue. Therefore, targeting delivery of drugs to bone may not only enhance the treatment efficacy, but also reduce the quantity of drug administered. In order to increase the distribution of paclitaxel (PTX) in bone, in this study, a series of novel dendritic aspartic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized as liposome ligands to deliver PTX to bone effectively. The liposomes were prepared by thin film hydration method and its particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, release profile, stability, hemolysis were also characterized. All the aspartic acid-coated liposomes showed more than 60% binding rates to hydroxyapatite (HAP), especially the PTX-Asp₈-Lip exhibited dramatic binding rates (> 97%) after 24 h. Moreover, the bone-targeting study in vivo indicated that all liposomes could improve the accumulation of PTX in bone, among which, the PTX-Asp₈-Lip showed the best affinity due to the increase of aspartic acid residues exposed on the liposome surface. These results provided a novel and effective entry to the development of bone-targeting drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3ablood 3abones 3achemistry 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3afilms (materials) 3ahemolysis 3ahydroxyapatite 3aligands 3apaclitaxel 3aparticle size 3azeta potential 0aDrug delivery 0aBone targeting 0aDendritic 0aLiposome1 aChen, Changqing1 aXie, Changwei1 aZhao, Yi0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2020 Jan., v. 226 p.104832-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2019.1048323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04097naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010100211300001800312500001900330520235400349592002802703596006802731650002402799650002502823650001302848650002902861650001702890650001302907650001902920650001502939650001602954650002202970650002502992650001603017650001103033650001503044650001503059650001403074700005803088700006503146700006003211700005803271700005903329773012403388856008203512852000903594655001203603IND60708638120221120040148.0200829e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070863812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05663-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimov, Svetoslav G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2564-242710aWGS-based characterization of the potentially beneficial Enterococcus faecium EFD from a beehive  ap. 6445-6449.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNowadays, due to their potential application as probiotics for humans or animals, many beneficial lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from different natural environments. These include members of the genus Enterococcus - quite specific due to their ambiguous nature, varying from pathogens to probiotics. In our work we present a whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based approach for assessing the potential of bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus isolates from beehives to serve as natural preserving agents against bacterial infections associated with honeybees. Potential Enterococcus spp. isolates from pollen granules were tested with the well diffusion assay for bacteriocin activity against Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of the American foulbrood disease (AFB). Two of them gave positive results and were determined at species level by 16S rRNA genes sequencing. They were then subjected to WGS using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The resulting raw data reads were processed and further analyzed by using only freely available web-based tools (the Shovill pipeline, QUAST, BAGEL4, ResFinder, VirulenceFinder and PlasmidFinder). The analysis revealed that both of them represent clonally identical isolates of the same strain. This specific strain was named Enterococcus faecium EFD, and was genotyped by the MLST-2.0 Server. Five bacteriocin genes were found in the assembled genome, providing a possible explanation for the antimicrobial properties of the isolate. The protein nature of the inhibitory agent/s was confirmed by treatment with proteinase K. No resistance determinants for clinically important antibiotics and functional virulence factor genes were detected. The bioinformatic analyses of the draft genome sequence suggest that E. faecium EFD is not pathogenic.The observation that E. faecium EFD was present within more than one of the beehives in the apiary proposes the idea that E. faecium EFD is there as a part of the normal beehive microbiota. This finding, in combination with its antibacterial activity against P. larvae, highlights this novel isolate as a potential natural preserving agent against AFB. Furthermore, the WGS-based approach reported here proved to be very cost- and time- efficient, for screening the applicability of new pro- and prebiotic Enterococcus strains as beehive protection agents.  aPublisher supplied data  aКП-06-Н26/8 from 17.12.2018cBulgarian National Science Fund 3aAmerican foul brood 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aInternet 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteriocins 3abeehives 3abioinformatics 3agenotyping 3alactic acid 3amolecular biology 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidase K 3apollen 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3avirulence1 aGuyrova, Anita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2488-12041 aVladimirova, Antoniya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3588-89031 aDimitrov, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4409-92871 aPeykov, Slavil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9431-95111 aStrateva, Tanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5197-18490 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.6445-6449dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05663-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007700173300001400250520139100264592002801655650002101683650001701704650001101721650002301732650001001755650001501765653002401780653002001804653002101824653002101845653003601866700002301902700002001925700001801945773012101963856008702084852000902171655001202180IND50066839220221120131417.0190318e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006683922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchindler, Dirk10aResponses of an individual deciduous broadleaved tree to wind excitation  ap. 69-82.  aAlthough responses of aerial tree parts to wind excitation are of crucial importance for deciduous broadleaved tree stability against wind loading, only a few field studies have been conducted that explore wind–tree part interactions. Therefore, responses of aerial parts of an individual Norway maple tree (Acer platanoides) to wind excitation were measured in a field study near the city of Freiburg (Southwest Germany) between July 2009 when the tree was in leaf and March 2010 when the tree was out of leaf. Using Fourier analysis, for most of the sampled tree parts six frequencies associated with the first three vibration modes in two motion directions were identified. In agreement with previous studies, vibration frequencies were lower when the tree was in leaf compared to the leafless period. The results indicate the importance of the foliage for the seasonal variation in aerial tree part motion damping. For the analyzed wind speed range, it is shown that the importance of higher order vibration modes localized on the sampled tree parts for total tree part response to wind excitation decreases with increasing wind speed. Results from wavelet analysis demonstrate that tree part response strongly covaried in the time frequency-space only with wind components having frequencies much lower than the frequencies associated with the dominant tree part vibration modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer platanoides 3aaerial parts 3aleaves 3aseasonal variation 3atrees 3awind speed 0aTree part vibration 0aWind excitation 0aFourier analysis 0aWavelet analysis 0aNorway maple (Acer platanoides)1 aSchönborn, Jochen1 aFugmann, Hannes1 aMayer, Helmut0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 177 p.69-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245015500212300001300367520139000380592002801770650002201798650001101820650001401831650002301845650001901868650001501887650002101902650002201923650001301945650001401958650001101972650001901983650001302002650001402015650001102029653004002040653003002080653003102110653004602141700001902187700002102206700001802227700005702245773008402302856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60755769720221118060840.0211206e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075576972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJannath, Khatun A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2988-308110aFe3N decorated S/N doped carbon derived from a coordinated polymer as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and catecholamines oxidation  ap. 1-12.  aA novel iron-coordinated conducting polymer is synthesized, followed by the preparation of Fe₃N nanoparticle-embedded sulfur and nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe₃N/SNC) nanostructures via a one-step polymer pyrolysis strategy, which can exceptionally catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic media, and the oxidation of catecholamines. To synthesize the metal coordinated polymer, FeCl₃ is used as an oxidant and metal source for the polymerization of 3′,4′-diamino-terthiophene (DAT) to form poly-FeDAT. It is subsequently pyrolyzed at 900 °C to attain the Fe₃N/SNC catalyst. The Fe₃N/SNC electrocatalyst exhibit a more positive onset (0.985 V vs RHE), half-wave potentials (0.848 V), a higher limiting current density (5.47 mAcm⁻²), alcohol resistance and durability than the benchmark Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH, and it is comparable to Pt/C in 0.1 M HClO₄. It also displays exceptional performance for the catalytic oxidation of catecholamines and AP, which results in simultaneous detection of DA and AP in trace amounts (the detection limits were 110 nM and 270 nM (S/N = 3) for each species, respectively). The unique catalytic activity is ascribable to the presence of pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and Fe–N along with thiophene-S in the carbon, resulting in catalytically enhanced electron transfer from Fe₃N to N, S doped carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol tolerance 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acatecholamines 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3asulfur 0aIron-coordinated conducting polymer 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aOxidation of catecholamine 0aFe3N, S, and N doped-carbon nanoparticles1 aHuang, Yuanhui1 aSeo, Kyeong-Deok1 aPark, Deog-Su1 aShim, Yoon-Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6295-14800 tCarbon.g2022 Feb., v. 187 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013500168300001600303520178100319592002802100650001702128650002802145650001102173650001602184650001602200650001502216650001902231650000902250650002302259650001702282650002502299650002902324651001602353653001802369653001502387653001902402653002002421653002202441700001602463700002102479700001902500700001702519773010402536856008502640852000902725655001202734IND60568829420221118030850.0170517e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056882942DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2017.12917832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mijeong10aMonitoring canopy growth and grain yield of paddy rice in South Korea by using the GRAMI model and high spatial resolution imagery  ap. 534-551.  aMonitoring crop conditions and forecasting crop yields are both important for assessing crop production and for determining appropriate agricultural management practices; however, remote sensing is limited by the resolution, timing, and coverage of satellite images, and crop modeling is limited in its application at regional scales. To resolve these issues, the Gramineae (GRAMI)-rice model, which utilizes remote sensing data, was used in an effort to combine the complementary techniques of remote sensing and crop modeling. The model was then investigated for its capability to monitor canopy growth and estimate the grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa), at both the field and the regional scales, by using remote sensing images with high spatial resolution. The field scale investigation was performed using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, and the regional-scale investigation was performed using RapidEye satellite images. Simulated grain yields at the field scale were not significantly different (p = 0.45, p = 0.27, and p = 0.52) from the corresponding measured grain yields according to paired t -tests (α = 0.05). The model’s projections of grain yield at the regional scale represented the spatial grain yield variation of the corresponding field conditions to within ±1 standard deviation. Therefore, based on mapping the growth and grain yield of rice at both field and regional scales of interest within coverages of a UAV or the RapidEye satellite, our results demonstrate the applicability of the GRAMI-rice model to the monitoring and prediction of rice growth and grain yield at different spatial scales. In addition, the GRAMI-rice model is capable of reproducing seasonal variations in rice growth and grain yield at different spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aagricultural management 3acanopy 3acrop models 3agrain yield 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3arice 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial data 3astatistical analysis 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aSouth Korea 0acrop modeling 0aGRAMI-rice 0aremote sensing 0asatellite image 0aspatial variation1 aKo, Jonghan1 aJeong, Seungtaek1 aYeom, Jong-min1 aKim, Hyun-ok0 tGIScience & Remote Sensing.g2017 July 4, v. 54, no. 4 p.534-551dTaylor & Francisx1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2017.12917833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245012000160300001800280520106900298592002801367650002101395650001601416650001701432650001601449650002601465650001301491650001701504650001601521650002001537650001301557650001401570653001801584653002301602653002501625653001901650700001801669700001201687700001801699700001501717773012701732856008301859852000901942655001201951IND60748953220221118020351.0220214e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074895322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Ke10aFabrication of hyaluronic acid-based micelles with glutathione-responsiveness for targeted anticancer drug delivery  ap. 1586-1596.  aHyaluronic acid (HA), a natural polymer, has gained much attention recently because of its good biocompatibility and extensive availability. Herein, a novel drug delivery system based on hyaluronic acid-tetraphenyl ethylene conjugate (HA-SS-TPE) with glutathione (GSH)-responsiveness for targeted drug delivery is designed. During the self-assembly of HA-SS-TPE, doxorubicin (DOX) is loaded to form DOX-loaded polymeric micelles. These as-prepared DOX-loaded polymeric micelles not only exhibit fluorescent emission, but also fast glutathione-triggered dissociation to unload DOX by responding to tumor microenvironments. In-vitro investigations showed that the DOX-loaded polymeric micelles presented a higher intracellular release ratio in CD44-positive cells (ES2 and Hela) than in CD44-negative cells (MCF-7 and L929). Notably, in vivo investigations showed that DOX@HA-SS-TPE significantly suppressed tumor growth. As a result, such a GSH-responsive drug delivery system with fluorescent feature provides a potential treatment for CD44-overexpressing cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiopolymers 3adissociation 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aethylene 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahyaluronic acid 3amicelles 3aneoplasms 0aSelf-assembly 0aGSH-responsiveness 0aDrug delivery system 0aCancer therapy1 aFeng, Yecheng1 aGao, Ke1 aShi, Xiaojing1 aZhao, Xubo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 606 p.1586-1596dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.08.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245015000163300001600313500001900329520106500348592002801413650002201441650002001463650001301483653003501496653001101531653002901542653001101571653002101582700002501603700005701628700005601685700005401741773012401795856007701919852000901996655001202005IND60673508220221119191350.0191018e20181103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067350822DNAL7 a10.1093/jofore/fvy0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajuli, Rajan10aEconomic Contribution Analysis of the Forest-Product Industry: A Comparison of the Two Methods for Multisector Contribution Analysis Using IMPLAN  ap. 513-519.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aState agencies and universities often use IMPLAN software and data to quantify economic contributions of forest-product industries in specific regions. Since IMPLAN software is designed to estimate economic impacts rather than economic contributions, adjustments have to be made to the direct effect values to avoid overstating the results of the analysis. Two economic contribution analysis approaches are most common: internal adjustments to the IMPLAN software and external adjustments of the input values by using output multipliers. Results suggest that both methods of contribution analysis produce similar total effects, but their approaches of handling direct effects are substantially different. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed, and the importance of adjustments to obtain economic contribution estimates as opposed to economic impact estimates is highlighted. Furthermore, practitioners are cautioned to follow the steps carefully and explain which, between the two contribution analysis methods, was used in their analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aeconomic impact 3aforestry 0aeconomic contribution analysis 0aIMPLAN 0aforest products industry 0asector 0amatrix inversion1 aHenderson, James E.,1 aTanger, Shaun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9980-18681 aJoshi, Omkar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3254-66281 aDahal, Ram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6401-22280 tJournal of forestry.g2018 Nov. 03, v. 116, no. 6 p.513-519dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl42349x1938-37467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvy0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245010500217300001600322506010400338506007600442520188900518592002802407506003702435650001602472650002002488650001402508650002002522650001402542650002402556650001502580650001602595650002002611650001102631650001502642653001402657653001602671653001402687653002302701653001802724653000902742700006402751700002102815700006002836700006102896700005802957773009903015856008603114852000903200655001203209IND60769328320221207091500.0220531e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076932832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2022.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Gabrielle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5663-266210aInhibitory control performance is repeatable over time and across contexts in a wild bird population  ap. 305-318.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInhibitory control is one of several cognitive mechanisms required for self-regulation, decision making and attention towards tasks. Inhibitory control is expected to influence behavioural plasticity in animals, for example in the context of foraging, social interaction or responses to sudden changes in the environment. One widely used inhibitory control assay is the ‘detour task’ where subjects must avoid impulsively touching transparent barriers positioned in front of food, and instead access the food by an alternative but known route. However, because the detour task has been reported to measure factors unrelated to inhibitory control, including motivation, previous experience and persistence, the task may be unreliable for making cross-species comparisons, estimating individual differences and linking performance with socioecological traits. To address these concerns, we designed a variant of the detour task for wild great tits, Parus major, and deployed it at the nesting site across two spring seasons. We compared task performance of the same individuals in the wild across 2 years, and with their performance in captivity when tested using the classical cylinder detour task during the nonbreeding season. Potential confounds of motivation, previous experience, body size, sex, age and personality did not significantly predict performance, and temporal and contextual repeatability were low but significant. These results support the hypothesis that our assays captured intrinsic differences in inhibitory control. Instead of dismissing detour tasks and ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater’, we suggest confounds are likely system and experimental-design specific, and that assays for this potentially fundamental but largely overlooked source of behavioural plasticity in animal populations, should be validated and refined for each study system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParus major 3aanimal behavior 3abody size 3acaptive animals 3acognition 3aexperimental design 3amotivation 3apersonality 3asocial behavior 3aspring 3awild birds 0acognition 0adetour task 0agreat tit 0ainhibitory control 0arepeatability 0awild1 aReichert, Michael S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0159-43871 aCoomes, Jenny R.1 aKulahci, Ipek G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0104-03651 ade la Hera, Iván1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0550-95621 aQuinn, John L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9363-31460 tAnimal behaviour.g2022 May, v. 187 p.305-318dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2022.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245006000167300001800227500001100245520076900256592002801025596007501053596007201128650001201200650001501212650001401227650001701241650001601258650001401274700001501288700001901303700001901322700002101341700002001362700006201382773011701444856008001561852000901641655001201650IND60792972020221118163854.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079297202DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.144262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinclair, Rosalie10aPlant cytokinesis and the construction of new cell wall  ap. 2243-2255.  aREVIEW  aCytokinesis in plants is fundamentally different from that in animals and fungi. In plant cells, a cell plate forms through the fusion of cytokinetic vesicles and then develops into the new cell wall, partitioning the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. The formation of the cell plate entails multiple stages that involve highly orchestrated vesicle accumulation, fusion and membrane maturation, which occur concurrently with the timely deposition of polysaccharides such as callose, cellulose and cross‐linking glycans. This review summarizes the major stages in cytokinesis, endomembrane components involved in cell plate assembly and its transition to a new cell wall. An animation that can be widely used for educational purposes further summarizes the process.  aPublisher supplied data  aMCB 1818219cDivision of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB), NSF  aCA‐D‐PLS‐2132‐HcNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3acallose 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3acytokinesis 3acytoplasm1 aHsu, Grace1 aDavis, Destiny1 aChang, Mingqin1 aRosquete, Michel1 aIwasa, Janet H.1 aDrakakaki, Georgia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3949-86570 tFEBS letters.g2022 Sept., v. 596, no. 17 p.2243-2255dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.144263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011600172300001400288520102800302592002801330650004801358650001701406650002301423650000901446650001501455650002101470650001401491650004301505650001701548653001701565653001301582653001701595653000901612653002101621700005901642700001901701700002301720773009401743856008601837852000901923655001201932IND60639385820221118222301.0190529e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063938582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorencova, Alena10aSurvival of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in raw fermented sausages during production and storage  ap. 20-26.  aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the etiological agent of paratuberculosis, is considered to be a potential zoonotic pathogen and meat is one of the sources of MAP exposure for humans. MAP has been shown to be relatively resistant to different food processing methods, but there is a lack of information about the effects of ripening and fermentation processes on MAP survival in meat. Our results demonstrate that a short ripening process during teewurst production did not reduce MAP counts and viable mycobacteria were detected even during 4 weeks of storage. Although no viable MAP was recovered during the dry fermented sausage production process, there was no reduction in MAP count detected by real time PCR during production and storage of both sausages. Although the impact of foodborne exposure to viable MAP and/or mycobacterial components has not yet been clearly determined, the consumption of raw fermented meat products may be considered as a possible route of MAP transmission to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3afermentation 3afermented sausages 3ameat 3ameat aging 3aparatuberculosis 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astorage time 0aFermentation 0aRipening 0aInactivation 0aMeat 0aParatuberculosis1 aBabak, Vladimir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0826-10751 aKralova, Alena1 aBorilova, Gabriela0 tMeat science.g2019 Sept., v. 155 p.20-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014600166300002000312520136200332592002801694650001701722650002101739650001501760650001401775650001101789650001301800650001301813650001101826650001501837650001101852650001401863650001901877650002001896650001701916650001601933653002001949653002201969653001701991653001702008653002102025653003502046700001802081700002002099700001802119700002602137700002402163700001302187700001902200700001202219700002202231773013002253856007802383852000902461655001202470IND60550901920221119161418.0161011e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055090192DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b079402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarey, Anne-Marie10aPhotocurrent Generation by Photosynthetic Purple Bacterial Reaction Centers Interfaced with a Porous Antimony-Doped Tin Oxide (ATO) Electrode  ap. 25104-25110.  aThe ability to exchange energy and information between biological and electronic materials is critical in the development of hybrid electronic systems in biomedicine, environmental sensing, and energy applications. While sensor technology has been extensively developed to collect detailed molecular information, less work has been done on systems that can specifically modulate the chemistry of the environment with temporal and spatial control. The bacterial photosynthetic reaction center represents an ideal photonic component of such a system in that it is capable of modifying local chemistry via light-driven redox reactions with quantitative control over reaction rates and has inherent spectroscopic probes for monitoring function. Here a well-characterized model system is presented, consisting of a transparent, porous electrode (antimony-doped tin oxide) which is electrochemically coupled to the reaction center via a cytochrome c molecule. Upon illumination, the reaction center performs the 2-step, 2-electron reduction of a ubiquinone derivative which exchanges with oxidized quinone in solution. Electrons from the electrode then move through the cytochrome to reoxidize the reaction center electron donor. The result is a facile platform for performing redox chemistry that can be optically and electronically controlled in time and space.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome c 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3alighting 3amedicine 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoxides 3aphotonics 3aphotosynthesis 3aredox reactions 3aspectroscopy 3aubiquinones 0areaction center 0aelectron transfer 0acytochrome c 0aphotocurrent 0aporous electrode 0aantimony-doped tin oxide (ATO)1 aZhang, HaoJie1 aMieritz, Daniel1 aVolosin, Alex1 aGardiner, Alastair

Massless Dirac carriers and massive normal carriers of the HOPG are distinguished from the analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas van Alphen oscillations. The quantum Hall effect-like plateaus are diminished after proton-irradiation owing to increasing interlayer interaction along the c-axis that causes the change of two-dimensional massless carriers of the HOPG to three-dimensional massive carriers. Moreover, tight-binding calculations exhibit similar diminishing plateaus of the Hall conductivity of HOPG as the interlayer interaction increases. This observation of dimensional crossover of the Hall conductivity demonstrates that proton-irradiation would be a useful tool to control quantum transport in HOPG through manipulating its interlayer interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexhibitions 3agraphene 3aoscillation 0aGraphite 0aQuantum Hall effect 0aProton-irradiation 0aShubnikov-de Haas oscillation 0aDe Haas Van Alphen effect1 aLee, Kyu Won1 aJang, Jae Won,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2162-45201 aLee, Choel Eui0 tCarbon.g2022 Feb., v. 187 p.126-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014200165300001800307500001900325520120300344592002801547596006401575650003101639650002101670650002201691650001701713650001801730650003701748650002201785650001301807650002501820650001301845650002901858700001901887700001901906700006001925773012401985856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60708638620221121124913.0200829e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070863862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05668-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Hyunjin10aRegulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcription by interleukin-31 via early growth response 1 (EGR-1) in HaCaT keratinocytes  ap. 5953-5962.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is a large precursor protein of and β-endorphin. POMC expressed in keratinocytes regulates various pathophysiological responses, such as pruritus in atopic dermatitis. Interleukin (IL)-31 is a T helper 2 (Th2)-derived cytokine that functions as a pruritogen, stimulating the sensory neurons in the skin. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying IL-31-induced POMC expression in keratinocytes remains largely unknown. Herein, using a 5′-serial deletion and site-specific mutation constructs of the regulatory region of POMC, we demonstrated that a putative EGR1-binding sequence (EBS) motif in POMC is required for its upregulation by IL-31 in HaCaT keratinocytes. Notably, EGR-1 directly interacted with the EBS motif in POMC. The ectopic expression of EGR-1 stimulated the POMC promoter activity, whereas the knockdown of EGR-1 expression by RNA interference reduced IL-31-induced POMC expression. Furthermore, we observed that three major mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase, mediated IL-31-induced EGR-1 expression. In summary, our results suggest that EGR-1 trans-activates POMC in response to IL-31 stimulation in HaCaT keratinocytes.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2018R1A2B2004653cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aRNA interference 3aatopic dermatitis 3ainterleukins 3akeratinocytes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amolecular biology 3amutation 3apro-opiomelanocortin 3apruritus 3atranscription (genetics)1 aAhn, Sung Shin1 aLee, Young Han1 aShin, Soon Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1075-00110 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.5953-5962dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05668-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245006100183300001400244520098300258592002801241650001901269650001901288650001901307650001301326650001401339650001001353650001901363650001201382650001701394650001901411650001401430650002001444650001001464653001201474653002501486653002001511653001801531653002401549700007101573700005901644700003101703700002201734700002801756700004201784773009401826856008601920852000902006655001202015IND60639385920221122094303.0190529e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063938592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalla Costa, Osmar Antônio10aRisk factors associated with pig pre-slaughtering losses  ap. 61-68.  aThe incidence of non-ambulatory non-injured (NANI), non-ambulatory injured (NAI) and dead pigs on-arrival at three Brazilian slaughterhouses were evaluated in 37,962 pigs to identify risk factors linked to them, besides carcass bruises and limb fractures. Total pre-slaughtering losses were 1.18%, in which NAI (0.39%) and NANI (0.37%) incidences contributed the most. A positive relation between on farm steeper ramp slope >20° and the incidence of NAI, NANI and dead pigs at unloading was found. Farm size, pigs/pen, enthalpy at loading, transportation time, truck loading order, muscle thickness and carcass weight, were identified as risk factors for pre-slaughtering losses. Loading procedures influenced the occurrence of limb fractures and bruises (which are a welfare issue and should be reduced). Therefore, personal training on pre-slaughter handling is essential to reduce the risk factors to improve animal welfare and avoid losses during the pre-slaughter process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abone fractures 3acarcass weight 3aenthalpy 3afarm size 3afarms 3afood transport 3amuscles 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 0aBruises 0aCarcass condemnation 0aDead on-arrival 0aFatigued pigs 0aNon-ambulatory pigs1 aDalla Costa, Filipe Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6038-841X1 aFeddern, Vivian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8678-24151 aLopes, Letícia dos Santos1 aColdebella, Arlei1 aGregory, Neville George1 ade Lima, Gustavo Julio Mello Monteiro0 tMeat science.g2019 Sept., v. 155 p.61-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006700161300001800228500001100246520099300257592002801250596005901278596005901337596005501396596007201451596007001523596007001593596007001663596007101733596007001804596007001874596007101944596007102015596006902086650002002155650001902175650001402194650001502208650001802223650002402241650002602265650002102291650001402312650001202326650001302338700001802351700005602369773011702425856008002542852000902622655001202631IND60792972320221118163811.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079297232DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.143622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Baiying10aCOPII vesicles in plant autophagy and endomembrane trafficking  ap. 2314-2323.  aREVIEW  aIn eukaryotes, the endomembrane system allows for spatiotemporal compartmentation of complicated cellular processes. The plant endomembrane system consists of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the trans‐Golgi network, the multivesicular body and the vacuole. Anterograde traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is mediated by coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that turns over cellular materials upon nutrient deprivation or in adverse environments, exploits double‐membrane autophagosomes to recycle unwanted constituents in the lysosome/vacuole. Accumulating evidence reveals novel functions of plant COPII vesicles in autophagy and their regulation by abiotic stresses. Here, we summarize current knowledge about plant COPII vesicles in endomembrane trafficking and then highlight recent findings showing their distinct roles in modulating the autophagic flux and stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data  cCAS‐Croucher Funding Scheme for Joint Laboratories  a91854201cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cChinese University of Hong Kong Research Committee  aAoE/M‐05/12cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC2009‐19GcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC4002‐17GcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC4002‐20WcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC4002‐21EFcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC4033‐19EcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aC4041‐18EcResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aCUHK14100818cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aCUHK14101219cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee  aR4005‐18cResearch Grants Council, University Grants Committee 3aGolgi apparatus 3aautophagosomes 3aautophagy 3acatabolism 3acoat proteins 3aendomembrane system 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aeukaryotic cells 3alysosomes 3atraffic 3avacuoles1 aZeng, Yonglun1 aJiang, Liwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-14720 tFEBS letters.g2022 Sept., v. 596, no. 17 p.2314-2323dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.143623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014100160300002000301520167500321592002801996650002802024650001902052650001902071650001902090650001302109650003202122650001702154700001902171700002002190700006002210700002002270700003302290700002402323700006002347700002302407700002202430700006402452700006302516773014902579856007702728852000902805655001202814IND60756792320220221000000.0220119e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075679232DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c083832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomio, Matteo10aDispersity within Brushes Plays a Major Role in Determining Their Interfacial Properties: The Case of Oligoxazoline-Based Graft Polymers  ap. 19067-19077.  aMany synthetic polymers used to form polymer-brush films feature a main backbone with functional, oligomeric side chains. While the structure of such graft polymers mimics biomacromolecules to an extent, it lacks the monodispersity and structural purity present in nature. Here we demonstrate that side-chain heterogeneity within graft polymers significantly influences hydration and the occurrence of hydrophobic interactions in the subsequently formed brushes and consequently impacts fundamental interfacial properties. This is demonstrated for the case of poly(methacrylate)s (PMAs) presenting oligomeric side chains of different length (n) and dispersity. A precise tuning of brush structure was achieved by first synthesizing oligo(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) methacrylates (OEOXMAs) by cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP), subsequently purifying them into discrete macromonomers with distinct values of n by column chromatography, and finally obtaining poly[oligo(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) methacrylate]s (POEOXMAs) by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Assembly of POEOXMA on Au surfaces yielded graft polymer brushes with different side-chain dispersities and lengths, whose properties were thoroughly investigated by a combination of variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCMD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. Side-chain dispersity, or dispersity within brushes, leads to assemblies that are more hydrated, less adhesive, and more lubricious and biopassive compared to analogous films obtained from graft polymers characterized by a homogeneous structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3achromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3aspectroscopy1 aGrob, Benjamin1 aTrachsel, Lucca1 aMattarei, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2023-07491 aMorgese, Giulia1 aRamakrishna, Shivaprakash N.1 aNiccolai, Francesca1 aGuazzelli, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2884-30531 aParadisi, Cristina1 aMartinelli, Elisa1 aSpencer, Nicholas D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7873-79051 aBenetti, Edmondo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5657-57140 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 143, no. 45 p.19067-19077dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c083833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001800281500001900299520130000318592002801618596004501646650000801691650001601699650001701715650002201732650002101754650004301775650002001818700002301838700002101861700006301882773012401945856008202069852000902151655001202160IND60708638720221121124929.0200829e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070863872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05664-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheli, Stefania10aDNA extraction from fresh and frozen plasma: an alternative for real-time PCR genotyping in pharmacogenetics  ap. 6451-6455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGenomic DNA, extracted from whole blood samples, is a key element for all genotyping workflows. When stored serum or plasma is the only source of DNA available, the main problem to overcome is the low quantity and poor quality of the DNA obtained, irrespective of the isolation procedure applied. The prevalence of artifacts, such as unbalanced amplification of alleles at specific sites (allelic dropout), is typically associated with PCR amplification of low quality/quantity DNA template, which is known to promote genotyping errors. The aim of this study was to determine whether the quality of genomic DNA from plasma samples may affect genotyping results. The ABCB1 c.3435C>T polymorphism was determined with two different real-time PCR assays, LightSNiP and TaqMan assays. We observed higher signal fluorescence values with DNA isolated from whole blood samples than with those from fresh and frozen plasma samples, due to reduced DNA concentration in the second ones. Despite the signal strength, a 100% concordance of genotyping data was however obtained in both assay types, regardless of the method of extraction. Our results show that, regardless of the lower DNA yield, extraction from plasma samples can still represent a valid alternative for real-time PCR genotyping application.  aPublisher supplied data  aRF-2016-02363761cMinistero della Salute 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3afluorescence 3amolecular biology 3apharmacogenomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal strength1 aNapoli, Alessandra1 aClementi, Emilio1 aMontrasio, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8276-36630 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.6451-6455dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05664-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001500180245016600195300001400361500002400375500001500399520148400414650001601898650003801914650001901952650001001971650001001981650002801991650001302019650002002032650001402052650002802066650003002094650002302124650003102147650002702178650002702205650002502232650002802257650001802285650002302303650001902326650002402345651001002369653002502379653002302404700001802427700001502445773009702460852000902557856009302566930003302659945002502692946001102717655001202728IND4400794220221119082004.0080201e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440079422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2007.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ202 0aX3801 aBhat, M.A.10aPrevalence and virulence gene profiles of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli from diarrhoeic and healthy lambs in India  ap. 65-70.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis communication describes the prevalence and virulence attributes of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolates in lambs with and without diarrhoea in Kashmir, India. One hundred twenty and 164 E. coli isolates belonging to 56 different 'O' serogroups were isolated from 101 diarrhoeic and 135 healthy lambs, respectively. All the 284 isolates were screened for presence of stx1, stx2, eae and ehxA genes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-PCR). Forty four (36.67%) isolates from lambs with diarrhoea carried at least one virulence gene studied. Twenty one (17.5%) and 15 (12.5%) isolates from diarrhoeic lambs were STEC and EPEC, respectively. Thirty (18.3%) isolates from healthy lambs possessed at least one virulence gene studied. Fourteen (8.53%) and 16 (9.75%) isolates from healthy lambs were detected as STEC and EPEC, respectively. Sixteen (45.71%) of 35 STEC isolates from both diarrhoeic and healthy lambs, carried both stx1 and stx2 genes, 15 (42.85%) had stx1 alone and four (11.42%) had stx2 gene alone. Statistically the difference between prevalence of STEC in diarrhoeic and healthy lambs was significant but that of EPEC was insignificant. One (2.85%) and 28 (80%) of STEC isolates possessed eae and ehxA genes, respectively. The high percentage of STEC and EPEC prevalent in diarrhoeic and healthy lambs may serve as source of infection to humans. STEC seem to be associated with diarrhoea in lambs. 3aShiga toxin 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3asheep diseases 3agenes 3alambs 3abacterial contamination 3adiarrhea 3arisk assessment 3avirulence 3aepidemiological studies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abacterial adhesion 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3amolecular epidemiology 3aEscherichia infections 3adisease surveillance 3ahuman health and safety 3anormal values 3adisease prevalence 3afood pathogens 3aon-farm food safety 3aIndia 0abacterial infections 0amolecular genetics1 aNishikawa, Y.1 aWani, S.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2008 Feb., v. 75, no. 1 p.65-70dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2007.08.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080529b20080606c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01821naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245010900200300001800309500002400327500001500351506007600366520040300442506003700845650001800882650001600900650002500916650001500941650002600956650001400982653001600996700002101012700002301033700002101056700001801077700001901095700001701114700001901131773013601150852000901286856008001295655001201375IND4404319320221207072932.0080412e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440431932DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02801-072doi7 aPMC22931582pmcid7 a183104152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIversen, Carol10aDevelopment of a Novel Screening Method for the Isolation of "Cronobacter" spp. (Enterobacter sakazakii)  ap. 2550-2553.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA differential medium, "Cronobacter" screening broth, has been designed to complement agars based on hydrolysis of chromogenic α-glucopyranoside substrates.

  1 aKarr-Lilienthal, L.K.10aIleal amino acid digestibilities by pigs fed soybean meals from five major soybean-producing countries  ap. 3198-3209.  aGrowing conditions and processing technologies to which soybeans (SB) are exposed have an effect on digestibilities of AA found in the resultant soybean meals (SBM). This study evaluated SBM from five major SB-producing countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, and the United States). An industry representative in each country collected samples of unprocessed SB and SBM subjectively determined to be of high, intermediate, or low quality. The SB from each country were processed into SBM under uniform conditions in the United States. Five experiments (each examining the three SBM and the SB processed in the United States from a single country) were conducted to determine true ileal AAd digestibilities. In addition, a standard SBM purchased on the open market in the United States was used in all experiments as a control. Data from pigs fed a low-protein casein diet in each study were used to calculate true AA digestibilities. Pigs were fitted with simple T-cannulas at the terminal ileum and allotted to treatments in Latin square design experiments. Duplicate experiments were conducted at the University of Illinois and at The Ohio State University. Within each country comparison, pigs fed the SBM processed in the U.S. from SB grown in the five countries had lower (P < 0.05) true total amino acid (TAA) digestibilities than did pigs fed any of the SBM prepared within the country of origin, except the United States. This indicates that processing conditions used at the U.S. pilot plant were not ideal when using SB from other countries. True TAA digestibilities of the diets containing the high-, intermediate-, and low-quality SBM did not differ, except for China, where the low-quality SBM (83.5%) had a lower (P < 0.05) digestibility than the intermediate- (89.6%) or high- (89.0%) quality meals. Soybean meal produced in Argentina (average, 87%) and Brazil (average, 82%) had lower (P < 0.05) true TAA digestibilities than did the standard SBM (91%), indicating that the processing plants in those countries may produce a less digestible SBM than that available on the open market in the United States. 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3asoybean meal 3ageographical variation 3aamino acids 3aileum 3adigestible protein 2aAgriculture 2aAmino Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSwinexmetabolism 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aIndia 3aUnited States 0aArgentina 0aBrazil 0aChina 0aIndia 0aUnited States 0aamino acid digestibility1 aMerchen, N.R.1 aGrieshop, C.M.1 aFlahaven, M.A.1 aMahan, D.C.1 aFastinger, N.D.1 aWatts, M.1 aFahey, G.C.

The Mak1 gene from the fungal pathogen Nectria haematococca encodes an FAD-dependent mono-oxygenase, known to specifically hydroxylate the phytoalexins medicarpin and maackiain, converting them to less fungitoxic derivatives. Two binary vector constructs were made containing the coding regions from two fungal clones, a Mak1 cDNA (intronless) and a genomic (including three fungal introns) clone, regulated by an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The constructs were introduced into tobacco to check for expression of active fungal enzyme in plant cells and for splicing of fungal introns. Leaves of tobacco plants transformed with the Mak1 cDNA construct readily metabolized infiltrated medicarpin to 1a-hydroxymedicarpin, indicating high levels of active enzyme. RT-PCR analysis of tobacco plants transformed with the Mak1 genomic construct indicated no processing of Mak1 introns, and no Mak1 activity was detected in these plants. When using plants containing the Mak1 cDNA construct, immunolocalization with a Mak1-specific antibody together with cellular fractionation indicated that Mak1 protein accumulated in the plant cytoplasm, associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes; medicarpin biosynthetic enzymes have been localized to the same subcellular region. The Mak1 cDNA construct is therefore suitable for use in studies to selectively eliminate medicarpin accumulation to assess the relative importance of medicarpin in the antifungal defense mechanisms of alfalfa and other legumes. 3agenetic transformation 3acomplementary DNA 3atransgenic plants 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aFusarium eumartii 3acytochemistry 3acell membranes 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aleaves 3aphytoalexins 2aAlternative Splicing 2aBenzopyransxmetabolism 2aBlotting, Western 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aHypocrealesxenzymology 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPterocarpans 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aNectria haematococca 0adetoxification 0agenes 0acytoplasm1 aWatson, B.S.1 aLopez-Meyer, M.1 aPaiva, N.L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2001 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.421-432x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03181naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245013200177300001600309520151300325650000801838650001201846650001701858650001301875650001101888650001101899650001201910650003501922650001701957650001801974650002901992650001702021650001502038650001102053650002702064650004402091650004602135650002402181650002102205650004002226653002002266653002902286653003702315700002602352773013402378852000902512856008602521930003302607946001102640655001202651IND4391182820221119082256.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439118282DNAL7 a174433132pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1256-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yun 10aAutomated single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis using fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and one-class classifiers  ap. 655-664.  aWe have developed a new method of highly automated SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis for identification of genotypes. The data were generated by the Taqman reaction. A total of 18 half-plates were analysed for different genes, each consisting of 48 wells, including six synthetic DNA samples, three background samples, and 39 human DNA samples. Fluorescence spectra were obtained from each well. The characteristics of the spectra depended on whether the genotype originated from one of three classes--homozygotic wild-type, mutant, or heterozygote. The main problems are: (1) spectral variation from one half-plate to another is sometimes very substantial; (2) the spectra of heterozygotic samples vary substantially; (3) outliers are common; and (4) not all possible alleles are represented on each half-plate so the number of types of spectra can vary, depending on the gene being analysed. We solved these problems by using a signal-standardisation technique (piecewise direct standardisation, PDS) and then built two one-class classifiers based on PCA models (PCA data description) to identify the two types of homozygote. The remaining samples were tested to see whether they could be approximated well by a linear combination of the spectra of two types of homozygote. If they could, they were identified as heterozygotic; if not, they were identified as outliers. The results are characterised by very low false-positive errors and 2 to 6% overall false-negative errors.

Forage species had low proportion of the tissues composed of thick-walled cells and high proportion of the tissues composed of thin-walled cells in all examined plant parts. The reduction of the proportion of lignified xylem, sclerenchyma and sclerenchymatous interfascicular parenchyma, were suggested as basic selection criteria in breeding Trifolium species for improved digestibility. T. angulatum, T. medium and T. pannonicum proved to be very similar to the forage species in their histological composition, proportion of thick-walled and thin-walled cells and type of variation of the examined parameters. We believe that these species have some potential for use as forages in their own right, but aditional biochemical, physiological and morphological investigations should be conducted. 3asclerenchyma 3ainterspecific variation 3apeduncle 3astems 3ahistology 3aTrifolium 3aforage legumes 3aforage quality 3apetioles 3adigestibility 3axylem 3awild relatives 3alignin 0aspecies differences 0aplant anatomy 0aparenchyma 0aleaflets1 aMerkulov, Ljiljana S.1 aLukovic, Jadranka Z.1 aBoza, Pal P.0 tEuphytica.g2008 Mar., v. 160, no. 2 p.277-286dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-007-9574-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/02/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03187naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001800154245012900172300001600301500002400317520180800341650001102149650001802160650001202178650001402190650001402204650001702218650002602235650001502261650002802276650002602304650001102330653003402341653003102375700002002406700002702426700002302453773009002476852000902566856008502575930003302660945002502693946001102718655001202729IND4400809220221119082313.0080203e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440080922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-007-9538-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aZhou, Shujun 10aGenome composition of triploid lily cultivars derived from sexual polyploidization of Longiflorum x Asiatic hybrids (Lilium)  ap. 207-215.  aIncludes references  aAbout 19 cultivars, which had originated from backcrosses between F1 LA (Longiflorum x Asiatic) hybrids (2n = 2x = 24) as female parents and Asiatic cultivars as male parents (2n = 2x = 24), were analyzed with genomic in situ hybridization. 17 of them were triploid (2n = 3x = 36), and two aneuploid (2n = 3x + 1 = 37). The triploid cultivars had resulted from the functional 2n eggs produced by the female parents (F1 hybrids) because first division restitution (FDR) occurred in their meiosis during megasporogenesis. Similarly, the aneuploid cultivars had originated from viable 2n + 1 eggs. The extra chromosome in cultivar 041555 or 041572 resulted from one univalent or one half-bivalent which might have lagged behind when the sister chromatids of the other univalents and half-bivalents were segregating during the FDR process in their LA hybrid parents, respectively. That the majority of cultivars possessed recombinant chromosomes showed that intergenomic recombination might play an important role during the selection of the cultivars directly from BC1 progenies. That five cultivars of the 15 recombinant cultivars only had reciprocal recombinant chromosomes and 10 cultivars had non-reciprocal recombinant chromosomes indicates that the latter are more important. Because 9 of the 10 non-reciprocal recombinant cultivars possessed substitutions for recombinant segments, it also indicated that such substitutions could be an important source for the genetic variation in the sexual triploid BC1 progenies. In such cases there was a potential for the expression of the recessive genes of the backcross parent in a nulliplex (aaa) condition in the substituted segments. Genetic variation resulting from such nulliplex loci might have played a role in the selection of some of the cultivars. 3aLilium 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3atriploidy 3acultivars 3abackcrossing 3ain situ hybridization 3aaneuploidy 3achromosome transmission 3agenetic recombination 3agenome 0agenomic in situ hybridization 0aintergenomic recombination1 aRamanna, M.

Chinese Spring) aleurone cells. The deduced proteins show a high similarity to each other and to thioredoxin h from other sources, in particular from T. aestivum and T. durum. One of them, TRXhA, was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged polypeptide and used to raise polyclonal antibodies by immunization of rabbits. These antibodies identified a single band (ca. 13.5 kDa) in western blot analysis of protein extracts from all wheat organs analyzed. TRXhA and TRXhB when expressed in E. coli as intact polypeptides showed indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility, which corresponded to the 13.5 kDa polypeptide detected in wheat protein extracts. The amount of thioredoxin h transcripts increased in scutellum and aleurone cells during germination but GA3 did not exert any stimulatory effect on thioredoxin h expression. Although northern blot analysis detected a single band, competitive RT-PCR showed that this band is due to the accumulation of both TrxhA and TrxhB mRNAs. These results suggest that the single band detected in western blots is due to the presence of at least two thioredoxin h polypeptides. Immunolocalization experiments confirmed the high content of thioredoxins h in scutellum and aleurone cells, and showed a low content in the starchy endosperm of germinating grains. Interestingly, though these proteins are evenly distributed in the cytosol, the highest levels of thioredoxins h were detected in the nucleus, both in aleurone and scutellum cells. 3apolypeptides 3aseed germination 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amolecular weight 3aamino acid sequences 3aaleurone layer 3aTriticum aestivum 3anucleotide sequences 3aelectrophoresis 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplant proteins 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGerminationxgenetics 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aProtein Isoformsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aThioredoxin h 2aThioredoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aseeds 0anuclei 0amolecular sequence data 0ascutellum1 aCrespo, J.L.1 aFlorencion, F.J.1 aCejudo, F.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2001 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.361-371x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02743naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245012600213300001600339500002400355500001500379520061500394650002101009650001101030650001301041650002101054650001701075650001701092650002201109650001501131650001401146650002901160650001201189650002101201650002101222650003001243650001701273650001601290650002201306650001201328650002801340650006801368650002801436650000901464650007301473650001801546650001101564650006601575650000901641653001001650653002101660653001801681700002001699700001901719700002101738773011601759852000901875856009201884930003301976945002502009946001102034655001202045IND4400830120221119082231.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440083012DNAL7 a178502662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2007.00438.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 avan K.laveren, N.J.10aCollapse following gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to a congenital duodenal diverticulum in two littermate boxer pups  ap. 103-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University's Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period.

It was shown that the StMCPI is encoded by a gene family in Solanum tuberosum (potato), but SbMCPI might be a single-copy gene in the non-tuberizing species Solanum brevidens. The StMCPI promoter shows evolutionary relatedness to the S. brevidens-derived SbMCPI and to the fruit-specific tomato promoter 2A11. Both StMCPI and SbMCP1 promoter regions were able to confer tuber- and berry-specific expression for the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene in potato suggesting that the difference in MCPI gene expression is in trans regulatory factors between the tuberizing and the non-tuberizing Solanum species. The MCPI promoters did not respond to metabolic, environmental or hormonal signals in leaves. Thus, the MCPI genes are regulated in a different way than the other known tuber-specific genes and potentially are suitable for biotechnological application in potato to provide specific transgene expression in tuber and berry. 3aprotein synthesis 3aSolanum palustre 3aevolution 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acid sequences 3atubers 3aenzyme inhibitors 3apeptidases 3agene expression 3areporter genes 3amultigene family 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGlucuronidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtease Inhibitors 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transduction 2aSolanaceaexgenetics 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aTissue Distribution 0aregulatory sequences 0agenetic regulation 0afruits 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aLovas, A.1 aBanfalvi, Z.1 aLakatos, L.1 aPolgar, Z.1 aHorvath, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2001 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.301-311x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04353naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245013500183300001800318500001500336520242100351650001802772650001402790650002702804650001902831650002102850650002302871650002402894650002002918650001802938650001402956650002102970650001002991650001603001650004703017650001203064650001403076650002503090650007803115650001103193650002303204650000903227650002403236650002203260650004503282650003003327653002503357653002303382700001803405700001603423700001803439700001403457700001203471700001503483700001503498773008603513852000903599930003303608945002503641946001303666655001203679IND4366080820221119082114.0041215e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436608082DNAL7 a154849452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDeRouchey, J.M.10aEffects of rancidity and free fatty acids in choice white grease on growth performance and nutrient digestibility in weanling pigs  ap. 2937-2944.  a2019-12-05  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effects of rancidity and FFA in choice white grease (CWG) on growth performance and nutrient digestibility in nursery pigs. In Exp. 1, 150 crossbred pigs (average initial BW of 6.8 kg and average initial age of 21 d) were used. Treatments (as-fed basis) were a corn-soybean meal-based control with no added fat, 6% CWG, and 6% CWG heated at 80 degrees C, with oxygen gas bubbled through it at 849 mL/min for 5, 7, 9, or 11 d. Peroxide value for the CWG increased as oxidative exposure was increased from 0 to 7 d (i.e., peroxide values of 1, 40, and 105 mEq/kg for d 0, 5, and 7, respectively), but decreased to 1 mEq/kg as the hydroperoxides decomposed after 9 and 11 d of oxidation. Pigs fed the control diet (no added fat) had the same (P = 0.91) overall ADG (d 0 to 35) but lower G:F (P < 0.04) than pigs fed diets with added fat. As for the effects of fat quality, ADG (linear effect, P < 0.01) and ADFI (linear effect, P < 0.001) decreased as the fat was made more rancid. However, there were no changes in digestibility of fatty acids as the rancidity of the fat was increased (P = 0.16), suggesting that the negative effects of rancidity were from decreased food intake and not decreased nutrient utilization. In Exp. 2, 125 crossbred pigs (average initial BW of 6.2 kg and average initial age of 21 d) were used to determine the effects of FFA in CWG on the growth performance and nutrient digestibility in nursery pigs. Treatments (as-fed basis) were a corn-soybean meal-based control with no added fat, 6% CWG, and 6% CWG that had been treated with 872, 1,752 or 2,248 lipase units/g of fat. The FFA concentrations in the CWG were increased from 2% with no lipase added to 18, 35, and 53% as lipase additions were increased. Pigs fed the control diet (no added fat) had the same (P = 0.30) overall ADG (d 0 to 33) but lower G:F (P < 0.01) than pigs fed diets with added fat. There were no effects of FFA concentration on ADG (P = 0.18), and ADFI increased (linear effect, P < 0.04) as FFA concentration in the CWG increased. Fatty acid digestibility was not affected (P = 0.17) by FFA in the diet. In conclusion, our data suggest that as fat is oxidized (especially to peroxide values greater than 40 mEq/kg), ADG and ADFI in nursery pigs will decrease; however, FFA concentrations of at least 53% do not adversely affect utilization of CWG in nursery pigs. 3aswine feeding 3aweanlings 3afatty acid composition 3aperoxide value 3afree fatty acids 3alipid peroxidation 3achoice white grease 3aliveweight gain 3adigestibility 3arancidity 3alipid metabolism 3aswine 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aanimal fats and oils 0aanimal performance1 aHancock, J.D.1 aHines, R.H.1 aMaloney, C.A.1 aLee, D.J.1 aCao, H.1 aDean, D.W.1 aPark, J.S.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Oct., v. 82, no. 10 p.2937-2944x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20100518b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262520138400278650001401662650002301676650002201699650001401721650001101735650000901746650001201755650001201767650001801779650001401797650001001811650002001821650001101841650001601852650001401868650001601882653001501898653002101913700002301934700002001957700001901977700001401996773012702010852000902137856009302146930003302239946001102272655001202283IND4392059920221119082049.0070603e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439205992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01189.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiaboe, K.K.M.10aBionomics of the acarophagous ladybird beetle Stethorus tridens fed Tetranychus evansi  ap. 355-361.  aThe bionomics of Stethorus tridens Gordon fed Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard were studied in the laboratory. The number of prey consumed by S. tridens increased with increasing instar levels and the total mean number consumed during immature development was 184.1 ± 18.02 T. evansi nymphs per individual. For adult male and adult female, the daily consumption was 41.3 ± 0.80 and 67.8 ± 1.69 nymphs, respectively. Stethorus tridens successfully developed to adulthood between 20 and 30°C but failed at 10, 15 and 35°C. The lower thermal threshold for egg-to-adult development estimated via linear regression and the modified Logan model was 9.2 and 8.1°C, respectively. The optimum and maximum temperatures for egg-to-adult development were around 29-31 and 32.9°C, respectively. Egg to adult development time was 23.8 ± 0.24, 17.4 ± 0.22, 16.2 ± 0.22 and 12.1 ± 0.16 days at 20, 24, 27 and 30°C, respectively. At 27°C, the sex ratio, expressed as the proportion of females, was 0.54 and the mean preoviposition, oviposition and postoviposition periods were 10.3 ± 0.67, 31.2 ± 4.74 and 30.2 ± 5.24 days, respectively. The oviposition rate was 4.0 ± 0.16 eggs/female/day with a female mean longevity of 71.6 ± 6.19 days and an intrinsic rate of natural increase of 0.104. The potential of S. tridens as a candidate natural enemy of T. evansi is discussed. 3aStethorus 3aTetranychus evansi 3aadult development 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aeggs 3afemales 3ainstars 3alinear models 3alongevity 3amales 3anatural enemies 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3asex ratio 3atemperature 0alife table 0aprey consumption1 aGondim, M.G.C.

  1 aPage, B.T.10aAssociation of markers in the bovine CAPN1 gene with meat tenderness in large crossbred populations that sample influential industry sires  ap. 3474-3481.  aTwo previously identified single-nucleotide polymorphism markers located within the micromolar calcium-activated neutral protease gene (CAPN1) were evaluated for their association with variation in meat tenderness using one commercial sample of Simmental x Angus crossbred calves and one multibreed, crossbred research herd. The commercial sample included 362 animals sired by 23 registered Simmental bulls bred to unregistered Angus cows and represented current industry animals in which to test the predictive merit of the markers. The second sample was a research herd including 564 steers from the Germplasm Evaluation Cycle VII population at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, produced with semen from popular sires of the seven Bos taurus beef breeds with the most registrations in the United States (Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin, Red Angus, and Simmental) on Angus, Hereford, and MARC III cows. These animals form a relatively outbred population that constituted a stringent test of the predictive merit of the genetic markers, although small groups were half-sibs. Warner-Bratzler shear force measurements were used to determine tenderness phenotypes for all animals. The populations were genotyped for two markers that predict variation at amino acid positions 316 and 530 of the mu-calpain polypeptide, produced by the CAPN1 gene. Minor allele frequencies for markers 316 and 530 in the commercial sample were 0.17 and 0.37, respectively, and in the Cycle VII animals, were 0.20 and 0.28, respectively. Both markers showed association with shear force in the commercial sample (P = 0.04) and the Cycle VII population (P = 0.02), supporting the hypothesis that they represent potential markers to aid selection for improved meat tenderness in commercial populations of beef cattle in the United States. 3abeef bulls 3agenetic markers 3acalpain 3ameat tenderness 3abeef quality 3alinkage (genetics) 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aAngus 3aHereford 3aSimmental 3acrossbreds 3asteers 3aprediction 3aphenotype 3agenotype 3agenetic improvement 3agene frequency 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCalpainxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aUnited States1 aCasas, E.1 aQuaas, R.L.1 aThallman, R.M.1 aWheeler, T.L.1 aShackelford, S.D.1 aKoohmaraie, M.1 aWhite, S.N.1 aBennett, G.L.1 aKeele, J.W.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.3474-3481x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/26  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001200144245009400156300001600250520174800266650001302014650001102027650001402038650001702052650001902069650001402088650002002102650002202122650000702144650003102151650001302182653002002195700001702215700001402232700001802246773008502264852000902349930003302358945002502391946001102416655001202427IND4379040020221119080846.0060324e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437904002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCho, J.10aViscoelastic properties of chitosan solutions: Effect of concentration and ionic strength  ap. 500-515.  aThe dynamic rheological properties of chitosan solutions have been investigated in terms of ionic strength and chitosan concentration for entangled systems. The overlap concentration C* and the entanglement concentration C(e) have first been determined to identify the dilute, semi-dilute and concentrated entangled regimes. In dilute solutions, the effect of ionic strength (I) on the intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) has been interpreted in terms of the Debye electrostatic screening length. The intrinsic viscosity, the radius of gyration and the persistence length decreased with increasing ionic strength, due to the screening of the electrostatic charges on the chitosan chains by the salt resulting in increased chain flexibility. For concentrated solutions, dynamic measurements were performed and the relaxation spectra were calculated from the storage (G') and loss (G") moduli characterized in the linear viscoelastic region. For all chitosan concentrations and ionic strengths, the time-weighted stress relaxation spectra showed only one peak. However, the width of the spectra increased with increasing polymer concentration, indicating a larger distribution of relaxation modes due to more entanglements and interchain interactions. The mean relaxation time (tau(H)), related to reptation, and the zero-shear viscosity (eta0) were found to follow power-law expressions of the chitosan concentration, with tau(H) approximately C(3.1) and eta0 approximately C(4.1), respectively, with the high exponents indicating the associating character of the polymer. The non-Newtonian nature (elastic properties and shear-thinning behavior) of the chitosan solutions increased with increasing chitosan concentration and decreasing ionic strength. 3achitosan 3achitin 3asolutions 3aelectrolytes 3aionic strength 3aviscosity 3aviscoelasticity 3astress relaxation 3apH 3aelectrostatic interactions 3apolymers 0apolyelectrolyte1 aHeuzey, M.C.1 aBegin, A.1 aCarreau, P.J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 4 p.500-515x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02140naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275520093300291650001601224650001701240650002501257650001301282650002001295650000901315650001701324650001001341650001801351650001701369650001601386651001101402653002601413653001701439653001901456773012601475852000901601856007601610930003301686946001101719655001201730IND4390481020221119080928.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439048102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01155.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaastad, G.10aLate dormant rapeseed oil treatment against black cherry aphid and cherry fruit moth in sweet cherries  ap. 284-288.  aBlack cherry aphid [Myzus cerasi (Fabricius)] and cherry fruit moth [Argyresthia pruniella (Clerck)] are the main insect pests on sweet cherries in Norway. In this study, application of rapeseed oil alone and rapeseed oil mixed with pesticides were tested as a control method against overwintering eggs of both black cherry aphid and cherry fruit moth. Results showed that rapeseed oil applied at the late dormant stage significantly reduced damage by black cherry aphid. Efficiency of oil mixed with pesticides was higher, but only significant in three of seven trials. The efficiency of rapeseed oil against cherry fruit moth was low compared with what was achieved for black cherry aphid, but within the range that has been reported for other botanical pesticides. As for the black cherry aphid, adding pesticides to oil decreased damage by the cherry fruit moth. Timing of treatment and effect of temperature were discussed. 3aArgyresthia 3aMyzus cerasi 3abotanical pesticides 3acherries 3acontrol methods 3aeggs 3ainsect pests 3amoths 3aoverwintering 3arapeseed oil 3atemperature 3aNorway 0aArgyresthia pruniella 0alate dormant 0asweet cherries0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.284-288dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01155.x3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02351naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014100183300001800324520063100342650002300973650002900996650001201025650001701037650001001054650001201064650001001076650002701086650003501113650004401148650001701192650001801209650002501227650002801252650004201280650003001322650004801352650002001400653001201420653001801432653000901450653002001459700001401479700002201493700001901515700001901534773012201553852000901675856006901684930003301753946001101786655001201797IND4385510320221119081157.0061126e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438551032DNAL7 a168688602pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-006-9122-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabar, T.

  1 aSantos, O.10aWhey protein adsorption onto steel surfaces--effect of temperature, flow rate, residence time and aggregation  ap. 468-483.  a2019-12-05  aWhey protein adsorption on stainless steel surfaces was investigated by in situ ellipsometry under well-defined flow conditions and protein solution residence times. The size distribution in solution of the protein aggregates formed under the same conditions was determined by dynamic light scattering. The adsorption was performed at 72 degrees C and 85 degrees C, which is below and above the unfolding temperature of beta-lactoglobulin (75 degrees C). The effect of increasing the Reynolds number on the aggregation process was evident only for the longest protein solution residence time, when larger aggregates were produced. At the higher temperature, higher flow turbulence decreased the amount of protein adsorbed on the surface, which was attributed to shear-induced removal of protein from the surface. At both temperatures, longer protein solution residence times decreased both the adsorption kinetics and the amount of protein adsorbed. This could be related to the concentration of native protein available in solution. Based on the experimental results, a model of the formation of a protein monolayer and multilayers on solid surfaces was developed. The model takes into account the dependence of the adsorption process on both protein solution residence time and flow rate and predicts the evolution of adsorbed mass of protein per unit surface area with operating time. Surface-induced aggregation was identified as the main mechanism responsible for the formation of multilayers, based on experimental data. To reduce the amount of protein adsorbed/deposited on the surface an increase in protein solution residence time was found to be more effective than an increase in the Reynolds number. 3awhey protein 3aprotein aggregates 3afood processing equipment 3adiffusivity 3aflow 3aactivation energy 3adairy industry 3astainless steel 3amass transfer 3atemperature 3aparticle size distribution 3afood contact surfaces 3aadsorption 0aheat exchanger fouling 0afood processing1 aNylander, T.1 aPaulsson, M.1 aTragardh, C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 4 p.468-483x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02278naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001200161245006300173300001600236500001500252520119500267650001901462650002001481650001601501650001401517650001301531650002201544650001701566650001301583650001901596650001601615650002301631653002701654700001201681773008501693852000901778930003301787945002501820946001101845655001201856IND4379039020221119081046.0060324e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKim, C.10aRheological properties of rice starch-xanthan gum mixtures  ap. 120-128.  a2019-12-05  aRheological properties of rice starch-xanthan gum mixtures (5% w/w) at different xanthan gum concentrations (0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8% w/w) were evaluated in steady and dynamic shear. The rice starch-xanthan gum mixtures at 25 degrees C showed high shear-thinning flow behavior (n = 0.13-0.24), and consistency index (K) and apparent viscosities (eta(a,100)) increased with the increase in xanthan gum concentration. In the temperature range of 25-70 degrees C, mixtures followed the Arrhenius temperature relationship. Activation energy (1.83-9.89 kJ/mol) decreased and storage (G') and loss (G") moduli increased with the increase in xanthan gum concentration. The dynamic (eta*) and steady shear (eta(a)) viscosities at several xanthan gum concentrations followed the Cox-Merz superposition rule with the application of shift factor (alpha). Magnitudes of shift factor were in the range of 0.307-0.478. During aging at 4 degrees C for 10 h, the values of G' were found to increase rapidly the early stage and attained the plateau region after a few hours. The increase in rate constant (k) in gelation of rice starch-xanthan gum mixtures was a function of xanthan gum concentration. 3ashear strength 3astorage modulus 3arice starch 3aviscosity 3arheology 3aactivation energy 3ashear stress 3amixtures 3agelatinization 3axanthan gum 3athermal properties 0arheological properties1 aYoo, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 1 p.120-128x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03841naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002000180245013200200300001800332500001500350520198400365650002302349650002702372650001802399650001202417650001402429650001202443650002302455650000902478650001802487650001602505650004702521650001202568650002902580650001102609650003402620650003302654650003702687650001402724650003402738650002202772650002202794650002402816653002702840653002702867653001702894653002002911653002502931700001602956700001702972700001702989700001903006773008603025852000903111930003303120945002503153946001303178655001203191IND4366082820221119081225.0041215e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436608282DNAL7 a154849552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aScheaffer, A.N.10aEffect of dietary restriction, pregnancy, and fetal type on intestinal cellularity and vascularity in Columbia and Romanov ewes  ap. 3024-3033.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this study were to evaluate intestinal cellularity and vascularity in mature ewes in response to dietary restriction and pregnancy status and to quantify the response of these variables to increased nutrient demand of fetal growth. In Exp. 1, 28 mature Dorset x crossbred white-faced ewes (61.6 +/- 1.8 kg initial BW) were fed a pelleted, forage-based diet. Treatments were arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial, with dietary restriction (60% restriction vs. 100% maintenance for respective states of pregnancy) and pregnancy status (nonpregnant, NP; d 90 and 130) as main effects. Dietary treatments were initiated on d 50 of gestation and remained at 60 or 100% maintenance throughout the experiment. Nonpregnant ewes were fed dietary treatments for 40 d. In Exp. 2, four Romanov ewes were naturally serviced (Romanov fetus and Romanov dam; R/R); two Romanov embryos per recipient were transferred to four Columbia recipients (Romanov fetus and Columbia recipient; R/C), and three Columbia ewes were naturally serviced (Columbia fetus and Columbia dam; C/C). In Exp. 1, dietary restriction and pregnancy status interacted with regard to maternal jejunal DNA concentration (P < 0.01), with restricted ewes having a greater DNA concentration (mg/g; fresh basis) at d 130. Vascularity (percentage of total tissue area) in the jejunum was increased (P < 0.06) as a result of dietary restriction and pregnancy status. Total microvascular volume of jejunal tissue was not altered by dietary restriction and increased (P < 0.01) at d 130 of pregnancy. In Exp. 2, R/R ewes had less (P < 0.09) DNA (g) in the jejunum compared with R/C and C/C ewes. Jejunal vascularity (%) was increased (P < 0.05) in R/R ewes compared with R/C or C/C ewes, whereas total jejunal microvascular volume remained unchanged. These data demonstrate intestinal vascular density responds to changes in diet and physiological state. In addition, pregnancy increased total jejunal microvascular volume. 3arestricted feeding 3aColumbia (sheep breed) 3asheep feeding 3aRomanov 3apregnancy 3ajejunum 3amaternal nutrition 3aewes 3ablood vessels 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Volumexveterinary 2aFemale 2aFetal Developmentxphysiology 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aJejunumxblood supplyxcytology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aSheepxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0aintestinal vascularity 0aintestinal cellularity 0asheep breeds 0asmall intestine 0amicrovascular volume1 aCaton, J.S.1 aRedmer, D.A.1 aArnold, D.R.1 aReynolds, L.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Oct., v. 82, no. 10 p.3024-3033x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20100518b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle01722naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245009000161300001600251520074200267650001901009650001401028650001401042650001801056650001901074650002101093650002401114650002401138651002101162700001401183773008501197852000901282930003301291945002501324946001101349655001201360IND4379039220221119081123.0060324e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The selected factors were contact time, solid to liquid ratio, acid concentration and moisture of bentonite. A first-order model is obtained by using 2(4) full factorial design. Auxiliary experiments for the second-order model were conducted according to an orthogonal central composite design. An experimental test carried out using a factorial design 2(4) indicated that contact time, solid to liquid ratio and moisture of bentonite have a positive effect, whereas acid concentration has a negative effect. Furthermore, the highest bleaching capacity was found to be 74.2%. 3acottonseed oil 3ableaching 3abentonite 3aacidification 3aneutralization 3ableaching agents 3aexperimental design 3amathematical models 3aTurkey (country)1 aLacin, O.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 1 p.137-141x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle04198naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245011300179300001800292520244600310650000902756650001602765650001402781650001402795650001902809650001202828650001402840650001302854650001902867650002202886650002302908650002302931650006302954650001603017650004703033650001203080650002203092650002803114650001103142650002603153650001103179650001403190650003403204650002203238650004403260700001703304700001703321700001503338700001603353700001903369700001803388773008603406852000903492930003303501945002503534946001303559655001203572IND4366083620221119081136.0041215e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436608362DNAL7 a154849592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYoung, M.G.10aComparison of three methods of feeding sows in gestation and the subsequent effects on lactation performance  ap. 3058-3070.  aA total of 684 sows from breeding groups over 6 wk was used to compare three methods of feeding during gestation on gestation and lactation performance. Control gilts and sows were fed according to body condition based on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = thin, 5 = fat). Sows were visually assessed for body condition at breeding and were assigned a daily feed allowance to achieve a BCS of 3 at farrowing. Treatment 2 used feeding levels based on backfat thickness (measured between d 0 and 5 after breeding) and weight at weaning for sows or service for gilts. Feed allowance was calculated to achieve a target backfat of 19 mm at farrowing, and remained constant from d 0 to 101 of gestation. Feed allowances were based on modeled calculations of energy and nutrient requirements to achieve target sow maternal weight and backfat gains. Treatment 3 was identical to Treatment 2, except that feeding pattern was altered for thin sows and gilts (<15 mm at service) in an attempt to reach 19 mm by d 36 of gestation. Sows were weighed at the previous weaning, and gilts were weighed at service, with both weighed again between d 112 and 114 of gestation. Backfat was measured between d 0 and 5, and again between d 108 and 113 of gestation. At farrowing, sows on Treatments 2 and 3 had 19 and 19.1 mm of backfat, respectively, whereas control sows tended to have greater (P < 0.07) backfat (20 mm). On average, sows targeted to gain 6 to 9 mm of backfat failed to reach target gains regardless of feeding method. Feeding sows in gestation based on backfat (Treatments 2 and 3) resulted in a numerically higher proportion of sows in the target backfat range of 17 to 21 mm (40.2, 53.3, and 52.6% for control and Treatments 2 and 3, respectively) at farrowing and a numerically lower percentage of fat sows (>21 mm), but no difference in the percentage of thin sows (<17 mm) compared with feeding based on body condition. In conjunction with this observation, sows fed based on BCS were fed higher (P < 0.05) feeding levels in gestation than were sows fed based on backfat depth. Gestation feeding method had no effect on performance during lactation. Feed intake in lactation was lower (P < 0.05) for high backfat sows (>21 mm) at farrowing compared with sows with <21 mm. The high proportion of sows in the optimal backfat category demonstrates that feeding based on backfat and BW has potential for facilitating more precise feeding during gestation. 3asows 3asow feeding 3apregnancy 3alactation 3abody condition 3abackfat 3athickness 3abody fat 3aweaning weight 3afeed requirements 3amaternal nutrition 3aanimal performance 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitution 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexanatomy & histologyxphysiology.1 aTokach, M.D.1 aAherne, F.X.1 aMain, R.G.1 aDritz, S.S.1 aGoodband, R.D.1 aNelssen, J.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Oct., v. 82, no. 10 p.3058-3070x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20100518b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle01941naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245006300166300001600229500001500245520082000260650002401080650002201104650001401126650001901140650001501159650001801174650002301192650001601215650003101231650001901262653002501281700001501306700001801321700001701339773008501356852000901441930003301450945002501483946001101508655001201519IND4379039620221119081221.0060324e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of temperature were found to be significant and all the isotherms were found sigmoid in shape. Five widely used three parameters sorption isotherms equations such as modified Henderson, modified Chung-Pfost, modified Oswin, modified Halsey and GAB were used to fit the experimental data. The modified Chung-Pfost and modified Oswin equations have the ability to describe well the EMC/ERH relationship selected range of the relative humidity and temperature. The modified Chung-Pfost equation is the most suitable in M = f(rh, T) form while the modified Oswin equation is the most suitable in rh = f(M, T) form. 3amathematical models 3arelative humidity 3aequations 3athermodynamics 3amung beans 3awater content 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3aVigna radiata var. radiata 3awater activity 0achemical composition1 aHuda, M.D.1 aHossain, M.A.1 aHassan, M.S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 4 p.462-467x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02053naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245005300162300001600215500001500231520079400246650001301040650002401053650001901077650004401096650002501140650002501165650001701190650001901207650003001226650001801256650001301274650001801287650001901305653002201324700002101346700002001367700001601387700001701403773008501420852000901505930003301514945002501547946001101572655001201583IND4379039520221119081250.0060324e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Heat transfer measurements and modelling confirmed that droplet internal temperatures were almost uniform (low Biot number regime), which was consistent with the microstructures generated. Fundamental parameters which could be extracted from the data included nucleation temperature, degree of recalescence, freezing temperature, and extent of freezing and freeze concentration. The mode of nucleation (spontaneous or forced) was observed to depend on concentration, cooling rate and air temperature. 3afreezing 3athermal diffusivity 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ainternal temperature 3athermal conductivity 3aspray drying 3aice nucleation 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aspecific heat 3adroplets 3aheat transfer 3ainstant coffee 0acoffee (beverage)1 aMcKittrick, J.A.1 aHindmarsh, J.P.1 aJohns, M.L.1 aWilson, D.I.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 4 p.451-461x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03028naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245013000198300001800328520129900346650001601645650001001661650002801671650001801699650001801717650001901735650002301754650001101777650001501788650002701803650002101830650001701851650001201868650002101880650008101901650002001982650001502002650000902017650000902026650002702035650001402062650003802076650003402114700001702148700001602165700001502181700001802196700001702214700001702231773008602248852000902334930003302343945002502376946001302401655001202414IND4366280720221119081226.0041228e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436628072DNAL7 a155377592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMizoshita, K.10aQuantitative trait loci analysis for growth and carcass traits in a half-sib family of purebred Japanese Black (Wagyu) cattle  ap. 3415-3420.  aWe used a half-sib family of purebred Japanese Black (Wagyu) cattle to locate economically important quantitative trait loci. The family was composed of 348 fattened steers, 236 of which were genotyped for 342 microsatellite markers spanning 2,664 cM of 29 bovine autosomes. The genome scan revealed evidence of 15 significant QTL (<5% chromosome-wise level) affecting growth and carcass traits. Of the 15 QTL, six QTL were significant at the 5% experiment-wise level and were located in bovine chromosomes (BTA) 4, 5, and 14. We analyzed these three chromosomes in more detail in the 348 steers, with an average marker interval of 1.2 cM. The second scan revealed that the same haplotype of the BTA 4 region (52 to 67 cM) positively affected LM area and marbling. We confirmed the QTL for carcass yield estimate on BTA 5 in the region of 45 to 54 cM. Five growth-related QTL located on BTA 14, including slaughter and carcass weights, were positively affected by the same region of the haplotype of BTA 14 (29-51 cM). These data should provide a useful reference for further marker-assisted selection in the family and positional cloning research. The research indicates that progeny design with moderate genotyping efforts is a powerful method for detecting QTL in a purebred half-sib family. 3abeef cattle 3aWagyu 3aquantitative trait loci 3aanimal growth 3agrowth traits 3acarcass weight 3achromosome mapping 3asteers 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aslaughter weight 3abeef quality 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGenetic Markers 2aHaplotypes 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable1 aWatanabe, T.1 aHayashi, H.1 aKubota, C.1 aYamakuchi, H.1 aTodoroki, J.1 aSugimoto, Y.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.3415-3420x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/26  aOther US 7aarticle02201naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245008600158300001400244520107500258650001801333650001801351650001201369650001401381650001701395650001901412650001901431650001801450650001001468650001601478700001801494700001401512700001901526700001801545700002601563700001701589773008301606852000901689930003301698945002501731946001101756655001201767IND4379037320221119080814.0060324e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFuchs, M.10aEncapsulation of oil in powder using spray drying and fluidised bed agglomeration  ap. 27-35.  aMany food active molecules such as antioxidants and aromas, exist in an oil form which may be easily oxidised. They are often prepared as a dosed, free-flowing powder, for storage protection and controlled release purposes. Oil encapsulation in powder was tested using a vegetable oil (VO) chosen as a model (5% w of dry matter) with a support of maltodextrin (MD) and acacia gum (AG) (ratio 3/2 w/w). Spray drying of a formulated aqueous emulsion (VO/MD/AG) led to small particles (<50 micrometer). Further, their size was increased (150 micrometer) by agglomeration in an air fluidised bed with spraying of water. Direct agglomeration of maltodextrin with an aqueous emulsion (VO/AG) represents a good process alternative, leading to particles of 200 micrometer. The two agglomerated powders consist of 5% of oil well dispersed in the support (MD/AG), with less than 0.5% on the particles surface. The protection against oil oxidation is good in comparison with unencapsulated oil. Also the agglomerated powders have suitable properties of flowability and wettability. 3avegetable oil 3aencapsulation 3apowders 3aemulsions 3aspray drying 3afluidized beds 3adrying quality 3aparticle size 3ashape 3awettability1 aTurchiuli, C.1 aBohin, M.1 aCuvelier, M.E.1 aOrdonnaud, C.1 aPeyrat-Maillard, M.N.1 aDumoulin, E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 1 p.27-35x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02278naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011200170300001600282520103000298650001501328650002301343650002601366650001501392650002201407650002001429650001901449650002601468650001601494650003001510650001401540653000801554700001701562700001601579700001801595773012601613852000901739856007601748930003301824946001101857655001201868IND4390479620221119080901.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439047962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01145.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGariepy, T.D.10aParasitoids, predators and PCR: the use of diagnostic molecular markers in biological control of Arthropods  ap. 225-240.  aThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revolutionized the field of diagnostics, and today it has routine applications in medical, veterinary, forensic and botanical sciences. The fields of biological control and insect pest management have generally been slow to adopt PCR-based diagnostics in comparison with other fields of science. However, there has been increasing interest in the use of molecular diagnostic tools in arthropod biological control. In applied entomology, molecular techniques have generally been used for insect identification and systematics; however, PCR-based techniques are increasingly becoming recognized as valuable tools in ecological studies. Here, we review research that has used PCR-based techniques for parasitoid and predator/prey identification and detection, and place these studies in the context of their contributions to biological control of arthropods. The status and future directions of diagnostic molecular markers in applied entomology and insect pest management are also discussed. 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3adiagnostic techniques 3aentomology 3aforensic sciences 3agenetic markers 3ainsect control 3ainsect identification 3aparasitoids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apredators 0aPCR1 aKuhlmann, U.1 aGillott, C.1 aErlandson, M.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.225-240dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01145.x3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02739naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012900184300001600313520098500329650002701314650002601341650002401367650000901391650001901400650001301419650001401432650001801446650001701464650001201481650002101493650004401514650002901558650003001587650004401617650005001661650000901711650002301720650003801743650003701781650002601818653002301844653001601867700002101883700001901904700002101923773011901944852000902063856006902072930003302141946001102174655001202185IND4388748420221119080951.0070311e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438874842DNAL7 a172354892pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-006-9270-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Won Suck 10aAntitumor therapeutic effects of Salmonella typhimurium containing Flt3 Ligand expression plasmids in melanoma-bearing mouse  ap. 511-516.  aAn attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium has been tested in animals and clinically as an anticancer agent due to its in vivo tumor-targeting and tumoricidal properties. We exploited a genetically-engineered S. typhimurium harboring Flt3 Ligand (Flt3L) expression vectors as a tumoricidal agent to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Flt3L showed tumoricidal effects when expressed in tumor cells in vitro. When melanoma-bearing mice were treated locally with Salmonella, S. typhimurim with Flt3L expression vectors inhibited tumor growth more than Salmonella controls (50% vs. 0% in tumor regression rates). Moreover, it prolonged survivals of animals without induction of memory antitumor protective responses to a parental tumor re-challenge (50% vs. 0% in survival rates). These results suggest that a genetically engineered S. typhimurium with Flt3L expression vectors has the potential to be applicable as a safer and more effective tumor-targeting and tumoricidal agent. 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantineoplastic agents 3agenetic engineering 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3aremission 3asurvival rate 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDNA, Bacterialxadministration & dosage 2aGenetic Therapyxmethods 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aMelanomaxgeneticsxpathologyxtherapy. 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxtherapeutic use. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPlasmidsxadministration & dosage 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxgenetics 2aTransfectionxmethods 0aAntitumor activity 0aFlt3 Ligand1 aChoi, Won Cheol 1 aSin, Jeong-Im 1 aPark, Yong Keun 0 tBiotechnology letters.g2007 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.511-516dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-006-9270-93electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02013naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245009200176300001400268520068900282650001500971650002100986650001101007650001101018650002301029650001301052650002001065650001501085650001901100650001001119650002001129650002501149650001601174650001801190650001501208653001801223653002401241700001101265700001201276700001701288700001301305700001601318773008301334852000901417930003301426945002501459946001101484655001201495IND4379038120221119080439.0060324e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNagaya, K.10aLow-temperature desiccant-based food drying system with airflow and temperature control  ap. 71-77.  aA new low-temperature food drying system with controlled airflow and temperature is presented. Low-temperature drying allows foods such as vegetables to be dried without losing the original color and texture. Existing low-temperature systems are slow, and it is difficult to obtain uniform product quality. The system proposed in this paper consists of an airflow control system to improve drying speed, and temperature control to ensure minimal damage to the food during the drying process in comparison with sun drying. Through experimental evaluation of the system, it is demonstrated that dried vegetables produced by this method retain their fresh color and high vitamin content. 3avegetables 3adried vegetables 3adrying 3adryers 3adrying temperature 3aair flow 3aprocess control 3adesiccants 3adrying quality 3acolor 3avitamin content 3afood nutrient losses 3ahumidifiers 3aheat transfer 3aalgorithms 0adehumidifiers 0athermal transducers1 aLi, Y.1 aJin, Z.1 aFukumuro, M.1 aAndo, Y.1 aAkaishi, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 1 p.71-77x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010600184300001800290520042500308650002200733650002300755650001000778650001200788650001200800650004500812650003500857650002100892650005200913650004500965650002901010650002401039650002101063650003001084650003001114650003001144650003501174653002201209653001701231653003401248700001901282700001901301700001701320773012201337852000901459856006901468930003301537946001101570655001201581IND4384712320221119080508.0061025e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438471232DNAL7 a170015002pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-006-9146-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ming-Ming10aConstruction and characterization of a novel maltose inducible expression vector in Bacillus subtilis  ap. 1713-1718.  aA maltose-inducible expression vector in Bacillus subtilis has been developed and characterized.

Nevertheless, the conversion of isoleucine into 2-methylbutyraldehyde depended not only on the degree of permeabilization but also on the bacteriocin that caused the cell membrane damage. The highest values of 2-methylbutyraldehyde corresponded to cell suspensions containing lacticin 3147 and lactococcins, treatments that provoked further lysis in addition to induced permeabilization. 3aLactococcus lactis 3acell membranes 3acell suspension culture 3aisoleucine 3alactococcins 3anisin 2aAldehydesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacteriocinsxclassificationxpharmacology. 2aBacteriolysisxdrug effects 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aCell Membrane Permeabilityxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aLactococcus lactisxmetabolism 2aTaste 0aBacteriocin 0aCell permeabilization 0aCheese aroma 0aLacticin 31471 aRequena, Teresa 1 aPeláez, Carmen.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2006 Oct., v. 28, no. 19 p.1573-1580dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-006-9131-63electronic resource  a20061127b20061202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01275naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245002800117300001400145500001500159520049100174650001300665650001100678650001800689650002400707653002900731653001100760653002600771653002000797653002400817773007000841852000900911939003300920945000800953655001200961991585521190742620221119080331.0771001e197706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794427692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCreperie par excellence  ap. 44-45.  a2019-12-06  aThe efforts of a French chef brought crepes to the school menu in one Houston school.

The elution of multiple components was performed using a C₁₈ column with stepwise gradient elution. The detection of individual analytes was monitored by electrospray MS scanning from 300 to 1000 m/z in the positive ion mode, with the limits of detection of these components ranging from 0.06 to 1 μg/mL at a signal-to-noise ratio of >=5. The intra- and inter-day accuracies ranged from 95.1 to 104.4%, and the overall precision was less than 9.3%. The recoveries of the analytes were >=96.6%.

It is concluded that the settling velocity should be calculated by the Allen formula, because the settling process of the granules is in the category of intermediate flow regime rather than in the laminar flow one. The comparison between calculated and measured values of the settling velocity shows an excellent agreement, with an average relative error of 4.04%. A simple but reliable mathematical method to determine the settling velocity is therefore proposed. 3agranules 3aintermediate flow 3alaminar flow 3amodels 3asludge 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBioreactors 2aSewage 2aWater Purification 0aAaerobic granular sludge 0aIntermediate flow regime 0aMean settling velocity 0aUASB-like reactor1 aHe, Yan-ling 1 aYang, Shu-cheng 1 aLi, Yao-zhong 0 tBiotechnology letters.g2006 Oct., v. 28, no. 20 p.1673-1678dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-006-9136-13electronic resource  a20061119b20061202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01838naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245006300175300001600238520061300254650001800867650000900885650001700894650002000911650001300931650001600944650002200960650001600982650002800998650002601026650001701052650001701069650001701086650001301103700001501116700001301131700001901144700001401163700001701177773008401194852000901278930003301287945002501320946001101345655001201356IND4377400820221119080458.0060124e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437740082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRodriguez Couto, S.10aUtilisation of grape seeds for laccase production in solid-state fermentors  ap. 263-267.  aThe aim of the present paper was to investigate the feasibility of grape seeds as a support-substrate for laccase production by the white-rot fungus Trametes hirsuta under solid-state conditions, operating in laboratory-scale bioreactors. Two bioreactor configurations were considered in order to determine the most suitable one: immersion and tray. As regards bioreactor design, the tray configuration led to the highest laccase activities. In addition, the nature of the support employed (inert or non-inert) on laccase production was also evaluated. The results obtained clearly showed the superiority of grape seeds for laccase production over nylon sponge, since they produced much higher activities (around threefold). On the other hand, decolourization of structurally different dyes by the extracellular liquid obtained in the tray configuration operating with grape seeds as a support was assayed. The results showed that the individual dye structures influenced the decolourization extent. However, in all cases a decolourization kinetic of first order with respect to dye concentration was found. 3agrape seeds 3aenzyme substrates 3afood processing wastes 3awaste utilization 3asolid state fermentation 3afermenters 3astarter cultures 3aCoriolus hirsutus 3awhite-rot fungi 3aligninolytic microorganisms 3aanaerobic digesters 3abiodegradation 3abiosynthesis 3alaccase 3adyes 3achemical structure 3adecolorization1 aLopez, E.1 aSanroman, M.A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 May, v. 74, no. 2 p.263-267x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01891naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245006600159300001600225520089200241650000901133650001901142650001901161650001801180650002401198650003001222650002401252650002501276650001901301700001701320700001701337773008501354852000901439930003301448945002501481946001101506655001201517IND4379040920221119080559.0060324e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437904092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWillix, J.10aLocal surface heat transfer coefficients on a model beef side  ap. 561-567.  aMeasurements of heat transfer coefficients were performed at 11 different positions on the surface of a fibreglass model of a side of beef for a range of free stream velocities and turbulence intensities, using customised heat transfer sensors and commercial heat flux sensors. There was wide variation between the results at the different measurement positions; for low velocities or high turbulence intensities, the difference between the maximum and minimum value was as high as 140% of the mean. For free stream velocities below 1 m s(-1), the heat transfer coefficients measured at the tenderloin position were very low, which suggested that there was very poor air movement around the sensor due to its position in a semi-enclosure within the intestinal cavity. The heat transfer coefficients at most of the sensor positions followed the usual power law dependence on air velocity. 3abeef 3abeef carcasses 3aheat treatment 3aheat transfer 3athermal diffusivity 3aheat transfer coefficient 3asurface temperature 3athermal conductivity 3aturbulent flow1 aHarris, M.B.1 aCarson, J.K.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 4 p.561-567x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle01681naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245004400161300001600205520076200221650001800983650001901001650002001020650001301040650001201053650001901065650002301084650002201107650001401129653001301143773008501156852000901241930003301250945002501283946001101308655001201319IND4379328420221119080608.0060403e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437932842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Out of the four equilibrium sorption models that were evaluated, the Hasley equation gave the best fit to the sorption data. The Hasley equation was further used to estimate the thermodynamic functions (heat of vaporization, differential entropy, enthalpy-entropy compensation, net integral enthalpy and entropy) of sweetpotato. The heat of vaporization and the differential entropy decreased with moisture in an exponential fashion. The maximum net integral enthalpy and the minimum net integral entropy were respectively obtained to be 418.94 kJ/kg and -1.13 kJ/kg K. 3awater content 3asweet potatoes 3aIpomoea batatas 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3awater activity 3asorption isotherms 3arelative humidity 3aequations 0amonlayer0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 2 p.149-155x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060818b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02842naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011800187300001800305520079800323650001201121650001401133650001301147650001701160650001001177650001201187650001401199650001501213650001201228650004301240650000901283650001501292650002901307650001201336650003201348650004101380650001601421650002501437650002801462650001401490650002401504650002601528650004201554650003901596650000901635650002901644650003401673650004201707650004001749653000801789653003301797653001401830653000901844700002401853700002201877700002401899773012301923852000902046856006902055930003302124946001102157655001202168IND4385297320221119080634.0061119e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438529732DNAL7 a168585092pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-006-9110-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Jessna H.

However, this risks triggering apoptosis if cells are depleted of glutamine or glucose. To examine the apoptosis cascade during glutamine or glucose limitation, the transcriptional profile of FAS, FASL, FADD, FLIP, BAX, p53 and PEG3 in CRL 1606 hybridoma culture was investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. Activities of caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9 were also analyzed. Increase in the activities of the caspases was observed with up-regulation in the expression of FAS (6-8-fold) and PEG3 (2.5-fold), suggesting that the cells experienced apoptotic cell death via both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. 3aammonia 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell culture 3adeath 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3ahybridomas 3amammals 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3astarvation 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2afas Receptorxbiosynthesis. 2aApoptosisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBioreactors 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Line 2aGlucosexdeficiency 2aGlutaminexdeficiency 2aHybridomasxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aKruppel-Like Transcription Factors 2aMice 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aProtein Kinasesxbiosynthesis 2aReceptors, Death Domainxbiosynthesis 2aTranscription Factorsxbiosynthesis 0aFAS 0aGlucose/glutamine starvation 0aHybridoma 0aPEG31 aLo, Jennifer C.

Accurate sales forecasting is certainly an inexpensive way to meet the aforementioned goals, since this leads to improved customer service, reduced lost sales and product returns and more efficient production planning. Especially for the food industry, successful sales forecasting systems can be very beneficial, due to the short shelf-life of many food products and the importance of the product quality which is closely related to human health. In this paper we present a complete framework that can be used for developing nonlinear time series sales forecasting models. The method is a combination of two artificial intelligence technologies, namely the radial basis function (RBF) neural network architecture and a specially designed genetic algorithm (GA). The methodology is applied successfully to sales data of fresh milk provided by a major manufacturing company of dairy products. 3ashelf life 3aeconomic forecasting 3agenetics 3araw milk 3afood marketing 3aevolution 3asales 3aneural networks 3afreshness 3aalgorithms 0adairy products1 aAlexandridis, A.1 aPatrinos, P.1 aSarimveis, H.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 2 p.196-204x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060818b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144245007800167300001600245520118200261650001801443650001601461650001501477650001901492650002501511650002101536650002001557650001801577650001701595650001201612650001501624650002301639650001801662650001901680653001701699700001701716700002301733700001501756773008501771852000901856930003301865945002501898946001101923655001201934IND4379329020221119080627.0060403e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437932902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVeen, M.E. van der10aStarch hydrolysis under low water conditions: A conceptual process design  ap. 178-186.  aA process concept is presented for the hydrolysis of starch to glucose in highly concentrated systems. Depending on the moisture content, the process consists of two or three stages. The two-stage process comprises combined thermal and enzymatic liquefaction, followed by enzymatic saccharification. The three-stage process starts with shear induced melting of starch, followed by enzymatic liquefaction and saccharification. At a low moisture content, the shear stress needed to completely melt corn starch is so high that significant enzyme inactivation cannot be avoided, which leads to a need for separating starch melting and liquefaction in two separate processing steps. Assuming the use of currently available enzymes, the final product composition was estimated to contain 69-93% glucose, starting with respectively 65% and 35% dry starch. These results showed that the formation of side-products, mainly isomaltose and isomaltotriose, increased with increasing dry matter content. Increasing the dry matter content from 35% to 65% resulted in increasing reactor productivity of 17%, while the amount of water that should be removed from the system was reduced by 87%. 3awater content 3acorn starch 3ahydrolysis 3aheat treatment 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3asaccharification 3aliquified foods 3amelting point 3ashear stress 3aglucose 3aisomaltose 3adry matter content 3aalpha-amylase 3apolymerization 0aliquefaction1 aVeelaert, S.1 aGoot, A.J. van der1 aBoom, R.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 July, v. 75, no. 2 p.178-186x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20060818b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01893naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008700172300001600259500002400275520086200299650002601161650002001187650001201207650001401219650002201233650002101255650002101276650001901297650001901316700002601335700002201361773010301383852000901486856004801495655001201543IND4441605720221119080650.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444160572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0474-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasarovičová, Elena.10aPrinciples of classification of medicinal plants as hyperaccumulators or excluders  ap. 823-829.  aIncludes references  aStrategies of plants, known as metallophytes, in response to metal excess are explored. Specific features of medicinal plants related to metal exposition are discussed. Different parameters used for metallophyte classification are discussed. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors are characterized. Chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.), one of the most important medicinal plants, is presented as a case history. Based on actual knowledge of plant response to metal excess and published data related to chamomile, it has been concluded that this plant species is Cd hyper/accumulator. Thus, chamomile can manifest high potential for cleaning-up (phytoremediation) of the soils contaminated with cadmium. However, it should be stressed that cultivation of this medicinal plant under natural conditions for pharmaceutical use should be carefully supervised. 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achamomile 3ahyperaccumulators 3amedicinal plants 3aphytoremediation 3aplant response 3apolluted soils1 aKráľová, Katarína1 aKummerová, Marie0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2010 Sept., v. 32, no. 5 p.823-829dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0474-1 7aarticle02556naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245005200194300001200246500002400258520126500282650001501547650001901562650001101581650001001592650001201602650001101614650001601625650001701641650002301658650001101681650001401692650001701706650001201723650001301735650002501748650001101773650001801784650001801802650002401820650001201844700001401856700001601870773011201886852000901998856005502007655001202062IND4415337420221119080643.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441533742DNAL7 a183971922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČebulj-Kadunc, N.10aSerum Leptin Concentrations in Lipizzan Fillies  ap. 1-5.  aIncludes references  aTo determine seasonal changes in circulating leptin concentrations, as well as leptin fluctuations in various patterns of seasonal ovarian activity, blood samples were taken in 107 Lipizzan fillies aged 1-4 years over the whole year from January to December. Serum concentrations were measured in samples obtained once a month (leptin) or twice a month (progesterone), and evaluated with respect to the age of animals (yearlings, 2-, 3- and 4-year olds) and the pattern of ovarian activity (anoestrous, seasonal cycle, prolonged cyclicity, continuous cyclicity). The mean and monthly leptin concentrations in 3- and 4-year olds were significantly higher than in yearlings and 2-year olds (p < 0.001). Circulating leptin levels in 3- and 4-year olds increased significantly in summer, to peak in August and then decline significantly (p < 0.001) in autumn. The fluctuations in younger fillies were less evident. The highest mean serum leptin concentrations were observed in fillies exhibiting continuous cyclicity and the lowest in those, exhibiting seasonal cyclicity (p < 0.001). In anoestrous fillies, leptin concentrations were lower than in fillies with prolonged or continuous cyclicity but higher than in fillies with seasonal cyclic activity (p > 0.05). 3aanimal age 3aanimal ovaries 3aautumn 3ablood 3afillies 3aleptin 3aperiodicity 3aprogesterone 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3ayearlings 2aAgingxblood 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aEstrous Cyclexblood 2aFemale 2aHorsesxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aProgesteronexblood 2aSeasons1 aKosec, M.1 aCestnik, V.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2009 Feb., v. 44, no. 1 p.1-5dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00963.x 7aarticle03890naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245016400191300001400355500001500369520211400384650001202498650001202510650001602522650002402538650001602562650001602578650003102594650000902625650002802634650002902662650001102691650002402702650002102726650001402747650002102761651001802782651003302800653001602833653003102849653002602880653002402906700001702930700001902947700001602966700001802982700001603000700001503016700001403031773008103045852000903126856009403135930003303229945001303262946001303275655001203288IND2061239020221119080608.0980113e199712  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123902DNAL7 a101677622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00830.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabiner, D.J.10aMetropolitan versus nonmetropolitan differences in functional status and self-care practice: findings from a national sample of community-dwelling older adults  ap. 14-28.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to use a recent national probability survey of the noninstitutionalized older adult population to compare the functional status and self-care practices of older adults residing in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities and to identify differences associated with residential location. The survey used in this study was the National Survey of Self-care and Aging (NSSCA). A cross-sectional design was employed using weighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan residential location and self-reported ability to perform basic, mobility, and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs), as well as to assess the degree to which the levels and types of functional limitations affect metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan older adults' performance of self-care activities. The bivariate logistic analyses pointed to modest, often insignificant metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan differences in the ability to perform functional tasks. However, larger positive effects of nonmetropolitan residence were generally observed once other factors likely to account for some of these differences were taken into account. Older adults from nonmetropolitan areas were more likely to report being able to perform functional activities but also were more likely to report performing self-care activities both in the presence and absence of disability. This study, therefore, concluded that nonmetropolitan older adults may discount the significance of declining functional status, thus normalizing the trajectory of aging in a different way than do their metropolitan counterparts. If this process occurs, it may affect how nonmetropolitan persons use primary health care and/or long-term care services, challenging the economists' concept of demand, the clinicians' concept of need, and the policy analysts' concept of equity. Additional work is required to assess whether such a normalization process actually occurs and, if so, to explore its distribution, causes, correlates, and consequences. 3aelderly 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3alife skills 2aActivities of Daily Living 2aAged 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aHealth Status Indicators 2aHumans 2aRegression Analysis 2aRural Population 2aSelf Care 2aUrban Population 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0acomparisons 0aactivities of daily living 0amultivariate analysis 0aprimary health care1 aKonrad, T.R.1 aDeFriese, G.H.1 aKincade, J.1 aBernard, S.L.1 aWoomert, A.1 aArcury, T.1 aOry, M.G.0 tJournal of rural health.g1997 Winter, v. 13, no. 1 p.14-28x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00830.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002600173245009900199300001600298500001500314520083800329650003001167650001601197650001401213650002401227650001401251650001601265650001501281650002001296650002801316650002001344650001101364650001401375650004201389650001101431650003001442650003901472650004901511650001901560650003301579651001301612651001301625653001901638653001301657653002401670653002101694653001101715700001501726700001501741700001701756773008101773852000901854856009401863930003301957945001301990946001302003655001202016IND2059919520221119080619.0970926s1996    mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205991952DNAL7 a101661352pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00806.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsbottom-Lucier, M.10aHills, ridges, mountains, and roads: geographical factors and access to care in rural Kentucky  ap. 386-394.  a2019-12-04  aAccess to health care remains an important issue facing many individuals.

Using a telephone survey of Kentucky residents, this study investigated the relationship between the road quality and county elevation and access to health care for individuals in rural and urban areas of the state. Controlling the comparison for known individual characteristics, community characteristics, and medical infrastructure characteristics, this study uncovered that worse road conditions, measured by a road "rideability" index, were associated With longer times to reach medical care. It also found an association between higher county elevations and shorter times to reach medical care. 3ageographical distribution 3arural roads 3amountains 3aregression analysis 3ahighlands 3arural areas 3ademography 3ahealth services 2aCatchment Area, Health. 2aData Collection 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aHealth Services Accessibilityxtrends 2aHumans 2aMammographyxutilization. 2aPhysical Examinationxutilization. 2aRural Health Servicesxsupply & distribution 2aTransportation 2aVaginal Smearsxutilization. 3aKentucky 0aKentucky 0ainfrastructure 0amatrices 0amountainous terrain 0aregional surveys 0aaccess1 aEmmett, K.1 aRich, E.C.1 aWilson, J.F.0 tJournal of rural health.g1996 Fall, v. 12, no. 5 p.386-394x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00806.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02151naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245015800131300001600289520115600305650001201461650001701473650001201490650001501502650002201517653001401539653001901553700001401572700001901586700001601605700001501621773009901636852000901735930003301744945001301777946001101790655001201801IND2048118320221119080405.0951005e199410  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204811832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlankenstein, G.10aMultichannel flow-injection-analysis biosensor system for on-line monitoring of glucose, lactate, glutamine, glutamate and ammonia in animal cell culture  ap. 291-307.  aThe application of a chemiluminometric method for the on-line monitoring of a hybridoma cell culture is described. Enzyme sensors for glucose, lactate, glutamine, glutamate and ammonia, based on oxidase-catalysed reactions, were developed and connected to a flow-injection-analysis (f.i.a.) biosensor. H2O2 produced by the oxidase-catalysed enzyme reaction was detected by luminol chemiluminescence with a fibre-optic H2O2 biosensor. The system has been used to monitor animal cell cultures. A continuous hybridoma cell cultivation for the production of monoclonal antibodies is presented as an example. It was possible to monitor the bioprocess over a period of 15 days. A complete analysis of all five components could be performed within 42 min. The enzyme sensors were stable during the whole cultivation time without significant loss of activity. The computer-controlled biosensor f.i.a. works with good reliability. The precision for all five components ranged between 2.2 and 4.5%. It was possible to determine glutamine in one step using an anti-interference enzyme reactor. Endogenous glutamate was completely removed up to a level of 0.5 mM. 3aanimals 3acell culture 3aenzymes 3abiosensors 3achemiluminescence 0astability 0aimmobilization1 aSpohn, U.1 aPreuschoff, F.1 aThommes, J.1 aKula, M.R.0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g1994 Oct., v. 20, no. pt.2 p.291-307x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245008100189300001400270520142700284650003301711650004401744650001301788650001601801650002101817650002301838650002301861650000901884650000901893650002201902650003301924650004101957650001101998650003202009651001802041653001402059700002202073773013302095852000902228856008502237930003302322946001102355655001202366IND4394435620221119080449.0070826e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439443562DNAL7 a175728852pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1392-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelmonte, Pierluigi 10aEvaluation of gas chromatographic methods for the determination of trans fat  ap. 77-85.  aConsumption of trans fat has been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. For nutrition labeling purposes, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines trans fat as the sum of all the fatty acids with at least one nonconjugated double bond in the trans configuration. The FDA regulation states that label declarations of trans fat are not required for products that contain less than 0.5 g of trans fat per serving if no claims are made about fat, fatty acids or cholesterol. While attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) provides reproducible measurements for samples containing more than 5% trans fat, methods based on gas chromatography (GC) are needed to measure lower trans fat levels. Trans fat quantitation by GC has recently been updated by considering more fatty acids, focusing more attention on fatty acids present in low amounts, and by using 100-m high-polarity capillary columns for optimal separation. The consistently high interlaboratory relative standard deviations (RSD, e.g., 21% at 1% trans fatty acids (TFA), 60% at 0.17% TFA), and intralaboratory RSD values (e.g., 10% at 1% TFA, 16% at 0.17% TFA) for trans fat at 1% or less of total fat reported in the collaborative study data for American Oil Chemists Society Official Method Ce 1h-05 suggest the need to carefully define the parameters associated with GC analysis of fatty acids. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemists 3acholesterol 3acoronary disease 3agas chromatography 3anutrition labeling 3aoils 3arisk 3atrans fatty acids 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aHumans 2aTrans Fatty Acidsxanalysis 3aUnited States 0aTrans fat1 aRader, Jeanne I. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Sept., v. 389, no. 1 p.77-85dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1392-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070826b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01971naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520095100261650001501212650002801227650001501255650002301270650001401293650001901307650001801326650002401344653001901368700002101387700002001408700001601428773009901444852000901543930003301552945001301585946001101598655001201609IND2197751520221119080515.0990324e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219775152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGemeiner, P.10aAmplification of flow-microcalorimetry signal by means of multiple bioaffinity layering of lectin and glycoenzyme  ap. 155-161.  aThis paper demonstrates a positive influence of a special stepwise technique of enzyme immobilization based on the biospecific adsorption of the glycoenzyme invertase on immobilized concanavalin A (Con A) subsequent adsorption of the free Con A on the immobilized invertase:Con A support and repeated adsorption of invertase on the support.

It also identifies the specific areas of satisfaction associated with longer retention within a given rural practice, as well as the characteristics of individuals, practices, jobs, and communities associated with the areas of satisfaction that predict retention. Study subjects comprised a sample of 1,600 primary care physicians who moved to nonmetropolitan counties nationwide during the years 1987 through 1990, with oversampling of those who moved to federally designated health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Physicians serving in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) were excluded. Sixty-nine percent of the eligible subjects returned completed mail questionnaires in 1991. Analyses for this study were limited to the 620 primary care physicians who worked more than 20 hours per week in towns of fewer than 35,000 population; who were neither in the military nor the NHSC; and who were not in urgent care, emergency room, or full-time teaching positions. Analyses revealed that the areas of rural physicians' greatest satisfaction were their relationships with patients, clinical autonomy, the care they provided to medically needy patients, and life in small communities. Physicians were least satisfied with their access to urban amenities and the amount of time they spent away from their practices. Retention was independently associated only with physicians' satisfaction with their communities and their opportunities to achieve professional goals. Retention was also marginally related to physicians' satisfaction with their earnings. Among the areas of satisfaction not related to retention were satisfaction with autonomy, access to medical information and consultants, and the quality of doctor-patient relationships. In a subsequent series of analyses of the factors that predict the three areas of satisfaction that were associated with retention (satisfaction with the community, professional goal attainment, and earnings), a variety of physician, work, and community factors were identified. These findings reveal that specific features of rural physicians, their work and their communities predict each of the various aspects of satisfaction and that only certain aspects of satisfaction predict rural physicians' retention. There are no magic bullets to make rural physicians satisfied in all ways. Nevertheless, there are identified approaches to elevate the specific aspects of rural physicians' satisfaction important to their retention. Programs to improve the satisfaction of rural physicians should focus on those areas of satisfaction that predict longer retention and other important outcomes. 3aphysicians 3arural communities 3arural areas 3astatistical analysis 2aData Collection 2aHumans 2aJob Satisfaction 2aMedically Underserved Area 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPractice Patterns, Physicians'. 2aPhysician-Patient Relations 2aPhysicians, Familyxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aProfessional Autonomy 2aProfessional Practice Location 2aRural Health Servicesxmanpower. 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aprimary health care 0amedical services 0aattitudes to work 0awork satisfaction1 aWilliams, E.S.1 aKonrad, T.R.0 tJournal of rural health.g1996 Fall, v. 12, no. 5 p.366-377x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00804.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle04089naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245014300181300001800324500001500342520247000357650001602827650001902843650001002862650000902872650001502881650001502896650002002911650002002931650001202951650003202963650001602995650001203011650003503023650000903058650002403067650003703091650001903128650005803147650002103205650005203226653002003278653001003298700001503308700001503323700001903338773008603357852000903443930003303452945002503485946001303510655001203523IND4365492420221119080520.0041110e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436549242DNAL7 a155424652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRincker, M.J.10aEffects of dietary iron supplementation on growth performance, hematological status, and whole-body mineral concentrations of nursery pigs  ap. 3189-3197.  a2019-12-05  aAn experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementing increasing concentrations of Fe to the diet of nursery pigs on growth performance and indices of hematological and mineral status. Pigs (n = 225; 6.5 kg; 19 +/- 3 d) were allotted randomly by BW, litter, and gender to one of five dietary treatments (five pigs per pen; nine pens per treatment). Basal diets for each phase (Phase 1: d 0 to 7; Phase 2: d 7 to 21; Phase 3: d 21 to 35) were formulated to contain minimal Fe concentration and then supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg Fe/kg of diet (as-fed basis) from ferrous sulfate. Three pigs per pen (n = 135) were chosen and bled throughout (d 0, 7, 21, and 35) to determine hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), transferrin (Tf), and plasma Fe (PFe). In addition, pigs (n = 5; 5.9 kg; 19 +/- 3 d) from the contemporary group were killed at d 0 to establish baseline (BL), and 30 pigs (six pigs/treatment) were killed at d 35 to determine whole-body and liver mineral concentrations. The improvements in growth performance during Phase 2 (ADG = linear, P = 0.04; ADFI = linear, P = 0.10; G:F = quadratic, P = 0.07) were of sufficient magnitude that dietary treatments tended to increase ADG (linear, P = 0.08), ADFI (quadratic, P = 0.09), and G:F (quadratic, P = 0.10) for the 35-d experiment. Hematological variables were not affected until d 21, at which time dietary Fe supplementation resulted in a linear increase (P = 0.03) in Hb, Hct, and PFe. This linear increase (P = 0.001) was maintained until d 35 of the experiment; however, dietary treatments resulted in a linear decrease (P = 0.01) in Tf on d 35. Whole-body Fe concentration increased (linear, P = 0.01) in pigs due to increasing dietary Fe concentrations. Moreover, pigs fed for 35 d had greater (P = 0.02) whole-body Fe, Zn, Mg, Mn, Ca, and P concentrations and lower (P = 0.001) whole-body Cu concentration than BL. Hepatic Fe concentration increased (linear, P = 0.001) in pigs due to dietary treatments; however, the hepatic Fe concentration of all pigs killed on d 35 was lower (P = 0.001) than the BL. Results suggest that Fe contributed by feed ingredients was not sufficient to maintain indices of Fe status. The decrease in Fe stores of the pigs was not severe enough to reduce growth performance. Even so, the lessening of a pig's Fe stores during this rapid growth period may result in the occurrence of anemia during the subsequent grower and finisher periods. 3atransferrin 3apiglet feeding 3aliver 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3ahematocrit 3aliveweight gain 3amineral content 3apiglets 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIronxanalysis 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLiverxchemistry 2aSwinexbloodxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0ablood chemistry 0aswine1 aHill, G.M.1 aLink, J.E.1 aRowntree, J.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.3189-3197x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20050718b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle04261naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245015600165300001800321500001500339520247200354650003302826650001802859650001002877650002202887650002102909650002002930650001202950650001202962650001002974650003402984650001303018650001103031650001203042650002103054650002103075650001403096650003003110650003103140650004403171650004603215650004203261650004503303650005103348653001903399653001103418653001403429700001803443700001703461700001503478773008603493852000903579930003303588945002503621946001303646655001203659IND4365492220221119080430.0041110e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436549222DNAL7 a155424642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We studied by real-time reverse-transcription PCR, whether there are differences in the abundance of mRNA coding for IGF-I, IGF-2, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGF-1R, IGF-2R, GHR, and InsR in compartmentalized layers (fractions) of jejunum and ileum of 5-d-old calves fed colostrum. Samples of jejunum consisted primarily of villi and crypts; samples from ileum consisted mainly of villus tips, crypts, and lamina propria (LP; containing mainly Peyer's patches). After slaughter, segments of middle areas of jejunum and ileum were flushed with 154 mM NaCl. Pieces (5 mm x 5 mm) of jejunal (n = 9) and ileal walls (n = 5) were placed on glass slides and snap-frozen in liquid N before being cut horizontally into 10-micrometer-deep slices using a cryotome at-20 degrees C. Fifteen consecutive and morphologically similar slices were collected as fractions of villus, crypt, and LP layers, respectively. Fractions were characterized by use of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) that labeled proliferating cells, and by expression of lactase mRNA. The BrdU-labeled cells were present in crypts and LP, but not in tips of villi. Lactase mRNA levels were greater in villus than crypt fractions, but lactase mRNA was absent in LP. In jejunum, mRNA levels, relative to levels of housekeeping genes (sum of levels of mRNA coding for ubiquitin, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, and ribosomal RNA), differed (P < 0.05) between fractions for InsR (crypts > villi), IGFBP-2 (crypts > villi), and IGFBP-3 (crypts > villi), and total RNA levels were greater (P < 0.05) in crypt than villus fractions. In ileum, mRNA levels, expressed relative to housekeeping genes, differed (P < 0.05) between fractions for IGF-I (LP > villi, crypts), IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 (villi > crypts, LP), GHR and InsR (crypts > LP), IGFBP-2 (crypts > villi, LP), and total RNA levels were greater (P < 0.05) in LP and crypt than in villus fractions. In conclusion, the tested fractionation technique is quite applicable for gene expression studies in the intestine of calves. Members of the somatotropic axis and of the insulin receptor are not equally expressed in different jejunal and ileal layers of neonatal calves. 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amessenger RNA 3aileum 3ahormone receptors 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3ajejunum 3ainsulin 3avilli 3ainsulin-like growth factor II 3aneonates 3acalves 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCattlexgenetics 2aColostrum 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aIleumxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aJejunumxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptor, Insulinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Somatotropinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0alamina propria 0acrypts 0areceptors1 aPhilipona, C.1 aHammon, H.M.1 aBlum, J.W.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.3181-3188x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20050718b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle02251naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010500167300001600272520076100288650000801049650002201057650002301079650001001102650002201112650001401134650002501148650004301173650001501216651001001231651001201241651001301253651001101266651001001277651001101287651001101298651001801309653002901327653001901356653001801375700002001393700001201413700001901425700001601444773012801460852000901588856009201597930003301689946001101722655001201733IND4394770820221119080445.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01216.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xian10aMolecular identification of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Dipt., Agromyzidae) based on real-time PCR  ap. 548-552.  aRapidly identifying juvenile individuals of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) from Liriomyza sativae Blanchard is crucial in plant quarantine. We report a molecular method to identify L. trifolii based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By comparing partial DNA sequences of mitochondrial COI genes of L. trifolii samples collected from Guangdong and Taiwan provinces in China, Japan, Philippine, Israel, Germany, the USA, Mexico and Honduras sequenced by authors, and those of related species recorded in GenBank, a L. trifolii-specific probe was developed. There was no difference in individuals of different stages tested by this probe. The total time for real-time PCR assay system was 2 h, and it would save 3-7 h compared with conventional PCR. 3aDNA 3aLiriomyza sativae 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3ajuveniles 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3aChina 3aGermany 3aHonduras 3aIsrael 3aJapan 3aMexico 3aTaiwan 3aUnited States 0amolecular identification 0amtDNA COI gene 0areal-time PCR1 aNai-Zhong, Chen1 aJun, Ma1 aShui-fang, Zhu1 aXue-nan, Hu0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 Sept., v. 131, no. 8 p.548-552dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01216.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010100168300001600269520148700285650003101772650001501803650001101818650001901829650001301848650001301861650001201874650001101886650001801897650001601915650002501931650001601956650002101972650001101993650000902004651001302013653001502026700001902041700001802060773013002078852000902208856009202217930003302309946001102342655001202353IND4398239120221119080354.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439823912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01228.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaves, P.M.10aWinter dormancy of the pine sawyer Monochamus galloprovincialis (Col., Cerambycidae) in Portugal  ap. 669-673.  aThe pine sawyer Monochamus galloprovincialis is the vector of the introduced pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in Portugal and has a fixed univoltine life cycle, overwintering as larvae inside the wood. We investigated the possibility of the existence of a phase of winter dormancy affecting the larvae, its induction and termination under controlled conditions and its incidence and termination in the field. In the laboratory, the majority of the newly hatched larvae which were maintained at a constant temperature of 23°C and different photoperiods became dormant in <70 days. Part of the population completed dormancy and reassumed development until adult emergence at the constant temperature, without the need for a chilling period. Although no critical photoperiod for dormancy maintenance or termination could be determined, dormancy termination was more frequent for larvae experiencing changes on daylength duration. In the field, dormancy incidence grew progressively from a minimum of 26% in October to a maximum of 100% in April, and dormancy appeared to be completed only during late winter. The results suggest that M. galloprovincialis larvae underwent an obligatory dormancy associated with the last larval instar, which conforms to the general definition of diapause, although presenting some affinities with oligopause. The role of this dormancy on the regulation of the pine sawyer's seasonal development and the number of generations is discussed. 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aMonochamus 3aadults 3acold treatment 3adiapause 3adormancy 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aoverwintering 3aphotoperiod 3aseasonal development 3atemperature 3aunivoltine habit 3awinter 3awood 3aPortugal 0aoligopause1 ade Sousa, E.M.1 aQuartau, J.A.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 Dec., v. 131, no. 9-10 p.669-673dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01228.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009500169300001600264520089800280650002701178650002301205650001101228650001601239650002101255650001501276650001101291650001801302650001601320650001301336650001301349653003801362700001701400773012801417852000901545856009201554930003301646946001101679655001201690IND4394770120221119080340.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFacknath, S.10aIs host selection in leafminer adults influenced by pre-imaginal or early adult experience  ap. 505-512.  aOlfactometer and feeding/oviposition preference tests were carried out to study if host plant preference in two agromyzid leafminers, Liriomyza trifolii and Liriomyza huidobrensis, is influenced by pre-imaginal or imaginal experience, and at what level (host plant species, host plant variety or host age). It was found that the choice of host plant species (potato or tomato) and host plant variety had a pre-imaginal component, which could be reinforced (or modified) by an imaginal component. On the other hand, preference for potato leaves of different ages did not appear to be based on either pre-imaginal or imaginal factors, but resulted from differential performance and oviposition preference. The Hopkins' host selection principle appears to operate in these leafminers at the level of host species, and to some extent at the level of host variety, but not with respect to host age. 3aLiriomyza huidobrensis 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3aadults 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3aleafminers 3aleaves 3aolfactometers 3aoviposition 3apotatoes 3atomatoes 0aHopkins' host selection principle1 aWright, D.J.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 Sept., v. 131, no. 8 p.505-512dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01195.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03342naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245008200191300001600273500001500289520135200304650001601656650001601672650001601688650002601704650001801730650002001748650001501768650002401783650004801807650003401855650002801889650004201917650001101959650003401970650003702004650001102041650000902052650003202061650002402093650004002117650005002157651001302207651002802220653002402248653001902272653002402291653002102315653001502336700001502351700001802366700001402384700001802398700001902416773008302435852000902518856009402527930003302621945001302654946001302667655001202680IND2057767920221119080401.0970617e199606  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205776792DNAL7 a101628482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00790.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRickert, V.I.14aThe effects of mental health factors on ambulatory care visits by rural teens  ap. 160-168.  a2019-12-04  aThis study sought to determine the effects of mental health variables on rural adolescents' use of ambulatory health care services and whether these effects varied across common outpatient settings. Using a cross-sectional survey design, 2,297 adolescents who attended public schools in grades 7 through 12 in one isolated rural Mississippi River Delta county were assessed via a standardized health behavior survey. This self-report measure inquired about relevant health behaviors such as alcohol use, depressive symptoms, and health service use. The students' mean age was 15 years and 58 percent of the sample were black. Approximately 11 percent of the sample reported symptoms of depression, 16.5 percent reported problem drinking, and slightly fewer than 6 percent reported both. After controlling for predisposing, enabling, and need factors, the reporting of depressive symptoms, problem drinking, or both was related to an increased number of outpatient visits in three of four sites examined. However, differences among sites were observed. These data suggest that mental health problems are associated with increased visits to ambulatory settings, and these problems affect service use differentially. Thus, effective interventions and better linkages between ambulatory settings and mental health providers may reduce unnecessary use. 3arural youth 3arural areas 3aadolescents 3amultivariate analysis 3amental health 3ahealth services 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAlcohol Drinkingxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aAmbulatory Carexutilization. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDepressionxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHealth Services Accessibility 2aHealth Services Needs and Demand 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegression Analysis 2aRural Health Servicesxutilization. 2aRural Populationxstatistics & numerical data 3aArkansas 0aArkansasxepidemiology. 0aoutpatient services 0aalcohol intake 0aunivariate analysis 0aregional surveys 0adepression1 aPope, S.K.1 aTilford, J.M.1 aWayne, J.1 aScholle, S.H.1 aKelleher, K.J.0 tJournal of rural health.g1996 Summer, v. 12, no. 3 p.160-168x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00790.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03315naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001500182245004200197300001400239500009300253500002400346500001500370520146300385650002201848650002201870650002301892650002301915650001901938650002401957650002501981650001402006650001702020650000902037650002202046650002802068650004302096650002202139650004102161650002402202650001102226650001702237650002402254650004302278650006702321653001302388653002302401773013802424852000902562856008502571930003302656945002502689946001102714655001202725IND4405365120221119080320.0080508e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440536512DNAL7 a182341342pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651080060462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aClarke, R.10aB-vitamins and prevention of dementia  ap. 75-81.  aPaper presented at a conference held on 16-19 July 2007, at Coleraine, Northern Ireland.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aElevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations have been implicated with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, but it is unclear whether low vitamin B12 or folate status is responsible for cognitive decline. Most studies reporting associations between cognitive function and Hcy or B-vitamins have used a cross-sectional or case-control design and have been unable to exclude the possibility that such associations are a result of the disease rather than being causal. The Hcy hypothesis of dementia has attracted considerable interest, as Hcy can be easily lowered by folic acid and vitamin B12, raising the prospect that B-vitamin supplementation could lower the risk of dementia. While some trials assessing effects on cognitive function have used folic acid alone, vitamin B12 alone or a combination, few trials have included a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable evidence. An individual-patient-data meta-analysis of all randomised trials of the effects on cognitive function and vascular risk of lowering Hcy with B-vitamins will maximise the power to assess the epidemiologically-predicted differences in risk. Among the twelve large randomised Hcy-lowering trials for prevention of vascular disease, data should be available on about 30 000 participants with cognitive function. The principal investigators of such trials have agreed to combine individual-participant data from their trials after their separate publication. 3aAlzheimer disease 3avitamin B complex 3anutritional status 3adisease prevention 3acohort studies 3avitamin supplements 3avitamin deficiencies 3acognition 3ahomocysteine 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aDementiaxbloodxprevention & control. 2aFolic Acidxblood 2aFolic Acid Deficiencyxcomplications 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin B 12xblood 2aVitamin B 12 Deficiencyxcomplications 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosagexbloodxphysiology. 0adementia 0aliterature reviews0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2008 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.75-81dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651080060463Available from publisher's Web site  a20080720b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02725naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245005400166300001800220520137900238650002701617650000801644650001801652650002301670650001301693650001801706650001301724650001501737650001801752650002201770650001601792650001601808650001301824653002101837700002301858700001701881700002201898700002501920700001601945700001801961773013801979852000902117856008502126930003302211946001102244655001202255IND4398552720221119080321.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439855272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1616-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Gelder, Joke 10aRaman spectroscopic study of bacterial endospores  ap. 2143-2151.  aEndospores and endospore-forming bacteria were studied by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were recorded from Bacillus licheniformis LMG 7634 at different steps during growth and spore formation, and from spore suspensions obtained from diverse Bacillus and Paenibacillus strains cultured in different conditions (growth media, temperature, peroxide treatment). Raman bands of calcium dipicolinate and amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine are more intense in the spectra of sporulating bacteria compared with those of bacteria from earlier phases of growth. Raman spectroscopy can thus be used to detect sporulation of cells by a characteristic band at 1,018 cm-¹ from calcium dipicolinate. The increase in amino acids could possibly be explained by the formation of small acid-soluble proteins that saturate the endospore DNA. Large variations in Raman spectra of endospore suspensions of different strains or different culturing conditions were observed. Next to calcium dipicolinate, tyrosine and phenylalanine, band differences at 527 and 638 cm-¹ were observed in the spectra of some of the B. sporothermodurans spore suspensions. These bands were assigned to the incorporation of cysteine residues in spore coat proteins. In conclusion, Raman spectroscopy is a fast technique to provide useful information about several spore components.

In Exp. 1, ewes were fed a 52% concentrate:48% hay-based diet (as-fed basis) consisting of alfalfa hay (n = 4), endophyte-free fescue hay (n = 4), or fescue hay with 3.7% fatty acids (n = 4) from d 4 to 56 of lactation. In Exp. 2, ewes were fed similar diets that had endophyte-free fescue hay (n = 6), fescue hay with 3.7% fatty acids (n = 5), or fescue hay with 3.1% tallow (n = 6) from d 14 before lambing until d 57 of lactation. Diet formulations with supplemental fat were more nutrient dense, and treatments were fed to meet ewe nutrient requirements; this caused diets with added fat to be offered at 10 and 17% lower rates than unsupplemented diets in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Lambs were maintained to consume only ewe milk. Ewe milk production and composition were determined using a portable milking machine following a 3-h separation from lambs. In Exp. 1, milk fat content was increased (P < 0.01) when ewes consumed fescue hay with fatty acids vs. the fescue hay diet (11.4 vs. 8.3%). Ewes fed fescue hay with fatty acids lost the most (P < 0.05) weight over lactation (-8.6 kg) compared with ewes fed the alfalfa hay (-2.4 kg) and fescue hay (-3.8 kg) diets. Other milk measures, lamb gain, and production efficiencies were not changed. In Exp. 2, ewes supplemented with fatty acids produced more (P < 0.05) milk fat than those fed tallow (290 vs. 210 g/d). The proportion of synthesized milk fat 14:0 was decreased (P < 0.01), but the percentage of incorporated 16:0 increased (P < 0.05) when fatty acids were fed. Dietary fat digestibility by ewes was increased (P < 0.01) by fatty acid supplementation but decreased (P < 0.01) when tallow was added. Although ewe weight measures were not changed in Exp. 2, twin lamb gain per ewe organic matter intake was most efficient (P < 0.05) when ewes were supplemented with fatty acids. Results suggest that feeding hydrogenated tallow decreased nutrient availability for ewe milk fat production. A complete diet based on endophyte-free fescue hay can replace a traditional alfalfa hay diet, whereas supplementing with the calcium salts of palm oil fatty acids may be more feasible when energy is limiting during ewe lactation. 3aewes 3alactation 3alambs 3atwins 3asheep feeding 3aalfalfa 3acalcium 3asalts 3apalm oils 3atallow 3ahydrogenated oils 3aanimal growth 3amilk production 3aewe milk 3amilk composition 3afeed supplements 3aPolypay 3afeed composition 3aFestuca 3afeed intake 3anutrient density 3aenergy requirements 3aruminant nutrition 3adigestibility1 aEly, D.G.1 aAaron, D.K.1 aDeweese, W.P.1 aFink, E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Sept., v. 82, no. 9 p.2780-2789x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20050722b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/29  aOther US 7aarticle02100naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245014200156300001400298500002400312520101800336650001301354650001001367650001001377650001401387650001201401651002101413651001601434651001701450651002001467700003001487700001901517700002401536700002201560773009701582852000901679856003801688655001201726IND4432900520221119080448.0100220s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443290052DNAL7 a10.1071/SB090332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroom, Judy E.S.10aRelationships of the Porphyra (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) flora of the Falkland Islands: a molecular survey using rbcL and nSSU sequence data  ap. 27-37.  aIncludes references  aThe phylogenetic relationships of Porphyra collected from the Falkland Islands have been examined using molecular data from two loci, the plastid rbcL gene and the nuclear nSSU gene, in conjunction with morphological observations. Nine species have been distinguished, belonging to four distinct lineages within the Bangiales, differing from one another by 16-137 substitutions in the rbcL gene. One species is closely related to P. amplissima, a north Atlantic taxon, three are resolved in a clade that includes several species from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, as well as P. umbilicalis, whereas four others are more closely related to Southern Ocean species, including P. cinnamomea, P. virididentata and several as yet unnamed taxa from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Three species, one of which we identify as P. columbina, appear to be widely distributed in the Southern Ocean, with representatives on the Falkland Islands and on islands of the Australian and New Zealand subantarctic. 3aPorphyra 3aflora 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3aFalkland Islands 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth Australia1 aNelson, W.

Although all PLs are detectable by MALDI-TOF MS, some lipid classes, particularly those with quaternary amines such as phosphatidylcholines (PCs), are more sensitively detected than others, and these suppress the signals of less sensitively detected PLs when complex mixtures are analyzed. Therefore, a separation of the total organic extract into individual lipid classes is necessary. As MALDI uses a solid sample, the direct evaluation of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates is possible. We report here on a method of directly coupling MALDI-TOF MS and TLC that can be easily implemented on commercially available MALDI-TOF devices. A total extract of hen egg yolk is used as a simple PL mixture to demonstrate the capabilities of this method. It will be shown that “clean” spectra without any major contributions from fragmentation products and matrix peaks can be obtained, and that this approach is even sensitive enough to detect the presence of PLs at levels of less than 1% of the total extract.

These proteins have the ability to interact with endogenous plasmodesmal proteins to increase the plasmodesmal size exclusion limit (SEL). When expressed in transgenic tobacco plants, the movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-MP), in addition to increasing the SEL, also alters the biomass partitioning and carbon allocation within these plants. During the day, source leaves of transgenic plants that express the TMV-MP accumulate sugars and starch and biomass partitioning into root tissue is reduced when compared with vector control plants. However, studies with transgenic tobacco plants expressing various mutant forms of the TMV-MP, as well as plants expressing the MP of cucumber mosaic virus, established that the effect on biomass partitioning and carbon allocation is independent of its effect on plasmodesmal SEL. Graft experiments and analysis of transgenic tobacco and potato plants expressing the TMV-MP under tissue-specific promoters indicated that mesophyll cells may be the site of TMV-MP action. In the light of these results and evidence that plasmodesmata are capable of trafficking macromolecules, it is proposed that plasmodesmata within the leaf establish a special communication network between the companion cells (CC) and the mesophyll. In this model, output signals from the CC to the mesophyll and input signals from the mesophyll to the CC are involved in regulating photosynthesis occurring within the mesophyll and loading/export that takes place in the CC-SE complex. It is proposed that the TMV-MP-mediated influence on plasmodesmal trafficking of these signal molecules alters this endogenous control mechanism resulting in a shift in biomass partitioning and carbon allocation. 3aplant viruses 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aplasmodesmata 3asugars 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3amesophyll 3amodels 3astarch 3avector control 3acarbon 3aphloem 3apotatoes 3aviral proteins 3aphotosynthesis 3abiomass 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aroots 3aleaves 0aoutputs1 aBalachandran, Suchandra1 aPark, Jun1 aWolf, Shmuel0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1996 Aug., v. 47 p.1119-1128dOxford University Pressw16629x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01231naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002300117245003700140300001400177520051100191650002400702650001700726650001400743651001100757653001200768653002100780653002400801773006600825852000900891939003300900945000800933655001200941991585508080742620221119080613.0780901e197712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894835192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoolton, Martha A.10aClassroom journey through Africa  ap. 41-42.  aAssemblies and other activities which were conducted at three schools in Washington, D.C. are described to give other schools across the nation ideas for celebrating African Day in February.

Non-enzymic glycation comprises a series of reactions between sugars, α-oxoaldehydes and other sugar derivatives and amino groups of amino acids, peptides and proteins leading to the formation of heterogeneous moieties collectively termed advanced glycation end products (AGE). AGE possess a wide range of chemical and biological properties and play a role in diabetes-related pathology as well as in several other diseases. Diabetes is, nevertheless, of particular interest for several reasons: (1) chronic hyperglycaemia provides the substrates for extracellular glycation as well as intracellular glycation; (2) hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress accelerates AGE formation in the process of glycoxidation; (3) AGE-modified proteins are subject to rapid intracellular proteolytic degradation releasing free AGE adducts into the circulation where they can bind to several pro-inflammatory receptors, especially receptor of AGE; (4) kidneys, which are principally involved in the excretion of free AGE adducts, might be damaged by diabetic nephropathy, which further enhances AGE toxicity because of diminished AGE clearance. Increased dietary intake of AGE in highly-processed foods may represent an additional exogenous metabolic burden in addition to AGE already present endogenously in subjects with diabetes. Finally, inter-individual genetic and functional variability in genes encoding enzymes and receptors involved in either the formation or the degradation of AGE could have important pathogenic, nutrigenomic and nutrigenetic consequences. 3ahyperglycemia 3arenal function 3anutritional status 3aglycation 3aMaillard reaction 3anutrigenomics 3adisease prevalence 3anutrient availability 3achronic diseases 2aDiabetes Complications 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGlycosylation End Products, Advancedxadverse effectsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxpathology 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stress 0aliterature reviews0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2008 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.60-74dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651080060343Available from publisher's Web site  a20080720b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02801naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245012300166300001600289520145200305650002701757650001701784650002201801650001701823650002501840650001801865650001801883650002801901650002801929650001801957650001101975653002701986653001602013653001202029653001402041700001502055700001402070700001602084773012602100852000902226856007602235930003302311946001102344655001202355IND4390480420221119080818.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439048042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01159.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Q.-B.10aInsecticidal activity influence of destruxins on the pathogenicity of Paecilomyces javanicus against Spodoptera litura  ap. 262-268.  aThe bioactivities of destruxins (dtx), depsipeptides isolated from Metarhizium anisopliae, against Spodoptera litura were tested in laboratory. For contacting toxicities, dtx-E was more effective than dtx-A and dtx-B. The LC₅₀s values of dtx-A, B and E were 197.98, 292.00 and 113.99 mg/l at 48 h after treatment, while the LT₅₀s were 42.65, 59.45 and 23.68 h at 300 mg/l. In the experiment of antifeedant activity, dtx-A, dtx-B and dtx-E at five concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/l) were bioassayed. Destruxins in a dose-dependent manner gave an apparent antifeedant activity. Generally, dtx-A, over dtx-B and dtx-E had the significant (P < 0.05) larger choice and no-choice antifeedant indexes (CAIs and NCAIs). At the concentration of 200 mg/l, the CAIs or NCAIs of dtx-A, dtx-B and dtx-E were 96.78, 84.93 and 85.90 or 89.75, 62.42 and 72.28 respectively. Furthermore, the synergistic activity of crude destruxin (CD) for pathogenicity of Paecilomyces javanicus strain Pj01 was detected. The LC₅₀s values of single Pj01 and the mixtures of Pj01 plus CD at 100 or 200 mg/l (Pj01-CD100 or Pj01-CD200) were respectively 474.63 x 10⁵, and 197.45 x 10⁵ or 113.11 x 10⁵ spores/ml at the fifth day after treated. Meanwhile, Pj01, Pj01-CD100 and Pj01-CD200 gave the LT₅₀s values of 6.99 day, 5.49 day and 4.21 day at 100 x 10⁵ spores/ml. Clearly, dtx decreased the values of LC₅₀ and LT₅₀ of the strain Pj01. 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aPaecilomyces 3aSpodoptera litura 3aantifeedants 3aantifeeding activity 3adepsipeptides 3adose response 3ainsecticidal properties 3alethal concentration 50 3apathogenicity 3aspores 0aPaecilomyces javanicus 0aantifeedant 0acontact 0asynergist1 aRen, S.-X.1 aAn, X.-C.1 aQian, M.-H.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.262-268dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01159.x3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03704naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245012200191300001400313520185000327650001202177650001002189650002202199650002002221650001002241650001002251650001602261650001602277650000902293650001802302650004402320650001102364650002902375650001102404650002402415650000902439650006002448650002902508650001602537650003502553650002102588650002102609650002602630650001402656650002102670651001202691653001802703653001602721653002102737653002502758653002302783700001702806773008102823852000902904856009402913930003303007945001303040946001303053655001203066IND2051677620221119080727.0960613e199612  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205167762DNAL7 a101570802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00769.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanelli, P.L.10aResidential differences in the use of pharmacies by older adults and their communication experiences with pharmacists  ap. 19-32.  aThis investigation compares adults (65 and older) living in two different types of communities on the characteristics of the pharmacies they use and their patterns of communicating with pharmacists. Telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample (N=400) of respondents, half residing in six nonmetropolitan counties (containing no towns of more than 4,000) and the other half in a single city (population approximately 130,000) located within a metropolitan county. Elders living in the sparsely populated nonmetropolitan areas were more apt to purchase their medications from an independent neighborhood pharmacy than their counterparts who lived in the large city. These pharmacies, however, were more likely to be located in another town. Differences between residential groups were also observed in the communication patterns that older patients had with their pharmacists. Elders residing in sparsely populated areas reported more frequent conversation with their pharmacists about general topics, although not about medicines or other health-related topics. The elders living in small and remote places also reported that they talked with their pharmacists longer, that communication about medications were more often initiated by the pharmacist, and that they were more likely to talk about their medications directly with their pharmacist rather than a non-pharmacist employee. The overall greater frequency of contact and communication between nonmetropolitan elders and their pharmacists would seem to be precursors to establishing a positive provider-client relationship and may increase the probability of more personal, medication-related discussions. Further research is needed, however, to determine if these potentials are transformed into realities and if they lead to more positive medical outcomes for older persons. 3aelderly 3atowns 3arural communities 3ahealth services 3alabor 3adrugs 3arural areas 3aurban areas 2aAged 2aCommunication 2aCounselingxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHealth Services Research 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aPatient Education as Topicxstatistics & numerical data 2aPharmaciesxutilization. 2aPharmacists 2aProfessional-Patient Relations 2aRural Population 2aSampling Studies 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aTelephone 2aUrban Population 3aFlorida 0acommunication 0acomparisons 0aregional surveys 0atallahassee, florida 0apensacola, florida1 aCoward, R.T.0 tJournal of rural health.g1996 Winter, v. 12, no. 1 p.19-32x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00769.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03430naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245015600166300001400322520184400336650002102180650004302201650002402244650001502268650001102283650001202294650001302306650001802319650001402337650002602351650001602377650002302393650002002416650001102436650001602447650001602463650001302479650001402492651001102506653001702517653001302534700002602547700002102573700001802594700001802612773012502630852000902755856009202764930003302856946001102889655001202900IND4399959020221119080830.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01246.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, G.10aProduction of greenhouse tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) using Nannotrigona perilampoides, Bombus impatiens and mechanical vibration (Hym.: Apoidea)  ap. 79-85.  aImportation of exotic bumblebees for greenhouse pollination may be restricted in México, thus making it necessary to evaluate the potential of native species as pollinators in enclosures. We studied the foraging activity and fruit production of tomato using one colony of Nannotrigona perilampoides (NP) and one colony of Bombus impatiens (BI) in greenhouses with [almost equal to]1000 plants. Mechanical vibration (MV) was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations were found between environmental variables and the number of bees entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with BI. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate if increasing densities of colonies of NP could improve tomato yield in tropical greenhouses. 3aBombus impatiens 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aambient temperature 3acrop yield 3aflight 3aflowers 3aforaging 3afruit growing 3afruit set 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aindigenous species 3alight intensity 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3atomatoes 3avibration 3aMexico 0aNannotrigona 0aYucatán1 aQuezada-Euán, J.J.G.1 aReyes-Oregel, V.1 aMeléndez, V.1 aMoo-Valle, H.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2008 Feb., v. 132, no. 1 p.79-85dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01246.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03236naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264520163000280650002501910650001801935650001101953650002301964650001401987650001402001650001402015650001202029650003102041650001502072650001602087650001202103650001102115650001102126650002002137650001702157650001002174650002602184650001402210650002002224650002202244650001802266650001402284700001802298700002102316700002402337700001802361700001602379773013002395852000902525856009202534930003302626946001102659655001202670IND4398241920221119080635.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439824192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01206.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadadi, H.10aHost plant effects on the functional response of Neoseiulus cucumeris to onion thrips larvae  ap. 728-733.  aThe performance of herbivores, natural enemies and their interactions may be affected directly or indirectly by host plant traits, e.g. the physical plant characteristics may influence the search pattern and the functional response of predators. We studied the functional response of adult females of the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris to first instar larvae of Thrips tabaci on three host plants (sweet pepper, eggplant and cucumber). The 24-h leaf disc experiments conducted at 25 ± 1°C, 60 ± 10% relative humidity and 16 : 8 h (light : dark) showed that N. cucumeris exhibited a type II functional response on all host plants. The following search rates and handling times were estimated from fitting the data to the disc equation 0.043/h and 1.798 h (cucumber); 0.048/h and 1.030 h (sweet pepper) and 0.0441/h and 2.294 h (eggplant) giving an estimated maximum predation of 13.35, 23.31 and 10.46 larvae per day respectively. The data from sweet pepper could also be described by the random predator equation (a': 0.051/h; Th: 0.472 h). The host plant species interacted significantly with prey density on the functional response of N. cucumeris with the relative differences in the number of thrips eaten on each host plant increasing with density. It is suggested that it is mainly the difference in trichome density between the three host plants that is responsible for the observed differences in the functional response of N. cucumeris. These results emphasize the importance of the host plant characteristics on the performance of natural enemies and for optimizing their use in biological control of pests. 3aNeoseiulus cucumeris 3aThrips tabaci 3aadults 3abiological control 3acucumbers 3aeggplants 3aequations 3afemales 3afunctional response models 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3apest control 3apests 3aplant characteristics 3apredation 3apredatory mites 3arelative humidity 3asweet peppers 3atrichomes1 aEnkegaard, A.1 aBrodsgaard, H.F.1 aKharrazi-Pakdel, A.1 aMohaghegh, J.1 aAshouri, A.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 Dec., v. 131, no. 9-10 p.728-733dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01206.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02269naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012100160300001800281500002400299520120800323650001401531650001201545650001101557650001301568650002201581650000901603650002701612650002401639651001001663700001701673700001501690700001701705700001401722773010201736852000901838856004801847655001201895IND4409132520221119080558.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440913252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-007-9439-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Haiyan10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers in Cupressus chenggiana S.

In order to study the population genetics and design the effective conservation methods, we aimed to develop microsatellite primers for this species in the present study. We developed eight new microsatellite loci for this species through biotin capture method. Polymorphism of each locus was further assessed in 18 individuals from three geographically distant populations. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 11 with an average of 8.13. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.219 to 0.296 and from 0.374 to 0.470, with averages of 0.254 and 0.417, respectively. We further found that three of nine microsatellite loci developed previously for another congeneric species showed polymorphic banding patters. We performed primer-crossing tests of these loci in the other two congeneric species which are closely related to C. chenggiana (C. gigantea and C. duclouxiana). These microsatellite markers would be effective for analyzing genetic diversity and population genetic structure of this species and its morphological differentiation with the close relatives. 3aCupressus 3aalleles 3abiotin 3aconifers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation genetics 3aChina1 aShi, Dachuan1 aWang, Juan1 aXu, Tingting1 aWu, Yuxia0 tConservation genetics.g2008 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.1023-1026dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-007-9439-3 7aarticle03436naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009800172300001400270520191100284650002302195650001002218650001502228650002002243650001202263650002602275650001102301650001902312650001902331650001702350650001202367650001002379650001502389650001202404650002202416650001002438650001502448651001302463653002202476653001802498653001802516653002302534700001702557700001902574700001502593700001602608773012502624852000902749856009202758930003302850946001102883655001202894IND4399958620221119080642.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01238.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmsworth, C.G.10aUptake of adhesive powders from lure stations by Mediterranean fruit fly (Dipt., Tephritidae)  ap. 45-53.  aPowders that are capable of adhering to insect cuticles can act as carrier particles when combined with insecticides, entomopathogens, or pheromones, for targeted insect control. One potential method of delivering the powder to an insect is to lure the insects to stations containing powder using a species-specific attractant. Here, we report on the uptake of two different powders from lure stations (henceforth called 'dispensers') by the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, and the transfer of the powders to conspecifics during field studies in Portugal, as part of a research programme to develop lure-and-kill technologies based on adhesive powder. Uptake of an electrostatic wax powder, Entostat[trade mark sign], from dispensers was greater than uptake of a proprietary metallic powder, Entomag[trade mark sign], for both wild male C. capitata visiting field-placed dispensers and laboratory-reared males confined with dispensers in field cages. In agreement with field data, C. capitata also took up more Entostat than Entomag when artificially dosed on dispenser trays containing powder in the laboratory, and the quantities taken up were shown to be greater than that calculated from field experiments. Increasing the amount of Entostat powder in field-placed dispensers resulted in greater uptake of powder by visiting male C. capitata. Laboratory-reared male and female C. capitata were released in field cages in which were hung dispensers containing adhesive powder that were baited with the male attractant trimedlure. After 24 h, the powder was successfully extracted from all males and nearly all females collected, indicating that males probably transferred powder to conspecific females after visiting dispensers. The results underscore that a lure-and-kill system based on adhesive powder might have potential for controlling Mediterranean fruit fly and other flying insects. 3aCeratitis capitata 3acages 3adispensers 3aentomopathogens 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3aflight 3ainsect control 3ainsect cuticle 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3amales 3apheromones 3apowders 3aresearch programs 3atrays 3atrimedlure 3aPortugal 0acarrier particles 0aelectrostatic 0alure and kill 0apesticide delivery1 aRogers, C.D.1 aBarton, L.E.E.1 aSoares, C.1 aPoppy, G.M.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2008 Feb., v. 132, no. 1 p.45-53dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01238.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01180naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002300117245004700140300001400187520039200201650001200593650002400605650001700629653002400646653002600670653002300696653002000719653002000739773006900759852000900828939003300837945000800870655001200878991585505990742620221119080751.0780901e197802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894834902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Annell M.10aTricks of the trade: greeting Uncle Reuben  ap. 60-63.  aHelpful hints are offered for preparing the Jewish menu for April from the ASFSA/USDA multicultural menu series.

However, the effect of each green manure on soil properties and crop yield depends upon its chemical composition. The main objective of this work was to study the effect of incorporating three green manures originating from residues of Trifolium pratense, L. (TP), Brassica napus, L. (BN), and the mixture of TP+BN at rates of 5384 and 8973kgCha-¹, on soil biological properties (soil microbial biomass-C, soil respiration and soil enzymatic activities), nutrition (leaf N, P and K concentration, pigments and soluble carbohydrate concentrations) and yield parameters of maize (Zea mays cv. Tundra) crop for four years on an Typic Xerofluvent located near Sevilla (Guadalquivir Valley, Andalusia, Spain). All green manures had a positive effect on the soil biological properties, plant nutrition an crop yield parameters, although at the end of the experimental period and at the high organic matter rate, the soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase, urease, β-glucosidase, phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities increased more significantly in the TP amended soils (79.2%, 92.1%, 93.9%, 99.3%, 87.9% and 96%, respectively) respect to the control soil, followed by TP+BN amended soils (77.3%, 90.9%, 92.8%, 99.1%, 84.4% and 95.7%, respectively) and BN amended soils (76%, 90.1%, 91.7%, 99%, 83.2% and 95.2%, respectively). Since these soil enzymatic activities measured are responsible for important cycles such as C, N, P and S, an increase of leaf N, P an K contents and pigments and soluble carbohydrate contents were highest in TP amended soils, followed by TP+BN and BN treatments. The application of TP in soils at high doses increased the grain protein concentration, number of grains corncob-¹ and crop yield 44.6%, 6.3% and 22.1%, respectively, compared with the control soil, followed by TP+BN treatment (41.7%, 5.7% and 20.8%, respectively) and BN treatment (39%, 5.3% and 20%, respectively). The explanation of these results can be a consequence to the different chemical composition of the green manures applied to the soils and its mineralization, aspect controlled by the soil C/N ratio. 3aBrassica napus 3aTrifolium pratense 3aZea mays 3aarylsulfatase 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrates 3acrop yield 3aenzyme activity 3agood agricultural practices 3agrain crops 3agrain protein 3agreen manures 3aleaves 3amicrobial biomass 3amineral fertilizers 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apigments 3asoil biological properties 3asoil respiration 3asoil treatment 3atundra 3aurease 3avalleys 2aAgriculture 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aEcosystem 2aManure 2aModels, Chemical 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistry 2aSoil 2aSoil Pollutants 2aTrifoliumxmetabolism 2aUreasexchemistry 2aZea maysxmetabolism 3aSpain1 aGonzalez, J.L.1 aGarcía-Martínez, A.M.1 aParrado, J.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 6 p.1758-1767dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.052 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009200167300001600259520135200275650001501627650001201642650002301654650001901677650001701696650002001713650001001733650001601743650001301759650001701772650001001789650001801799650001101817650002201828650001101850651001101861653002101872773012801893852000902021856009202030930003302122946001102155655001202166IND4394770420221119080655.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01173.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖberg, S.10aDiversity of spiders after spring sowing - influence of farming system and habitat type  ap. 524-531.  aSpiders contribute considerably to diversity in agroecosystems and are important components of natural pest control. Farming system and adjacent habitats may influence spider diversity. In this study, diversity of the spider families Lycosidae and Linyphiidae was studied after spring sowing until the time when a common pest (Rhopalosiphum padi) colonizes cereal fields. The spiders were collected with pitfall traps at eight organically or conventionally managed farms around Uppsala, Sweden, in three different habitats at each site: field margin, crop field and the edge between the two. The effects of farming system and habitat type on diversity of lycosids and linyphiids were considered using three different measures (activity density, species richness and composition). The most dominant species of each spider family, Pardosa agrestis (Lycosidae) and Oedothorax apicatus (Linyphiidae), had higher activity density at organic sites, and farming systems also contained different species compositions of both lycosid and linyphiid spiders. Also, linyphiid species richness was higher on conventional sites and linyphiid species composition was influenced by habitat type, in contrast with lycosids. Activity density and species richness of lycosid spiders were, on the other hand, more associated with field margins than linyphiid spiders. 3aOedothorax 3aPardosa 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aagroecosystems 3aedge effects 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afield crops 3ahabitats 3apest control 3apests 3apitfall traps 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3aSweden 0aactivity density0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 Sept., v. 131, no. 8 p.524-531dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01173.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245011500191300001600306500001500322520116500337650001901502650001201521650001601533650001201549650002501561650001601586650000901602650002201611650007301633650001101706650002601717650007601743650006601819650001101885650001901896650000901915650006901924650006901993651001802062651001602080653003502096653002702131653002002158773008102178852000902259856009402268930003302362945001302395946001302408655001202421IND2049876620221119080603.0960214e199509  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204987662DNAL7 a101536862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1995.tb00424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabiner, D.J.10aPatterns and predictors of noninstitutional health care utilization by older adults in rural and urban America  ap. 259-273.  a2019-12-04  aNoninstitutional long-term care is not often included in policy studies or recommendations in the United States even though there have been recent efforts to include this type of care in health reform proposals. This study was designed to provide insight into the patterns and predictors of noninstitutional medical, home-, and community-based services utilization by older adults in rural and urban Americn. The National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) was used to explore the relationship between residentinl setting and subsequent noninstitutional services utilization. Weighted logistic regression procedures for complex survey designs were used to guide the analysis. Living in the Northeast and residence in moderately densely populated areas (towns, small cities, and suburbs) were significant positive predictors of subsequent medical, home-, and community-based services utilization. Because some differentials were found in access to and use of services by regional and geographic setting, policy-makers need to develop alternative strategies to eliminate inequities in the distribution of noninstitutional long-term care services in more remote areas. 3along term care 3aelderly 3aurban areas 3asurveys 3aprobability analysis 3arural areas 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCommunity Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aFemale 2aHealth Care Rationing 2aHealth Services for the Agedxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aHome Care Servicesxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aHumans 2aLong-Term Care 2aMale 2aRural Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aUrban Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 3aUnited States 0aNew England 0anational long term care survey 0adescriptive statistics 0ahealth services0 tJournal of rural health.g1995 Fall, v. 11, no. 4 p.259-273x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1995.tb00424.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03095naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245014300168300001600311520175300327650002302080650001702103650000902120650001502129650000902144650001702153650001702170650001502187650001602202650001402218651001302232653001902245653002402264700001902288700001802307700001702325700001702342700001802359773012702377852000902504856009202513930003302605946001102638655001202649IND4392940520221119080612.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01198.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, J.10aLarge-scale releases of Trichogramma ostriniae to suppress Ostrinia nubilalis in commercially grown processing and fresh market sweet corn  ap. 432-440.  aWe evaluated the egg parasitoid Trichogramma ostriniae (Pang et Chen) (Hym.: Trichogrammatidae) for control of European corn borer [Lep.:Crambidae: Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner)] in fields of commercial processing sweet corn in New York in 2002 and 2003. We made inoculative releases of 75 000 T. ostriniae/ha when corn was at mid-whorl and regional O. nubilalis activity had begun. Each release field was paired with a similar non-release control. The incidence of egg mass parasitism, number of stalk tunnels, incidence of ear damage and effect on insecticide spray decisions were evaluated. Parasitism of cumulative number of O. nubilalis egg masses was 51.3 ± 7.2% and 43.5 ± 5.7% (mean ± SEM) in release fields in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The incidence of ear damage by O. nubilalis was not affected by T. ostriniae in either year of the study. There was no difference in stalk damage between release fields and control fields in either 2002 or 2003. However, individual comparisons between paired release and control fields showed reduced stalk tunnelling in 10 of 19 fields, but ear damage was reduced in only two of 19 fields. Neither the number of actual insecticide sprays nor the number of decisions to spray based on sequential sampling were affected significantly by releasing T. ostriniae. In a separate but related study, where releases were conducted in commercial fresh market sweet corn and used higher rates of release, T. ostriniae had no effect on the number of insecticidal sprays. In an additional experiment using small plots of sweet corn, ear damage was similar whether plots were treated with T. Ostriniae or with insecticide. Additional research should focus on improving the timing, frequency and rate of releases. 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3aTrichogramma 3acorn 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3afresh market 3ainsecticides 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3asweetcorn 3aNew York 0aegg parasitoid 0ainoculative release1 aHoffmann, M.P.1 aCheever, S.A.1 aSeaman, A.J.1 aWestgate, P.1 aHazzard, R.V.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 July, v. 131, no. 6 p.432-440dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01198.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02564naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009800167300001600265520134500281650002001626650001301646650001201659650001101671650001001682650002001692650001001712650001901722653001301741653004201754700002001796700001701816700001501833700001601848700001701864773012701881852000902008856009302017930003302110946001102143655001202154IND4392059220221119080722.0070603e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439205922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01167.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNansen, C.10aEffects of sex pheromone in electrostatic powder on mating behaviour by Lobesia botrana males  ap. 303-310.  aIn laboratory trials, mating behaviour of males of Lobesia botrana Den. and Schiff. (Lep., Tortricidae) was investigated after treatment with an electrostatically chargeable powder, EntostatTM. Male moths were powdered with either blank Entostat or Entostat containing sex pheromone. Significantly more Entostat adhered to L. botrana males when sex pheromone was added to the powder compared with blank Entostat. Powdering male moths with Entostat, with or without sex pheromone, caused a significant reduction in antennal response when antennae were placed 2 cm away in downwind direction, while there was little effect when antennae were placed 25-100 cm from the EAG in downwind direction. In a flight study, powdering males of L. botrana caused significant increase in time before flight initiation and reduction in proportion of males making contact with calling females compared with untreated males. In a mating experiment in Petri dishes (to minimize required search time to locate female), significantly fewer females mated successfully (based on dissection of bursa copulatrix) when males had been treated with pheromone-loaded powder. Overall, powdering males of L. botrana caused considerable suppression of mating behaviour on various levels, and these suppressing effects were increased after adding sex pheromone to Entostat. 3aLobesia botrana 3aantennae 3afemales 3aflight 3amales 3amating behavior 3amoths 3asex pheromones 0aEntostat 0amoth integrated pest management (IPM)1 aMacDonald, K.M.1 aRogers, C.D.1 aThomas, M.1 aPoppy, G.M.1 aBaxter, I.H.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 June, v. 131, no. 5 p.303-310dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01167.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070603b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03175naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009100174300001600265520185000281650003502131650001102166650000902177650000902186650001202195650001102207650001602218650001302234650002402247650001302271650001702284650001002301651001202311651000902323653001902332653002102351653001602372700001502388700001802403700001202421773012702433852000902560856009202569930003302661946001102694655001202705IND4392940020221119080733.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01205.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgrc Barčić, J.10aWestern corn rootworm adult movement and possible egg laying in fields bordering maize  ap. 400-405.  aWestern corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, larval damage in maize following soybean was observed in Croatia in 2003 along the edges and within soybean fields which bordered continuous maize fields in previous year. The explanation was that WCR adults moved from the continuous maize to the neighbouring soybean fields to lay eggs. This study was designed to measure how far WCR adults will enter into neighbouring fields to lay eggs. The WCR adult population was monitored in continuous maize fields in 2003 and 2005 by using Pherocon® AM non-baited yellow sticky traps in the middle and on the borders of the maize field and at different distances and directions into neighbouring fields planted by wheat and soybean. Larval presence and root damage ratings (Iowa State University 1-6) were recorded at different locations within the maize field in following years. Approximately, the same concentration of WCR adults was recorded along the edges of the maize fields as recorded in the centres of those fields. A significant number of WCR adults was recorded up to a distance of 50 m into neighbouring fields. Regression analysis showed medium negative correlation between distance from previous maize field and root damage in the following year. Findings indicate that WCR egg lying can reach approximately 20 m into fields neighbouring maize fields and that significant root damage caused by WCR larvae in first-year maize following soybean and wheat can happen up to a distance of 20 m into those fields. Most farmers's fields in Croatia are up to approximately 50 m wide. As an edge effect for WCR egg laying can reach approximately 20 m into fields neighbouring maize fields, our research results indicate that it is possible to see WCR larval damage in rotated fields without those WCR's being the variant form. 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aadults 3acorn 3aeggs 3afarmers 3alarvae 3aoviposition 3aplanting 3aregression analysis 3asoybeans 3asticky traps 3awheat 3aCroatia 3aIowa 0aadult movement 0afirst-year maize 0aroot damage1 aBažok, R.1 aEdwards, C.R.1 aKos, T.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2007 July, v. 131, no. 6 p.400-405dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01205.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009800175300001400273520175600287650002302043650001502066650001802081650002402099650002102123650001602144650001002160650001302170650001102183650002602194650002002220653002102240653001902261653001702280700001902297700001902316700001502335773012502350852000902475856009202484930003302576946001102609655001202620IND4399958320221119080645.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01247.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogervorst, P.A.M.14aThe importance of honeydew as food for larvae of Chrysoperla carnea in the presence of aphids  ap. 18-25.  aLarvae of the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea are predacious and feed on a wide range of small, soft-bodied arthropods. In addition to their feeding on prey arthropods to cover their nutritional requirements for growth and development, the consumption of non-prey foods such as honeydew has been reported. It is commonly believed that these food supplements are primarily exploited by the larvae when prey is scarce or of low nutritional quality. Here, we assess whether C. carnea larvae also use honeydew when high-quality aphid prey are readily available. In a choice experiment, the feeding behaviour of C. carnea larvae was observed in the presence of both aphids and honeydew. The larvae were starved, aphid-fed, or honeydew-fed prior to the experiment. The time spent feeding on honeydew compared with feeding on aphids was highest for starved larvae and lowest for honeydew-fed larvae. Among the three treatments, the aphid-fed larvae spent the most time resting and the least time searching. In an additional experiment food intake was assessed in terms of weight change when larvae were provided with an ad libitum supply of either aphids or honeydew. Larvae yielded a significant lower relative weight increase on honeydew compared with aphids. The reduced weight increase on honeydew was compensated when larvae were subsequently provided with aphids, but not when honeydew was provided again. This study showed that (i) prior honeydew feeding reduces overall aphid consumption, and (ii) larvae do consume honeydew even after they have been given ad libitum access to aphids. The fact that larvae of C. carnea still use honeydew as a food source in the presence of suitable prey underlines the importance of carbohydrates as foods. 3aChrysoperla carnea 3aarthropods 3acarbohydrates 3adietary supplements 3afeeding behavior 3afood intake 3afoods 3ahoneydew 3alarvae 3anutrient requirements 3anutritive value 0aalternative food 0aaphid predator 0afood ecology1 aWäckers, F.L.1 aCarette, A.-C.1 aRomeis, J.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2008 Feb., v. 132, no. 1 p.18-25dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01247.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245008600190300001800276520077700294650001501071650001101086650002101097650000701118650002701125650001601152650003401168650001901202650001501221650001101236650003101247650004501278650002901323650004301352650001601395650001701411653002701428653003001455653003201485653002901517700002601546700002301572700002701595700002301622700002301645773012201668852000901790856006901799930003301868946001101901655001201912IND4385640220221119080713.0061203e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438564022DNAL7 a170216612pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-006-9188-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Claudia S.

At pH 9 the adsorption on microgel particles was strongly affected by temperature, approximately 40 mg hIgG/g support (90% of initial hIgG) being adsorbed at 40°C but only 10% of initial hIgG at 25°C. At pH 5 the maximum adsorbed amount (20 mg hIgG/g support) was similar for both temperatures. The adsorption of hIgG on to charged poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) core-shell latexes was negligible (5-10 mg hIgG/g support) at the same temperature and pH conditions. The lower adsorption of hIgG onto the core-shell particles is explained by steric interactions due to the small size of the shell. 3aadsorption 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apH 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atemperature 2aAcrylamidesxpharmacokinetics 2aAcrylic Resins 2aAdsorption 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aImmunoglobulin Gxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aPolymersxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aHuman immunoglobulin G 0aPoly(methyl methacrylate) 0aPoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 0aThermosensitive polymers1 aBaptista, Ricardo P. 1 aSantos, Andrea M. 1 aMartinho, José M.

Data for this study came from a 1996 cross-sectional survey of C/MHCs' medical directors. A total of 411 centers (68.3 percent) responded to the survey, including 240 rural (67.4 percent) and 171 urban (68.7 percent) C/MHCs. Factor analysis was used to synthesize physician practice characteristics related to overall satisfaction. The resulting factors were entered as new variables in a predictive logistic regression model of overall satisfaction. Growing up in an inner-city community was significantly associated with practicing in an urban center; whereas, growing up in a rural or frontier community was more likely to result in practicing in a rural center. The majority of medical directors (82.3 percent) were either somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with their work. Satisfaction with work was most significantly associated with overall level of satisfaction, followed by satisfaction with administration, peers and patients. Recruitment efforts are more likely to succeed when they target individuals with prior exposure to underserved areas. Improving the working conditions and interactions with administrators would help sustain the high level of satisfaction experienced by medical directors at C/MHCs. 3aphysicians 3amanagers 3ademography 3aregression analysis 2aCommunity Health Centersxmanpower. 2aDemography 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aJob Satisfaction 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMedically Underserved Area 2aPhysician Executivesxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aProfessional Practicexstatistics & numerical data 2aRural Health Servicesxmanpower. 2aTransients and Migrants 2aUrban Health Servicesxmanpower. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acharacteristics 0awork satisfaction 0afactor analysis 0arural urban relations 0acomparisons 0ahealth centers1 aSamuels, M.E.1 aCochran, C.R.1 aGlover, S.1 aSingh, D.A.0 tJournal of rural health.g1998 Fall, v. 14, no. 4 p.346-356x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00640.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02837naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008700180300001600267520107000283650001401353650001101367650001101378650000901389650000901398650001201407650002201419650000901441650001301450650002001463650001001483650002601493650004701519650001201566650003801578650001101616650000901627650001101636650004301647650002001690650004001710650002401750650003101774653001901805653001901824700001401843700001801857700001501875700001301890700002201903700002401925773013501949852000902084856008602093930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4391169020221119080700.0070506e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116902DNAL7 a168966242pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0644-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnobbe, N. 10aC and N stable isotope variation in urine and milk of cattle depending on the diet  ap. 104-108.  aThe stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of urine and milk samples from cattle under different feeding regimes were analysed over a period of six months. The isotope ratios were measured with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The δ ¹³C values of milk and urine were dependent on different feeding regimes based on C₃ or C₄ plants. The δ ¹³C values are more negative under grass feeding than under maize feeding. The δ ¹³C values of milk are more negative compared to urine and independent of the feeding regime. Under grass feeding the analysed milk and urine samples are enriched in ¹³C relative to the feed, whereas under maize feeding the ¹³C/¹²C ratio of urine is in the same range and milk is depleted in ¹³C relative to the diet. The difference between the ¹⁵N/¹⁴N ratios for the two feeding regimes is less pronounced than the ¹³C/¹²C ratios.

The prepared luminescent water-soluble CdS QDs were evaluated as fluorescence probes for the detection of highly reactive hydrogen selenide ions (HSe- ions). The quenching of the fluorescence emission of CdS QDs with the addition of HSe- ions is due to the elimination of the S²- vacancies which are luminescence centers. Quantitative analysis based on chemical interaction between HSe- ions and the surface of CdS QDs is very simple, easy to develop, and has demonstrated very high sensitivity and selectivity features. The effect of foreign ions (common anions and biologically relevant cations) on the fluorescence of the CdS QDs was examined to evaluate the selectivity. Only Cu²⁺ and S²- ions exhibit significant effects on the fluorescence of CdS QDs. With the developed method, we are able to determine the concentration of HSe- ions in the range from 0.10 to 4.80 μmol L-¹, and the limit of detection is 0.087 μmol L-¹. The proposed method was successfully applied to monitor the obtained HSe- ions from the reaction of glutathione with selenite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on fluorescence analysis of HSe- ions in aqueous solution.

Acetyl xylan esterase of T. reesei was highly active on polymeric xylan but was unable to remove acetyl substituents from glucomannan or phenolic substituents from wheat straw arabinoxylan. Another esterase, acetyl esterase from T. reesei, had activity only towards short oligomeric and monomeric acetates derived both from xylan and glucomannan. The acetyl glucomannan esterase of A. oryzae was most active towards polymeric glucomannan, but was also able to remove acetyl groups from xylan. The only esterase studied which was active against phenolic substituents in arabinoxylans was the feruloyl esterase from A. oryzae. Feruloyl esterase had the widest substrate specificity of the esterases studied. It was also able to act on acetyl groups both in xylan and in glucomannan. The simultaneous enzymic liberation of acetyl groups from xylan and glucomannan clearly enhanced the action of xylan- and mannan-degrading enzymes, thus increasing the hydrolysis yield significantly. However, none of the esterases was able to remove all acetyl substituents when acting alone and simultaneous action of two esterases was needed for complete deacetylation. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aacetates 3aarabinoxylan 3aesterification 3aferuloyl esterase 3afungi 3aglucomannans 3ahydrolysis 3asubstrate specificity 3awheat straw 3axylan0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g1998 Feb., v. 27, no. pt.1 p.19-24x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03716naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100003000170245014100200300001800341500002400359520185200383650001002235650001902245650001402264650001902278650001802297650001502315650001002330650002602340650001202366650002202378650001102400650002102411650001602432650002702448650001402475650001202489650001602501650001502517650002502532650002302557650004802580650004602628650003202674650001602706650004102722700001802763700002202781700002202803700002202825700001902847700003302866773011502899852000903014856009103023655001203114IND4438669920221119080454.0100618s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443866992DNAL7 a204476812pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeset, Tina-Simone Schmid10aUnderstanding consumption-related sucralose emissions — A conceptual approach combining substance-flow analysis with sampling analysis  ap. 3261-3269.  aIncludes references  aThis paper explores the potential of combining substance-flow modelling with water and wastewater sampling to trace consumption-related substances emitted through the urban wastewater. The method is exemplified on sucralose. Sucralose is a chemical sweetener that is 600 times sweeter than sucrose and has been on the European market since 2004. As a food additive, sucralose has recently increased in usage in a number of foods, such as soft drinks, dairy products, candy and several dietary products. In a field campaign, sucralose concentrations were measured in the inflow and outflow of the local wastewater treatment plant in Linköping, Sweden, as well as upstream and downstream of the receiving stream and in Lake Roxen. This allows the loads emitted from the city to be estimated. A method consisting of solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry was used to quantify the sucralose in the collected surface and wastewater samples. To identify and quantify the sucralose sources, a consumption analysis of households including small business enterprises was conducted as well as an estimation of the emissions from the local food industry. The application of a simple model including uncertainty and sensitivity analysis indicates that at present not one large source but rather several small sources contribute to the load coming from households, small business enterprises and industry. This is in contrast to the consumption pattern seen two years earlier, which was dominated by one product. The inflow to the wastewater treatment plant decreased significantly from other measurements made two years earlier. The study shows that the combination of substance-flow modelling with the analysis of the loads to the receiving waters helps us to understand consumption-related emissions. 3acandy 3adairy products 3aemissions 3afood additives 3afood industry 3ahouseholds 3alakes 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3asmall businesses 3asoft drinks 3asolid phase extraction 3asucralose 3asucrose 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aLimit of Detection 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSucrosexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aSweetening Agentsxanalysis 2aUncertainty 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis1 aSinger, Heinz1 aLongrée, Philipp1 aBader, Hans-Peter1 aScheidegger, Ruth1 aWittmer, Anita1 aAndersson, Jafet Clas Martin0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 July 15, v. 408, no. 16 p.3261-3269dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02064naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010300124300001600227520118800243650001301431650002401444650002001468650001601488650003101504653001401535700001401549700002201563773009901585852000901684930003301693945001301726946001101739655001201750IND2037996420221119080420.0940317e199306  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203799642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, P.M.10aInduction of alpha-galactosidase in Penicillium ochrochloron by guar (Cyamopsis tetragonobola) gum  ap. 361-371.  aHigh yields of extracellular alpha-galactosidase from fungal cultures were obtained by inducing enzyme production with guar gum (a galactomannan obtained from the seeds of Cyamopsis tetragonobola) as the sole carbon source. An alpha-galactosidase was isolated from the culture medium of Penicillium ochrochloron culture and purified 867-fold by CM-cellulose and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Gel-filtration data revealed an Mr of 57500, which was in close agreement with SDS/PAGE Mr estimation, for a single band, of 60200. The alpha-galactosidase activity is strictly dependent upon the pH and temperature of the incubation medium, being maximal at pH 4.5 and 55 degrees C respectively. This enzyme from P. ochrochloron was isolated and purified, devoid of beta-mannanase activity, which cleaves the main beta-mannan backbone of galactomannans and greatly diminishes its gel-promoting capacity. The properties of purified guar-gum-induced alpha-galactosidase activity in P. ochrochloron culture were evaluated in order to ascribe a possible application for alpha-galactosidase in the controlled generation of an improved guar-gum-based gel promoter. 3aguar gum 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aPenicillium 3agene expression regulation 0ainduction1 aPatel, S.1 aBrownleader, M.D.0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g1993 June, v. 17, no. pt.3 p.361-371x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03198naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001800172245008100190300001600271520131100287650003901598650002001637650002001657650001601677650001601693650001501709650003001724650001001754650002501764650003301789650001101822650003101833650006301864650006601927650001101993650000902004650001602013650001402029650002002043650001702063650001902080650002602099650001702125651001402142651001402156653001602170653002502186653003302211700001702244700002002261700001802281700001602299773008302315852000902398856009402407930003302501945001302534946001302547655001202560IND2180368020221119080553.0981008e199804  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218036802DNAL7 a97150022pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00615.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeckman, T.G.10aPsychosocial differences between urban and rural people living with HIV/AIDS  ap. 138-145.  aDuring the past decade, many investigations have examined the life circumstances of people living with HIV disease. Most of these studies, however, have focused on HIV-infected people in large metropolitan areas. This study compares the psychosocial profiles of rural and urban people living with HIV disease. Anonymous, self-administered surveys were completed by 276 people with HIV/AIDS in a Midwestern state. The assessment instrument measured respondents' quality of life, perceptions of loneliness, social support, experiences with AIDS-related discrimination, access to services, and illness-related coping strategies. Compared with their urban counterparts, rural people with HIV reported a significantly lower satisfaction with life, lower perceptions of social support from family members and friends, reduced access to medical and mental health care, elevated levels of loneliness, more community stigma, heightened personal fear that their HIV serostatus would be learned by others, and more maladaptive coping strategies. Programs that are designed to improve the life circumstances of people with HIV disease in rural areas -- particularly those that facilitate access to adequate health care, increase perceptions of social support, and improve illness-related coping -- are urgently needed. 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3aquality of life 3ahealth services 3arural areas 3aurban areas 3ademography 2aAdaptation, Psychological 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxpsychology 2aHealth Services Accessibilityxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Services Needs and Demandxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrejudice 2aQuality of Life 2aRural Health 2aSocial Support 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aUrban Health 3aWisconsin 0aWisconsin 0acomparisons 0apsychosocial aspects 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus1 aSomlai, A.M.1 aKalichman, S.C.1 aFranzoi, S.L.1 aKelly, J.A.0 tJournal of rural health.g1998 Spring, v. 14, no. 2 p.138-145x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00615.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03151naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002100172245005400193300001600247500009200263500001500355520111800370650001101488650001601499650002001515650001601535650001001551650003301561650001101594650001101605650000901616650001601625650007201641650007701713650007801790650005501868650006401923650003701987650003702024651001202061651001202073653002502085653002402110653002502134653002002159653002402179653002902203653002102232700002102253700001802274773008302292852000902375856009402384930003302478945001302511946001302524655001202537IND2180366620221119080615.0981008e199804  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218036662DNAL7 a97149992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00612.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrickland, W.J.10aRural and urban nonphysician providers in Georgia  ap. 109-120.  aIn the special section: Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners in Rural Practice.  a2019-12-04  aNonphysician providers make valuable contributions to health care in rural areas. This study examines provider and practice characteristics, location preference, and reasons for location preference among Georgia nurse practitioners (NPs), certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants (PAs) (N=1,079). Data collected through a statewide survey revealed that providers were concentrated in urban areas. Rural providers tended to be older, less educated, possess fewer specialty credentials, and were employed longer than urban providers. NPs were significantly more likely to prefer smaller communities, and PAs were significantly more likely to prefer larger communities. Providers who preferred smaller communities were likely to practice in rural and urban areas, but providers who preferred larger communities were substantially more likely to practice in urban areas. Providers who preferred smaller communities were significantly more likely to mention the importance of community dynamics, while providers who preferred larger communities were significantly more likely to mention professional context. 3anurses 3aurban areas 3alocation theory 3arural areas 2aAdult 2aAttitude of Health Personnel 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNurse Midwivesxstatistics & numerical dataxsupply & distribution. 2aNurse Practitionersxstatistics & numerical dataxsupply & distribution. 2aPhysician Assistantsxstatistics & numerical dataxsupply & distribution. 2aProfessional Practicexstatistics & numerical data 2aProfessional Practice Locationxstatistics & numerical data 2aRural Health Servicesxmanpower. 2aUrban Health Servicesxmanpower. 3aGeorgia 0aGeorgia 0alocation preferences 0anurse practitioners 0aphysician assistants 0acharacteristics 0ahealth care workers 0acertified nurse midwives 0aregional surveys1 aStrickland, D.L.1 aGarretson, C.0 tJournal of rural health.g1998 Spring, v. 14, no. 2 p.109-120x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00612.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03131naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002700172245012000199300001400319520163300333650002201966650002201988650002302010650002402033650004202057650002302099650001102122650003102133650003302164650003802197650003002235650003902265650003702304651001802341653002102359653002302380700002702403773008102430852000902511856009402520930003302614945001302647946001302660655001202673IND2180366020221119080611.0981008e199804  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218036602DNAL7 a97149972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00609.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEarle-Richardson, G.B.10aCommentary from the front lines: improving the National Health Service Corps' use of nonphysician medical providers  ap. 91-97.  aMigrant and community health centers, funded by the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC), provide a vital service to rural communities by ensuring accessible and affordable medical care. One way the BPHC helps communities staff these centers is through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). In this program, medical professionals receive scholarships or educational loan repayment in return for practicing in medically underserved regions where migrant and community health centers are located. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurse midwives (nonphysician providers) are a recent addition to the NHSC, and they offer the advantages of reduced cost and a strong primary care orientation. In this commentary, the authors recount their own experiences as a nonphysician provider NHSC scholarship recipient and spouse, and they identify five underlying problems with the current system, which lead to poor nonphysician provider retention. (1) Too few potential placement sites are made available from the outset. (2) NHSC placement deadlines do not allow enough time for making the best possible placement. (3) Many community health centers are not highly supportive of or invested in the program. (4) NHSC efforts to support the development of local medical providers from within underserved regions are inadequate. (5) NHSC officers working with nonphysician providers do not demonstrate a high degree of commitment to achieving an optimal provider-site match. Changes in the NHSC program based on these five problems are recommended to improve the retention of nonphysician providers in this important program. 3arural communities 3amedical education 3aeducation programs 3ahealth care workers 2aAllied Health Personnelxutilization. 2aAttitude to Health 2aHumans 2aMedically Underserved Area 2aNurse Midwivesxutilization. 2aNurse Practitionersxutilization. 2aOrganizational Innovation 2aPhysician Assistantsxutilization. 2aRural Health Servicesxmanpower. 0aUnited States 0amedical services 0ainservice training1 aEarle-Richardson, A.F.0 tJournal of rural health.g1998 Spring, v. 14, no. 2 p.91-97x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00609.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011200130300001400242520101800256650002101274650001801295650001201313650002101325650001901346650002201365650003201387650001501419650001501434650001801449650002101467650002501488650003901513650003001552650001201582650002501594650001801619650002701637700003001664700002001694700001601714700002301730773009701753852000901850930003301859945001301892946001101905655001201916IND2332657920221119080348.0030520e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233265792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Văn Chi.10aCharacterization of trichobakin, a type I ribosome-inactivating protein from Trichosanthes sp.

Bac Kan 8-98 (family Cucurbitaceae), by PCR using specific primers designed from the cDNA sequences of alpha-trichosanthin. The sequence encoding mature TBK was constructed in the pET-21d(+) vector for overexpression in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by CM-Sepharose chromatography on FPLC with a final yield of about 55 mg/l of culture. The protein has a molecular mass of about 27 kDa, as shown by SDS/PAGE and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS. It was found that the protein inhibited luciferase mRNA translation in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system with an IC50 value (that which causes a 50% reduction of residual translational activity) of about 3.5 pM. The rRNA N-glycosidase activity of the protein was also proved at the above-mentioned concentration after rRNAs were treated with acid aniline. 3aEscherichia coli 3aTrichosanthes 3aaniline 3acell free system 3achromatography 3acomplementary DNA 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aionization 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3arecombinant proteins 3aribosomal RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aHoàng, Quó̂c Trương.1 aNguyen Thuy Ha.1 aChung, W.I.1 aLê, Trần Bình.0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g2001 Oct., v. 34, no. pt.2 p.85-92x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02630naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001600173245009000189300001600279500001500295520095600310650001501266650001401281650002401295650001601319650002001335650002501355650001101380650002201391650003201413650001101445650003301456650000901489650008901498650003501587650002101622650001901643651002901662651001901691651002601710651001801736653002401754653001701778700002301795700001501818773008101833852000901914856009401923930003302017945001302050946001302063655001202076IND2124239720221119080429.0980725e199709  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212423972DNAL7 a101771522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00973.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrein, S.L.14aThe composition of rural hospital medical staffs: the influence of hospital neighbors  ap. 306-319.  a2019-12-04  aThe local supply of physicians has a strong influence on the availability and the quality of services provided by rural hospitals. Nevertheless, there are no published studies that describe the composition of rural hospital medical staffs and, in particular, the availability of specialists on these staffs. This study uses 1991 and 1994 survey data from rural hospitals located in eight states to describe the specialty composition and factors that influence the presence of specialists on rural hospital medical staffs. The results show a strong, positive association between the level of medical staff specialization in rural hospitals and the level of medical specialization of their closest rural neighbors, which suggests there is competition among rural hospitals based on the composition of the hospital medical staff. Analysis by specialty type, however, indicates that the degree of competition may differ for different types of specialists. 3aphysicians 3ahospitals 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3ahealth services 2aEconomic Competition 2aFemale 2aHealth Workforce. 2aHospitals, Ruralxmanpower. 2aHumans 2aInterinstitutional Relations 2aMale 2aMedical Staff, Hospitalxorganization & administrationxstatistics & numerical data. 2aQuality Assurance, Health Care 2aRural Population 2aSpecialization 3aMidwestern United States 3aPacific States 3aRocky Mountain region 0aUnited States 0ahealth care workers 0aavailability1 aChristianson, J.B.1 aChen, M.M.0 tJournal of rural health.g1997 Fall, v. 13, no. 4 p.306-319x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00973.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03155naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001800173245008000191300001600271520134400287650001301631650001601644650002001660650001601680650001801696650003001714650001501744650001001759650005101769650002101820650005101841650001101892650001801903650001101921650004201932650001101974650002001985650000902005650003302014650002102047650002102068651003102089651003102120651001802151653002702169653002602196653002302222700001602245700002002261700001702281773008102298852000902379856009402388930003302482945001302515946001302528655001202541IND2124240020221119080345.0980725e199709  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212424002DNAL7 a101771552pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00976.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlifkin, R.T.10aPublic-sector immunization coverage in 11 states: the status of rural areas  ap. 334-341.  aThis report uses county-level immunization data generated by state public health agencies to explore the rural-urban variation in the delivery of childhood immunizations in the public sector. Public health department-documented immunization coverage rates for 1995 were obtained from 882 counties in 11 states east of the Mississippi River. To assess the possible association between public health department immunization coverage rates and county rurality, descriptive statistics were calculated. A multiple regression model then was estimated. In all states except West Virginia, nonmetropolitan counties averaged higher completion rates than metropolitan counties. Consistent with the descriptive statistics, in the regression analysis nonmetropolitan counties had average immunization rates 2.47 percentage points higher than metropolitan counties, even when controlling for county socioeconomic characteristics. For the 11 states in the analysis, rural children immunized in the public sector had higher completion rates compared with urban children. These data reflect the dependence of rural families on the public health system and the potential for successful health care delivery through public clinics. As new health care systems are brought into rural areas, the success of this existing avenue for care must not be overlooked. 3achildren 3arural youth 3ahealth services 3arural areas 3apublic sector 3apublic services and goods 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChild Health Servicesxeconomicsxutilization. 2aChild, Preschool 2aDelivery of Health Care, Integratedxeconomics 2aFemale 2aHealth Policy 2aHumans 2aImmunizationxeconomicsxutilization. 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aPublic Health Administration 2aRural Population 2aState Government 3aNortheastern United States 3aSoutheastern United States 0aUnited States 0adescriptive statistics 0aimmunization programs 0achildhood diseases1 aClark, S.J.1 aStrandhoy, S.E.1 aKonrad, T.R.0 tJournal of rural health.g1997 Fall, v. 13, no. 4 p.334-341x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00976.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01554naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001600249520071300265650002100978650001900999650001801018650002101036650002501057700001701082773009901099852000901198930003301207945001301240946001101253655001201264IND2332680220221119080325.0030521e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233268022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuk, I.H.Y.10aChanges in the overall extent of protein glycosylation by Chinese hamster ovary cells over the course of batch culture  ap. 133-140.  aGlycosylation of recombinant proteins can change during the culture of animal cells. Since lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) are the carbohydrate donors in N-linked glycosylation, their availability is postulated to influence the extent of glycosylation. To test this hypothesis, relative LLO and glycosylation levels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were monitored over the course of batch culture for corresponding changes. Radiolabelling studies reveal that throughout the length of culture, intracellular LLO levels remained within a 2-fold range and overall CHO protein glycosylation varied by less than 30%. The implications of these results and hypotheses to explain the findings are discussed. 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3aglycosylation 3aoligosaccharides 3arecombinant proteins1 aWang, D.I.C.0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g2002 Oct., v. 36, no. pt.2 p.133-140x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02359naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245012800122300001400250520132600264650001601590650002101606650001501627650001301642650002001655650001601675650001201691650001501703650001201718650002101730650000701751650002301758700001501781700001401796773009701810852000901907930003301916945001301949946001101962655001201973IND2203503120221119080720.0000331e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220350312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, J.10aPurification and biochemical characteristics of beta-D-glucosidase from a thermophilic fungus, Thermomyces lanuginosus-SSBP  ap. 81-87.  aThe beta-D-glucosidase produced by Thermomyces lanuginosus-SSBP was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme consisted of two identical subunits with a native molecular mass of 200 kDa. The purified beta-D-glucosidase only hydrolysed the glucoside substrates containing a terminal, non-reducing beta-D-glucose residue and was active on both aryl-beta-glucoside and cellobiose. This enzyme also exhibited less, but significant alpha-D-glucosidase activity and was capable of hydrolysing beta-1,6-linked diglucosides and gentiobiose. The Km(app), V(max) and k(cat) values for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside were calculated to be 0.075 mM, 12.12 units/mg of protein and 44.44 glucose molecules released/s respectively. The beta-D-glucosidase retained its full activity after a 30 min incubation at 50 degrees C but was inactive after the same treatment at 70 degrees C. The enzyme appeared to be stable when the pH of the storage buffer was above 5.0. Maximal beta-D-glucosidase activity occurred at 65 degrees C and pH 6.0. This enzyme was competitively inhibited by glucose, cellobiose and salicin with K(i) values of 0.55, 0.52 and 0.81 mM respectively. The presence of Hg(2+) and N-bromosuccinimide inhibited the enzyme activity completely at 2 mM, while cysteine enhanced beta-D-glucosidase activity. 3aThermomyces 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellobiose 3acysteine 3aenzyme activity 3agentiobiose 3aglucose 3aglucosides 3amercury 3amolecular weight 3apH 3athermophilic fungi1 aPillay, B.1 aSingh, S.0 tBiotechnology and applied biochemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 30, no. pt.1 p.81-87x0885-45137nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03849naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245020500184300001600389520163400405650003502039650002102074650001002095650001502105650001102120650001202131650002602143650001002169650001502179650000902194650001402203650001302217650002102230650000902251650002902260650001202289650001202301650004002313650003302353650003602386650002202422650001102444650002302455650002202478650003102500650005302531650000902584650002102593650000902614650003202623650001702655653002502672653002502697700001802722700002002740700001802760700001902778700001702797700001902814700002302833773013302856852000902989856008502998930003303083946001103116655001203127IND4393770920221119080746.0070805e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377092DNAL7 a166098402pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0414-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiles, Dale R. 10aValidation and use of three complementary analytical methods (LC-FLS, LC-MS/MS and ICP-MS) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and stability of motexafin gadolinium in plasma and tissues  ap. 345-356.  aLiquid chromatography-fluorescence (LC-FLS), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods were developed and validated for the evaluation of motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin) pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in plasma and tissues. The LC-FLS method exhibited the greatest sensitivity (0.0057 μg mL-¹), and was used for pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, and protein binding studies with small sample sizes or low MGd concentrations. The LC-MS/MS method, which exhibited a short run time and excellent selectivity, was used for routine clinical plasma sample analysis. The ICP-MS method, which measured total Gd, was used in conjunction with LC methods to assess MGd stability in plasma. All three methods were validated using human plasma. The LC-FLS method was also validated using plasma, liver and kidneys from mice and rats. All three methods were shown to be accurate, precise and robust for each matrix validated. For three mice, the mean (standard deviation) concentration of MGd in plasma/tissues taken 5 hr after dosing with 23 mg kg-¹ MGd was determined by LC-FLS as follows: plasma (0.025±0.002 μg mL-¹), liver (2.89±0.45 μg g-¹), and kidney (6.09±1.05 μg g-¹). Plasma samples from a subset of patients with brain metastases from extracranial tumors were analyzed using both LC-MS/MS and ICP-MS methods. For a representative patient, >=90% of the total Gd in plasma was accounted for as MGd over the first hour post dosing. By 24 hr post dosing, 63% of total Gd was accounted for as MGd, indicating some metabolism of MGd. 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abinding proteins 3abrain 3agadolinium 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissues 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aChemistry, Clinicalxmethods 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aDrug Interactions 2aHumans 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMetalloporphyrinsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aMice 2aModels, Chemical 2aRats 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aMotexafin gadolinium 0aBioanalytical method1 aMesfin, Mimi 1 aMody, Tarak D. 1 aStiles, Mark 1 aPwu, Jean Lee.1 aFiene, John 1 aDenis, Bernie 1 aBoswell, Garry W. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 May, v. 385, no. 2 p.345-356dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0414-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02109naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245010400168300001400272500001500286520099000301650002201291650001201313650002401325650002101349650002101370650001201391650002001403651001301423653001601436653001301452700001501465773008101480852000901561856009401570930003301664945001301697946001301710655001201723IND2164192020221119080722.0980921e199812  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216419202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00862.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSachs, B.10aDeveloping community partnerships to enhance care for rural families with low birth weight children  ap. 51-58.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper describes one strategy, a participatory conference, for building partnerships among health professionals who provide care for rural families living in eastern Kentucky with low birth weight children. The long-term goals are to improve coordination and to supplement care for these children and their families. A two-round Delphi technique was used prior to the conference--Rural Low Birth Weight Children and Their Families: Visions for the Future--for providers, families, and policy-makers to identify the major health needs and concerns of these families. At the conference, speakers presented data and examples of successful interventions used in other rural areas. In small groups, conference participants explored barriers to care and strategies to overcome them. They also made recommendations to improve service delivery. Based on conference ideas, a support program for families with low birth weight children is being implemented and evaluated in one rural county. 3arural communities 3aparents 3ahealth care workers 3aneeds assessment 3alow birth weight 3ainfants 3ahealth services 3aKentucky 0aconferences 0afamilies1 aHall, L.A.0 tJournal of rural health.g1998 Winter, v. 14, no. 1 p.51-58x0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.1998.tb00862.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02594naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002300173245005300196300001600249500001500265520069900280650000900979650001500988650002201003650001901025650006301044650009801107650001801205650002401223650010901247650001801356650002701374650003401401650005801435650002001493650009801513651001801611653001801629653002401647653003701671653002301708653001401731653002001745700001401765700001601779773008301795852000901878856009401887930003301981945001302014946001302027655001202040IND2123313620221119080931.0980611e199706  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212331362DNAL7 a101746152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.1997.tb00848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristianson, J.B.10aHMO financial arrangements with rural physicians  ap. 240-252.  a2019-12-04  aThe growth of managed care in general suggests that a substantially larger number of rural primary cam physicians will be asked to enter into risk-bearing contracts with Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in the near future.

However, some of these efforts have been limited by product toxicity to host cells, product proteolysis, low expression levels, poor recovery yields, and sometimes an absence of posttranslational modifications required for biological activity. For the present work, we investigated the use of the baculoviral polyhedrin (Polh) protein as a novel fusion partner for the production of a model AMP (halocidin 18-amino-acid subunit; Hal18) in Escherichia coli. The useful solubility properties of Polh as a fusion partner facilitated the expression of the Polh-Hal18 fusion protein ([approximately]33.6 kDa) by forming insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli which could easily be purified by inclusion body isolation and affinity purification using the fused hexahistidine tag. The recombinant Hal18 AMP ([approximately]2 kDa) could then be cleaved with hydroxylamine from the fusion protein and easily recovered by simple dialysis and centrifugation. This was facilitated by the fact that Polh was soluble during the alkaline cleavage reaction but became insoluble during dialysis at a neutral pH. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was used to further purify the separated recombinant Hal18, giving a final yield of 30% with >90% purity. Importantly, recombinant and synthetic Hal18 peptides showed nearly identical antimicrobial activities against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which were used as representative gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These results demonstrate that baculoviral Polh can provide an efficient and facile platform for the production or functional study of target AMPs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acentrifugation 3adialysis 3ainclusion bodies 3apH 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolubility 3asynthetic peptides 3atoxicity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Engineeringxmethods 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aViral Structural Proteins1 aKim, Young-Soo.1 aSeo, Jeong Hyun1 aJang, Woong Sik1 aLee, In Hee1 aCha, Hyung Joon0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 , v. 71, no. 9 p.5038-5043dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.9.5038-5043.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03352naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100002900156245013800185300001800323500002400341520130900365650001701674650001901691650001401710650002401724650001301748650001501761650002601776650002201802650001501824650001701839650002301856650002801879650002001907650004701927650001201974650002301986650002802009650004702037650004302084650002102127650004102148650001102189650001802200650002502218650002102243650001102264650001602275650001402291650004702305650003902352700002302391700001702414700001802431700001602449773012102465852000902586930003302595945002502628946001302653655001202666IND4398006720221119074001.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800672DNAL7 a180247352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL8401 aRodriguez-Sallaberry, C.10aPlasma Prostaglandin and Cytokine Concentrations in Periparturient Holstein Cows Fed Diets Enriched in Saturated or Trans Fatty Acids  ap. 5446-5452.  aIncludes references  aAfter parturition, immune functions such as lymphocyte response to mitogens and production of antibodies are depressed in dairy cows. Dietary regimens that improve the immune function of dairy cows after calving may improve uterine health and lead to earlier breeding after parturition. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of feeding a calcium salt of trans isomers of fatty acids (tFA) to periparturient Holstein cows on plasma biomarkers of inflammation. Dietary treatments were initiated approximately 28 d before expected calving date and continued through d 21 postpartum. Prepartum and postpartum diets were formulated to be isolipidic, containing 1.5% saturated fats (n = 15) or 1.8% tFA (n = 15). Multiparous cows were heavier at calving (+32%) and produced more milk (+17%) than primiparous cows. Periparturient tFA supplementation increased plasma PGF₂α metabolite concentration in multiparous cows, but not in primiparous cows. Concentrations of prostaglandin E₂, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4 in plasma did not differ between diets and parities. Results raise the possibility that peripartum tFA supplementation may affect uterine health and reproductive efficiency of early lactation dairy cows through alteration of peripheral PGF₂α concentration. 3ablood plasma 3aprostaglandins 3acytokines 3apostpartum interval 3aHolstein 3adairy cows 3asaturated fatty acids 3atrans fatty acids 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3aexperimental diets 3areproductive efficiency 3aearly lactation 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCalcium Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aCattlexbloodximmunologyxphysiology. 2aDinoprostxblood 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aHealth Status 2aInterleukin-4xblood 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aParity 2aParturition 2aPregnancy 2aTrans Fatty Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood1 aCaldari-Torres, C.1 aCollante, W.1 aStaples, C.R.1 aBadinga, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5446-5452dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle03933naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100002100184245010400205300001800309500002400327500001500351520182700366650002702193650001402220650002602234650001502260650000902275650001802284650001902302650001202321650002702333650001202360650002602372650004702398650004002445650001102485650004902496650005802545650000902603650005102612650004002663653002902703653002202732653002102754653003102775653002702806653001802833653002402851653002102875653002302896700001802919700001602937700001902953700001402972773009702986852000903083856009603092930003303188945002503221946001303246655001203259IND4398070720221119073912.0071119e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439807072DNAL7 a179206722pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aManjunatha, B.M.10aSelection of developmentally competent buffalo oocytes by brilliant cresyl blue staining before IVM  ap. 1299-1304.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) test determines the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH); the activity of this enzyme is greatest in growing oocytes, but it declines as oocytes mature. The objective was to develop and evaluate this test for assessing development of buffalo oocytes (to select developmentally competent oocytes for increased in vitro embryo production). Oocytes were exposed to BCB stain diluted in mDPBS (DPBS with 0.4% BSA) for 90 min at 38.5 °C in a humidified air atmosphere; those with or without blue coloration of the cytoplasm were designated as BCB+ and BCB-, respectively. In Experiment 1, oocytes were exposed to 13, 26, or 39 μM BCB. There were fewer BCB+ oocytes after exposure to 13 μM BCB (10%) than after exposure to 26 or 39 μM BCB (57.2 and 61.8%; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference among treatments for blastocyst production rate. In Experiment 2, the diameter of BCB+ oocytes (144.4 ± 4.2 μm; mean ± S.E.M.) was higher (P < 0.05) than that of BCB- oocytes (136.8 ± 4.6 μm). In Experiment 3, oocytes were allocated into three groups: control (immediately cultured); holding-control (kept in mDPBS for 90 min before cultured); and treatment-incubation (incubated with 26 μM BCB). After IVM, oocytes were fertilized in vitro and cultured on an oviductal monolayer. The nuclear maturation rate was higher (P < 0.05) in BCB+ (86.2%), control (83.4%) and holding-control (82.6%) oocytes than BCB- (59.2%) oocytes. The BCB+ oocytes yielded more blastocysts than control or holding-control oocytes (33.4, 20.2, and 21.0%, P < 0.05); blastocyst development was lowest in BCB- oocytes (5.2%). In conclusion, staining of buffalo oocytes with BCB before IVM may be used to select developmentally competent oocytes for increased in vitro embryo production. 3achemical concentration 3abuffaloes 3adifferential staining 3ablastocyst 3adyes 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3aoocytes 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxphysiology 2aColoring Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxmethodsxveterinary. 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOocytesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aOxazinesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0adevelopmental competence 0aoocyte maturation 0ain vitro culture 0ain vitro embryo production 0agrowth and development 0aoocyte growth 0ain vitro maturation 0aoocyte selection 0anuclear maturation1 aGupta, P.S.P.1 aDevaraj, M.1 aRavindra, J.P.1 aNandi, S.0 tTheriogenology.g2007 Dec., v. 68, no. 9 p.1299-1304dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.08.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02306naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245010300122300001800225520124900243650002001492650002601512650001401538650001101552650001501563650000901578650001001587650001501597700001401612700001501626700001401641700001701655773009501672852000901767856012201776939003301898946001301931655001201944IND4443802820221119074100.0101019e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444380282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, K.10aPrediction of Rut Depth During Military Vehicle Turning Maneuvers Using a Modified Sinkage Numeric  ap. 1019-1024.  aVehicle-induced ruts can cause severe adverse effects on soil and vegetation and reduce a vehicle's mobility potential. Vehicle turning factors including turning radius, velocity, and dynamic weight effects were integrated into the Vehicle Terrain Interaction (VTI) terrain mechanics model to predict rut formation during vehicle turning operations on yielding soils. In the modified VTI model, the resultant force on a single tire is a dynamic variable correlated with the vehicle's dynamic weight, velocity, and turning radius. Field tests using an eight-wheeled light armored vehicle (LAV) were conducted, and the results were analyzed and implemented in a modified VTI sinkage model for turning. The LAV was operated at varying velocities during spiral-pattern turn testing to obtain continuously decreasing radii rutting results. The results of the LAV field tests were analyzed with predictions from the modified VTI, and the conclusion shows that the modified model can be used to predict the influence of turning on soil rutting. Rut depths for both vehicle tracks were predicted for turning operations. Results show a tremendous improvement in prediction of rut depth using the modified VTI model, which includes the effect of turning. 3aadverse effects 3afield experimentation 3amechanics 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil 3atires 3avegetation1 aAyers, P.1 aHoward, H.1 aJones, R.1 aAnderson, A.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1019-1024wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140424  aOther US 7aarticle03374naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001500138245008800153300001800241500002400259500001500283520155200298650001801850650002701868650001601895650002301911650002101934650002401955650001301979650002301992650001202015650006302027650001002090650003702100650005502137650001102192650002002203650005202223650003602275650002002311650003202331650001002363650002402373653003102397653001602428700001602444700001902460700001802479700001702497700002302514700002202537773012102559852000902680930003302689945002502722946001302747655001202760IND4398005920221119074147.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800592DNAL7 a180247272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2011 aLinage, B.10aPerformance of Blue-Yellow Screening Test for Antimicrobial Detection in Ovine Milk  ap. 5374-5379.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDrug residues in milk are important because of public health and industrial implications. The detection limits of 25 antimicrobial agents were determined by the blue-yellow screening method in ovine milk. For each drug, 8 concentrations were tested on 20 ovine milk samples from individual ewes in midlactation. Detection limits determined by means of logistic regression were below European Union maximum residue limits (EU-MRL) for penicillin G (3 to 4 μg/kg), ceftiofur (96 to 107 μg/kg), framycetin (720 to 781 μg/kg), neomycin (915 to 1,084 μg/kg), and tylosin (44 to 51 μg/kg). Detection limits for ampicillin (5 to 6 μg/kg), cloxacillin (33 to 42 μg/kg), cefoperazone (73 to 82 μg/kg), cefalexin (160 to 202 μg/kg), gentamycin (355 to 382 μg/kg), streptomycin (3,063 to 3,593 μg/kg), tilmicosin (109 to 131 μg/kg), erythromycin (444 to 522 μg/kg), spyramicin (1,106 to 1,346 μg/kg), sulfadimethoxine (101 to 119 μg/kg), sulfathiazole (122 to 151 μg/kg), sulfamethazine (309 to 328 μg/kg), sulfanilamide (1,750 to 2,674 μg/kg), tetracycline (233 to 257 μg/kg), oxytetracycline (398 to 501 μg/kg), doxycycline (323 to 419 μg/kg), chlortetracycline (3,331 to 3,989 μg/kg), danofloxacin (4.7 to 5.5 mg/kg), enrofloxacin (41 to 46 mg/kg), and flumequin (63 to 71 mg/kg) were higher than the EU-MRL. Although the blue-yellow method showed improved sensitivity compared with other tests studied in ovine milk, the performance of screening methods for detecting antimicrobial agents in milk of this species should be improved. 3amilk analysis 3amaximum residue limits 3aantibiotics 3afood contamination 3amilk composition 3aantibiotic residues 3aewe milk 3aproduct evaluation 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aColor 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Residuesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aFemale 2aLogistic Models 2aMass Screeningxmethodsxstandardsxveterinary. 2aMaximum Allowable Concentration 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSheep 2aSpecies Specificity 0aBlue-Yellow Screening Test 0afood safety1 aGonzalo, C.1 aCarriedo, J.A.1 aAsensio, J.A.1 aBlanco, M.A.1 aDe La Fuente, L.F.1 aSan Primitivo, F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5374-5379dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013000204300002000334506007600354520130600430506003701736650001501773650002401788650001501812650002001827650001101847650002301858650001301881650001801894700002401912700002101936700002201957773017601979852000902155856008302164930003302247946001302280655001202293IND4423621720221207071652.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442362172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09011481062doi7 aPMC27154862pmcid7 a195744542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChanana, Bhavna10aReception of Slit requires only the chondroitin-sulphate-modified extracellular domain of Syndecan at the target cell surface  ap. 11984-11988.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSyndecan (Sdc) is a conserved transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) bearing additional chondroitin sulfate (CS) modifications on its extracellular domain. In vertebrates, this extracellular domain of Sdc is shed and acts as a soluble effector of cellular communication events, and its cytoplasmic domain participates in intracellular signaling needed to maintain epithelial integrity. In Drosophila, Sdc has been shown to be necessary for Slit signaling-dependent axon and myotube guidance during CNS development and muscle pattern formation. We report that Sdc acts in a cell-autonomous manner in Slit-receiving cells and that its membrane-anchored extracellular domain is sufficient to mediate Slit signaling. Sdc activity can be replaced by the human homolog hsdc2. However, the HSPG Dally-like protein (Dlp), which lacks CS modifications at its extracellular domain, can only partially substitute for Sdc function, and its activity is not restricted to the Slit target cells. Our results suggest that Sdc and Dlp act in a cooperative but nonredundant fashion in axon and myotube guidance. We propose that Dlp, which lacks CS modifications, participates in the transfer of Slit from its site of expression to the target cells, where CS-modified Sdc concentrates and presents the ligand.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3achondroitin sulfate 3aepithelium 3aheparan sulfate 3ahumans 3amuscle development 3amyotubes 3aproteoglycans1 aSteigemann, Patrick1 aJäckle, Herbert1 aVorbrüggen, Gerd0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 21, v. 106, no. 29 p.11984-11988dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09011481063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02600naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002500164245012600189300001200315500002400327500002300351500001500374520126000389650002501649650003401674650001701708650001101725650001301736650002201749650001801771650002201789650001701811653001901828700002601847700001801873773009901891852000901990856008601999930003302085945002502118946001102143655001202154IND4422592220221119074120.0090630e20090129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442259222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2008.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK0011 aLeuschner, Christoph10aFunctional role of forest diversity: Pros and cons of synthetic stands and across-site comparisons in established forests  ap. 1-9.  aIncludes references  aSummary in German.  a2019-12-06  aIn contrast to grasslands, forests have only rarely been the subject of functional biodiversity research. This paper addresses specific problems, which arise from applying the synthetic stand approach to long-lived plants, which can be taken to simulate the loss or addition of tree species or tree functional groups in forest stands. Planted synthetic stands often deviate from natural forests in several properties including trophic structure, tree age distribution, and horizontal and vertical canopy structures. Moreover, edge effects and the absence of a quasi-steady state in soil development limit the spectrum of processes which can be analysed for biodiversity effects in synthetic tree stands. We propose that these shortcomings can partly be overcome by combining the synthetic stand approach with observational studies in existing forest stands of contrasting tree diversity. The potentials and limitations of comparisons among existing stands for functional biodiversity research are briefly discussed using the example of the Hainich Tree Diversity Matrix, a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest consisting of a small-scale mosaic of stands differing in tree diversity, which originated from a variety of historic forest-use practices. 3afunctional diversity 3abroadleaved evergreen forests 3aforest trees 3acanopy 3atree age 3atemperate forests 3aforest stands 3aspecies diversity 3aforest soils 0aforest ecology1 aJungkunst, Hermann F.1 aFleck, Stefan0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2009 Jan. 29, v. 10, no. 1 p.1-9dUrban & Fischerx1439-17917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090727b20090801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02204naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245009300199300002000292506007600312520080000388506003701188650001401225650001901239650001901258650002501277650002001302650001301322650002401335700001901359700002301378700002301401700002101424700002301445773017601468852000901644856008301653930003301736946001301769655001201782IND4423621620221207071653.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442362162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09006081062doi7 aPMC27072712pmcid7 a195872392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, David10aMAP4K3 modulates cell death via the post-transcriptional regulation of BH3-only proteins  ap. 11978-11983.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntracellular signal transduction networks involving protein kinases are important modulators of cell survival and cell death in multicellular organisms. Functional compromise of these networks has been linked to aberrant apoptosis in diseases such as cancer. To identify novel kinase regulators of cell death, we conducted an RNAi-based screen to identify modulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Using this approach, we identified MAP4K3 as a novel apoptosis inducer. Here, we present evidence that this pro-apoptotic kinase orchestrates activation of BAX via the concerted posttranscriptional modulation of PUMA, BAD, and BIM. Additionally, we found decreased levels of this kinase in pancreatic cancer samples, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for MAP4K3 in pancreatic tumorigenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell viability 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aprotein kinases 3aproteins 3asignal transduction1 aDickens, David1 aReid, Elizabeth B.1 aLoh, Samantha H.Y.1 aMoisoi, Nicoleta1 aMartins, L.

Italica Group) is an important indicator of quality deterioration and occurs with chlorophyll (Chl) degradation. Postharvest ethanol vapor treatment could delay the yellowing of broccoli florets, through the suppression of Chl degradation. As the first step in identifying the mechanism of this delay, the effects of postharvest ethanol vapor treatment on activities and gene expression of the Chl catabolic enzymes in broccoli were determined. Broccoli branchlets were placed in a perforated polyethylene bag with or without (control) an ethanol pad and stored at 20°C in darkness. The Chl contents of the control broccoli florets decreased remarkably after three days in storage, whereas the contents of the ethanol-treated broccoli showed no significant changes except at day one. Changes in chlorophyllase activity in the ethanol-treated broccoli were similar to those of the control until three days in storage, but then the activity tended to decease. Mg-dechelatase and Chl-degrading peroxidase activities, which increased greatly with senescence in the controls, remained unchanged in the ethanol-treated broccoli. BoCLH1 expression showed changes almost similar to those of chlorophyllase activity. BoPAO expression in the control broccoli increased greatly at day one in storage and was maintained at a high level until three days. In contrast, this expression in ethanol-treated broccoli was suppressed until two days. BoRCCR expression in the control broccoli increased until two days in storage, while the expression in the ethanol-treated broccoli showed no change during storage. These results show that postharvest ethanol vapor treatment suppressed the activities and gene expression of Chl catabolic enzymes, resulting in delayed yellowing of broccoli florets. 3atemporal variation 3abroccoli 3afood quality 3astorage time 3agene expression 3aperoxidases 3apostharvest injuries 3apostharvest physiology 3afood composition 3aenzyme activity 3achlorophyll 3aethanol 3achemical treatment 3achlorophyllase 0asenescence1 aSuzuki, Yasuo1 aTerai, Hirofumi1 aYamauchi, Naoki0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2010 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.97-102dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2009.08.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle04090naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100002000156245007400176300001800250500002400268520248900292650001102781650001302792650000902805650001602814650002302830650001502853650001502868650002202883650004702905650001202952650002302964650002802987650004503015650003303060650001103093650005003104650004103154650003203195650002303227650002003250650003203270650001703302700001603319773012103335852000903456930003303465945002503498946001303523655001203536IND4398006120221119074042.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800612DNAL7 a180247292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE100 0aL500 0aQ5011 aSt-Pierre, N.R.12aA Model to Determine the Optimal Sampling Schedule of Diet Components  ap. 5383-5394.  aIncludes references  aVarious recommendations have been issued regarding the sampling schedule of diet components, especially forages. Their basis is unclear and none are justified from an economic standpoint. The objective of this research was to derive a general method for determining the optimal sampling design for forages. The process of forage removal from storage can be conceptualized as a quality control issue that can be monitored using a Shewhart X-bar chart. This procedure requires 3 control parameters: number of samples (n), sampling interval (h), and control limits (L). A quality cost function made of 4 parts is proposed: cost per cycle while the process is in-control (I); cost per cycle while the process is out-of-control (O); cost per cycle for sampling and analyses (A); and expected duration of a cycle (D). Thirteen inputs enter the cost function: the mean time that process is in control, the number of animals in the herd, the unit price of milk, the milk production loss due to white noise, the milk production loss from an abrupt change in forage composition, the time to sample and analyze one item, the expected time to discover the assignable cause, the expected time to fix the diet, the cost per false alarm, the cost to fix the diet, the fixed cost of sampling at each sampling time, the cost for each unit sampled, and the number of standard deviation slips when forage changes. The total quality cost per day C = (I + O + A)/D. The C function can be optimized with respect to n, h, and L to yield an optimal sampling schedule. Because n and h are discrete variables in a highly nonlinear function, parametric optimization algorithms cannot be used to optimize the function. A genetic algorithm was used for the minimization of C. Results showed that the optimal sampling designs are close to current practices in small herds of 50 cows, but very different in large herds of 1,000 cows, resulting in reduced total quality costs of $250/d. Total sensitivity of C was greatest for the number of cows in the herd, the shift in milk production when forage changes, the mean time that the process is in control, the price of milk, and the time to sample and analyze one item. Total sensitivities of n, h, and L were greatest for the mean time that the process is in control, the extent of the change in composition when there is a change in forage composition, the number of cows in the herd, the shift in milk production when forage changes, and the cost per unit sampled. 3amodels 3asampling 3adiet 3acow feeding 3aforage composition 3adairy cows 3amilk yield 3aeconomic analysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethodsxstandards. 2aDietxstandardsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFood Analysisxeconomicsxmethodsxstandards. 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxeconomicsxstandards. 2aPopulation Density 2aQuality Control 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors1 aCobanov, B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5383-5394dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle02348naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245004900209300002000258506007600278520094600354506003701300650001301337650001801350650001601368650001601384650001601400650001501416650002601431650001901457650001101476650001801487650001501505650002001520700002601540700002201566773017601588852000901764856008301773930003301856946001301889655001201902IND4423621520221207071656.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442362152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09016411062doi7 aPMC27155332pmcid7 a195744602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNambiar, Rajalakshmi10aControl of cell membrane tension by myosin-I  ap. 11972-11977.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAll cell functions that involve membrane deformation or a change in cell shape (e.g., endocytosis, exocytosis, cell motility, and cytokinesis) are regulated by membrane tension. While molecular contacts between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton are known to make significant contributions to membrane tension, little is known about the molecules that mediate these interactions. We used an optical trap to directly probe the molecular determinants of membrane tension in isolated organelles and in living cells. Here, we show that class I myosins, a family of membrane-binding, actin-based motor proteins, mediate membrane/cytoskeleton adhesion and thus, make major contributions to membrane tension. These studies show that class I myosins directly control the mechanical properties of the cell membrane; they also position these motor proteins as master regulators of cellular events involving membrane deformation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3acell movement 3acytokinesis 3adeformation 3aendocytosis 3aexocytosis 3amechanical properties 3amicrofilaments 3amyosin 3aoptical traps 3aorganelles 3aplasma membrane1 aMcConnell, Russell E.1 aTyska, Matthew J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 21, v. 106, no. 29 p.11972-11977dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09016411063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03314naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002100138245011500159300001800274500002400292500001500316520152600331650001001857650002401867650001301891650002301904650001101927650000701938650001701945650001001962650001201972650004001984650001102024650004302035650002202078650002102100650003102121650006102152650003802213650000902251650003102260650002202291650001702313650004202330650001202372653002702384653001902411700001702430700002002447700001502467700001702482773012102499852000902620930003302629945002502662946001302687655001202700IND4398007820221119074113.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800782DNAL7 a180247462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aEmmanuel, D.G.V.10aAcidosis and Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli B:055 Cause Hyperpermeability of Rumen and Colon Tissues  ap. 5552-5557.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of acidic pH of the perfusate and presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on permeability of rumen and colon mucosal tissues to mannitol and LPS using the Ussing chamber system. Rumen and colon tissues (n = 8), obtained from slaughtered feedlot steers, were tested for changes in permeability to ³H-mannitol under pH of 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 for rumen and at 5.5, 6.5, and 7.4 for colon, with or without LPS from Escherichia coli B:055 at 500 μg/mL. The ³H-Mannitol was added at 10 μL (525.4 GBq/mmol) on the mucosal side of the Ussing chamber to detect changes in permeability, and 4 samples were taken at 20, 25, 30, and 35 min from the serosal side. Permeability of rumen and colon mucosa to ³H-mannitol increased 6- and 5-fold, respectively, at acidic pH values of 4.5 and 5.5 and in the presence of 500 μ/mL of LPS. In contrast, LPS did not affect rumen and colon permeability at pH that ranged from 5.5 and 7.4. Translocation of LPS across the rumen and colon mucosa of cattle was not pH dependent. The LPS translocated through these tissues if present at the mucosal side. In conclusion, the permeability of rumen and colon tissues to ³H-mannitol increased in presence of LPS and under acidic pH, whereas LPS permeated through mucosal tissues independently of the pH of the perfusate. Further research is warranted to understand the mechanism(s) by which acidic pH of the rumen digesta and presence of LPS make rumen and colon tissues "leaky". 3arumen 3alipopolysaccharides 3aacidosis 3aEscherichia coli B 3amucosa 3apH 3apermeability 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Translocationxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCell Membrane Permeabilityxphysiology 2aColonxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMannitolxpharmacokinetics 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aTritium 0aEscherichia coli B:055 0aanimal tissues1 aMadsen, K.L.1 aChurchill, T.A.1 aDunn, S.M.1 aAmetaj, B.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5552-5557dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle03092naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245015400159300001600313520188300329650002402212653004102236653002402277653001402301653001202315653001902327700001602346700001702362700002402379700001902403700002602422773014402448852000902592856008502601930003302686946001102719655001202730IND4447468620221119074018.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444746862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00432-010-0877-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHori, S. 10aOutcomes and predictive factors for biochemical relapse following primary androgen deprivation therapy in men with bone scan negative prostate cancer  ap. 235-241.  aPurpose Primary androgen deprivation therapy (PADT) is an important treatment modality for men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer and without bone metastasis. There is, however, a lack of data on the biochemical relapse (BR) outcomes in these patients. Here, we studied the outcome of a contemporary series of men treated by PADT and investigated predictive risk factors for BR. Methods One hundred and fifty-five patients treated by PADT formed the initial study cohort, and BR outcomes in this group were reviewed. The outcomes of men with bone scan negative disease were specifically analysed. The predictive value of a panel of clinical risk factors for BR was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. The results were further validated in a separate cohort of patients without bone metastasis from a second institution (n = 84). Results Median follow-up was 70 months. In the first study cohort, 109/155 men (70%) had bone scan negative disease. In these patients, only 45% developed BR during the follow-up period with only 28% relapsing within 5 years of initiating PADT. Key-independent factors predicting BR were a high PSA nadir (p = 0.001) and a shorter time to nadir (p < 0.001). A nadir of ≤0.1 ng/ml and time to nadir of >24 months specifically identified men with a very good outcome from PADT. In a second-independent cohort, very similar overall and 5-year BR rates were observed in men without bone metastasis (39 and 35%, respectively). PSA nadir thresholds identified in the first cohort were again able to define a good prognostic group in this re-test cohort (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion Men treated by PADT and without bone metastasis can have very durable responses to PADT with the majority remaining BR free at 5 years. PSA nadir and time to nadir are key predictors of a good outcome in this group. 3aprostatic neoplasms 0aPrimary androgen deprivation therapy 0aBiochemical relapse 0aPSA nadir 0aOutcome 0aNon-metastatic1 aJabbar, T. 1 aKachroo, N. 1 aVasconcelos, J.

Twelve lactating multiparous Holstein cows were randomly selected and blocked into 3 groups of 4 cows intended to represent early [123 ± 26 d in milk (DIM); mean ± standard deviation], mid (175 ± 3 DIM), and late (221 ± 12 DIM) lactation stages. Cows within each stage of lactation were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence within a split-plot Latin square balanced for carryover effects. Stage of lactation formed the main plots (squares) and dietary CP levels (15, 17, 19, and 21% of diet dry matter) formed the subplots. Graded amounts of urea were added to the basal total mixed ration to linearly increase dietary CP content while maintaining similar concentrations of all other nutrients among treatments. The experimental periods lasted 7 d, with d 1 to 6 used for adjustment to diets and d 7 used for total collection of urine as well as milk and blood sample collection. Dry matter intake and yields of milk, fat, protein, and lactose declined progressively with lactation stage and were unaffected by dietary CP content. Milk and plasma urea-N as well as UUN concentration and excretion increased in response to dietary CP content. Milk and urine urea-N concentration rose at increasing and decreasing rates, respectively, as a function of plasma urea-N. The renal urea-N clearance rate differed among lactation stages and dietary CP contents. The relationship between UUN excretion and MUN differed among lactation stages and diverged from linearity for cows in early and late lactation. However, these differences were restricted to very high MUN concentrations. Milk urea N may be a useful tool to predict the UUN excretion and ultimately NH₃ emission from dairy cattle manure. 3adairy cows 3aammonia 3amilk analysis 3alactation stage 3aurine 3adietary protein 3amilk composition 3adairy manure 3acrude protein 3amilk 3aHolstein 3aemissions 3aurea nitrogen 3aexcretion 3aprediction 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aLactationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aManurexanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 2aUreaxanalysis 2aUrinexchemistry 0adairy cattle1 aFadel, J.G.1 aDePeters, E.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5499-5508dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle02926naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151100002000160245014400180300001600324500002400340520155300364650001801917650001101935650001101946650001401957650002601971650002101997650001502018650001402033650001502047650002502062650002502087650002302112653003702135700002102172700002302193773011102216852000902327856007502336930003302411945002502444946001102469655001202480IND4382320120221119074107.0060727e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438232012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2004.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aLiakopoulos, G.10aTrichome layers versus dehaired lamina of Olea europaea leaves: differences in flavonoid distribution, UV-absorbing capacity, and wax yield  ap. 294-304.  aIncludes references  aLeaf flavonoid compounds from six olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars were analysed by HPLC. The composition of the soluble fractions of the dehaired lamina and the isolated trichome layers of the abaxial leaf surface were analysed in separate, as to study the distribution of flavonoids between the two leaf parts. Quercetin and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside that have been reported to occur in the leaves seem to be located exclusively in the trichome layer. A greater variety of flavonoids was found in the lamina but the trichome layer was richer in terms of total flavonoids per unit mass. Trichome layer demonstrated an independent chemical character since its flavonoid concentration and composition was not coordinated with that of the lamina. The occurrence of flavonoid compounds in trichomes is related to the UV-filtering capacity of these cells. The results of the present study showed that apart from the soluble fraction, the cuticular waxes and cell walls of the trichomes also showed significant UV-absorbing capacity, indicating the occurrence of UV-absorbing compounds in these fractions as well. Moreover, the cuticular waxes of the trichome layer exhibited not only a higher investment of mass per unit of leaf area, but also a higher UV-absorbing capacity expressed per unit mass as compared to the cuticular waxes of the lamina surface. The importance for the separate chemical investigation of the phenolic composition of the leaf lamina and the trichome layers as well as the ecological significance of the findings is discussed. 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 3aleaves 3atrichomes 3aultraviolet radiation 3aepicuticular wax 3aflavonoids 3acultivars 3acell walls 3acell wall components 3aradiation resistance 3aphenolic compounds 0aultraviolet radiation absorption1 aStavrianakou, S.1 aKarabourniotis, G.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 55, no. 3 p.294-304dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2004.11.0083electronic resource  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03753naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001600156245009500172300001800267500002400285520194600309650002502255650001102280650002202291650001302313650001202326650001602338650002302354650002302377650002302400650002402423650005902447650001202506650004602518650001302564650002102577650001402598650003702612650003802649650001102687650001702698650003102715650002502746650002202771650001102793650001602804650001302820653002602833700001702859700001802876700002002894773012102914852000903035930003303044945002503077946001303102655001203115IND4398008220221119074124.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800822DNAL7 a180247502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR3001 aMoody, M.L.10aNutrient Utilization of Differing Forage-to-Concentrate Ratios by Growing Holstein Heifers  ap. 5580-5586.  aIncludes references  aTraditionally, high-forage, low-concentrate diets fed ad libitum have been the primary system of feeding dairy heifers. However, high-concentrate diets can be fed at restricted intakes to reach desired rates of gain and increase nutrient efficiency. A total mixed ration containing high corn silage (CS; HCS: 77% CS, 23% concentrate) or low CS (LCS: 67% concentrate, 33% CS) was fed at restricted intakes in 2 trials to evaluate nutrient utilization by growing heifers. In the first trial, 4 ruminally cannulated heifers (298 ± 16 kg of body weight) were fed to study differences in rumen pH, volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and mass of rumen contents. In situ determinations were made on the total mixed ration and CS. Low CS rations were digested more rapidly in situ when compared with HCS (4.5 vs. 2.3 ± 0.3%/h), and no differences were observed in CS digestibility when incubated in the rumen of heifers fed either ration. Mean rumen pH tended to be lower for LCS than for HCS (5.9 vs. 6.2 ± 0.1). Individual and total rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations and rumen ammonia concentration were not different between treatments. Total mass of rumen contents was lower for LCS. In the second trial, four 6-mo-old heifers (172 ± 14 kg of body weight) and four 12-mo-old heifers (337 ± 10 kg of body weight) were used. Digestibility of dry matter was greater for the LCS than the HCS diet in both age groups (76.3 vs. 71.1% for 12-mo-old heifers; 71.4 vs. 68.9% for 6-mo-old heifers). Apparent digestibility of N was not different between treatments; however, retained N was higher for the LCS diets for both age groups. Fecal output was significantly reduced in the LCS diets for both age groups. Feeding low-forage, high-concentrate diets to growing dairy heifers at restricted intakes, although more highly digestible, resulted in few significant differences in rumen fermentation patterns and lower fecal output. 3anutrient utilization 3aforage 3afeed concentrates 3aHolstein 3aheifers 3acow feeding 3aad libitum feeding 3aruminant nutrition 3arumen fermentation 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDairying 2aDietxveterinary 2aDigestion 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSilage 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays 0afeed sorting behavior1 aZanton, G.I.1 aDaubert, J.M.1 aHeinrichs, A.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5580-5586dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle04617naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001500156245013700171300001800308500002400326500001500350520216600365650001502531650001602546650002302562650002202585650001702607650001902624650001102643650001402654650001402668650001302682650002302695650001602718650002302734650002002757650001302777650001502790650001502805650006002820650001602880650004702896650001202943650003702955650003602992650002803028650001103056650003103067650003103098650002603129650003203155650005303187650002503240650005903265650005503324650002203379650003703401650005303438653001403491653002003505700001703525700001703542700001703559700001303576700002103589773012103610852000903731930003303740945002503773946001303798655001203811IND4398009120221119073857.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800912DNAL7 a180247592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL8001 aYang, W.Z.10aEffects of Garlic and Juniper Berry Essential Oils on Ruminal Fermentation and on the Site and Extent of Digestion in Lactating Cows  ap. 5671-5681.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding essential oils from garlic (GAR) and juniper berry (JUN), or monensin (MO) on feed intake, ruminal fermentation, the site and extent of digestion, microbial protein synthesis, milk production, and immune status in dairy cows. Four midlactating Holstein cows fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods and 4 treatments: control (no additive), MO (330 mg/cow per d), GAR (5 g/cow per d), and JUN (2 g/cow per d). Cows were fed ad libitum a TMR consisting of 40% forage and 60% barley-based concentrate. Dry matter intake averaged 20.4 kg/d and was not affected by dietary additives. Total tract digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, fiber, and starch were not affected by experimental treatments. However, ruminal digestibilities of dry matter and organic matter were higher (+13%) for GAR and JUN than for the control diet, mainly because of increased crude protein digestion in the rumen. Feeding GAR and JUN increased ruminal digestion of dietary protein by 11% as compared with the control. In contrast, ruminal digestion of dietary protein was reduced by 11% with MO as compared with the control. Milk fat content was lower for MO (2.68%) than for the GAR (3.46%), JUN (3.40%), and control (3.14%) diets. No effects of GAR, JUN, or MO were observed on milk production, ruminal microbial protein synthesis, ruminal pH, and ruminal concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ammonia N. The total and differential numbers of white blood cells as well as serum amyloid A and haptoglobin were not affected by the treatments, suggesting that additives had no effect on the immune status of cows. Results of this study indicate that supplementing dairy cows with GAR (5 g/d) and JUN (2 g/d) essential oils improved feed digestibility in the rumen, but possibly at the expense of a reduction in the flow of bypass protein to the small intestine. Feeding monensin could be beneficial in terms of increasing bypass protein from the rumen but did not improve feed digestion or milk production under the current experimental conditions. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aruminant nutrition 3aprotein synthesis 3asmall fruits 3aessential oils 3agarlic 3alactation 3aJuniperus 3aHolstein 3arumen fermentation 3afeed intake 3amicrobial proteins 3aimmune response 3amonensin 3aseed cones 3amilk yield 2aAllyl Compoundsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aMonensinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOils, Volatilexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSulfidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0adigestion 0ajuniper berries1 aBenchaar, C.1 aAmetaj, B.N.1 aChaves, A.V.1 aHe, M.L.1 aMcAllister, T.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5671-5681dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle04353naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001400156245013600170300001800306500002400324500001500348520232100363650001502684650001602699650001602715650001902731650001202750650002302762650002102785650001402806650000902820650001802829650001102847650002202858650001502880650003802895650004702933650001202980650004002992650002303032650002303055650001103078650001803089650003403107650002603141650003203167650002003199650003303219650001103252650002303263653001103286653001603297653002303313700001403336700001303350700001403363700001403377700001303391700001403404773012103418852000903539930003303548945002503581946001303606655001203619IND4398009520221119073849.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439800952DNAL7 a180247632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aR100 0aL1001 aFaust, M.10aPerformance of Lactating Dairy Cows Fed Silage and Grain from a Maize Hybrid with the cry1F Trait Versus its Nonbiotech Counterpart  ap. 5706-5713.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffects of feeding grain and maize silage from a non-Bt maize and a variety of Bt maize that contains cry1F (event TC1507, event DAS-Ø15Ø7-1), a gene that provides maize with insect resistance, on the health and performance of dairy cows were evaluated. In a crossover trial, 20 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to each of 2 dietary treatment groups and fed diets containing whole-plant maize silage plus maize grain from TC1507 or its near-isoline counterpart (control). Each period of the crossover trial lasted 28 d and was preceded by a 7-d adjustment period. To minimize variability due to stage of lactation, 2 blocks of 10 cows at 90 to 130 d of lactation at the start of the trial were used. Within each dietary treatment, 10 cows were from each of 2 genetic selection lines (high and average fat plus protein predicted transmitting ability). Diets were formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Dry matter intake and daily production of milk, fat, protein, lactose, nonfat solids, and total solids did not differ between cows fed the TC1507 diet and cows fed the control diet. Furthermore, milk from cows in different dietary treatment groups did not differ in milk urea nitrogen concentration or somatic cell count. For milk fat percentage, a significant dietary treatment by genetic group interaction was detected although overall yield of milk and solids-corrected milk did not differ with diet. Physical measures of cow health including body weight, body condition score, temperature, pulse, and respiration rate were collected weekly; dietary treatment group means for these measures were not different. Blood chemistry and hematological analyses were conducted using blood samples collected from cows before the start of the trial and at the end of each period. Overall, the TC1507 and control groups did not differ in any of these indices of health status. Further, hematological profiles for cows in the dietary treatment groups were not different. In summary, no differences were detected in milk production, milk composition, or cow health as indicated by physical measures, blood chemistry, and hematological analyses between dairy cows fed diets containing maize grain plus whole-plant maize silage from TC1507 and dairy cows fed grain plus silage from its near-isoline counterpart. 3adairy cows 3afeed grains 3acow feeding 3aisogenic lines 3ahybrids 3aexperimental diets 3amilk composition 3alactation 3acorn 3abiotechnology 3asilage 3adry matter intake 3amilk yield 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxstandards. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxveterinary 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aHealth Status 2aHematologic Testsxveterinary 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aNutritive Value 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSilage 2aZea maysxgenetics 0atraits 0acry1F trait 0aanimal performance1 aSmith, B.1 aRice, D.1 aOwens, F.1 aHinds, M.1 aDana, G.1 aHunst, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Dec., v. 90, no. 12 p.5706-5713dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle03301naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164100001900182245014000201300001800341506007600359520149400435506003701929650001401966650001301980650002101993650001402014650001802028650001902046650001602065650002102081650003502102650001802137650001102155650001502166650001902181650002102200650001602221650001502237650000902252650002602261650001902287650001402306650001302320700001802333700002102351700002302372700002102395700001902416700002102435700002402456773007302480852000902553856008102562930003302643946001102676655001202687IND4425604520221207073256.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442560452DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp0852doi7 aPMC27360432pmcid7 a195286652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanussi, Carla12aA newly generated functional antibody identifies Tn antigen as a novel determinant in the cancer cell-lymphatic endothelium interaction  ap. 1056-1067.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMalignant transformation of epithelial cells is frequently associated with the alteration of glycosylation pathways. Tn is a common tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen present in 90% of human carcinomas and its expression correlates with metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Despite its relevance, the functional role of Tn in tumor biology has not been firmly established probably for the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Our aims were to produce highly reactive monoclonal antibodies against Tn making use of synthetically produced Tn and to test their usefulness for in vivo imaging as well as to define their potential functional activity in tumor cell spread. We immunized mice with Tn clustered on cationized BSA and screened the positive hybridomas with Tn-biotinylated alginate. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay and immunofluorescence assays revealed that the most reactive anti-Tn IgM mAb (2154F12A4) selectively recognized Tn on the MCF7 breast cancer cell line since its binding to the cell membrane was completely abolished by preincubation with purified Tn. Importantly, QDot 800-conjugated mAb injected in MCF7-tumor bearing mice specifically bound to primary tumor lesions as well as to metastases in lymph nodes. In addition, this mAb was able to inhibit cancer cell adhesion to lymphatic endothelium suggesting a novel involvement of Tn in the lymphatic dissemination of cancer cells and hypothesizing future applications in inhibiting lymphatic metastases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalginates 3aantigens 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinoma 3acell adhesion 3acell membranes 3aendothelium 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ahybridomas 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3aprognosis 3asorbents1 aCoslovi, Anna1 aCampa, Cristiana1 aMucignat, Maria T.1 aSpessotto, Paola1 aUggeri, Fulvio1 aPaoletti, Sergio1 aColombatti, Alfonso0 tGlycobiology.g2009 Oct., v. 19, no. 10 p.1056-1067x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp0853Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03613naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100002100199245013000220300001600350500002400366500001500390520148600405650001501891650001401906650001801920650001801938650002901956650002201985650001002007650001402017650002202031650003302053650001902086650003702105650001602142650001902158650002802177650001302205650002502218650001202243650001102255650003002266650001102296650000902307650003502316650003902351650002902390650003802419650004502457653002102502653001702523653001502540653003302555700001802588700002002606773010602626852000902732856009302741930003302834945002502867946001102892655001202903IND4428640020221119073857.0091113e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442864002DNAL7 a194103902pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL400 0aM0011 aPsenicka, Martin10aUltrastructural study on the fertilisation process in sturgeon (Acipenser), function of acrosome and prevention of polyspermy  ap. 147-154.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSturgeon gametes differ from other fish in that their spermatozoa possess acrosome with finger-like posterolateral projections, which undergo exocytosis and filament formation, whereas eggs possess numerous micropyles. The fertilisation process in Acipenser baerii was investigated by fluorescence and electron microscopy. A suitable activation solution containing 2.5mM CaCl₂, 15mM Tris, pH 10 was found for detailed description of acrosomal reaction. The acrosome reaction includes the formation of a spear-like fertilisation filament coming from three endonuclear canals and implantation fossa through the acrosomes. It can accelerate the process of polyspermy prevention. Another unique feature of the acrosome was an anchor-like opening of the posterolateral projections. Mature eggs of A. baerii possessed 2-10 micropyles in the animal pole region. The eggs consisted of three principal layers and an outermost jelly coat blocking micropyle, and a layer of cortical granules in unfertilised eggs. With the exposure to freshwater, the jelly like layer separated from the egg surface, whereas the cortical granules swelled. No change between the layers of fertilised and unfertilised eggs, apart from the generation of an increasing perivitelline space by dissolution of the cortical granules, had been observed after the fusion of spermatozoon with an egg. A fertilisation cone blocked a fusion of other spermatozoa with cytoplasmatic projection in the fertilised micropyle. 3apolyspermy 3afish eggs 3amorphogenesis 3anormal values 3amale reproductive system 3aacrosome reaction 3amales 3aAcipenser 3aanimal morphology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3amale fertility 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aspermatozoa 3aultrastructure 3afluorescence microscopy 3asturgeon 2aAcrosomexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aFishes 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aOvumxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSpermatozoaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 0aAcipenser baerii 0acapacitation 0ainhibitors 0afertilization (reproduction)1 aRodina, Marek1 aLinhart, Otomar0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Jan., v. 117, no. 1-2 p.147-154dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.03.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100106b20100205c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03445naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171100001400180245012700194300001600321500002400337520193500361650002802296650002202324650002202346650002502368650001702393650003302410650002102443650002402464650002602488650001402514650002302528650004802551650003102599653002402630653002402654700001402678773010802692852000902800856008302809930003302892945002502925946001302950655001202963IND4422611920221119074009.0090702e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442261192DNAL7 a195225802pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-99-7-08232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF830 0aX1001 aGosme, M.10aCascade: An Epidemiological Model to Simulate Disease Spread and Aggregation Across Multiple Scales in a Spatial Hierarchy  ap. 823-832.  aIncludes references  aDisease spread occurs at several spatial scales, e.g., from field to field, plant to plant, and leaf to leaf. So far, epidemiological models have largely overlooked the multiscale nature of epidemics. Here, we propose a model that simulates disease spread across multiple scales in a nested hierarchy. The model is based on the central ideas of hierarchy theory, i.e., (i) the system is decomposed vertically into levels and horizontally into holons (elements at one level, which are complete systems when seen from the lower level), and (ii) higher levels are characterized by slower processes than lower levels. The model is individual-based, the individuals being the holons, which are either susceptible or infected. At each level, infections within one holon (i.e., infections between holons of the level below) occur independently from the other holons: infections between holons happen at the higher level. The self-similarity of the model structure and processes across all levels allows implementing the model with a simple recursive algorithm. The behavior of the model was studied using methods commonly applied to field data. Aggregation of the disease was characterized through the incidence-incidence relationship and the binomial power law, in order to study the effect of infectiousness at each level on disease aggregation. Sensitivity analyses showed that disease incidences at all levels were influenced by the infectiousness at any level, but infectiousness at higher levels had more effect than infectiousness at lower levels. It was also shown that increasing the probability of infection at a given level increased aggregation at higher level(s) and decreased aggregation at lower level(s). The results were consistent between incidence-incidence relationship and power law analysis, but the incidence-incidence relationship was more sensitive in detecting the differences in aggregation between treatments. 3aepidemiological studies 3asimulation models 3adisease incidence 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial data 3aplant diseases and disorders 2aArea Under Curve 2aComputer Simulation 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aIncidence 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxstatistics & numerical data 2aReproducibility of Results 0adisease aggregation 0aspatial hierarchies1 aLucas, P.0 tPhytopathology.g2009 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.823-832dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-99-7-08233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090721b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/20  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009200143300001600235500001500251520064600266650002200912650001100934650002100945650002200966650002000988650001701008650002501025650002001050650002901070650001301099650002701112650002501139650002101164650001701185650001801202650002901220650002801249650003301277650003101310650001701341650002801358650003001386650003801416650002101454650003001475650002901505650003301534650002401567650002301591650003601614650002701650653001101677653002001688653002801708653002601736653001901762653001901781653002501800700001601825700001801841700002201859773008101881852000901962930003301971945001302004946001102017655001202028IND2039014320221119073929.0940422e199311  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203901432DNAL7 a82516262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeci, L.R.12aA tRNA Val(GAC) gene of chloroplast origin in sunflower mitochondria is not transcribed  ap. 727-736.  a2019-12-05  aA tRNA(Val) (GAC) gene is located in opposite orientation 552 nucleotides (nt) down-stream of the cytochrome oxidase subunit III (coxIII) gene in sunflower mitochondria.

No tRNA(Val) is encoded in monocot mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whereas two tRNA(Val) species are coded for by potato mtDNA.

In rbcS-rolC plants, the expression of the rolC gene was located mainly in leaves, while in 35S-rolC plants transcripts were detected as well in shoots and roots. Phenotypically, rbcS-rolC transgenic plants were found to be slightly reduced in plant size with a few more tillers than control plants. Photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were significantly lower in all rolC transgenic plants irrespective of the type of construct used. Tuber yield was not significantly different between controls and rbcS-rolC transgenic plants, but was reduced in the 35S-rolC transformants. Sucrose level was unchanged in all rolC clones investigated, whereas fructose content was significantly enhanced in 35S-rolC transformants, but not in the plants expressing the rolC gene in aerial plant parts only. In both types of rolC transgenic plants, glucose content was lower than in controls, resulting in a significant reduction of reducing sugar in tubers. The results suggest a hormonal influence on the carbohydrate composition of potato tubers. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3astructural genes 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic transformation 3agene expression 3atubers 3arecombinant DNA 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3acrop yield 3asucrose 3afructose 3aglucose 3apromoter regions 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aLight 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolyploidy 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgenetics 2aSolanum tuberosumxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2abeta-Glucosidase1 aBallvora, A.1 aSchmulling, T.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1993 Nov., v. 23, no. 4 p.749-757x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20110531b20110603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02561naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015300165300001400318520145600332650001401788653001601802653000901818653002301827653000901850653002301859700002301882700002501905700002601930773012901956852000902085856008502094930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4447472720221119074036.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444747272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00430-010-0173-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeiler, Janina 10aComparison of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and cellular signal transduction in human macrophages infected with different influenza A viruses  ap. 53-60.  aInfluenza A virus infection of macrophages and virus-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression are regarded to contribute to severity of influenza A virus-caused diseases. Although some data are available on cytokine production by influenza A virus-infected macrophages, systematic comparisons of the virus types are currently considered to be of high relevance in humans (pandemic H1N1/2009, seasonal H1N1, seasonal H3N2, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1) on pro-inflammatory potential, and relevant underlying cellular signalling events are missing. Here, we show that the infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages with pandemic H1N1/2009 (A/HH/01/2009), seasonal H1N1/1999 (A/New Caledonia/20/99), seasonal H3N2/2004 (A/California/7/2004) or highly pathogenic H5N1/2004 (A/Thailand/1(Kan-1)/04) results in similar infection rates. However, the investigated H1N1 strains caused delayed and decreased apoptosis in comparison with H3N2/2004 or H5N1/2004. Moreover, human macrophage infection with H3N2/2004 or H5N1/2004 but not with H1N1 viruses was associated with pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and activation of relevant mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as indicated by phosphorylation of p38, JNK and ERK 1/2. These findings are in line with clinical observations indicating enhanced disease severity in H3N2- or H5N1-infected patients compared to individuals infected with pandemic H1N1/2009 or seasonal H1N1. 3acytokines 0aInfluenza A 0aMAPK 0aSeasonal influenza 0aH5N1 0aPandemic H1N1/20091 aMichaelis, Martin 1 aSithisarn, Patchima 1 aCinatl, Jindrich Jr. 0 tMedical microbiology and immunology.g2011 Feb., v. 200, no. 1 p.53-60dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0300-85847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00430-010-0173-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01631naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006700129300001600196520077400212650001900986650001901005650001201024650001201036700001601048700001601064700001801080700001601098700001501114773013301129852000901262939003301271946001301304655001201317IND9003368320221119073947.0900724e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900336832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, J.W.

More than 75% of the limitation in photosynthesis following chilling was due to non-stomatal factors, and reduced initial slopes of CO2 assimilation vs. intercellular CO2 indicate that photosynthetic capacity was reduced for 5 days following chilling. Carbon dioxide assimilation at saturating intercellular CO2 (>500 micromole.mol-1) was also reduced by chilling, indicating again that stomatal limitations were a minor contributor to the photosynthetic reduction observed under ambient CO2. 3aLolium perenne 3aphotosynthesis 3acooling 3astomata1 aKopec, D.M.1 aFallahi, E.1 aMancino, C.F.1 aSlack, D.C.1 aJordan, K.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1990 May, v. 115, no. 3 p.478-481wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03090naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009700163300001600260520205300276650001802329650002002347653001402367653002702381700001502408700001402423700001702437700002802454773014402482852000902626856008502635930003302720946001102753655001202764IND4447469420221119073948.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444746942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00432-010-0887-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHontscha, C. 10aClinical trials on CIK cells: first report of the international registry on CIK cells (IRCC)  ap. 305-310.  aPurpose Recently, a subset of natural killer T lymphocytes termed “cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells” has been described. To build an international registry, we collected the clinical data and treatment of patients with cancer using CIK cells from the literature and the respective investigators. This registry is expected to set a new set of standards on the reporting of results from clinical trials using CIK cells. A standardized reporting system will accelerate discoveries and allows us to improve treatment to benefit the patients. Methods We searched in PubMed for “CIK cells clinical trials”. Results Within the 867 matches found, 11 clinical trials with CIK cells were identified. Within these trials, 426 patients were treated, of which 313 were male, and 113 were female. Most trials included male patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, and Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin disease. In 10 of 11 studies, autologous CIK cells were used. The total number of CIK cells injected ranged from 21.9 × 10⁷ to 5.2 × 10¹⁰. The number of CIK cells used per infusion ranged from 7.2 × 10⁶ to 2.1 × 10¹⁰. Patients were treated with up to 40 infusions of CIK cells. Of the 384 patients, where a clinical response was reported, 24 patients showed a complete response, 27 patients showed a partial response, 40 patients showed a minor response. The total response rate (RR) was 91/384 reported patients, 161 patients had a stable disease, 129 patients had progressive disease. A decrease in tumor volume was only described in three patients. Side effects of CIK cell treatment were minor. Interestingly, a reduction of hepatitis B virus load was described in patients undergoing treatment with CIK cells. Disease-free survival rates were significantly higher in patients treated with CIK cells than in a control group without CIK treatment. Conclusion Adjuvant immunotherapy with cytokine-induced killer cells may prevent recurrence and improve quality of life and progression-free survival rates in patients with cancer. 3aimmunotherapy 3aclinical trials 0aCIK cells 0aInternational registry1 aBorck, Y. 1 aZhou, H. 1 aMessmer, D. 1 aSchmidt-Wolf, I.

Since, after a foraging dive they surface to ingest the prey, the intensity of kleptoparasitic attacks on the surface can have a major impact upon the net energetic gain for each individual. Inspite of the fact that cormorants and their habitats are severely threatened in India, their foraging behaviour has not been adequately studied. Such considerations prompted us to undertake field studies on three sympatric cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.) at 60 different sites in the Delhi region of North India, during 2004-2007. By means of video photography, some key foraging parameters including group size, prey size and patterns of kleptoparasitic attacks were quantified. Along a loose body size gradient, we observed significant differences among the three species with respect to not only their preference for wetland size but also prey size. The frequency of a kleptoparasitic attacks depended upon the group size and foraging behaviour of each species. It was observed that several foraging bouts were abruptly terminated due to human disturbances, mostly at sites lying outside the protected areas. This observation points towards the need to conserve small waterbodies in the countryside, currently threatened by pollution and urbanization, for the benefit of a variety of waterbirds including cormorants. 3aPhalacrocorax 3abody size 3afood webs 3aforaging 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aphotography 3apollution 3aseafoods 3aurbanization 3awater birds 3awetlands 3aIndia1 aUrfi, Abdul J.0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Jan., v. 638, no. 1 p.21-28dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0002-8 7aarticle02302naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007000128300001600198520132200214650002101536650003201557650002301589650000901612650001501621650001701636650001901653650001701672650002701689653001401716700001701730700001701747773013301764852000901897939003301906946001301939655001201952IND9003367120221119073436.0900723e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900336712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, B.J.10aFoliar-applied iron enhances bermudagrass tolerance to herbicides  ap. 422-426.  aField experiments were conducted to determine the effects of foliar iron (Fe) applied with postemergence herbicides on injury, color, and quality of 'Tifway' bermudagrass [Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt-Davy X Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.]. Iron significantly decreased injury and improved quality and color of 'Tifway' bermudagrass in conjunction with herbicide treatment. Turf injury was less for 4 to 18 days after the initial MSMA application when Fe was added. Injury was also less from sequential Fe treatment with MSMA + metribuzin (up to 4 days) and MSMA + imazaquin (from 4 to 10 days) compared to the respective herbicides applied alone. There was no difference in turf injury from Fe when imazaquin at 1.3 kg.ha-1 was applied as a single treatment. However, turf treated with Fe and two applications of imazaquin (9- to 10-day interval) recovered from herbicide injury faster than when treated only with the herbicide. Iron did not prevent immediate 2,4-D + mecoprop + dicamba injury to the bermudagrass, but did hasten turf recovery from injury at 26 days after treatment. With a few exceptions, 'Tifway' bermudagrass quality was higher and color improved when Fe was added. However, injury expressed as loss of shoot density was not affected by Fe and only injury expressed as color loss was improved by Fe. 3aCynodon dactylon 3ainterspecific hybridization 3afoliar application 3airon 3aherbicides 3aplant damage 3alawns and turf 3acrop quality 3aCynodon transvaalensis 0atolerance1 aCarrow, R.N.1 aMurphy, T.R.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1990 May, v. 115, no. 3 p.422-426wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02110naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245012200121300001600243500001500259520105100274650001901325650001901344650003401363650002201397650001201419650002701431653001001458653003001468653001501498653001201513700001901525700001601544773013301560852000901693939003301702946001301735655001201748IND9003367420221119073450.0900724e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900336742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, D.10aPhysiological and quality responses of 'Bartlett' pears to reduced O2 and enhanced CO2 levels and storage temperature  ap. 435-439.  a2019-12-04  a'Bartlett' pears (Pyrus communis L.) tolerated up to 10 days of exposure to atmospheres containing 1.0%, 0.5%, or 0.25% O2 at 0, 5, or 10C without any detrimental effects on their quality attributes.

While 1.0% or 0.5% 62 and 20% CO2 did not increase ethanol and acetaldehyde contents, 0.25% O2 slightly increased and 50% or 80% CO2 dramatically increased the contents of these two volatiles in juice of the fruits. The effects of low O2 or high CO2 on the above attributes generally became more pronounced at the higher temperatures.

The trend in this field is to transfer tissue using increasingly smaller blood vessels, which decreases problems associated with tissue harvest but increases the possibility that blood supply to the transferred tissue may not be adequate for healing. It would thus be helpful to surgeons to understand the relationship between the tissue volume and blood vessel diameter to ensure success in these operations. As a first step towards addressing this question, we present a simple mathematical model that might be used to predict successful tissue transfer based on blood vessel diameter, tissue volume, and oxygen delivery.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3ablood vessels 3ablood volume 3acongenital abnormalities 3amathematical models 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3apatients1 aKao, Chiu-Yen1 aGreen, J.

Our data demonstrate that type I (α, β) IFNs induce phosphorylation/activation of Mnk1, which, in turn, regulates phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) on Ser-209. Such Mnk activation depends on upstream engagement of Jak1, and requires downstream activation of the Mek/Erk MAPK pathway. In studies using double Mnk1-/-Mnk2-/- knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we found that engagement of Mnk kinases is essential for mRNA translation of the Isg15 and Isg54 genes, suggesting an important role for this pathway in mRNA translation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Importantly, our data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Mnk kinases or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mnk1 and Mnk2 results in partial reversal of the suppressive effects of IFNα on normal and leukemic hematopoietic progenitors, establishing a key role for this pathway in the generation of the growth inhibitory effects of type I IFNs. Together, our findings establish that the Mnk/eIF4E kinase pathway is activated in an IFN-inducible manner and plays important roles in mRNA translation for ISGs and generation of IFN-inducible anti-proliferative responses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ainterferons 3aknockout mutants 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSurindara Kaura.1 aRedig, Amanda J.1 aGoldsborough, Katy1 aDavid, Kevin1 aUeda, Takeshi1 aWatanabe-Fukunaga, Rie1 aBaker, Darren P.1 aFish, Eleanor N.1 aFukunaga, Rikiro1 aPlatanias, Leonidas C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 21, v. 106, no. 29 p.12097-12102dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09005621063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03016naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011900142300001400261500001500275520141400290650001101704650001701715650001801732650001501750650001901765650001401784650001301798650002601811650001201837650002501849650004601874650001401920650001801934650004001952650003301992650003702025650001102062650002702073650002802100650002602128650001502154650002302169650002302192650001702215653001402232653003302246653001402279700001702293773008702310852000902397939003302406946001102439655001202450IND9101628120221119073515.0910401e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910162812DNAL7 a20162132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLye, D.J.12aA membrane filter procedure for assaying cytotoxic activity in heterotrophic bacteria isolated from drinking water  ap. 89-94.  a2019-12-04  aCytotoxic activity assays of Gram-negative, heterotrophic bacteria are often laborious and time consuming. The objective of this study was to develop in situ procedures for testing potential cytotoxic activities of heterotrophic bacteria isolated from drinking water systems. Water samples were passed through 0.45 micrometer membrane filters which were then placed upon appropriate media and incubated. After incubation, each membrane filter was transferred to the surface of Y-1 mouse adrenal cells overlaid with 1% agar. The filters were removed after exposure for 15 min. The Y-1 cells were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 2.5% CO2 for an additional 24 h. The release of putative cytotoxic and cytotonic products from the bacterial colonies was recognized by zones of cellular lysis and injury of Y-1 cells that appeared immediately beneath the membrane. Cytotoxic strains of Aeromonas, Vibrio, Escherichia, and Legionella spp. were readily recognized by this method. About 1% of the bacteria isolated from drinking water also released cytotoxic products. This frequency was dependent upon the primary medium used and the density of bacteria present. The majority of cytotoxic strains isolated from drinking water also expressed protease activity (95%) and haemolytic activity (70%). This in situ membrane filter procedure is a facile method for simultaneously testing many different bacterial colonies. 3aassays 3acytotoxicity 3arapid methods 3afiltration 3adrinking water 3ascreening 3abacteria 2aAeromonasxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Toxinsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aCell Line 2aCulture Media 2aCytotoxinsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aHemolysin Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aLegionellaxmetabolism 2aPseudomonasxmetabolism 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aVero Cells 2aVibrioxmetabolism 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Supply 0amembranes 0aheterotrophic microorganisms 0aisolation1 aDufour, A.P.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1991 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.89-94x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02201naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007400204300002000278506007600298520088700374506003701261650000801298650001701306650002301323650002001346650002101366650002301387650001701410700002201427700002101449700001901470773017601489852000901665856008301674930003301757946001301790655001201803IND4423620320221207045828.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442362032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09020201062doi7 aPMC27154952pmcid7 a195498662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadkhan, Saba10aProtein-free small nuclear RNAs catalyze a two-step splicing reaction  ap. 11901-11906.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPre-mRNA splicing is a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression and is carried out by a highly complex ribonucleoprotein assembly, the spliceosome. Many fundamental aspects of spliceosomal function, including the identity of catalytic domains, remain unknown. We show that a base-paired complex of U6 and U2 small nuclear RNAs, in the absence of the [almost equal to]200 other spliceosomal components, performs a two-step reaction with two short RNA oligonucleotides as substrates that results in the formation of a linear RNA product containing portions of both oligonucleotides. This reaction, which is chemically identical to splicing, is dependent on and occurs in proximity of sequences known to be critical for splicing in vivo. These results prove that the complex formed by U6 and U2 RNAs is a ribozyme and can potentially carry out RNA-based catalysis in the spliceosome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3agene expression 3aoligonucleotides 3aribonucleoproteins 3aspliceosomes1 aMohammadi, Afshin1 aJaladat, Yasaman1 aGeisler, Sarah0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 21, v. 106, no. 29 p.11901-11906dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09020201063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02583naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010600126300001600232500001500248520138300263650003001646650001701676650002001693650001401713650001201727650001501739650001301754650001701767650002201784650002001806650002001826651001401846651002001860653001701880653001701897653002001914653001601934700001901950700001601969773009901985852000902084939003302093946001102126655001202137IND9101628820221119073624.0910401s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910162882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, K.B.10aInfluence of growing season, location and planting time on some quality parameters of kabuli chickpea  ap. 429-441.  a2019-12-04  aVariability in hundred seed weight (HSW), protein content (PC) and cooking time (CT) was determined in the world collection of kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) maintained at ICARDA. HSW varied from 8 to 67g, PC from 143 to 270 g kg-1 (14.3 to 27%) and CT from 50 to 296 min. Over all observations a coefficient of correlation of 0.87 (P=0.01) was found between HSW and CT. This was not maintained for genotypes of intermediate HSW (25-42 g per 100 seeds). Standard unit heritability was 0.96, 0.37 and 0.68 respectively for HSW, PC and CT, while broad sense heritability, was 0.79 for HSW and 0.55 for PC indicating a surprisingly high degree of heritability, of PC in the kabuli chickpea. Growing season had a marked effect on HSW and a lesser effect on PC than did growing location, and genotype/season and genotype/location interactions were apparent in both HSW and PC. Since CT and HSW were highly correlated, CT was affected to the same extent as HSW by growing season and location. PC appeared to be the most stable of the three quality parameters, and several lines were identified which maintained a PC significantly higher than the population mean when grown on two locations over two seasons, with low within-genotype coefficients of variability. Compared with spring planting, winter planting decreased PC by 8 g kg-1 whereas HSW increased by 1.2 g per 100 seeds. 3ageographical distribution 3acrop quality 3aprotein content 3achickpeas 3aseasons 3acrop yield 3agenotype 3aheritability 3agenetic variation 3aCicer arietinum 3acooking quality 3aWest Asia 3aNorthern Africa 0acooking time 0afood quality 0aplanting season 0aseed weight1 aWilliams, P.C.1 aNakkoul, H.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 53, no. 4 p.429-441x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02525naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137072000900146100002600155245011000181300001400291500002400305520115200329650001101481650001801492650001801510650001001528650002501538650002201563650002301585650002201608650002301630650003001653650002501683653001901708653001801727653001701745773010101762852000901863856011201872930003301984945002502017946001302042655001202055IND4422586920221119074031.0090630e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442258692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK510 0aX100 0aD500 0aE700 0aF8501 aPrestemon, Jeffrey P.10aStatistical Power of Intervention Analyses: Simulation and Empirical Application to Treated Lumber Prices  ap. 48-63.  aIncludes references  aTimber product markets are subject to large shocks deriving from natural disturbances and policy shifts. Statistical modeling of shocks is often done to assess their economic importance. In this article, I simulate the statistical power of univariate and bivariate methods of shock detection using time series intervention models. Simulations show that bivariate methods are several times more statistically powerful than univariate methods when underlying series are nonstationary and potentially involved in cointegrating relationships. In an empirical application to detect the long-run price impacts of the voluntary phase-out of chromated copper arsenate in pressure-treating southern pine lumber for residential applications, I find the multivariate methods to be more powerful as well. I identify highly significant long-run price increases of 11% for two of three treated southern pine dimension lumber price series evaluated using multivariate approaches. The univariate method detected a long-run increase only for the third product, and the statistical significance was weak, although comparable, in magnitude to the first two products. 3alumber 3amarket prices 3atimber supply 3aPinus 3atime series analysis 3asimulation models 3aMonte Carlo method 3awood preservation 3awood preservatives 3achromated copper arsenate 3alaws and regulations 0aautoregression 0acointegration 0aprice shocks0 tForest science.g2009 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.48-63dSociety of American Forestersx0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/325783Available in Treesearch, US Forest Service's digital repository  a20090706b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/02  aOther US 7aarticle02928naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245014900143300001600292520102100308650002801329650001601357650000901373650002501382650000901407650000901416650002501425650002501450650002001475650002201495650001401517650001701531650001901548650004701567650002401614650001201638650001801650650002601668650002301694650002101717650002301738650005101761650004401812650002001856650002801876650002401904650001401928650001901942650003001961650002001991650003402011650002402045653001402069700001602083700001902099700001702118773006502135852000902200930003302209945001302242946001102255655001202266IND2042606020221119073634.0941013e19940615gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204260602DNAL7 a80285872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutero, A.10aDrosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase: identification and expression of two mutations responsible for cold- and heat-sensitive phenotypes  ap. 699-705.  aAceIJ29 and AceIJ40 are cold- and heat-sensitive variants of the gene coding for acetylcholinesterase in Drosophila melanogaster. In the homozygous condition, these mutations are lethal when animals are raised at restrictive temperatures, i.e., below 23 degrees C for AceIJ29 or above 25 degrees C for AceIJ40. The coding regions of the gene in these mutants were sequenced and mutations changing Ser374 to Phe in AceIJ29 and Pro75 to Leu in AceIJ40 were found. Acetylcholinesterases bearing these mutations were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and we found that these mutations decrease the secretion rate of the protein most probably by affecting its folding. This phenomenon is exacerbated at restrictive temperatures decreasing the amount of secreted acetylcholinesterase below the lethality threshold. In parallel, the substitution of the conserved Asp248 by an Asn residue completely inhibits the activity of the enzyme and its secretion, preventing the correct folding of the protein in a non-conditional manner. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amutagenesis 3aloci 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acold 3aheat 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein secretion 3aphenotype 3alethal genes 3apoint mutation 2aAcetylcholinesterasexgeneticsxsecretion. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCold Temperature 2aConserved Sequence 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHot Temperature 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Folding 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aXenopusxmetabolism 0aace locus1 aBride, J.M.1 aPralavorio, M.1 aFournier, D.0 tMGG.g1994 June 15, v. 243, no. 6 p.699-705x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01932naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001300158245008900171300001400260500002400274520072100298650002001019650002301039650002701062650001301089650002601102650002301128653002501151700001201176700001201188700001301200700001201213700001301225700001301238773010801251852000901359856007301368930003301441945002501474946001101499655001201510IND4382447920221119073512.0060731e20060710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438244792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aChen, L.10aPoly(L-lactide)/starch blends compatibilized with poly(L-lactide)-g-starch copolymer  ap. 75-80.  aIncludes references  aThe poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)/starch blends were prepared by the PLLA grafting starch (PLLA-g-St) copolymers as a compatibilizer, and their thermal, mechanical and morphological characterizations were performed to show the better performance of these blends compared to the virgin PLLA/starch blend without the compatibilizer, including PLLA crystallinity, interfacial adhesion between the PLLA matrix and starch dispersive phases, mechanical test, medium resistance, and contact angle.

The diets were fed to surubim, a Brazilian native carnivorous freshwater fish. Gross energy of the diets were 4440, 4650, 4840, and 5140 (kcal/kg). Surubim fingerlings (average weight: 2.72 g/fish) were randomly assigned to treatments and fed the test diets twice a day to apparent satiation for 62 days. The study was conducted in triplicate with 13 fish distributed in 60-1 net-cages set up in 1000-1 plastic tanks (three cages per tank), equipped with a flow through freshwater system and water temperature of 27 +/- 1 degrees C. The diet with 6% lipid gave the poorest performance, while fish fed the highest lipid level showed the best nutritional performance. Feed conversion ratio and daily feed consumption showed a marked decrease (P < 0.05) in inverse proportion to lipid level in the diet. Proximate composition of fish whole body was markedly affected (P < 0.05) by dietary lipid, particularly in relation to moisture and crude lipid. Visceral lipid content and nutrient retention also increased in direct proportion to the dietary lipid level (P < 0.05). Results of the present study indicate that soybean lipid is well metabolized by this species, serving as a source of energy and promoting excellent growth. 3awater content 3afish feeding 3anutrient requirements 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3abody composition 3anutrient retention 3afreshwater fish 0aperformance1 aCyrino, J.E.P.1 aPortz, L.1 aTrugo, L.C.0 tAquaculture.g2002 June 28, , no. 1/4 p.209-218dElsevier Pub.

The alkal-ine solubilising process with prewashing could remove myoglobin most effectively from sardine muscle, whereas the process without prewashing resulted in the greatest myoglobin removal in mackerel muscle (p<0.05). Surimi conventionally prepared by water or NaCl washing showed the gel with greater breaking force and deformation than that from alkaline solubilising process (p<0.05). The hig-her expressible moisture was found in the gels of surimi pre-pared by alkaline process, indicating the poor water holding capacity of the gel matrix.

We derived iterative formulas for calculating critical depth of general horseshoe cross-sections, and these formulas can be used for computer program development to find accurate solutions of critical depth. Based on the principle of gradual optimization fitting, general estimation formulas were also developed for direct computation of critical depth for all types of standard horseshoe cross-sections. The estimation formulas have high accuracy for hydraulic designers to use in comparison to accurate critical depth determined from the iterative formulas, and the maximum relative error is less than 1%. 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3aequations 3airrigation systems 3aprogram planning 3awater supply1 aWang, Z.Z.1 aFang, X.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1159-1164wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140424  aOther US 7aarticle02083naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006700145300001600212300002100228500001500249520045900264650002200723650000800745650002900753650001700782650001000799650002400809650002000833650001200853650001800865650002300883650005100906650004600957650005001003650001001053650001801063650001201081650002901093650002801122650001701150650005201167650003801219653002001257653001401277653001001291700001801301700001401319700001501333700001701348700001301365773006201378852000901440939003301449946001101482655001201493IND9101862420221119073527.0910416e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910186242DNAL7 a18486512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSargueil, B.12aA new specific DNA endonuclease activity in yeast mitochondria  ap. 340-341.  ap. 340-341. ill.  a2019-12-05  aTwo group I intron-encoded proteins from the yeast mitochondrial genome have already been shown to have a specific DNA endonuclease activity.

All three systems produced their own straightbred replacement females. Male calves were sold at weaning and female calves in excess of those required to keep the herd size constant were sold at one year of age. In the base situation, F1 HG females were priced at twice as much as the price per kg of the beef male calves, according to present market values. Typical 1000 ha beef cattle farms were simulated for each system, based on Brachiaria brizantha pastures managed according to recommended practices. Herd dynamics were controlled by reproduction and survival. Literature figures on monthly pasture nutrient production, live weights and milk yield were used to estimate nutrient requirements to match stocking rate to nutrient availability in each system. For calving rate set to 0.8 in all three systems, the total numbers of cows for the N, AN and HG systems were, respectively, 803, 795 and 885 and the total live weight sold annually was 129,070, 133,120 and 127,680 kg. The annual economic return on investment was 5.21%, 5.81% and 10.84%, respectively, for the N, AN and HG systems. Reducing the relative price of the HG heifers diminished the economic superiority of this system over N and AN. The difference was zero when the price of HG heifers was reduced to approximately 1.2 times the beef calf price. This also happened when the calving rate of the Gir cows was set to 0.6 keeping N cows at 0.8 or higher. 3abeef cattle 3aHolstein 3aGir (cattle breed) 3aAngus 3aNellore 3aanimal performance 3aanimal breeding 0aF1 Holstein x Gir 0aF1 Angus x Nelore1 aMadalena, F.E.1 aCezar, I.M.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 June, v. 88, no. 2-3 p.111-124dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2005.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02049naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001500164245012800179300001600307500002400323520093200347650001801279650002801297651001201325653002401337700001901361700001501380700001501395773011301410852000901523856008601532930003301618945002501651946001101676655001201687IND4382442420221119073537.0060731e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438244242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2005.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aJ5001 aNevens, F.10aFarm gate nitrogen surpluses and nitrogen use efficiency of specialized dairy farms in Flanders: Evolution and future goals  ap. 142-155.  aIncludes references  aData from the Farm Accountancy Data Network revealed that from 1989 to 2001 the average farm-gate N surplus of Flemish specialized dairy farms decreased from 378 to 238 kg N ha(-1), the corresponding whole-farm N efficiency increased from 15% to 22%. Study of European literature on dairy farming, of experimental farms or farm groups and of progressive Flemish farms showed that there is scope for further improvement of the N use efficiency in Flemish dairy farming. The improvement can mainly be realized by changes in the operational management, resulting in an ever decreasing use of fertilizer N and concentrate N. Reasonable targets for sustainable dairy farming in Flanders are 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for the farm-gate N surplus and about 85 kg milk kg(-1) N surplus for eco-efficiency. These targets can be reached at production levels of up to 10,000 a 12,000 l ha(-1) and at a satisfying income per unit of labour. 3adairy farming 3anutrient use efficiency 3aBelgium 0afarm gate N surplus1 aVerbruggen, I.1 aReheul, D.1 aHofman, G.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 June, v. 88, no. 2-3 p.142-155dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2005.03.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02345naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100002100155245010900176300001600285500002400301520106100325650001801386650002501404650003201429650001001461651001101471653003601482653001501518653001801533653002501551653001601576700002101592700001801613700001501631773011301646852000901759856008601768930003301854945002501887946001101912655001201923IND4382442320221119073559.0060731e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438244232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2005.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL1001 aGalanopoulos, K.10aAssessing the effects of managerial and production practices on the efficiency of commercial pig farming  ap. 125-141.  aIncludes references  aA non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique was applied to investigate the degree of technical and scale efficiency of commercial pig farming in Greece. Mean pure technical efficiency in a DEA model in which all variables were normalized with the number of sows was 0.83, indicating that there is ample potential for more efficient input utilisation in domestic pig farming. The normalized measurement of variables captures the fact that most scale-inefficient farms are operating under decreasing returns to scale. This implies that even smaller farms have expanded to a size larger than is optimal relative to the number of sows in their herds. In an attempt to explain variation in efficiency scores, the study focuses on certain managerial and breeding practices often not accounted for. Tobit analysis reveals that the choice of insemination method, origin of the genotype, and the feedstuff preparation system, as well as the mortality rate of piglets and the size class, have a significant impact on the efficiency level of pig farms. 3adata analysis 3aproduction functions 3agood agricultural practices 3aswine 3aGreece 0aDEA (data envelopment analysis) 0aefficiency 0abest practice 0amanagerial practices 0apig farming1 aAggelopoulos, S.1 aKamenidou, I.1 aMattas, K.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 June, v. 88, no. 2-3 p.125-141dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2005.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02723naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245011200158300001800270500002400288520134500312650001201657650001401669650001801683650002501701650002401726650002001750653002801770700001701798700001601815700001901831700001401850700001401864700001501878700001601893773018301909852000902092856008102101856004802182930003302230945001302263946001302276655001202289IND2332051520221119073613.0030418e200209  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233205152DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.89.9.15312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSytsma, K.J.10aUrticalean rosids: circumscription, rosid ancestry, and phylogenetics based on rbcL, trnL-F, ndhF sequences  ap. 1531-1546.  aIncludes references  aTo address the composition of the urticalean rosids, the relationships of the component families (maximally Cannabaceae, Cecropiaceae, Celtidaceae, Moraceae, Ulmaceae, and Urticaceae) and analyze evolution of morphological characters, we analyzed sequence variation for a large sampling of these families and various rosid outgroups using rbcL, trnL-F, and ndhF plastid regions. Urticalean rosids are derived out of a lineage including Barbeyaceae, Dirachmaceae, Elaeagnaceae, and Rhamnaceae, with Rosaceae less closely related; thus, they are imbedded within Rosales. Ulmaceae are the sister to all remaining families. Cannabaceae are derived out of a subclade of Celtidaceae; this expanded family should be called Cannabaceae. Cecropiaceae are derived within Urticaceae and are polyphyletic with Poikilospermum derived elsewhere within Urticaceae; this expanded family should be called Urticaceae. Monophyletic Moraceae are sister to this expanded Urticaceae. Support for these relationships comes from a number of morphological characters (floral sexuality, presence or absence of hypanthium, stamen type and dehiscence, pollen pore number, ovule position, and embryo alignment) and chromosome numbers. Most fruit types, in terms of ecological dispersal, are derived independently multiple times and are strongly correlated with habitat. 3aRosales 3aphylogeny 3achemotaxonomy 3anucleotide sequences 3ataxonomic revisions 3achloroplast DNA 0amolecular sequence data1 aMorawetz, J.1 aPires, J.C.1 aNepokroeff, M.1 aConti, E.1 aZjhra, M.1 aHall, J.C.1 aChase, M.W.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2002 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.1531-1546dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.89.9.15313Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03379naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007800148300001600226500001500242520158000257650002101837650002201858650002501880650001901905650002001924650001001944650002101954650001201975650002401987650001802011650002302029650002302052650002302075650000802098650001002106650001702116650001702133650003502150650001202185650002802197650002102225650003002246650001702276650002502293653001902318653001402337653001402351653001302365653002802378653001702406653001802423653001902441653002502460653001702485700001402502700001602516700001402532773008102546852000902627930003302636945001302669946001102682655001202693IND2038087620221119073547.0940321e199311  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203808762DNAL7 a82190862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangstad, O.P.14aThe myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase) gene family in Brassicaceae  ap. 511-524.  a2019-12-05  aThe glucosinolate hydrolyzing enzymes myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.3.1) are encoded by a multigene family consisting of two subgroups. The first two nuclear genes representing each of these two subgroups of the new gene family, Myr1.Bn1 and Myr2.Bn1, from Brassica napus have been cloned and sequenced. Based on conserved regions in cDNA of three species, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers were made, and used to amplify and characterize the structure of the myrosinase genes in seven species of Brassiceae. Southern hybridization analysis of PCR products and genomic DNA indicates that myrosinase is encoded by at least 14 genes in B. napus, with similar numbers in the other species of Brassicaceae investigated. The Myr1 gene cloned from B. napus has a 19 amino acid signal peptide and consists of 11 exons of sizes ranging from 54 to 256 bp and 10 introns of sizes from 75 to 229 bp. The Myr2 gene has a 20 amino acid signal peptide and consists of 12 exons ranging in size from 35 to 262 bp and 11 introns of sizes from 81 to 131 bp. The exons from the two genes have 83% homology at the amino acid level. The intron-exon splice sites are of GT..AG consensus type. The signal peptides and presence of sites for N-linked glycosylation, suggest transport and glycosylation through the ER-Golgi complex. The differences between the two genes are discussed on the basis of their predicted expression at different developmental stages in the plant. Both genes show homology to a conserved motif representing the glycosyl hydrolase family of enzymes. 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aBrassica napus 3athioglucosidase 3aexons 3amultigene family 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBrassicaxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aExons 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA Splicing 2aTerminology as Topic 0agenbank/z21978 0amyr2 gene 0amyr1 gene 0aBrassica 0amolecular sequence data 0amyr.bn1 gene 0amyr2.bn1 gene 0agenbank/z21977 0anucleotide sequences 0aBrassicaceae1 aWinge, P.1 aHusebye, H.1 aBones, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1993 Nov., v. 23, no. 3 p.511-524x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02678naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007800204300002000282506007600302520149000378506003701868650001001905650001401915650001201929650001201941650001401953700001901967700001601986773017602002852000902178856008302187930003302270946001302303655001202316IND4423325720221207070150.0090718e20090714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442332572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09056141062doi7 aPMC27013442pmcid7 a195532112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrashow, Rachel10aReliable neuromodulation from circuits with variable underlying structure  ap. 11742-11746.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent work argues that similar network performance can result from highly variable sets of network parameters, raising the question of whether neuromodulation can be reliable across individuals with networks with different sets of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane conductances. To address this question, we used the dynamic clamp to construct 2-cell reciprocally inhibitory networks from gastric mill (GM) neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion. When the strength of the artificial inhibitory synapses (gsyn) and the conductance of an artificial Ih (gh) were varied with the dynamic clamp, a variety of network behaviors resulted, including regions of stable alternating bursting. Maps of network output as a function of gsyn and gh were constructed in normal saline and again in the presence of serotonin or oxotremorine. Both serotonin and oxotremorine depolarize and excite isolated individual GM neurons, but by different cellular mechanisms. Serotonin and oxotremorine each increased the size of the parameter regions that supported alternating bursting, and, on average, increased burst frequency. Nonetheless, in both cases some parameter sets within the sample space deviated from the mean population response and decreased in frequency. These data provide insight into why pharmacological treatments that work in most individuals can generate anomalous actions in a few individuals, and they have implications for understanding the evolution of nervous systems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrabs 3aevolution 3aganglia 3aneurons 3aserotonin1 aBrookings, Ted1 aMarder, Eve0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 14, v. 106, no. 28 p.11742-11746dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09056141063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01096naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245011900134300001600253520023800269650002300507650003500530650001800565653002100583700001300604700001600617773011200633852000900745939003300754945000800787946001100795655001200806991587057420742620221119072441.0830801e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830067162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSastry, K.N.V.10aInfectivity of Theileria annulata infected Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum adult ticks incubated at 37 C and 95% RH  ap. 372-376.  aTheileria annulata, infectivity to susceptible calves inoculated with ground-up-tick-supernate prepared from Theileria annulata-infected Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum which had been incubated at 37 C and 95% RH for various intervals 3aTheileria annulata 3aHyalomma anatolicum anatolicum 3apathogenicity 0aVectors, Acarina1 aDhar, S.1 aSingh, R.P.0 tJournal of research - Haryana Agricultural University.g1982 Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.372-376x0379-40087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830801c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245006600209300002000275506007600295520171600371506003702087650001002124650001402134650001102148650001102159650001102170650001802181650001902199700002402218700003002242700001802272700002602290700002102316773017602337852000902513856008302522930003302605946001302638655001202651IND4423325820221207072755.0090718e20090714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442332582DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09036411062doi7 aPMC27036692pmcid7 a195646052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassett, Danielle S.10aCognitive fitness of cost-efficient brain functional networks  ap. 11747-11752.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe human brain's capacity for cognitive function is thought to depend on coordinated activity in sparsely connected, complex networks organized over many scales of space and time. Recent work has demonstrated that human brain networks constructed from neuroimaging data have economical small-world properties that confer high efficiency of information processing at relatively low connection cost. However, it has been unclear how the architecture of complex brain networks functioning at different frequencies can be related to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks. Here, we show that impaired accuracy of working memory could be related to suboptimal cost efficiency of brain functional networks operating in the classical β frequency band, 15-30 Hz. We analyzed brain functional networks derived from magnetoencephalography data recorded during working-memory task performance in 29 healthy volunteers and 28 people with schizophrenia. Networks functioning at higher frequencies had greater global cost efficiency than low-frequency networks in both groups. Superior task performance was positively correlated with global cost efficiency of the β-band network and specifically with cost efficiency of nodes in left lateral parietal and frontal areas. These results are consistent with biophysical models highlighting the importance of β-band oscillations for long-distance functional connections in brain networks and with pathophysiological models of schizophrenia as a dysconnection syndrome. More generally, they echo the saying that "less is more": The information processing performance of a network can be enhanced by a sparse or low-cost configuration with disproportionately high efficiency.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acognition 3ahumans 3amemory 3amodels 3aschizophrenia 3aspace and time1 aBullmore, Edward T.1 aMeyer-Lindenberg, Andreas1 aApud, Jose A.1 aWeinberger, Daniel R.1 aCoppola, Richard0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 14, v. 106, no. 28 p.11747-11752dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09036411063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle05162naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245014500202300001400347500014300361500002400504500001500528520322400543650001503767650001603782650002703798650001703825650001603842650002103858650002903879650001503908650003203923650002003955650002103975650002403996650002604020650001904046650001104065650001804076650002004094650000904114650001004123653001904133653002304152653001704175700002004192700001804212700002104230700001904251700001604270773008704286852000904373856007304382930003304455945002504488946001104513655001204524IND4382326120221119072404.0060727e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438232612DNAL7 a220627132pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ5021 aScollan, N.10aInnovations in beef production systems that enhance the nutritional and health value of beef lipids and their relationship with meat quality  ap. 17-33.  aPaper presented at the 52nd International Congress of Meat Science and Technology (52nd ICoMST) held, August 13-18, 2006, Dublin, Ireland.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aConsumers are becoming more aware of the relationships between diet and health and this has increased consumer interest in the nutritional value of foods. This is impacting on the demand for foods which contain functional components that play important roles in health maintenance and disease prevention. For beef, much attention has been given to lipids. This paper reviews strategies for increasing the content of beneficial omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and reducing saturated fatty acids (SFA) in beef. Particular attention is given to intramuscular fat (IMF) and the relationships between fatty acid composition and key meat quality parameters including colour shelf life and sensory attributes. Despite the high levels of ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary PUFA, nutrition is the major route for increasing the content of beneficial fatty acids in beef. Feeding grass or concentrates containing linseed (rich in αa-linolenic acid, 18:3n - 3) in the diet increases the content of 18:3n - 3 and its longer chain derivative eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n - 3) in beef muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in a lower n - 6:n - 3 ratio. Grass feeding also increases docasahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n - 3). Feeding PUFA rich lipids which are protected from ruminal biohydrogenation result in further enhancement of the PUFA in meat with concomitant beneficial improvements in the ratio of polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids (P:S ratio) and n - 6:n - 3 ratio. The main CLA isomer in beef is CLA cis-9, trans-11 and it is mainly associated with the triacylglycerol lipid fraction and therefore is positively correlated with level of fatness. The level of CLA cis-9, trans-11 in beef is related to (1) the amount of this isomer produced in the rumen and (2) synthesis in the tissue, by delta-9 desaturase, from ruminally produced trans vaccenic acid (18:1 trans-11; TVA). Feeding PUFA-rich diets increases the content of CLA cis-9, trans-11 in beef. Trans-fatty acids in foods are of rising importance and knowledge of the differential effects of the individual trans isomers is increasing. TVA is the major trans 18:1 isomer in beef and as the precursor for tissue CLA in both animals and man should be considered as a neutral or beneficial trans-isomer. Increasing the content of n - 3 PUFA in beef can influence colour shelf life and sensory attributes of the meat. As the content of n - 3 PUFA increases then sensory attributes such as "greasy" and "fishy" score higher and colour shelf life may be reduced. Under these situations, high levels of vitamin E are necessary to help stabilise the effects of incorporating high levels of long chain PUFA into meat. However, grass feeding not only increases n - 3 PUFA and CLA but, due to its high content of vitamin E, colour shelf life is improved. It is evident that opportunities exist to enhance the content of health promoting fatty acids in beef and beef products offering opportunities to add value and contribute to market differentiation. However, it is imperative that these approaches to deliver "functional" attributes do not compromise on the health value (lipoperoxidation) or the taste of beef products. 3ashelf life 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3abeef quality 3abeef cattle 3afood composition 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3atechnology 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat production 3ahealth promotion 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3abody fat distribution 3aadipose tissue 3aflavor 3alipid content 3anutritive value 3abeef 3acolor 0anew technology 0asensory properties 0ameat science1 aHocquette, J.F.1 aNuernberg, K.1 aDannenberger, D.1 aRichardson, I.1 aMoloney, A.0 tMeat science.g2006 Sept., v. 74, no. 1 p.17-33dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.05.0023electronic resource  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/10/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01894naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002300160245011700183300001800300500002400318500001500342520050100357650002800858650001700886650001800903650002300921650001200944650002600956650001300982650001400995651001301009653002401022653001801046700001601064773018301080852000901263856008101272856004801353930003301401945001301434946001301447655001201460IND2332013320221119072155.0030415e200209  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233201332DNAL7 a216657382pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.89.9.13612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaolillo, D.J.

This system is suitable for the evaluation of bread in commercial bakeries. Dough thickness and baking temperature/time conditions were varied: doughs sheeted to < 3.0 mm thick require baking temperatures higher than 500 degrees C whereas doughs that are thicker than this will benefit from temperatures lower than 500 degrees C. Thinner doughs baked at higher temperatures for shorter times produced better quality bread. The processing variables identified as being optimal in this study were incorporated into a test baking method. This method gave reproducible results and greater discrimination between flour samples than a previous method. 3abreadmaking 3abaking 3atemperature 3afood quality 3aduration 3adough 3abreads 3athickness1 aMcMaster, G.J.1 aTomlinson, J.D.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 53, no. 4 p.527-540x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02762naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014400125300001600269520173600285650001002021650001202031650001302043650000902056650001802065650001002083650001402093653002602107653001602133653001602149653001502165700001602180700002202196700001802218773009902236852000902335939003302344946001102377655001202388IND9101629120221119072046.0910401s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910162912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohler, T.10aComparison of different digesta collection methods to determine the apparent digestibilities of the nutrients at the terminal ileum in pigs  ap. 465-475.  aThree different cannulation techniques in pigs were tested with 15 crossbred castrates. Four pigs were fitted with a simple T-cannula, six pigs with a post-valve T-caecum cannula (PVTC cannula) and five pigs with ileocaecal re-entrant cannulas. Four diets were tested: a conventional diet, a pectin-rich diet, a crude fibre-rich diet and a semisynthetic diet. For quantitative collection of ileal digesta the PVTC cannulation technique was tested for homogeneity of sampling. Cr2O3 and TiO2 were used as solid phase markers and Co-EDTA as a liquid phase marker. The digestibilities of dry matter, nitrogen, crude fibre, ADF and NDF were determined. Digestibilities measured with re-entrant cannula as a quantitative collection method were sometimes significantly higher (P < 0.05) than with the other cannulas. After correction to 100% Cr recovery the differences were reduced to less than 5 Nitrogen digestibility measured with the re-entrant cannula was lower than with the PVTC cannula in the fibre-rich and semisynthetic diets. The Cr recovery was mostly lower than 100%, except with PVTC cannulas and the semisynthetic diet. The recovery rates of Co were higher than those of Cr. In the semisynthetic diet, recoveries of Co and Cr were similar. The recovery rate of TiO2 with the semisynthetic diet was lower than that of the other two markers. The recovery rates of the markers depended on fibre contents of diets. With the pectin-rich and fibre-rich diets the Cr and Co recoveries were lower than with the control diet. In general, digestibility coefficients measured with the three different cannulation techniques were different. However, when corrections were made for marker recoveries there were only small differences. 3aswine 3adigesta 3asampling 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aileum 3anutrients 0adigestibility markers 0acomparisons 0acannulation 0acollection1 aHuisman, J.1 aHartog, L.A. den.1 aMosenthin, R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 53, no. 4 p.465-475x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03182naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002200161245007800183300001600261500002400277520194800301650001602249650001802265650002102283650002302304650002502327650002402352650002302376650001402399650001302413653002302426700001902449700002402468773011002492852000902602856009202611930003302703945002502736946001102761655001202772IND4422646620140725000000.0090703e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442264662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3101 aMolloy, Philip P.10aEffects of marine reserve age on fish populations: a global meta-analysis  ap. 743-751.  aIncludes references  a1. Marine reserves are widely used for conservation and fisheries management. However, there is debate surrounding the speed of population recovery inside reserves and how recovery differs among species. Here, we determine how reserve effectiveness in enhancing fish density changes with reserve age. We also examine how the effects of protection vary between fished and non-fished species and among species of different body sizes, which we use as a proxy for life history and ecology. 2. We meta-analysed over 1000 ratios of fish densities (inside : outside reserves) taken from reserves of 1-26 years old from around the world. 3. Overall, older reserves were more effective than younger reserves, with fish densities increasing within reserves by ~5% per annum relative to unprotected areas. Reserves older than 15 years consistently harboured more fish compared with unprotected areas; younger reserves were less reliably effective. 4. Large, fished species responded strongly and positively to protection in old (>15 years) and, unexpectedly, in new and young ([less-than or equal to]10 years) reserves. Small, fished species and non-fished species of all sizes showed weaker responses to protection that did not vary predictably with reserve age. 5. We expected large fish to respond more slowly to protection than smaller species. We also expected small species to decline after large fish had recovered (i.e. trophic cascades). Neither prediction was supported. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analyses demonstrate that, globally, old reserves are more effective than young reserves at increasing fish densities. Our results imply that reserves should be maintained for up to 15 years following establishment, even if they initially appear ineffective. If protection is maintained for long enough, fish densities within reserves will recover and such benefits will be particularly pronounced for large, locally fished species. 3amarine fish 3ameta-analysis 3amarine fisheries 3aconservation areas 3afisheries management 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation density 3abody size 3aduration 0aliterature reviews1 aMcLean, Ian B.1 aCôté, Isabelle M.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2009 Aug., v. 46, no. 4 p.743-751dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01662.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01022naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012400128300001600252500001500268520020800283650001600491650001500507651001200522653001100534653001600545700001900561773009900580852000900679939003300688946001100721655001200732IND9101630020221119072214.0910401s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910163002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmogbai, F.E.10aLipid composition of the Mesogastropods, Pachymelania fusca and Tympanosus fuscatus, found in coastal waters of Nigeria  ap. 563-566.  a2019-12-04  aThe lipid and fatty acid composition of the mesogastropods (periwinkles) Pachymelania fusca var quadraserieta and Tympanosus fuscatus var radula were studied using TLC and gas chromatographic techniques. 3afatty acids 3aGastropoda 3aNigeria 0alipids 0aperiwinkles1 aAkubugwo, I.E.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 53, no. 4 p.563-566x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02144naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015700127300001600284520109400300650000901394650001901403650002101422650001801443650002201461650001301483650001101496650002301507650001001530650001101540650001901551650001301570653001701583700001801600773009901618852000901717939003301726946001101759655001201770IND9101629520221119072005.0910401s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910162952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarmer, L.J.10aInteraction of lipid in the Maillard reaction between cysteine and ribose: the effect of a triglyceride and three phospholipids on the volatile products  ap. 505-525.  aThe inclusion of phospholipid in the Maillard reaction between cysteine and ribose is known to modify the volatile aroma compounds produced. The contributions made to the headspace volatiles by 60 major products of this reaction have been compared for four different lipids and their effect on aroma quality noted. The results described demonstrate marked dissimilarities between the behaviour of the four lipids. The most noticeable distinction was between the effect of triglyceride and the three phospholipids, but there were also variations in the way that each of the three phospholipids participated in the Maillard reaction. As well as displaying marked differences in volatile products, reaction mixtures containing the four lipids possessed distinct aroma characteristics; the phospholipids containing phosphatidylethanolamine conferred the most meat-like odour. These differences appear to be caused by the dissimilar fatty acid compositions and polar moieties. Thus this study underlines the importance of lipid interaction in the Maillard reaction for the formation of flavour. 3abeef 3aadipose tissue 3atriacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 3aMaillard reaction 3acysteine 3aribose 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3aflavor 3amuscle tissues 3aextracts 0ainteractions1 aMottram, D.S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 53, no. 4 p.505-525x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02757naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007800126300001800204520141900222650001401641650002201655650002501677650002501702650001401727650000901741650001801750650002601768650000901794650003301803650000901836650001301845650001101858650001801869650003101887650001301918650001701931650002301948650001401971700001701985700001302002773009502015852000902110856012202119939003302241946001302274655001202287IND4443804620221119072427.0101019e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444380462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNindo, C.I.10aThermal Properties of Aloe Vera Powder and Rheology of Reconstituted Gels  ap. 1193-1200.  aAloe vera (Aloe barbadensis L.) is a plant from the lily family that possesses therapeutic and antioxidant properties. Extracts from aloe vera leaves are widely used in skin care products, and recently in health drinks and supplements. Substandard aloe products arising from poor processing methods or adulteration with other compounds is a major problem for the aloe industry. Functional properties of aloe vera may be affected by processing procedures that involve heat or shearing action. In this study, aloe vera extract was dried using spray drying (SD), freeze drying (FD), and Refractance Window (RW) drying methods to investigate the effect of those methods on glass transition temperature (Tg), total carbohydrates, reducing groups, particle size distribution, and viscosity of solutions formed after reconstitution with deionized water. The Tg of SD aloe was in the range of 65°C ±3.2°C compared to 70°C to 78°C for the latter two drying methods. Addition of corn maltodextrin contributed to shifts in Tg of aloe powder. Solutions prepared from spray-dried aloe had the lowest viscosity, while freeze-dried and RW-dried counterparts had higher and nearly equal consistency. The activation energy for network formation of solutions reconstituted from SD powder was 23.9 ±0.1 kJ mol-1, which was slightly lower than the 24.6 ±0.3 and 24.7 ±0.4 kJ mol-1 obtained with FD and RW drying, respectively. 3aAloe vera 3aactivation energy 3aadulterated products 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3acorn 3afreeze drying 3afunctional properties 3agels 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3aindustry 3aleaves 3amaltodextrins 3aparticle size distribution 3arheology 3aspray drying 3athermal properties 3aviscosity1 aPowers, J.R.1 aTang, J.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1193-1200wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140424  aOther US 7aarticle03001naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245006300135300001800198520182200216650001302038650001402051650002402065650001702089650001302106650002102119650001902140650001502159650001902174650001102193650001902204650001602223650002502239650001802264700001602282700002102298773009502319852000902414856012202423939003302545946001302578655001202591IND4443804220221119072407.0101019e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444380422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinoza-Perez, J.D.10aEpoxidized High-Oleic Vegetable Oils Applied to Composites  ap. 1167-1174.  aVegetable oils are a renewable source for the production of oleochemicals. Oils with high oleic and low saturate content may be an excellent source for producing epoxy resins because of the uniform distribution of cross-linking sites. Bio-based epoxy resins can be used as matrix components for composite materials. Vegetable oils with oleic acid content varying from 22% to 86% were epoxidized in situ with peracetic acid and a heterogeneous catalyst. Contents of 30%, 35%, and 40% (% wt of total matrix) of bio-based epoxy resins were blended with a synthetic epoxy resin and an anhydride curing agent to be applied as the matrix in the preparation of composites using E-glass as the structural fiber. A control was also prepared with a 100% synthetic epoxy resin. Mechanical properties (flexural properties, interlaminar shear strength, and dynamic mechanical analysis) of the produced composite materials were evaluated. More flexible but less resistant composites were obtained as the content of oleic acid in the initial vegetable oil and the content of bio-based resin increased. Toughness increased at lower levels of oleic acid content. Interlaminar shear strength showed low adhesion of the matrix-fiber at a bio-based epoxy resin content of 40%. High homogeneity and slightly reduced glass transition temperatures were shown in composites with high-oleic bio-based resins when compared with the control. The application of bio-based epoxy resins in the production of composites materials helps decrease the dependence on petroleum-based resins and may lead to a high added-value product from vegetable oils. However, future studies are needed to increase the adhesion of matrices containing bio-based resin with synthetic and natural fibers, which will improve the mechanical performance of the composites. 3aadhesion 3acatalysts 3acomposite materials 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3aglass transition 3anatural fibers 3aoleic acid 3aperacetic acid 3aresins 3ashear strength 3atemperature 3avalue-added products 3avegetable oil1 aUlven, C.A.1 aWiesenborn, D.P.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1167-1174wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140424  aOther US 7aarticle04422naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014000185300001600325500001500341520191700356650002102273650002902294650001602323650002402339650001002363650001402373650002002387650001602407650001802423650001902441650003102460650001702491650002602508650001702534650001602551650002702567650001702594650002602611650001302637650001202650650002402662650001602686650001302702650003102715650005102746650006402797650003502861650003002896650003802926650001802964650002502982650004403007650002903051650003103080650003403111650005303145653001503198653002403213653001303237653002403250653001503274653002703289700001803316700001503334700002603349773011503375852000903490856008503499930003303584946001103617655001203628IND4398164720221119072049.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439816472DNAL7 a178858092pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9241-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Mingsheng 10aGenome-wide analysis of Arabidopsis responsive transcriptome to nitrogen limitation and its regulation by the ubiquitin ligase gene NLA  ap. 775-797.  a2019-12-05  aNitrogen is an essential mineral nutrient and is required in great abundance for plant growth and development. Insufficient nitrogen triggers extensive physiological and biochemical changes in plants which constitute a set of adaptive responses to nitrogen limitation. In this study, to determine the genome-wide transcriptome response to nitrogen limitation, Arabidopsis plants were grown with limiting (3 mM) and sufficient (10 mM) nitrate, respectively, and their gene expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. In addition to inducing the adaptive responses in Arabidopsis, nitrogen limitation altered the expression levels of 629 genes with 340 up-regulated and 289 down-regulated. The up-regulated group included the genes involved in protein degradation and the biosynthesis of anthocyanin and phenylpropanoids. The down-regulated group contained the genes functioning in photosynthesis and in the synthesis of nitrogenous macromolecules such as chlorophyll, proteins, amino acids and nucleotides. Numerous nitrogen limitation responsive genes encode transcription factors, signal transduction components, and proteins required for hormone synthesis and response. The Arabidopsis nitrogen limitation adaptation mutant (nla) is defective in developing the nitrogen limitation adaptive responses. The microarray analysis revealed that the absence of the functional NLA in the nla mutant extensively altered its responsive transcriptome to nitrogen limitation. In this mutant 1122 genes were up-regulated and 622 repressed. It was also found that the nla mutant phenotype was associated with the early induction of senescence-associated genes. This study presents a genome-wide view of Arabidopsis transcriptome response to nitrogen limitation and its regulation by NLA, and provides information to probe the molecular mechanism controlling plant adaptability to nitrogen limitation. 3aphenylpropanoids 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3anucleotides 3asignal transduction 3agenes 3aphenotype 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3atranscriptome 3aphotosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3aanthocyanins 3atranscription factors 3aplant growth 3aArabidopsis 3agrowth and development 3abiosynthesis 3amicroarray technology 3anitrogen 3amutants 3aprotein degradation 3achlorophyll 3anitrates 2aAnthocyaninsxbiosynthesis 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transportxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPhotosynthesisxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0anla mutant 0aMicroarray analysis 0aproteins 0aNitrogen limitation 0aRegulation 0aTranscriptome response1 aBi, Yong-Mei 1 aZhu, Tong 1 aRothstein, Steven J. 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Dec., v. 65, no. 6 p.775-797dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9241-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04000naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008600183300001600269520159100285650001601876650001801892650001701910650002601927650001301953650003101966650001001997650002002007650001202027650001302039650001902052650001902071650001602090650002102106650001402127650002402141650002002165650002202185650003002207650002602237650004802263650003702311650002002348650002502368650003002393650003802423650002402461650002302485650001302508650001202521650005102533650002202584650002402606650003102630653002902661653002702690653002202717700001702739700001502756700001702771700001702788700001302805700001802818700001702836700002102853700001902874700001702893700001302910773012102923852000903044856008503053930003303138946001103171655001203182IND4393044520221119072101.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439304452DNAL7 a175335122pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9182-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Youning 10aArabidopsis EIN2 modulates stress response through abscisic acid response pathway  ap. 633-644.  aThe nuclear protein ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2) is a central component of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in plants, and plays an important role in mediating cross-links between several hormone response pathways, including abscisic acid (ABA). ABA mediates stress responses in plants, but there is no report on the role of EIN2 on plant response to salt and osmotic stresses. Here, we show that EIN2 gene regulates plant response to osmotic and salt stress through an ABA-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis. The expression of the EIN2 gene is down-regulated by salt and osmotic stress. An Arabidopsis EIN2 null mutant was supersensitive to both salt and osmotic stress conditions. Disruption of EIN2 specifically altered the expression pattern of stress marker gene RD29B in response to the stresses, but not the stress- or ABA-responsive genes RD29A and RD22, suggesting EIN2 modulates plant stress responses through the RD29B branch of the ABA response. Furthermore, disruption of EIN2 caused substantial increase in ABA. Lastly, our data showed that mutations of other key genes in ethylene pathway also had altered sensitivity to abiotic stresses, indicating that the intact ethylene may involve in the stress response. Taken together, the results identified EIN2 as a cross-link node in ethylene, ABA and stress signaling pathways, and EIN2 is necessary to induce developmental arrest during seed germination, and seedling establishment, as well as subsequent vegetative growth, thereby allowing the survival and growth of plants under the adverse environmental conditions. 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3acrosslinking 3aenvironmental factors 3aethylene 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amutants 3amutation 3aosmotic stress 3aplant response 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3avegetative growth 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDown-Regulation 2aEthylenesxchemistry 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMannitolxchemistry 2aModels, Biological 2aMutation 2aOsmosis 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSaltsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aSodium Chloridexchemistry 0aStress signaling pathway 0aEthylene Insensitive 2 0aAbscisic acid ABA1 aLiu, Zhuang.1 aLi, Kexue 1 aSun, Feifei 1 aHu, Haizhou 1 aLi, Xia 1 aZhao, Yankun 1 aHan, Chunyu 1 aZhang, Wensheng 1 aDuan, Yunfeng 1 aLiu, Mengyu 1 aLi, Xia 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Aug., v. 64, no. 6 p.633-644dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9182-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03383naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007800144300001600222520162600238650001101864650001401875650002201889650001501911650001401926650001501940650001901955650001601974650001401990650001502004650002002019650002502039650002802064650001202092650003402104650003202138650004302170650002202213650005902235650001502294650002902309650005802338650001102396650003102407650004902438653004202487653003102529653003502560700001602595700001702611773009702628852000902725930003302734945001302767946001302780655001202793IND2047564620221119072155.0950831e199508  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204756462DNAL7 a85339892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, D.J.10aProthrombotic events in the prodromal stages of acute laminitis in horses  ap. 986-991.  aProthrombotic changes occurring in the prodromal stages of carbohydrate-induced laminitis were investigated. Hemostatic alterations were evaluated by determining platelet counts, platelet survival, activated partial thromboplastin time, one-stage prothrombin time, and monocyte procoagulant activity. Thrombosis of vessels in the hoof wall was evaluated by contrast arteriography and histologic examination. Of 5 horses, 4 became lame between 28 and 52 hours after carbohydrate administration. Mean platelet count in laminitis-affected horses was lower throughout the prodromal stages of laminitis, compared with that in control horses, but differences were not statistically significant. However, survival of indium-111-labeled platelets was less than the value in control horses by 6 hours after carbohydrate administration. Arteriography of disarticulated feet revealed marked reduction in blood supply to hooves in laminitis-affected horses. Histologic examination of the laminar dermis disclosed microthrombi in venules of the laminar dermis in 2 of 4 affected horses. Statistically significant changes in prothrombin time were not observed, and changes in activated partial thromboplastin time were slight and occurred only at the onset of lameness. Statistically significant changes in monocyte procoagulant activity were not observed. Plasma endotoxin-like activity was not detected in laminitis-affected horses. These data indicate that platelet survival was decreased within the first 6 hours after induction of carbohydrate-induced laminitis, but systemic activation of the coagulation system was not detected. 3ahorses 3alaminitis 3ablood coagulation 3athrombosis 3amortality 3ahemostasis 3athromboplastin 3aprothrombin 3amonocytes 3ablood flow 3ablood platelets 3ablood platelet count 2aAngiographyxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aBlood Coagulationxphysiology 2aBlood Plateletsxphysiology 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadverse effects 2aEndotoxinsxblood 2aFoot Diseasesxbloodxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aHemostasis 2aHoof and Clawxpathology 2aHorse Diseasesxbloodxchemically inducedxpathology. 2aHorses 2aLameness, Animalxetiology 2aThrombosisxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 0aactivated partial thromboplastin time 0aone-stage prothrombin time 0amonocyte procoagulant activity1 aTrent, A.M.1 aJohnston, G.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1995 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.986-991x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009800129300001600227500002400243500001500267520165300282650001201935650001501947650001401962650002701976650001302003650002402016650001702040650001902057651002002076653001602096653001702112653002002129653001602149773012602165852000902291856007002300930003302370945001302403946001102416655001202427IND2332006820221119072318.0030415e20020628ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233200682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, W.A.10aLatitudinal variation in reproductive behavior in the pearl oyster, Pinctada albina sugillata  ap. 333-345.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIncreased interest in periculture in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, encouraged an assessment of the changes in the reproductive condition of pearl oyster, Pinctada albina sugillata. Over a 2-year period, macroscopic and histological observations were made of oysters collected monthly from Port Stephens. In contrast to more northerly populations, P. albina sugillata in NSW were found to have a truncated breeding season. Reproductive activity was greatest from late spring to early autumn with oysters in poor reproductive condition during winter. Peaks in reproductive indices occurred in October 1998, March 1999, January 2000 and April 2000. Spat collectors deployed at two sites in Port Stephens found spat fall to be restricted to the months of November-January, indicating that the autumnal peaks (March and April) in the reproductive activity did not result in subsequent recruitment. These results supported previous observations of latitudinal change in the reproductive behavior of pearl oysters in which populations at higher latitudes have truncated breeding seasons that tend to occur during the warmer months. Recruitment to spat collectors was low and variable, discouraging the collection of wild spat for culture, yet the spring increase in reproductive activity was coincident with the likely time for hatchery propagation. Infestations of shell-boring organisms were found among wild oysters although the degree of shell damage was almost invariably low. Most common were infestations of spionid polychaetes, present in 30% of the shells collected, with several larger oysters showing shell damage typical of boring sponges. 3aoysters 3aPolychaeta 3ahistology 3ageographical variation 3alatitude 3asexual reproduction 3awild animals 3abody condition 3aNew South Wales 0arecruitment 0areproduction 0aspawning season 0ainfestation0 tAquaculture.g2002 June 28, , no. 1/4 p.333-345dElsevier Pub.

In studying these interactions, it is desirable to collect volatiles from plants that have not been excised and are growing under as natural conditions as possible. We compared a vessel of borosilicate glass and Nylon-6 or polyester [poly(ethyleneterephthalate) or PET] cooking bags for enclosing plants during collection of volatiles. A push-pull airflow system was used, and volatiles were trapped on Tenax TA and analyzed by gas chromatography after thermal desorption. Low levels of impurities were found for the glass vessel and polyester bags. Nylon bags contained higher levels and more impurities. Recoveries of standards of 10 plant volatiles were measured in static and dynamic systems. In a static air system, there was good recovery only from the glass vessel. In a dynamic system, there was generally good recovery from both the glass vessel and polyester bags. Recoveries of α-pinene and (Z)-jasmone were poor throughout. The former was shown to have a very low breakthrough volume on the Tenax TA adsorbent, and the latter may be strongly adsorbed on glass. All three materials were essentially transparent in the IR and visible (photosynthetic) range but with significantly different absorptions in the UV range. In a simulated dynamic entrainment in full sunlight, internal vessel temperatures were higher than ambient by up to 9.5°C in the glass vessel and 7.5°C in the polyester bag. Lower increases in temperature relative to ambient (<1°C) were recorded when entrainments were conducted in the shade. In a field trial, the profiles of volatiles collected from an apple tree infested with rosy apple aphid using a glass vessel and a polyester bag were similar. Polyester bags are recommended as more convenient than glass vessels for the enclosure of plants during the collection of volatiles. 3achemical constituents of plants 3avolatile compounds 3aheadspace analysis 2aAdsorption 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aCaprolactamxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aGlassxchemistry 2aMalusxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPolyethylene Terephthalatesxchemistry 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aVolatilization 0achemical analysis1 aPoppy, G.M.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2006 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.845-864dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-006-9039-63electronic resource  a20060916b20061003c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/09/16  aOther US 7aarticle03130naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238500002400254520194700278650002902225650001902254650002202273650001302295650001402308650002502322650002002347650001602367651001802383653001702401700001602418700002302434700001302457773012602470852000902596856007002605930003302675945001302708946001102721655001202732IND2332005520221119072222.0030415e20020628ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233200552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemaire, P.10aCombined effect of temperature and salinity on osmoregulation of juvenile and subadult Penaeus stylirostris  ap. 307-317.  aIncludes references  aIn New Caledonia, the "syndrome 93," which results in mass mortalities of farmed shrimp Penaeus stylirostris, occurs during the transitional and the cold seasons. The transitional season is characterized by an important fall in the average water temperature from 28 to 19 degrees C in 2 weeks. Besides this marked temperature fall, there are also nyctemeral temperature changes of up to 7 degrees C in 12 h. The cold season is characterized by an average water temperature of 19 degrees C with extreme lows of 14 degrees C. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and its variations on the osmoregulatory capacity of juvenile (7-10 g average weight) and subadult (25 g average weight) shrimps subjected to conditions of different salinity. A reduction in temperature level resulted in a decreased osmoregulatory capacity (OC) (defined as the difference between the osmolality of the haemolymph and that of sea water) at low salinity (hyper-CO) and at high salinity (hypo-CO), respectively, below and above the isoosmotic point (26.2 ppt). In subadult shrimps, the hyper-CO was affected when temperature dropped from 26 to 22 degrees C. The hypo-CO was modified only when temperature decreased down to 15 degrees C. Furthermore, the sensitiveness of osmoregulation to temperature changes was dependent on the developmental stage of the shrimp. Subadults were more sensitive than juvenile animals. The value of the isoosmotic point, which did not depend on the shrimp developmental stage, increased when temperature decreased to 17 or 15 degrees C. Our results provide an additional explanation of the "syndrome 93" and display the unfavourable influence of marked temperature drop on shrimp health. Our research could provide a possibility of seeking a nutritional and/or genetic solution to improve the capacity of the shrimps to maintain their homeostasis within a rearing medium with fluctuating temperatures. 3aLitopenaeus stylirostris 3aosmoregulation 3awater temperature 3asalinity 3amortality 3adevelopmental stages 3aanimal diseases 3ahomeostasis 3aNew Caledonia 0ainteractions1 aBernard, E.1 aMartinez-Paz, J.A.1 aChim, L.0 tAquaculture.g2002 June 28, , no. 1/4 p.307-317dElsevier Pub.

Egg batches of 500 g were inseminated with semen frozen in sixteen 1.2-ml straws (sperm/egg ratio = 2.7 x 10(6):1). To be able to handle this number of straws at the same time, they were connected in self-made, flexible plastic racks into "straw packages". The straws were filled with diluted semen, and the whole straw packages frozen in the vapor of liquid nitrogen are 1 cm above the surface of liquid nitrogen. As the racks remained flexible in liquid nitrogen, the straw packages could be rolled together for storage in cans of commercial liquid nitrogen containers. For thawing, the straw packages were rolled out and thawed in warm water (30 degrees C, 30 s). Then, they were placed over the eggs and the straws were cut open to release the semen. The semen was mixed with the eggs and, thereafter, 250-ml fertilization solution was added under constant mixing. The fertilization rates were 87.5 +/- 1.6% (n = 3) when inseminating 500-g egg batches with cryopreserved semen and 86.7 +/- 2.2% for the fresh semen controls. Only the dry fertilization technique yielded high fertilization rates when inseminating large egg quantities with cryopreserved semen, while other investigated parameters (amount of fertilization solution, arrangement of eggs) had no influence. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aspermatozoa 3aova 3ainsemination 3acryopreservation 0aevaluation 0abiological techniques1 aMansour, N.1 aWeismann, T.0 tAquaculture.g2002 June 28, , no. 1/4 p.359-367dElsevier Pub.

Direct evidence that hippocampal field CA1 displays clear regional, laminar, and pyramidal neuron differentiation is presented here, based on a systematic high-resolution analysis of a publicly accessible, genome-wide expression digital library (Allen Brain Atlas) [Lein et al. (2007) Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain. Nature 445:168-176]. First, genetic markers reveal distinct spatial expression domains and subdomains along the longitudinal (dorsal/septal/posterior to ventral/temporal/anterior) axis of field CA1. Second, genetic markers divide field CA1 pyramidal neurons into multiple subtypes with characteristic laminar distributions. And third, subcortical brain regions receiving axonal projections from molecularly distinct spatial domains of field CA1 display distinct global gene expression patterns, suggesting that field CA1 spatial domains may be genetically wired independently to form distinct functional networks related to cognition and emotion. Insights emerging from this genomic-anatomic approach provide a starting point for a detailed analysis of differential hippocampal structure-function organization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acerebral cortex 3acognition 3adigital libraries 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic markers 3amice 3aneurons1 aSwanson, Larry W.1 aChen, Lin1 aFanselow, Michael S.1 aToga, Arthur W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 14, v. 106, no. 28 p.11794-11799dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08126081063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012000125300001500245500002400260500001500284520158600299650001101885650002101896650002101917650002401938650002301962650002001985650001602005650002002021650002302041650001402064653002002078700001902098700002002117773012502137852000902262856007002271930003302341945001302374946001102387655001202398IND2331999420221119072328.0030415e20020628ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233199942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoed, K.H.10aDisease resistance and immune characteristics in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for lysozyme activity  ap. 91-101.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate the possibility of using serum lysozyme activity as a selection criterion to improve disease resistance in aquacultured fish, lines of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for high- or low-serum lysozyme activity were tested for disease resistance against Aeromonas salmonicida and Vibrio anguillarum and for humoral immune response to these pathogens after vaccination. Two challenge experiments were undertaken by intraperitoneally injecting doses of each pathogen. Following injection with A. salmonicida, the mortality was significantly different between the two lines in both experiments, with higher mortality in the high-lysozyme line compared to the low-lysozyme line. The difference between lines was particularly pronounced during the first days after injection. Following injection with V. anguillarum, the mortality showed no significant difference between the lysozyme lines. After vaccination, the levels of antibodies against both A. salmonicida and V. anguillarum and total amount of IgM were significantly higher in the high-lysozyme line, whereas no difference between lines was seen before vaccination. Selection for lysozyme activity appears to affect both the immune system and the disease resistance of rainbow trout. The prospects of using lysozyme as a selection criterion to improve disease resistance is, however, complicated by the fact that the association between lysozyme activity and the disease traits seems to be highly influenced by the immune status of the fish at the actual moment of sampling blood for lysozyme assessments. 3aVibrio 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ahumoral immunity 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3aenzyme activity 3aselection criteria 3amortality 0ablood chemistry1 aFevolden, S.E.1 aFjalestad, K.T.0 tAquaculture.g2002 June 28, , no. 1/4 p.91-101dElsevier Pub.

Based on pottery samples, the waste pits were dated to the end of the twelfth century or to the first half of the thirteenth century. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there were any differences in the soil chemical properties in arable and subsoil layers between cropmarks and the surrounding stands (controls) with normal crop growth. We also investigated how plant performance and biomass chemical properties differed between the cropmarks and controls. There were no differences in pH between cropmarks and controls in the 0-20 cm arable layer, but a substantially higher pH was recorded in the subsoil layer (30-40 cm) in cropmarks compared to controls, indicating deposited wood ash. Similar results were recorded for plant available (Mehlich III) P, Ca, Mg, As and Zn concentrations. Plant height, spike length, flag leaf length, tiller density, spike density and standing dry matter biomass were substantially higher in cropmarks than in controls on both sampling dates (25 May and 18 July 2009). Plant nutrition (N, K, Ca and Zn) was substantially improved in cropmarks compared to controls. A substantially higher density of roots was recorded in the subsoil of cropmarks compared to controls. In Central European lowlands, ancient wood ash in the subsoil can irreversibly increase stand productivity. The presence of subsoil archeological features within the agricultural landscape can substantially increase the spatial variability of crop production on arable fields. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural land 3aarsenic 3abiomass production 3acalcium 3acrop production 3aleaves 3alowlands 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3aroots 3asoil chemical properties 3aspring 3asurveys 3awinter wheat 3awood ash 3azinc 3aCentral European region 0aAerial archeological survey 0aNitrogen, phosphorus and potassium nutrition 0aPositive cropmarks 0aWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum)1 aOndráček, Jiří 1 aSmrž, Zdeněk.0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Feb., v. 339, no. 1-2 p.341-350dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0585-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02230naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002100158245012300179300001400302500002400316500001500340520107800355650001401433650001901447650001301466653002101479700001701500700001801517700001701535700001701552700001601569773010801585852000901693856007301702930003301775945002501808946001101833655001201844IND4382446320221119072514.0060731e20060710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438244632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aRichardson, J.C.14aThe influence of L-amino acid molecular structure on the phase transition temperature of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  ap. 22-27.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of molecular structure of small ionised molecules on the thermo-reversible sol:gel phase transition of a hydroxyalkyl cellulose ether has been investigated with respect to an L-amino acid series. The concentration dependency of the phase transition temperature of 1% w/w hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solutions in the presence of different amino acids was studied turbidimetrically. The effects of different amino acids ranged from -33.54 to +45.52 °C M-1. Correlations between the effect on phase transition temperature and amino acid molecular properties showed the strongest relationships with amino acid hydrophobicity. Small hydrophilic amino acids lowered the transition temperature, whereas large hydrophobic aromatic amino acids increased this temperature. The effect of different amino acids was proposed to be a balance between the ability of their hydrophilic regions to dehydrate and disrupt the polymer hydration sheath, and the ability of their hydrophobic regions to associate with and solubilise the methoxyl-dominated regions of the polymer. 3acellulose 3ahydrophobicity 3agelation 0aphase transition1 aFoster, C.S.1 aDoughty, S.W.1 aBurton, J.S.1 aMacRae, R.J.1 aMelia, C.D.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 July 10, v. 65, no. 1 p.22-27dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.11.0223electronic resource  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02795naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002600164245009000190300001400280500002400294500002300318500001500341520113000356650002201486650001801508650001001526650002401536650001901560650001501579650002901594650002201623651001101645653002501656700002201681700001901703700001601722700001801738700002501756700001701781700002001798700002401818700002601842700001901868700002001887700002401907700002101931773010101952852000902053856008602062930003302148945002502181946001102206655001202217IND4422593420221119072348.0090630e20090129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442259342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2007.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM300 0aP2001 aPeeters, Edwin T.H.M.10aAssessing ecological quality of shallow lakes: Does knowledge of transparency suffice  ap. 89-96.  aIncludes references  aSummary in German.  a2019-12-06  aThe European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that all aquatic ecosystems in their member states should reach 'good' ecological quality by 2015. To assess ecological quality, the WFD requires the definition of reference conditions using biological, physical and chemical indicators and the assignment of each water body to one of five quality classes using these indicators. Elaborate assessment schemes using large sets of variables are now being developed. Here we address the question whether all this is really needed and what the simplest assessment approach would be for the case of shallow lakes. We explore the relationships between the quality class assigned to a lake by experts in shallow lake ecology and a rich set of biological, physical, and chemical data. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were carried out based on data from 86 shallow lakes throughout Europe that were sampled in 2000 and/or 2001. Ecological quality of shallow lakes judged by experts was strongly correlated to physical and chemical variables associated with light regime and nutrients and much less to biological variables. 3asimulation models 3awater quality 3alakes 3aregression analysis 3aEuropean Union 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3ahydrologic models 3aEurope 0aenvironmental models1 aFranken, Rob J.M.1 aJeppesen, Erik1 aMoss, Brian1 aBecares, Eloy1 aHansson, Lars-Anders1 aRomo, Susana1 aKairesalo, Timo1 aGross, Elisabeth M.1 aDonk, E. vanq(Ellen)1 aNõges, Tiina.1 aIrvine, Kenneth1 aKornijów, Ryszard.1 aScheffer, Marten0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2009 Jan. 29, v. 10, no. 1 p.89-96dUrban & Fischerx1439-17917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2007.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090727b20090801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03037naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245006700144300001600211500001500227520177300242650002302015650001302038650001602051650001202067650001102079650002002090650003702110650001702147650000902164650004002173650003102213650004102244650002602285653000902311653002002320653001202340653001502352700001602367700001902383773009702402852000902499930003302508945001302541946001302554655001202567IND2046908820221119072202.0950719e199506  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204690882DNAL7 a75445562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeitz, S.E.10aEvaluation of marking materials for cutaneous surgical margins  ap. 826-833.  a2019-12-05  aMicroscopic evaluation of the margins of excised cutaneous neoplasms is of paramount importance for determining that neoplastic tissue does not extend to the excision borders. Dyes or pigments that indelibly mark the tissue should be more reliable than sectioning techniques or suture markers for identifying the surgical margins before and after tissue processing. We evaluated 5 pigments to select a material that could be rapidly applied by surgeons, and readily identified on histologic section by the pathologists. Twenty normal canine skin specimens were assigned to each of 5 groups. Each group was treated with artists' pigments in acetone, India ink in acetone, alcian blue, typists' correction fluid, or a commercially available marking kit. Ten specimens within each group were marked before formalin fixation, and 10 were marked after fixation. Application properties, fixation and processing properties, and microscopic characteristics were evaluated for each material. Application properties were acceptable for all marking materials on unfixed specimens, and for alcian blue, India ink in acetone, and correction fluid on fixed specimens. Fixation and processing properties were acceptable for all materials except correction fluid. All marking materials survived fixation and processing and colors were readily visualized under the microscope. Microscopic characteristics were acceptable for alcian blue, India ink in acetone, and the commercial kit. Overall, alcian blue was the best marking material, with India ink in acetone and the commercial kit also acceptable. Correction fluid and artist' pigments in acetone were not acceptable because pigment fragmentation and incomplete tissue coverage hindered microscopic evaluation of resection margins. 3asurgical equipment 3apigments 2aAlcian Blue 2aAnimals 2aCarbon 2aColoring Agents 2aDermatologic Surgical Procedures 2aDog Diseases 2aDogs 2aHistological Techniquesxveterinary 2aSkinxcytologyxpathology. 2aSkin Neoplasmsxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aStaining and Labeling 0askin 0acharacteristics 0amarkers 0aevaluation1 aFoley, G.L.1 aMarretta, S.M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1995 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.826-833x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02329naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002200158245007400180300001400254500002400268500001500292520109000307650002501397650002001422650001601442650002001458650001601478650000901494650000901503653001801512653002701530700001701557700002101574700002201595700001901617773010801636852000901744856007301753930003301826945002501859946001101884655001201895IND4382447120221119072218.0060731e20060710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438244712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aTischer, P.C.S.F.10aEffects of iota-carrageenan on the rheological properties of starches  ap. 49-57.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe phycocolloid iota-carrageenan (iota-CAR) was extracted from the Brazilian seaweed Meristiella gelidium. At a concentration of 5 mg ml-1 it was mixed with solutions of common corn starch (CS), high amylose starch (MS), waxy corn starch (WS) and YS starch (YS), to give systems at a final concentration of 25 g l-1, which were subjected to rheological measurements. Each mixture gave rise to a different behaviour under dynamic rheological conditions showing a distinct degree of interaction between iota-CAR and the starch. The presence of iota-CAR in iota-CAR-WS, iota-CAR-MS and iota-CAR-CS systems resulted in synergy manifested as enhancements in thermal stability (absence of hysteresis), resulting in thermoreversible gels softer and more stable between 45 and 85 °C. In the iota-CAR-YS system, the synergistic effect occurred as an improvement in solid character, increasing the elastic nature of the gel, suggesting that the structural characteristic of YS, more regular structure with amylopectin having a low molar mass, can contribute to enhanced intermolecular binding. 3achemical composition 3aviscoelasticity 3acorn starch 3astorage modulus 3acarrageenan 3aflow 3agels 0aflow behavior 0arheological properties1 aNoseda, M.D.1 aFreitas, R.A. de1 aSierakowski, M.R.1 aDuarte, M.E.R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 July 10, v. 65, no. 1 p.49-57dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.12.0273electronic resource  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02279naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245006900170300001600239520129600255650001101551650002001562650001401582650000701596650001601603650001901619650001501638653001701653700002401670773010901694852000901803856008501812930003301897946001101930655001201941IND4447438820221119072023.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444743882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0584-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Richard N. 10aPedogenic factors and measurements of the plant uptake of cobalt  ap. 499-512.  aUnderstanding the factors which affect plant uptake of cobalt (Co) across a range of soil types is essential for both continued agricultural productivity as well as for possible remediation of contaminated sites. This review examines the relevant pedogenic processes contributing to plant uptake of Co from soils based on a critical evaluation of existing numerical data. Numerous pedogenic factors have been put forward in the scientific literature to account for the plant uptake of Co, including total, extractable and isotopically exchangeable soil Co concentrations, pH and other soil chemical parameters (e.g. manganese concentrations), microbial variations as well as anthropogenic inputs. Despite there being certain instances where significant correlations occur between these parameters and plant uptake of Co, an examination of multiple data sets shows that these relationships are spatially isolated. With the measureable parameters showing only weak correlations at best, there should be a degree of scepticism regarding the interpretation of reported data sets. Newly evolving techniques which assess kinetically-bioavailable in-situ soil concentrations, such as diffusive gradient thin-films, offer the potential to better address plant Co uptake across a range of soil types. 3acobalt 3adata collection 3amanganese 3apH 3aremediation 3asoil formation 3asoil types 0aPlant uptake1 aKinsela, Andrew S. 0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Feb., v. 339, no. 1-2 p.499-512dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0584-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008100201300002000282506007600302520112900378506003701507650002401544650002601568650002601594650001401620650002501634650002301659650002201682650001601704700002201720700001601742700002001758700001801778773017601796852000901972856008301981930003302064946001302097655001202110IND4423619320221207072310.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442361932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08087581062doi7 aPMC27155092pmcid7 a195565422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xinwei10aStatistical approach to quantifying the elastic deformation of nanomaterials  ap. 11845-11850.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuantifying the mechanical properties of nanomaterials is challenged by its small size, difficulty of manipulation, lack of reliable measurement techniques, and grossly varying measurement conditions and environment. A recently proposed approach is to estimate the elastic modulus from a force-deflection physical model based on the continuous bridged-deformation of a nanobelt/nanowire using an atomic force microscope tip under different contact forces. However, the nanobelt may have some initial bending, surface roughness and imperfect physical boundary conditions during measurement, leading to large systematic errors and uncertainty in data quantification. In this article, a statistical modeling technique, sequential profile adjustment by regression (SPAR), is proposed to account for and eliminate the various experimental errors and artifacts. SPAR can automatically detect and remove the systematic errors and therefore gives more precise estimation of the elastic modulus. This research presents an innovative approach that can potentially have a broad impact in quantitative nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelastic deformation 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananowires 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3asurface roughness 3auncertainty1 aJoseph, V.

This includes unintended side effects of the transgene or its genome insertion site on the regulation of other endogenous genes, which could potentially cause the accumulation of different secondary metabolites that may have not only an impact on diet as repeatedly worried by the public but also on the environment. Regarding amount and possible environmental effects, flavonoids represent the most prominent group of secondary metabolites in wheat. Many flavonoids function as signalling or defence molecules. We used a robust and reproducible analytical method to compare the flavonoid content of genetically modified (GM) wheat (Triticum aestivum L., Gramineae) expressing genes that confer increased fungal resistance with their non-GM siblings. The transgenes provide either a broad-spectrum fungal defence (chitinase/glucanase from barley) or bunt-specific resistance by a viral gene (KP4). Significant differences in flavonoid composition were found between different wheat varieties whereas different lines of GM wheat with increased antifungal resistance showed only minor differences in their flavonoid composition relative to their non-GM siblings. In a field test, no significant differences were detectable between infected and non-infected wheat of the same variety regardless of the presence of the transgene. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the transgenes we used to increase wheat defence to fungal pathogens do not interfere with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. More significantly, the genetic background resulting from conventional breeding has a direct impact on the biological composition of flavonoids, and thus possibly on the environment. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadverse effects 3aanalytical methods 3abarley 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3achitinase 3adiet 3afield experimentation 3aflavonoids 3afungi 3agenetic background 3apathogens 3apleiotropy 3asecondary metabolites 3asiblings 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3awheat 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFlavonoidsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aTransgenesxphysiology 2aTriticumxgenetics 0aGenetic modification 0aFungal resistance1 aUrbaniak, Bartosz 1 aNdjoko-Ioset, Karine 1 aWirth, Judith 1 aMartin, Frédéric.1 aGruissem, Wilhelm 1 aHostettmann, Kurt 1 aSautter, Christof 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Nov., v. 65, no. 5 p.645-654dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9229-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03556naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171100001900180245010600199300001600305500002400321520149300345650002501838650002801863650001301891650001501904650002201919650001301941650002201954650002001976650002701996650000802023650002702031650001302058650002702071650001702098650003002115650006702145650003602212650001602248650005302264650002202317650001302339650003702352650003302389650003002422650002402452651001002476651001002486653002002496700001802516700001502534700001902549700001602568700001502584773010802599852000902707856008302716930003302799945002502832946001302857655001202870IND4422609020221119072047.0090702e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260902DNAL7 a194532232pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-99-6-06512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aProdorutti, D.10aGenetic Diversity of Armillaria spp. Infecting Highbush Blueberry in Northern Italy (Trentino Region)  ap. 651-658.  aIncludes references  aArmillaria spp. are the causal agents of root rots of several woody plants, including highbush blueberry. Since 2003, highbush blueberry plants infected by Armillaria spp. have been found in Valsugana Valley, Trentino region, northern Italy. Our aim was to identify the Armillaria spp. involved in these infections, as well as possible sources of inoculum in blueberry fields. Samples of Armillaria spp. were collected from diseased blueberry plants in 13 infected blueberry fields, from bark spread along the blueberry rows, from infected trees in the vicinity of the fields, and from four forest locations. The identification of Armillaria spp. was accomplished using a species-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction method and by sequencing the rDNA at a specific locus. The differentiation between genotypes was performed by using simple-sequence repeat analysis. Armillaria mellea and A. gallica were the most frequently observed species infecting blueberry in the Valsugana Valley. Three to eight Armillaria genotypes were identified in each blueberry field. No individual genotypes were found in more than one blueberry field. Two-thirds of the genotypes found colonizing trees in the immediate vicinity of infected fields and two-thirds of the genotypes found colonizing the bark spread in blueberry rows were also isolated from blueberry plants in the field, indicating that bark used as mulch and infected trees surrounding the fields may be important sources of inoculum. 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3apathogen identification 3ainoculum 3aArmillaria 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3asequence analysis 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aDNA 3amolecular epidemiology 3aroot rot 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3abark mulches 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aArmillariaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBlueberry Plantsxmicrobiology. 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aTreesxmicrobiology 3aItaly 0aItaly 0ainoculum source1 aVanblaere, T.1 aGobbin, D.1 aPellegrini, A.1 aGessler, C.1 aPertot, I.0 tPhytopathology.g2009 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.651-658dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-99-6-06513Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/20  aOther US 7aarticle02919naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011200162300001600274500001500290520127800305650002201583650001701605650001201622650002201634650001501656650002601671650002801697650002001725650002801745650001601773650002401789650002001813650002201833650001801855650000801873650003101881650001001912650001401922653001001936653002001946653004501966700001902011700002302030700002902053700001602082700002302098773012202121852000902243856006902252930003302321946001102354655001202365IND4390402720221119072022.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439040272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9144-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReilly, Kim 10aTowards identifying the full set of genes expressed during cassava post-harvest physiological deterioration  ap. 187-203.  a2019-12-05  aStorage roots of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) exhibit a rapid post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) response that can occur within 24-72 h of harvest. PPD is an enzymatically mediated oxidative process with parallels to plant wound, senescence and defence responses. To characterise those genes that show significant change in expression during the PPD response we have used cDNA microarray technology to carry out a large-scale analysis of the cassava root transcriptome during the post-harvest period. We identified 72 non-redundant expressed sequence tags which showed altered regulation during the post-harvest period. Of these 63 were induced, whilst 9 were down-regulated. RNA blot analysis of selected genes was used to verify and extend the microarray data. Additional microarray hybridisation experiments allowed the identification of 21 root-specific and 24 root-wounding-specific sequences. Many of the up-regulated and PPD-specific expressed sequence tags were predicted to play a role in cellular processes including reactive oxygen species turnover, cell wall repair, programmed cell death, ion, water or metabolite transport, signal transduction or perception, stress response, metabolism and biosynthesis, and activation of protein synthesis. 3aprotein synthesis 3abiosynthesis 3acassava 3acomplementary DNA 3acell walls 3amicroarray technology 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ametabolites 3asignal transduction 3agene expression 3aManihot esculenta 3atranscriptome 3aRNA 3agene expression regulation 3aroots 3aapoptosis 0agenes 0acDNA microarray 0aPost-harvest physiological deterioration1 aBernal, Diana 1 aCortés, Diego F. 1 aGómez-Vásquez, Rocío 1 aTohme, Joe 1 aBeeching, John R. 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 May, v. 64, no. 1-2 p.187-203dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9144-03electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04231naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072001700156072001700173072001700190072001700207100002000224245009200244300001600336520226200352650002202614650002102636650001702657650001702674650001902691650001802710650001502728650000902743650001902752650001702771650001602788650001902804650001702823650002002840650002002860650001402880650001802894650002502912650001202937650002302949650003802972650002103010650001403031650003303045650002303078650001503101650001703116650002203133650002203155651001503177651001703192653002303209700001803232773013003250852000903380856007303389930003303462945002503495946001303520655001203533IND4405872320221119072010.0080520e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440587232DNAL7 a184886022pmid7 a10.1890/07-0446.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEschtruth, A.K.10aDeer herbivory alters forest response to canopy decline caused by an exotic insect pest  ap. 360-376.  aHemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) infestations have resulted in the continuing decline of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) throughout much of the eastern United States. While the initial impacts of HWA infestations have been documented, our understanding of forest response to this disturbance remains incomplete. HWA infestation is not occurring in isolation but within a complex ecological context. The role of potentially important interacting factors, such as elevated levels of white‐tailed deer herbivory, is poorly understood. Despite the potential for herbivory to alter forest successional trajectories following a canopy disturbance, little is known about herbivory–disturbance interactions, and herbivory is rarely considered in assessing forest response to a co‐occurring disturbance. We used repeated censuses of deer exclosures and paired controls (400 paired plots) to quantify the impact of deer herbivory on tree seedling species abundance in 10 eastern hemlock ravines that span a gradient in HWA‐induced canopy decline severity. Use of a maximum likelihood estimation framework and information theoretics allowed us to quantify the strength of evidence for alternative models developed to estimate the impacts of herbivory on tree seedling abundance as a function of varying herbivore density and canopy decline severity. The exclusion of deer herbivory had marked impacts on the abundance of the studied seedling species: Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum, Betula lenta, Nyssa sylvatica, Quercus montana, and Tsuga canadensis. For all six species, the relationship between seedling abundance and deer density was either exponential or saturating. Although the functional form of the response varied among seedling species, the inclusion of both deer density and canopy decline severity measures consistently resulted in models with substantially greater support. Canopy decline resulted in higher proportional herbivory impacts and altered the ranking of herbivory impacts by seedling species. Our results suggest that, by changing species' competitive abilities, white‐tailed deer herbivory alters the trajectory of forest response to this exotic insect pest and has the potential to shift future overstory composition. 3atemperate forests 3aTsuga canadensis 3ainsect pests 3aforest pests 3aAdelges tsugae 3aforest damage 3aherbivores 3adeer 3aforest decline 3aforest trees 3aAcer rubrum 3aAcer saccharum 3aBetula lenta 3aNyssa sylvatica 3aQuercus montana 3aseedlings 3aplant density 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDeerxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aSeedlings. 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 2aTsugaxphysiology 3aNew Jersey 3aPennsylvania 0amaximum likelihood1 aBattles, J.J.0 tEcological applications.g2008 Mar., v. 18, no. 2 p.360-376dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0446.13Available from publisher's site  a20080702b20080801c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/07/02  aOther US 7aarticle03400naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002800186245007000214300001600284506007600300520131100376506003701687650001201724650004301736650002201779650001201801650002001813650001501833650001801848650001301866650001301879650001301892650001001905650001301915650001001928650001201938650001301950650001401963650003101977650002402008650003202032650003802064650006002102650005202162650002802214650002902242650001402271650001402285650004202299650005302341650002302394653001202417700002302429700002602452773012102478852000902599856008602608930003302694946001102727655001202738IND4390933520221207073253.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439093352DNAL7 a174408212pmid7 aPMC18762542pmcid7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9149-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Schie, Chris C.

Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced β-phellandrene, β-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAraneae 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abeta-phellandrene 3aflowers 3agene expression 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3alinalool 3apetioles 3aproteins 3aroots 3asabinene 3astems 3atissues 3atomatoes 3atrichomes 3avolatile organic compounds 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIntramolecular Lyasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonoterpenesxmetabolism 2aOxylipins 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 0aDefence1 aHaring, Michel A. 1 aSchuurink, Robert C. 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 June, v. 64, no. 3 p.251-263dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9149-83Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02953naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245011000141300001600251500001500267520150800282650000901790650002701799650002001826650001101846650002201857650001401879650001901893650001201912650003901924650005501963650001702018650000902035650005902044650003702103650002502140650002102165650004502186653003402231653002702265700001402292773009702306852000902403930003302412945001302445946001302458655001202471IND2046906620221119072013.0950719e199506  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204690662DNAL7 a76538882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapp, E.10aUltrastructural study of unidentified inclusions in the cornea and iridocorneal angle of dogs with pannus  ap. 779-785.  a2019-12-05  aThe corneas and/or the iridocorneal angles of 13 dogs were examined morphologically by use of transmission electron microscopy. Virologic identification techniques also were used for tissue from 2 dogs. Four dogs had clinical signs of chronic superficial keratitis or pannus, 9 dogs had normal eyes. In the tissue from 7 dogs (4 German Shepherd Dogs with chronic superficial keratitis; 2 German Shepherd Dogs and 1 mixed-breed dog with normal eyes) we found unusual cytoplasmic inclusions. Inclusions were not found in dogs of other breeds with normal eyes. The inclusions were observed in corneal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages, as well as in trabecular cells and fibroblasts of the iridocorneal angle. They were often grouped within the rough endoplasmic reticulum or found free in the cytoplasm. The cylindrical particles had a helical substructure, measuring 20 nm in diameter and up to 400 nm long, with a distance of 10 nm for the repeating turns. Results of virologic culturing on canine and seal kidney cells were negative, as was staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies against canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus, canine parvovirus, and canine adenovirus. Relevance of the inclusion bodies described is discussed. Because our results seem to hint at a correlation between presence of the rod shaped particles and German Shepherd Dogs with pannus, we suggest that an etiologic or pathogenic connection exists that merits further examination. 3adogs 3acytoplasmic inclusions 3aGerman Shepherd 3acornea 3abody measurements 3akeratitis 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aCorneaxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aCorneal Diseasesxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aDog Diseases 2aDogs 2aInclusion Bodiesxpathologyxultrastructurexvirology. 2aIrisxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aReference Values 2aVaricellovirusxisolation & purification 0achronic superficial keratitis 0aanatomy and morphology1 aKolbl, S.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1995 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.779-785x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001900171245008900190300001400279500002400293500001500317520092000332650002801252650002701280650001701307650002201324650001801346650002001364650001001384650004901394650002001443650001101463650002101474650001501495650003901510650002201549653001801571653001501589700001601604700002101620700001901641700002201660700001701682773009701699852000901796856009301805930003301898945002501931946001101956655001201967IND4405022620221119072439.0080428e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440502262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aBalikci, Engin10aEfficacy of marbofloxacin for naturally occurring contagious caprine pleuropneumonia  ap. 75-79.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy of marbofloxacin used in goats with naturally occurring contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP). The study was performed in two groups (consisting of 15 animals in each group) with two different doses of 10% aqueous solution of marbofloxacin injected intramuscularly into the semitendinous muscle. 2mg/kg BW for 3 days (total dose administered: 6mg/kg BW) was injected to the first group (group 1) and 3mg/kg for 2 times every other day (total dose administered: 6mg/kg BW) was injected to the second group (group 2). Microbiological analyses revealed that the causative agent of the disease was Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae. Cure rates for groups 1 and 2 were determined as 100% (15/15 goats) and 93% (14/15 goats), respectively. The results of this field trial suggest that marbofloxacin could be an effective drug against CCPP in goats. 3aintramuscular injection 3abacterial colonization 3adrug therapy 3aaqueous solutions 3adose response 3adrug evaluation 3agoats 3aMycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae 3adisease control 3adosage 3amicrobial growth 3aquinolones 3acontagious caprine pleuropneumonia 3aprotective effect 0amarbofloxacin 0ainhibitors1 aKizil, Omer1 aKarapinar, Tolga1 aKarahan, Murat1 aÖzdemir, Haydar.1 aDabak, Murat0 tSmall ruminant research.g2008 June, v. 77, no. 1 p.75-79dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02959naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013900203300002000342506007600362520153200438506003701970650001302007650001102020650002502031650001202056650000902068650002002077650001002097650001802107650001202125650001702137700001902154700001702173700002102190773017602211852000902387856008302396930003302479946001302512655001202525IND4423624520221207071038.0090724e20090721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442362452DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09050921062doi7 aPMC27062712pmcid7 a195815972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahata, Toru10aExpression of immediate-early genes reveals functional compartments within ocular dominance columns after brief monocular inactivation  ap. 12151-12155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVisual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals "blob" structures within the supragranular layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers, where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the "border strips" of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (>5 h), the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured, changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy pattern of the expression in the infragranular and supragranular layers remained. These changes of IEG expression after MI indicate that cortical circuits involving the CO blobs of the supragranular layers include aligned groups of neurons in the infragranular layers and that the border strip neurons of layer 4C are highly active for a 3-h period after MI.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrimates 3acortex 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aeyelids 3aeyes 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3aneurons 3atetrodotoxin1 aHigo, Noriyuki1 aKaas, Jon H.1 aYamamori, Tetsuo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 July 21, v. 106, no. 29 p.12151-12155dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09050921063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02492naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001700164245012600181300001600307500002400323520104400347650002201391650001701413650001601430650002501446650001901471650002401490650001701514650001901531650002701550650002101577650002101598650002001619650001001639650001601649650002601665651001701691773014701708852000901855856007701864930003301941945002501974946001101999655001202010IND4382668320221119072152.0060808e20060130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438266832DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.23542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ500 0aQ5041 aAl-Eid, S.M.10aEffect of nitrogen and manure fertilizer on grain quality, baking and rheological properties of wheat grown in sandy soil  ap. 205-211.  aIncludes references  aWinter wheat was grown under various nitrogen (N) fertilizer regimes (with/without manure application) under calcareous sandy soils, control wheat being grown without fertilization. Six levels of N fertilizer were applied. The technological and baking characteristics of the wheat were closely related to N and nitrogen + manure (NM) fertilization. Contents of protein increased with increase in fertilization level, which also improved the rheological properties of dough and baking quality. N fertilization increased farinograph stability time, which increased with increasing flour protein content. NM fertilization affected protein content as well as farinograph stability time and farinograph maximum viscosity, thereby affecting the relationship between these properties. The increase in bread volume due to fertilizers was more noticeable with NM than with N. Application of 60 t ha-1 manure along with 200 kg ha-1 N onwards improved technological properties of flour in comparison with wheat grown with the basic N fertilizer only. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3asandy soils 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3aorganic fertilizers 3acrop quality 3abaking quality 3arheological properties 3afertilizer rates 3acalcareous soils 3aprotein content 3adough 3awheat flour 3afunctional properties 3aSaudi Arabia0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2006 Jan. 30, v. 86, no. 2 p.205-211dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.23543Available from publisher's Web site  a20080110b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008100144300001600225500001500241520098700256650001001243650001401253650001401267650001901281650001601300650001201316650003601328650006701364650002401431650002701455650002001482650004101502650002701543650000901570650003101579650003301610653002701643653003001670653002101700653001601721653002601737653002001763653001101783653001701794700001501811773009601826852000901922930003301931945001301964946001301977655001201990IND2046899320221119072002.0950719e199505  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204689932DNAL7 a76614622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, J.10aResponse to demineralized bone matrix implantation in foals and adult horses  ap. 649-655.  a2019-12-05  aEquine demineralized bone matrix, particle size 2 to 4 mm, was implanted SC and IM in 4 foals and 4 adult horses. The implants were removed between 5 and 8 weeks after implantation. Bone formation was induced by SC and IM implantations in all animals. The implantation site had a marked effect on the amount of bone that developed, bone being formed earlier and in greater amounts when the matrix was implanted IM. The amount of bone formed increased with increasing time after matrix implantation at both sites. Demineralized bone matrix implantation also led to formation of small amounts of chondroid tissue; this tissue was more common in IM than SC matrix implants, and increased in amount with increasing time after implantation. Formation of this chondroid tissue did not precede the formation of bone, and there was no evidence that implantation of demineralized bone matrix in horses induced endochondral ossification. Age of the host did not appear to affect the response. 3afoals 3ahistology 3acartilage 3abone formation 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBone Demineralization Technique 2aBone Matrixxgrowth & developmentxpathologyxtransplantation. 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aGiant Cellsxpathology 2aHorsesxsurgery 2aInflammationxpathologyxveterinary. 2aOsteoclastsxpathology 2aRats 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTransplantation, Heterotopic 0aintramuscular implants 0aendochondral ossification 0achondroid tissue 0abone tissue 0asubcutaneous implants 0aage differences 0ahorses 0aimplantation1 aClarke, A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1995 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.649-655x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02311naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009300129300001600222500001500238520139800253650001401651650002201665650001401687650001301701650002201714651001101736651001501747653002301762653001401785700001701799700001901816773007101835852000901906939003301915946001301948655001201961IND9301030720221119072439.0930219e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930103072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerrigan, R.W.14aThe California population of Agaricus bisporus comprises at least two ancestral elements  ap. 123-136.  a2019-12-04  aGenotypes of a sample of field-collected heterokaryon isolates of Agaricus bisporus from California were compared with those of a comprehensive sample of cultivar isolates that are likely to be of European ancestry. Isolate genotypes were determined for 14 nuclear DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism markers and seven allozyme markers, and were compared in a pairwise fashion to produce a matrix of genotypic dissimilarities between all isolates. This matrix was evaluated with regard to the affinities of individual California isolates, both among themselves and with a reconstructed population ancestral to the cultivars. Most isolates from California fell into one of two apparent groups; these either: 1) had high affinity with the cultivars or 2) differed substantially from the cultivars and aggregated in a distinct, cypress-associated "Californian" group. A few isolates had an intermediate character. This result, supported by habitat correlations and the distribution of characteristic mitochondrial DNA types, indicates that the California population presently comprises introduced cultivars, indigenous cypress-associated strains, and a less distinct group that could include spontaneous hybrids between these two ancestral elements, or strains with other affinities. If hybridization is indeed occurring, the two major ancestral elements have introgressed only slightly. 3acultivars 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aphylogeny 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aEurope 3aCalifornia 0ageographical races 0aevolution1 aHorgen, P.A.1 aAnderson, J.B.0 tSystematic botany.g1993 , v. 18, no. 1 p.123-136x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245007900142300001400221520146700235650002401702650001301726650001001739650001001749650001101759650001801770650001601788650003701804650001601841650005201857650002801909650002701937650002401964651001001988653001801998700001202016700002202028700001302050773008402063852000902147930003302156945001302189946001302202655001202215IND2324573520221119072443.0011220e200101  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232457352DNAL7 a112156652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Z.10aAccumulation of rare earth elements in corn after agricultural application  ap. 37-45.  aUsing both pot and plot experiments, the dose-dependent accumulation of rare earth elements (REs) in corn (Zea mays L.) after application of an agricultural REs mixture was measured. In the pot experiment, the dose-dependent accumulation of REs in corn root and stem was observed, but it could not be detected in corn leaf under the dosage of 20 mg REs kg-1 soil (oven-dry mass). The non-observed effect concentration (NOEC) for accumulation of REs in corn seedling with the pot experiment was 1.0 mg REs kg-1. In the plot experiment, the dose-dependent accumulation was observed at an early stage after application of REs and the NOEC value of 32 mg REs m-2 was obtained. At harvest, no dose-dependent accumulation of REs was observed in any part of the corn. These results can be confirmed by the fingerprinting analysis based on the differences between La to RE ratios in the REs mixture and in pot or plot soil. We observed that the plant shows no preference on individual RE and the results of fingerprinting indicated clearly the incorporation of exogenous REs in plant tissues, in a similar manner as that observed in the dose-dependent distribution of RE concentrations. The results indicated also a translocation process of REs from plant root to leaf when applied to soil or from leaf to root when applied to leaf. A homeostatic regulation mechanism for excessive uptake of REs in plants is suggested to regulate the concentrations of REs in the plant. 3arare earth elements 3aZea mays 3aroots 3astems 3aleaves 3adose response 2aAgriculture 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHomeostasis 2aMetals, Rare Earthxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aChina 0aconcentration1 aLiu, D.1 aLu, Ponzy,d1942-1 aWang, C.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2001 , v. 30, no. 1 p.37-45x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02723naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009600144300001400240520167700254650001501931650001601946650003401962650001301996650003502009650001202044650002002056650001702076650004302093700001602136700001502152700001302167773010102180852000902281930003302290945001302323946001302336655001202349IND2324573020221119072412.0011220e200101  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232457302DNAL7 a112156502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, T.10aIn vitro pesticide degradation in turfgrass soil incubated under open and sealed conditions  ap. 18-23.  aDegradation of selected pesticides was conducted in a turfgrass soil from a golf course under open (i.e., allowing gas exchange with atmosphere) and sealed systems. The time required for 50% of the initial dose of fenitrothion (O,O-dimethyl O-4-nitro-m-tolyl phosphorothioate), diazinon (O,O-dimethyl O-2-isopropyl-6-methylpyrimidin4-yl phosphorothioate), iprodione [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-isopropyl-2, 4-dioxo-imidazolidine-1-carboxamide], mecoprop [(RS)-2-(4-chloro-o-tolyloxy)propionic acid], and asulam (4-aminophenylsulfonyl-carbamate) to dissipate (half-life, t1/2) was less than 2 wk under both conditions. The t1/2 values of dithiopyr (S,S'-dimethyl 2-difluoromethyl-4-isobutyl-6-trifluoro-methylpyridine-3, 5-dicarbothioate) were 324 and 185 d under the open and sealed conditions, respectively. The t1/2 values of isoprothiolane (di-isopropyl 1,3-dithiolan-2-ylidene-malonate), flutolanil (alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluoro-3'-isopropoxy-o-toluanilide), and benefin (N-butyl-N-ethyl-alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluoro-2, 6-dinitro-p-toluidine) under the open conditions were 154, 336, and 47 d, respectively. The t1/2 values of these pesticides increased slightly under the sealed conditions. The t1/2 values of terbutol (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl N-methycarbamate) and one of the major degradation products, N-demethyl-terbutol (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl carbamate), were 182 and 291 d under the open conditions and increased by six- and threefold under the sealed conditions, respectively. The degradation system under the sealed conditions could characterize the persistence of terbutol and N-demethyl-terbutol, which were the most persistent in the field. 3apesticides 3adegradation 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aKinetics 2aPesticide Residuesxmetabolism 2aPoaceae 2aSoil Pollutants 2aTime Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism1 aYaguchi, K.1 aSuzuki, S.1 aSuga, T.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2001 , v. 30, no. 1 p.18-23wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01943naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013500124300001600259520095000275650002401225650002701249650002001276650002301296650001601319650002901335650002001364650002301384700001701407700001701424700001501441773009601456852000901552939003301561946001101594655001201605IND9301031420221119072356.0930219e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930103142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukui, T.10aLong-term continuous production of optically active 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propanoic acid by yeast lipase in an organic solvent system  ap. 330-334.  aLong-term continuous optical resolution of 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propanoic acid was carried out by stereoselective esterification with Celite-adsorbed lipase OF 360 from Candida cylindracea using n-tetradecanol as the second substrate in organic solvent systems.

Water-saturated carbon tetrachloride-isooctane (8:2, v/v) was found to be an excellent organic solvent for the continuous operation. The particle size of Celite had no effect on productivity. Under optimized conditions, the (R)-enantiomer of the acid was continuously esterified with high stereoselectivity in a packed-bed column reactor for 34 days.

The main advantage of the presented procedure is the fact that an excess of the derivatizing reagent can be employed as the product exhibits an absorption maximum at 360 nm, while the reagent has its absorption maximum at 260 nm. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the reagent signal by a detection wavelength of 400 nm leading to an easy and general method for the enantioseparation of a mixture of dl-amino acids and the determination of the enantiomeric purity of α-amino acid as exemplified by 16 different α-amino acids. 3aabsorption 3aacids 3aamino acids 3adiastereomers 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3awavelengths 0aSanger reagent 0aMarfey reagent 0aChiral derivatization agent (CDA) 0aEnantiomeric purity determination1 aAltenbach, H.-J. 0 tAmino acids.g2011 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.527-532dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-010-0665-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007600144300001600220520157700236650001101813650001901824650001001843650001601853650001901869650001201888650003701900650001201937650002101949650006501970650001102035650002702046650006202073650001102135650000902146650003402155653001302189653002802202700002002230700001702250773009602267852000902363930003302372945001302405946001302418655001202431IND2046897120221119072429.0950719e199505  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204689712DNAL7 a76614552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, W.W.10aEncephalopathy in cattle experimentally infected with the scrapie agent  ap. 606-612.  aTen 8- to 10-month-old cattle were each inoculated intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracerebrally, and orally with the scrapie agent to determine whether cattle are susceptible to it. Two inocula, both 10% homogenates of cerebrum, were used. One inoculum was from a sheep used for the second experimental ovine passage of the agent from 4 naturally affected Suffolk sheep. The other inoculum was from a goat used for the first experimental caprine passage of the agent from 2 naturally affected dairy goats living with the Suffolk sheep, the source of their infection. Between 27 and 48 months after inoculation, neurologic disease was observed in 1 of 5 cattle given the sheep brain homogenate and in 2 of 5 given the goat brain homogenate. In all 3 affected cattle, the disease was expressed clinically as increasing difficulty in rising from recumbency, stilted gait of the pelvic limbs, disorientation, and terminal recumbency during a 6- to 10-week course. Neurohistologic changes, though consistent with those of scrapie, were slight and subtle: moderate astrocytosis with sparse rod cells, some neuronal degeneration, a few vacuolated neurons, and scant spongiform change. Clinically and neurohistologically, the experimentally induced disease differed from bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The differences emphasize that such infections in cattle induce diverse responses, presumably depending largely on the strain of the agent. Pathologists should keep this variability in mind when looking for microscopic evidence of a scrapie-like encephalopathy in cattle. 3acattle 3aPrPSc proteins 3abrain 3aspinal cord 3ahistopathology 3ascrapie 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 2aAnimals 2aBrainxpathology 2aBrain Diseasesximmunologyxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCattle 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiformximmunologyxpathology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPrPSc Proteinsxpathogenicity 0asymptoms 0aexperimental infections1 aHourrigan, J.L.1 aHadlow, W.J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1995 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.606-612x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02993naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001700175245009200192300001600284500002400300520177100324650001802095650002502113650001802138650001902156650001902175650000902194650001302203650002402216650001302240650001602253651000902269700001902278773009602297852000902393856008802402930003302490945002502523946001102548655001202559IND4405023220221119072213.0080428e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440502322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2007.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aJ200 0aJ5001 aWilson, H.M.10aCrop rotation and nitrogen fertilization effect on soil CO₂ emissions in central Iowa  ap. 264-270.  aIncludes references  aDepending upon how soil is managed, it can serve as a source or sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂). As the atmospheric CO₂ concentration continues to increase, more attention is being focused on the soil as a possible sink for atmospheric CO₂. This study was conducted to examine the short-term effects of crop rotation and N fertilization on soil CO₂ emissions in Central Iowa. Soil CO₂ emissions were measured during the growing seasons of 2003 and 2004 from plots fertilized with three N rates (0, 135, and 270kgNha⁻¹) in continuous corn and a corn-soybean rotation in a split-plot design. Soil samples were collected in the spring of 2004 from the 0-15cm soil depth to determine soil organic C content. Crop residue input was estimated using a harvest index based on the measured crop yield. The results show that increasing N fertilization generally decreased soil CO₂ emissions and the continuous corn cropping system had higher soil CO₂ emissions than the corn-soybean rotation. Soil CO₂ emission rate at the peak time during the growing season and cumulative CO₂ under continuous corn increased by 24 and 18%, respectively compared to that from corn-soybean rotation. During this period, the soil fertilized with 270kgNha⁻¹ emitted, on average, 23% less CO₂ than the soil fertilized with the other two N rates. The greatest difference in CO₂ emission rate was observed in 2004; where plots that received 0N rate had 31% greater CO₂ emission rate than plots fertilized with 270kgNha⁻¹. The findings of this research indicate that changes in cropping systems can have immediate impact on both rate and cumulative soil CO₂ emissions, where continuous corn caused greater soil CO₂ emissions than corn soybean rotation. 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3agas emissions 3acarbon dioxide 3agrowing season 3acorn 3asoybeans 3asoil organic carbon 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aIowa1 aAl-Kaisi, M.M.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2008 July, v. 39, no. 3 p.264-270dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2007.12.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20081101b20081101c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012000163300001600283520093800299650001101237650002601248650002501274650002601299650001001325650002201335650001301357650002301370650001401393650002401407650002201431651001001453653003901463653002301502653001801525700001501543700001701558700001701575700001701592700001601609700001601625700002001641700001401661700001901675773010901694852000901803856008501812930003301897946001101930655001201941IND4447436620221119072136.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444743662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0572-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaogang 10aNo evidence of persistent effects of continuously planted transgenic insect-resistant cotton on soil microorganisms  ap. 247-257.  aTransgenic insect-resistant cotton expressing the Cry1Ac and/or CpTI protein has been released into the environment for commercial cultivation for over a decade in China.

Here, we demonstrate that both Y10 DNA β (Y10β) and Y35 DNA β (Y35β) were stably trans-replicated by the noncognate Begomovirus, although the noncognate DNA β accumulated in plants at a lower level than did the cognate DNA β. In Nicotiana benthamiana and N. glutinosa plants agroinoculated with Y10+Y10β+Y35β or with Y35+Y35β+Y10β, all components accumulated in the early stages of infection but, at later stages, the noncognate DNA β decreased in relative concentration and was undetectable at 80 to 120 days after inoculation. The helper viruses and cognate DNA β species persisted at higher levels throughout the experiments. When the initiation codon of the βC1 gene of the cognate DNA β was mutated, the dominance of the cognate over the noncognate DNA β in mixed infections was unimpaired. These results imply that the cognate DNA β competes with the noncognate DNA β and that the ability for selective maintenance of DNA β is not controlled by the βC1 protein. 3aplant viruses 3asequence analysis 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aDNA replication 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asatellite DNA 3agenes 0areplication specificity 0aBegomovirus1 aZhou, Xueping0 tPhytopathology.g2009 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.716-720dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-99-6-07163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090721b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/21  aOther US 7aarticle03663naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171100003200180245009700212300001600309500002400325500001500349520178900364650001102153650003202164650003002196650001402226650002102240650001902261650002202280650001402302650000902316650002302325650002502348650001502373650005702388650001602445650005102461650003302512650003102545650001602576650001702592651001102609651001102620653003102631653001202662700002402674700002102698700001902719700002802738773010802766852000902874856008302883930003302966945002502999946001303024655001203037IND4422609120221119072049.0090702e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442260912DNAL7 a194532242pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-99-6-06592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aX1001 aMonteiro, Jose Eduardo B.A.10aDevelopment of Ramulosis Disease of Cotton Under Controlled Environment and Field Conditions  ap. 659-665.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aColletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides, the fungus that causes ramulosis disease of cotton, is widespread in Brazil and can cause severe yield loss. Because weather conditions greatly affect disease development, the objective of this work was to develop weather-based models to assess disease favorability. Latent period, incidence, and severity of ramulosis symptoms were evaluated in controlled environment experiments using factorial combinations of temperature (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C) and leaf wetness duration (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 h after inoculation). Severity was modeled as an exponential function of leaf wetness duration and temperature. At the optimum temperature of disease development, 27°C, average latent period was 10 days. Maximum ramulosis severity occurred from 20 to 30°C, with sharp decreases at lower and higher temperatures. Ramulosis severity increased as wetness periods were increased from 4 to 32 h. In field experiments at Piracicaba, São Paulo State, Brazil, cotton plots were inoculated (10(5) conidia ml-1) and ramulosis severity was evaluated weekly. The model obtained from the controlled environment study was used to generate a disease favorability index for comparison with disease progress rate in the field. Hourly measurements of solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, rainfall, and wind speed were also evaluated as possible explanatory variables. Both the disease favorability model and a model based on rainfall explained ramulosis growth rate well, with R2 of 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. They are proposed as models of ramulosis development rate on cotton in Brazil, and weather-disease relationships revealed by this work can form the basis of a warning system for ramulosis development. 3acotton 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3afungal diseases of plants 3aequations 3adisease severity 3aColletotrichum 3adisease outbreaks 3aGossypium 3arain 3astatistical models 3adisease surveillance 3aprediction 2aColletotrichumxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aEnvironment 2aGossypiumxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0adisease favorability index 0aweather1 aSentelhas, Paulo C.1 aGleason, Mark L.1 aEsker, Paul D.1 aChiavegato, Ederaldo J.0 tPhytopathology.g2009 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.659-665dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-99-6-06593Available from publisher's Web site  a20090721b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/20  aOther US 7aarticle02237naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008900160300001800249500002400267520109900291650001001390650001501400650001401415650002201429650001501451650001501466650001301481650001901494653001801513653002001531653000901551653001701560653002001577700002001597700001601617700001901633773011801652852000901770856004801779655001201827IND4441282420221119072158.0100813e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444128242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-010-9550-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVir, Ruchi10aGenetic characterization and species relationships among selected Asiatic Vigna Savi  ap. 1091-1107.  aIncludes references  aTwenty-four ISSR primers were employed for diversity analysis, genotyping and assessment of species relationships in Asiatic Vigna from the Indian subcontinent.

The wild forms, V. mungo var. silvestris, V. radiata var. sublobata and V. radiata var. setulosa grouped closer to their respective cultigens. V. hainiana emerged as a distinct taxon and seems to be more primitive in comparison to the other close wild relatives of greengram and blackgram. Moderate gene flow and genetic differentiation was detected between the species analyzed.

In classical photoperiodism studies, these varieties have been widely used to analyse the physiological nature for floral induction by day length. Since key regulators for flowering time control by day length have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by molecular genetic studies, it was intriguing to analyse how closely related plants in the Nicotiana genus with opposite photoperiodic requirements respond to certain flowering time regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FRUITFULL (FUL) are two MADS box genes that are involved in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. SOC1 is a central flowering time pathway integrator, whereas the exact role of FUL for floral induction has not been established yet. The putative Nicotiana orthologs of SOC1 and FUL, NtSOC1 and NtFUL, were studied in day-neutral tobacco Nicotiana tabacum cv Hicks, in short-day tobacco N. tabacum cv Hicks Maryland Mammoth (MM) and long-day N. sylvestris plants. Both genes were similarly expressed under short- and long-day conditions in day-neutral and short-day tobaccos, but showed a different expression pattern in N. sylvestris. Overexpression of NtSOC1 and NtFUL caused flowering either in strict short-day (NtSOC1) or long-day (NtFUL) Nicotiana varieties under non-inductive photoperiods, indicating that these genes might be limiting for floral induction under non-inductive conditions in different Nicotiana varieties. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aflowering 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aphotoperiod 3aphotoperiodism 3atobacco 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aPhotoperiod 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aFloral induction 0aMADS box genes 0aTobMADS 0aNtSOC1 0aNtFUL1 aGennen, Jerôme 1 aDe Bodt, Stefanie 1 aRanganath, Venkatesh 1 aMelzer, Siegbert 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2007 Oct., v. 65, no. 3 p.233-242dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9211-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03442naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245009000205300001600295520245700311653001202768653000902780653001002789653001402799653003302813700002302846700001902869773012302888852000903011856008503020946001103105655001203116IND4447431520221119072103.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444743152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00221-010-2492-z2doi7 aPMC32300812pmcid7 a211042362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, J. R. 10aMulti-finger interaction during involuntary and voluntary single finger force changes  ap. 423-435.  aTwo types of finger interaction are characterized by positive co-variation (enslaving) or negative co-variation (error compensation) of finger forces. Enslaving reflects mechanical and neural connections among fingers, while error compensation results from synergic control of fingers to stabilize their net output. Involuntary and voluntary force changes by a finger were used to explore these patterns. We hypothesized that synergic mechanisms will dominate during involuntary force changes, while enslaving will dominate during voluntary finger force changes. Subjects pressed with all four fingers to match a target force that was 10% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). One of the fingers was unexpectedly raised 5.0 mm at a speed of 30.0 mm/s. During finger raising the subject was instructed “not to intervene voluntarily”. After the finger was passively lifted and a new steady-state achieved, subjects pressed down with the lifted finger, producing a pulse of force voluntarily. The data were analyzed in terms of finger forces and finger modes (hypothetical commands to fingers reflecting their intended involvement). The target finger showed an increase in force during both phases. In the involuntary phase, the target finger force changes ranged between 10.71 ± 1.89% MVC (I-finger) and 16.60 ± 2.26% MVC (L-finger). Generally, non-target fingers displayed a force decrease with a maximum amplitude of −1.49 ± 0.43% MVC (L-finger). Thus, during the involuntary phase, error compensation was observed--non-lifted fingers showed a decrease in force (as well as in mode magnitude). During the voluntary phase, enslaving was observed--non-target fingers showed an increase in force and only minor changes in mode magnitude. The average change in force of non-target fingers ranged from 21.83 ± 4.47% MVC for R-finger (M-finger task) to 0.71 ± 1.10% MVC for L-finger (I-finger task). The average change in mode of non-target fingers was between −7.34 ± 19.27% MVC for R-finger (L-finger task) and 7.10 ± 1.38% MVC for M-finger (I-finger task). We discuss a range of factors affecting force changes, from purely mechanical effects of finger passive lifting to neural synergic adjustments of commands to individual fingers. The data fit a recently suggested scheme that merges the equilibrium-point hypothesis (control with referent configurations) with the idea of hierarchical synergic control of multi-element systems. 0aSynergy 0aHand 0aForce 0aEnslaving 0aEquilibrium-point hypothesis1 aZatsiorsky, V.

The development of a human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, denosumab, constitutes a novel approach to prevent fragility fractures in osteoporosis, skeletal complications of malignancy, and potentially bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition to being expressed by osteoblasts, RANKL is abundantly produced by activated T cells, and synoviocytes in RA, whereas its receptor, RANK, is also expressed by monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. However, in preclinical and clinical studies of RA--including patients with some degree of immunosuppression--RANKL inhibitors did not significantly alter inflammatory processes. RANKL, RANK, and OPG deficiency in murine models highlights the important role of this pathway in the development and maturation of the immune system in rodents, including functions of T and/or B cells, whereas OPG overexpression in mice and rats seems innocuous with regard to immunity. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in humans have more limited effects on immune cells. In clinical studies, the overall rate of infections, cancer, and death was similar with denosumab and placebo. Nevertheless, the risk of severe infections and cancer in some specific tissues remains to be carefully scrutinized. 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3aosteoporosis 0aDenosumab 0aOPG 0aRANKL1 aFerrari, S. 0 tOsteoporosis international.g2011 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.435-446dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0937-941X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00198-010-1326-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01803naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245012100170300001800291520053300309650002200842650002900864650002500893650002300918650002000941650003300961650003600994650004501030650006401075650002901139650003301168700001601201700001901217700001701236773009701253852000901350939003301359946001301392655001201405IND9300996120221119072305.0930217e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930099612DNAL7 a13779002pmid7 aPMC1956682pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLoughlin, T.J.10aPseudomonas cepacia suppression of sunflower wilt fungus and role of antifungal compounds in controlling the disease  ap. 1760-1763.  aIn a field experiment, Pseudomonas cepacia J82rif and J51rif increased sunflower emergence in the presence of the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

Here, we report successful crossdating of Juniperus procera trees from North Gondar, Ethiopia. The trees form annual rings in response to a unimodal rainfall regime. The selection of mesic locations ensured that the trees did not respond to intra-seasonal weather anomalies. Crossdating was achieved by comparison of the wood anatomy directly on the surface of the core samples and purpose-adapted skeleton plotting. Wood-anatomical anomalies, such as false and indistinct rings, were regarded as potentially replicated features and used in crossdating. COFECHA yielded site-specific mean series inter-correlations between 0.52 and 0.59. AMS radiocarbon dating during the bomb era indicated that dating uncertainty is ±1 year. 3aJuniperus procera 3adendrochronology 3aradiocarbon dating 3arain 3askeleton 3atrees 3atropics 3auncertainty 3awood anatomy 3aEthiopia 0aTropical dendrochronology 0aRing formation 0aAMS radiocarbon dating1 aRobertson, Iain 1 aEshetu, Zewdu 1 aTouchan, Ramzi 1 aSass-Klaassen, Ute 1 aKoprowski, Marcin 0 tTrees.g2011 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.71-82dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-010-0475-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03384naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245009600198300001300294500002400307520200700331650000902338650002702347650001102374650002002385650001102405650002402416650001402440650002302454650001602477650002602493650001402519650001802533650002702551650002202578650001702600700001802617773009602635852000902731856009302740930003302833945002502866946001102891655001202902IND4405021720221119072154.0080428e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440502172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL210 0aL3001 aSanford, L.M.10aProlactin regulation of testicular development and sexual behavior in yearling Suffolk rams  ap. 1-10.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to determine how the yearly prolactin rhythm might affect the sexual development of Suffolk rams (latitude 50°N). Five rams were injected daily with bromocriptine (35-45μgkg⁻¹ body weight) for 1 year, beginning in January (early winter) when rams were 11 months of age. Five control rams each received daily injections of the vehicle. In the controls, blood prolactin was <7.5ngml⁻¹ in winter, increased (P <0.01) to a peak of 172.6±11.9ngml⁻¹ after the spring equinox, and remained high during summer before declining (P <0.01) to 29.6±6.6ngml⁻¹ at the autumn equinox. Suppression of the seasonal rise in prolactin secretion with bromocriptine slowed testicular growth (50%; P <0.05) in April and May (spring), thus delaying the time of peak testis size and sperm production by 1 month. Serum testosterone level was lower (50%; P <0.01) in the treated rams than the controls in June and July (early summer), due mainly to reduced stimulation of the testes by smaller (P <0.01) LH pulse releases or to smaller (P <0.01) testosterone responses to LH releases, respectively. Suppression of prolactin also seemed to disrupt the central activation of gonadotropin secretion in that seasonal increases in serum FSH level and LH pulse amplitude and frequency were unusually slow (P <0.05). These anomalies did not affect testis growth, which was normal from June until development was complete. Rams were sexually inexperienced when libido was first tested in July (non-breeding season). Both groups were equally capable of learning and expressing sexual behavior (i.e. normal mounting and ejaculation frequencies), which was more intense in September (breeding season; P <0.05). Results support the hypothesis (based on the location of prolactin receptors) that the spring increase in prolactin secretion could target both the testes and the hypothalamic-pituitary system and be involved in the seasonal regulation of sexual function in the young adult Suffolk ram. 3arams 3atesticular development 3atestes 3aspermatogenesis 3alibido 3ahormonal regulation 3aprolactin 3aseasonal variation 3aperiodicity 3aSuffolk (sheep breed) 3ayearlings 3abromocriptine 3aphysiological response 3ahormone secretion 3atestosterone1 aDickson, K.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2008 June, v. 77, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080902b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03223naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012000167520188100287592002802168650001502196650001502211650001102226650001402237650001102251650001002262650001602272650001102288650002602299650001202325650001302337650001202350650001802362650001302380650001202393650001002405651002002415700002202435700002302457700002202480700001802502700002502520773012002545856007902665852000902744655001202753IND60646968820221118020020.0190614e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064696882DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy90502512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilippi, Patrick 10aMapping the Depth-to-Soil pH Constraint, and the Relationship with Cotton and Grain Yield at the Within-Field Scale  aSubsoil alkalinity is a common issue in the alluvial cotton-growing valleys of northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Soil alkalinity can cause nutrient deficiencies and toxic effects, and inhibit rooting depth, which can have a detrimental impact on crop production. The depth at which a soil constraint is reached is important information for land managers, but it is difficult to measure or predict spatially. This study predicted the depth in which a pH (H<inf>2</inf>O) constraint (>9) was reached to a 1-cm vertical resolution to a 100-cm depth, on a 1070-hectare dryland cropping farm. Equal-area quadratic smoothing splines were used to resample vertical soil profile data, and a random forest (RF) model was used to produce the depth-to-soil pH constraint map. The RF model was accurate, with a Lin&rsquo;s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) of 0.63&ndash;0.66, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.47&ndash;0.51 when testing with leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Approximately 77% of the farm was found to be constrained by a strongly alkaline pH greater than 9 (H<inf>2</inf>O) somewhere within the top 100 cm of the soil profile. The relationship between the predicted depth-to-soil pH constraint map and cotton and grain (wheat, canola, and chickpea) yield monitor data was analyzed for individual fields. Results showed that yield increased when a soil pH constraint was deeper in the profile, with a good relationship for wheat, canola, and chickpea, and a weaker relationship for cotton. The overall results from this study suggest that the modelling approach is valuable in identifying the depth-to-soil pH constraint, and could be adopted for other important subsoil constraints, such as sodicity. The outputs are also a promising opportunity to understand crop yield variability, which could lead to improvements in management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aarid lands 3acanola 3achickpeas 3acotton 3afarms 3agrain yield 3amodels 3anutrient deficiencies 3arooting 3asodicity 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3atoxicity 3avalleys 3awheat 3aNew South Wales1 aJones, Edward J.,1 aGinns, Bradley  J.1 aWhelan, Brett  M.1 aRoth, Guy  W.1 aBishop, Thomas  F.A.0 tAgronomy.g2019 May 21, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90502513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171520130700273592002801580650001201608650001701620650000901637650001501646650001301661650002901674650002101703650001601724653002101740653001601761653003401777653002501811700002201836700002801858700001801886773009001904856008501994852000902079655001202088IND60690608920221120232846.0200523e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069060892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1176862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoračić, Borna14aThe effect of different parameters of the excess heat source on the levelized cost of excess heat  aIn areas with higher heat demand densities, district heating is the most logical way of achieving heat sector decarbonisation aims, especially when renewable energy or highly efficient cogeneration is used. However, excess heat from industry is also recognized as a valuable source with the high potential for utilization. It increases the economic and environmental viability of the system due to the low operation, investment and conventional energy costs. The main goal of this work was to define the effect of the main factors influencing the levelized cost of excess heat. The paper provided the feasibility of excess heat utilization in different district heating configurations, including solar collectors, cogeneration, peak load boilers, heat pumps and heat storages, showing that its overall utilization can be much lower than the expected 100% of the overall availability depending on the configuration. Furthermore, temperature levels of the excess heat source have been considered in the analysis to show changes in levelized cost of excess heat with different temperatures and the necessary preconditions for its utilization. It has been concluded that it is necessary to reduce the supply temperature of district heating in order to make the low temperature excess heat sources feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboilers 3aenergy costs 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aindustry 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 0aDistrict heating 0aExcess heat 0aLevelized cost of excess heat 0aFeasibility analysis1 aPukšec, Tomislav1 aSchneider, Daniel Rolph1 aDuić, Neven,0 tEnergy.g2020 June 15, v. 201 p.117686-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1176863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009200169300001600261520100500277592002801282650004701310650002501357650002101382650004101403650002501444650002501469650002401494650001601518650003601534650002601570650002101596650001301617650001601630653002101646653003601667653003201703653001001735653001301745653002501758653004001783653003501823653004301858653004901901653004501950653004501995653005702040653002802097653004702125653003502172700001502207700001702222700002902239773010002268856008702368852000902455655001202464IND60542341220221118035610.0190402e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054234122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuehua10aModulation of Actinidia arguta fruit ripening by three ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors  ap. 405-413.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of postharvest application of 1-methylecyclopropene (1-MCP), 1-pentylcyclopropene (1-PentCP) and 1-octylcyclopropene (1-OCP), two structural analogues of 1-MCP, on Actinidia arguta (Siebold et Zucc.)

But, 0.8μlL−1 1-OCP was found to be more potent in postponing the appearances of respiration rate peak and ethylene production peak, delaying the softening and weight loss, suppressing the activities of ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO), maintaining higher glutathione (GSH) content, activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), though slightly inferior to 1.2μlL−1 1-MCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aActinidia arguta 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aethylene production 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3apostharvest treatment 3arespiratory rate 3aripening 3aweight loss 0aActinidia arguta 0a1-Pentylcyclopropene (1-PentCP) 0a1-Octylcyclopropene (1-OCP) 0aDelay 0aRipening 0aAntioxidant activity 0aDithiothreitol (PubChem CID: 19001) 0a1-Heptene (PubChem CID: 11610) 0aMethylene chloride (PubChem CID: 6344) 0aPolyvinylpyrrolidone (PubChem CID: 11989721) 0aSodium ascorbate (PubChem CID: 23667548) 0aTrichloroacetic acid (PubChem CID: 6421) 0aEthyenediammine-tetraacetic acid (PubChem CID: 6049) 0aH2O2 (PubChem CID: 784) 0aS-adenosyl methionine (PubChem CID: 34755) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176)1 aXu, Fangxu1 aFeng, Xuqiao1 aMacArthur, Roseline Love0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 173 p.405-413dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007900173300001600252500001900268520136700287536035601654592002802010650001602038650003002054650001002084650001602094650001502110650002002125650002602145650002302171650001302194650002102207650001302228650001402241650003202255650006202287650001802349653001202367653001402379653001802393700002602411700002402437700003002461700002902491773013902520856008502659852000902744655001202753IND60738160420221120105716.0210521e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073816042DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2021.18886152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuitio, Chakpetch10aAptasensor for paraquat detection by gold nanoparticle colorimetric method  ap. 370-377.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to develop an aptasensor for paraquat detection by gold nanoparticles. The specific aptamer for paraquat was selected by using the SELEX process via capillary electrophoresis. Sixty-three aptamer candidates were amplified by asymmetric PCR and screened for paraquat binding using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Aggregation of AuNPs was specifically induced by desorption of paraquat binding aptamers from the surface of AuNPs as a result of aptamer–target interaction leading to the color change from red to purple. Aptamer 77F with the following sequence: 5′-AGGCTTACACCTGAAAAGCGGCTTAATTTACACTACTGTAT-3′ was selected as a highly specific aptamer for paraquat. The detection limit of paraquat was 0.267 µg/mL by colorimetry and 1.573 µg/mL by the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique. This aptamer showed specificity for paraquat by colorimetry. Dimethyl phophite, diethyl phophite and O,O diethyl thiophosphate potassium salt did not react by colorimetry but, exhibited a weak nonspecific reaction by QCM. This is first time that an aptasensor was used for detection of paraquat based on QCM. However, the aptasensor based on the colorimetric method simply uses a generation of a signal that can be detected by the naked eye. This technique is rapid, low cost easy to use and suitable for on-site detection of herbicide residue.  aThis work was supported by the Research and Researcher for Industries Ph.D. program (Grant No. PHD59I0001), National Research Council of Thailand, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University, and the Center for Advanced Studies in Nanotechnology for Chemical, Food and Agricultural Industries, the KU Institute for Advanced Studies, Kasetsart University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental science 3aherbicide residues 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3aparaquat 3apotassium 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3athiophosphate 0aAptamer 0aherbicide 0aSELEX process1 aKlangprapan, Supaporn1 aChingkitti, Netnapa1 aBoonthavivudhi, Sornsamat1 aChoowongkomon, Kiattawee0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2021 Apr. 3, v. 56, no. 4 p.370-377dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2021.18886153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245005300132300001600185500001500201520079500216592002801011650001701039650002201056653002901078700001401107773010901121852000901230939003301239946001301272655001201285IND8206922420221119134241.0181002e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820692242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra, Subhash,10aEffect of cattle manure on soil erosion by water  ap. 228-231.  a2019-12-05  aWe treated soils from six different regions of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, with 1 and 2 percent concentrations of cattle manure and incubated them for 15 and 30 days. In a laboratory study, we determined erosion coefficients of both natural and treated soils. The cattle manure was found to be effective in checking soil erosion when it was allowed to decompose in soil for 30 days. At a 15-day incubation period, the erosion of many soils increased, possibly due to the production of carbon dioxide and consequent reduction in soil pH. The 2 percent concentration was found to be only marginally superior to the 1 percent concentration in slowing soil erosion. We also observed that the manure application was more effective in light-textured soils having high erosion coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil science 3asoil conservation 0asoil resource management1 aDE, S.

Pooled ejaculates from three beagle dogs were extended in egg yolk tris extender and encapsulated using alginate and poly-L-lysine at room temperature. The microcapsules were cooled at 4 °C, immersed in pre-cooled extender (equivalent in volume to the microcapsules) to reach final concentration of 7% (v/v) glycerol and 0.75% (v/v) Equex STM paste, and equilibrated for 5, 30 and 60 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, microcapsules were loaded into 0.5 mL plastic straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen. In Experiment 1, characteristics of microencapsulated canine sperm were evaluated after glycerol addition at 4 °C. Glycerol exposure for 5, 30 and 60 min did not significantly affect progressive motility, viability, or acrosomal integrity of microencapsulated sperm compared with pre-cooled unencapsulated sperm (control). In Experiment 2, characteristics of frozen-thawed canine microencapsulated sperm were evaluated at 0, 3, 6, and 9 h of culture at 38.5 °C. Pre-freeze glycerol exposure for 5, 30, and 60 min at 4 °C did not influence post-thaw quality in unencapsulated sperm. Post-thaw motility and acrosomal integrity of microencapsulated sperm decreased more than those of unencapsulated sperm (P < 0.05) following glycerol exposure for 5 min. However, motility, viability and acrosomal integrity of microencapsulated sperm after 30 and 60 min glycerol exposure were higher than unencapsulated sperm cultured for 6 or 9 h (P < 0.05). In conclusion, since microencapsulated canine sperm were successfully cryopreserved, this could be a viable alternative to convention sperm cryopreservation in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3aegg yolk 3aglycerol 3amicroencapsulation 3anitrogen 3aspermatozoa 3atemperature 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDogs 2aMale 2aSemen Analysisxveterinary 2aSpermatozoa1 aOtsuki, Tsubasa1 aFujimura, Chika1 aYamamoto, Naoki1 aYamashita, Yasuhisa1 aHigaki, Shogo1 aHishinuma, Mitsugu0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 75, no. 4 p.679-686dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013200165300001600297520096200313592002801275650002001303650002901323650002501352650002101377650001301398650001301411650000901424650001601433650001301449650002101462650001801483650001601501650001501517653001901532653002201551653001301573653001601586653001801602653002601620653000901646653000801655653000801663653000701671653000701678653000901685653000801694653001001702653000901712653000701721653000801728653000801736653000801744653000701752653000801759700002201767700001701789700005801806773012401864856008301988852000902071655001202080IND60633479120221120195142.0190325e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063347912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoyo, Javier10aMultifunctional ZnO NPs-chitosan-gallic acid hybrid nanocoating to overcome contact lenses associated conditions and discomfort  ap. 114-121.  aContact lenses (CL) provide visual correction but their use may also induce several adverse effects causative of discomfort and conditions that lead to stop or discontinue their use. Discomfort is mainly caused by insufficient wetting, impairment of the antioxidant defence system and eye infections. The current work reports on a single step sonochemical coating of CL with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), chitosan (CS) and gallic acid (GA). GA and CS are expected to improve the comfort of CL by imparting respectively antioxidant properties and enhanced wettability, while their combination with ZnO NPs provides the CL with antimicrobial properties. The ternary composite coating presents high antibacterial efficiency (>4.5 logs reduction) against S. aureus causative of CL-related conditions, and maintains good biocompatibility (>72%) with human cell lines. The obtained multi-functionality on the CL did not affect their geometry and refractive properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3acoatings 3aeyes 3agallic acid 3ageometry 3ahuman cell lines 3ananoparticles 3awettability 3azinc oxide 0aContact lenses 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aChitosan 0aGallic acid 0aSonochemistry 0aAntibacterial coating 0aDMSO 0aAMP 0aAFM 0aCS 0aCL 0aDPPH 0aEDS 0aFESEM 0aFITC 0aGA 0aMeO 0aNPs 0aROS 0aUS 0aWCA1 aIvanova, Kristina1 aGuaus, Ester1 aTzanov, Tzanko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8568-11100 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 May 01, v. 543 p.114-121dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012900165520125200294592002801546650001301574650001001587650001901597650001701616700002001633700001901653700001701672700001901689700002201708700002601730700002101756773012201777856008001899852000901979655001201988IND60754162120221120130549.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075416212DNAL7 a10.3390/biology101010542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokota, Hayato 10aRelationship between Plasma Concentrations of Afatinib and the Onset of Diarrhea in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  aWe evaluated the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) of afatinib required to avoid the onset of grade 2 or higher diarrhea. The C₀ and AUC₀–₂₄ of afatinib were significant higher in patients with grade 2 diarrhea than in those with grade 0–1 diarrhea. The areas under the receiver operator curves were 0.795 with the highest sensitivity (89%) and specificity (74%) at an AUC₀–₂₄ threshold of 823.5 ng·h/mL, and 0.754 with the highest sensitivity (89%) and specificity (74%) at a C₀ threshold of 28.5 ng/mL. In Kaplan–Meier analysis based on these cut-off AUC₀–₂₄ and C₀ values, the median time to the incidence of grade 2 diarrhea was 16 days. The predicted AUC₀–₂₄ of afatinib from the single point of C₆ showed the highest correlation with the measured AUC₀–₂₄ (r² = 0.840); however, a significant correlation between the AUC₀–₂₄ and C₀ was also observed (r² = 0.761). C₀ could be used as a marker of therapeutic drug monitoring because afatinib C₀ was related to AUC₀–₂₄. Therefore, afatinib C₀ should be monitored on day 8 after beginning therapy, and the daily dose of afatinib should be adjusted as an index with a cut-off value of 28.5 ng/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiarrhea 3adrugs 3alung neoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aSato, Kazuhiro 1 aSakamoto, Sho 1 aOkuda, Yuji 1 aAsano, Mariko 1 aTakeda, Masahide 1 aNakayama, Katsutoshi 1 aMiura, Masatomo 0 tBiology.g2021 Oct. 17, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology101010543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015300178300001600331500001900347520140400366536028801770592002802058596001302086650003402099650002902133650001802162650002502180650001702205650001202222650001702234650002602251650001902277650001602296650002802312650001502340650001002355650001302365650001102378650001402389650001302403650001002416653001802426653002602444653001702470700002902487700002202516700003802538700003902576700003202615700002702647700002502674700003502699700002202734773013902756856008502895852000902980655001202989IND60738160620221120100021.0210521e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073816062DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2021.18905192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPante, Giseli Cristina10aLitsea cubeba essential oil: chemical profile, antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity, effect against Fusarium verticillioides and fumonisins production  ap. 387-395.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the chemical profile of Litsea cubeba essential oil, carry out an in vitro evaluation of its antioxidant potential and its cytotoxicity, as well as its antifungal and antimicotoxigenic activities against Fusarium verticillioides. Most of the compounds observed in the EO were neral (32.75%) and geranial (37.67%). The radical scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid was 104.4 and 56.4 mmol Trolox mg⁻¹, respectively, indicating good antioxidant activity. The EO studied by us revealed cytotoxic effect against HT-29 and HeLa cancer cells. The Minimum Inhibitory and Minimum Fungicidal Concentrations against F. verticillioides were both 125 µg mL⁻¹. Morphological investigation, performed by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, showed that hyphae and microconidia structures underwent changes after treatment with the EO. Analyses performed with the EO strongly reduced the mycelial development of F. verticillioides and the synthesis of fumonisins B₁ and B₂ in dose-dependence effect compared (P < 0.01) with the fungal control (10⁵ conidia mL⁻¹) and positive control (fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M). Thus, the results obtained in vitro suggest that L. cubeba EO has excellent antioxidant, fungicidal, and antimycotoxigenic effects.  aThis study was financed in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001, as well as the Complex of Central Research Support (Complexo de Centrais de Apoio à Pesquisa - Comcap) from the State University of Maringá.  aPublisher supplied data  aCode 001 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aLitsea cubeba 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aconidia 3acytotoxicity 3aenvironmental science 3aessential oils 3afludioxonil 3afluorescence microscopy 3afumonisins 3afungi 3ageranial 3ahyphae 3amefenoxam 3amycelium 3aneral 0aessential oil 0abiological activities 0abiofungicide1 aCastro, Juliana Cristina1 aLini, Renata Sano1 aRomoli, Jéssica Cristina Zoratto1 aAlmeida, Rafaela Takako Ribeiro de1 aGarcia, Francielle Pelegrin1 aNakamura, Celso Vataru1 aPilau, Eduardo Jorge1 aAbreu Filho, Benício Alves de1 aMachinski, Miguel0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2021 Apr. 3, v. 56, no. 4 p.387-395dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2021.18905193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168520112700279592002801406650000801434650001201442650001301454650002401467650002201491650001601513653002001529653001701549653003101566700001701597700001701614700001801631700001801649773009001667856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60690609320221122051751.0200523e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069060932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1176942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Daoming10aTheoretical study of infrared transparent cover preventing condensation on indoor radiant cooling surfaces  aDue to their energy saving and thermal comfort, radiant cooling (RAC) systems have attracted growing interests all around the world in recent years. However, condensation has been troubling the wide application of RAC systems. In this paper, being analogous to the sky radiative cooling, a method of infrared (IR) transparent cover preventing condensation on the RAC surface is proposed. The feasibility of this method is analyzed theoretically by modeling. The key factors affecting the anti-condensation performance are studied in detail, including flow regimes in the interlayer, mean IR radiative properties of transparent covers and relative humidity of indoor air. It is shown that the RAC system equipped with an IR transparent cover could operate without condensation as long as the relative humidity is not more than 79.2%. The temperature of the RAC surface could be lowered to 7 °C when the relative humidity is less than 65%. The method could overcome the limitation of the dew point temperature on the cooling capacity partly. It is conducive to the application of RAC systems in hot and humid environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acooling 3adewpoint 3aenergy conservation 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 0aRadiant cooling 0aCondensation 0aInfrared transparent cover1 aLi, Nianping1 aCui, Haijiao1 aZhou, Linxuan1 aLiu, Qingqing0 tEnergy.g2020 June 15, v. 201 p.117694-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1176943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011500169520124900284592002801533650005001561650001201611650001501623650002601638650001901664650002001683650002701703650001501730650001701745650001701762700002201779773012001801856007901921852000902000655001202009IND60646969220221118020019.0190614e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064696922DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy90502552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovelli, Francesco 10aAssimilation of Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index Data into a Physically-Based Crop Growth Model for Yield Estimation  aRemote sensing data, crop growth models, and optimization routines constitute a toolset that can be used together to map crop yield over large areas when access to field data is limited. In this study, Leaf Area Index (LAI) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite were combined with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate crop yield using a re-calibration data assimilation approach. The experiment was implemented for a winter wheat crop during two growing seasons (2016 and 2017) under four different fertilization management strategies. A number of field measurements were conducted spanning from LAI to biomass and crop yields. LAI showed a good correlation between the Sentinel-2 estimates and the ground measurements using non-destructive method. A correlating fit between satellite LAI curves and EPIC modelled LAI curves was also observed. The assimilation of LAI in EPIC provided an improvement in yield estimation in both years even though in 2017 strong underestimations were observed. The diverging results obtained in the two years indicated that the assimilation framework has to be tested under different environmental conditions before being applied on a larger scale with limited field data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnvironmental Policy Integrated Climate Model 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3anondestructive methods 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3awinter wheat1 aVuolo, Francesco 0 tAgronomy.g2019 May 21, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90502553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002100172245011900193300001600312520116800328592002801496650002201524650002301546650002301569650001501592650001101607650004301618650002801661650002901689650001201718650001101730650001201741650001201753650004101765650003701806650002701843650003101870650002601901650002801927650002901955650002301984650002502007700001602032773008302048856008902131852000902220655001202229IND4466416420221118010706.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446641642DNAL7 a212159912pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyay, Aparna10aMolluscicidal activity of Sapindus mukorossi and Terminalia chebula against the freshwater snail Lymnaea acuminata  ap. 468-474.  aThe molluscicidal activity of Sapindus mukorossi and Terminalia chebula fruit powder against the vector snail Lymnaea acuminata was time and concentration dependent. The molluscicidal activity of T. chebula fruit powder (96h LC₅₀:93.59mgL⁻¹) was more pronounced than that of S. mukorossi fruit powder (96h LC₅₀:119.57mgL⁻¹). Ethanolic extracts of S. mukorossi and T. chebula fruit powder were more toxic than their other organic solvent extracts. The molluscicidal activity of ethanolic extract of S. mukorossi fruit powder (24h LC₅₀:2.75mgL⁻¹) was more effective than the ethanolic extract of T. chebula fruit powder (24h LC₅₀:124.06mgL⁻¹). The 96h LC₅₀ of column-purified fraction of S. mukorossi fruit powder was 5.43mgL⁻¹ whereas those of T. chebula fruit powder was 7.49mgL⁻¹. Column, thin layer and high performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrates that the active molluscicidal component in S. mukorossi and T. chebula is saponin (96h LC₅₀:1.31mgL⁻¹) and tannic acid (96h LC₅₀:1.64mgL⁻¹), respectively.

BioTiger™, a patented microbial consortium of twelve natural environmental isolates, was found to cometabolically biodegrade the NA hexanoic acid and the PAH phenanthrene in the presence of tailings. Hexanoamide was found to be produced and consumed during cometabolism of hexanoic acid. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated three of the BioTiger™ strains generated biosurfactants with the bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay, seven with the methylene blue active substances assay, and nine with a hemolysis assay. Serial transfers of the BioTiger™ consortium demonstrated the stability of hexanoic acid degradation over several generations. The results demonstrate that BioTiger™ cometabolically biodegrades combinations of phenanthrene and hexanoic acid in tailings. This work reveals the potential for in situ bioremediation of tailings with this natural microbial consortium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abacterial adhesion 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3ahemolysis 3ahexanoic acid 3aindustry 3amethylene blue 3amine tailings 3anaphthenates 3aoil sands 3aphenanthrenes 3atoxicity1 aMilliken, Charles E.1 aForeman, Koji1 aFox, Jasmine1 aSimpson, Waltena1 aBrigmon, Robin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7668-15650 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.253-258dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02776-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010800170300001600278520112100294592002801415650002001443650001401463650001301477650001401490650001401504650001401518650003101532650001301563650001601576653001401592653001401606653001401620653002301634653001901657700002101676700002001697700001301717700001401730700001801744700001501762700001201777773010001789856008701889852000901976655001201985IND60542341620221118035333.0190402e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054234162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiaorong10aComparative characterisation of green tea and black tea cream: Physicochemical and phytochemical nature  ap. 432-440.  aTea cream is prevalent in various types of tea, yet a comparison of the mechanism of creaming in different teas remains uncertain. Here, we compared physicochemical characteristics, phytochemical composition, and simulated digestive profiles of green tea and black tea cream, looking to exploit their concentration and structure based mechanisms and in vitro bioaccessibility. Green tea cream particles were roughly one order of magnitude larger than those of black tea in size. Moreover, creaming concentrations of catechins, proteins and methylxanthines of green tea were dramatically higher than black tea. As major creaming components, gallated catechins, theaflavins, thearubigins, theabrownines, proteins and methylxanthines also exhibited high creaming affinities. Green tea cream particles, which were completely destroyed by simulated digestion, had few impacts on digestive recoveries of catechins and methylxanthines. In comparison, black tea cream particles were more stable under mimicking digestion, and clarification remarkably decreased the in vitro bioaccessibility of catechins and methylxanthines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ablack tea 3acreaming 3adigestion 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3aphysicochemical properties 3aproteins 3atheaflavins 0aGreen tea 0aBlack tea 0aTea cream 0aPhysical chemistry 0aPhytochemistry1 aChen, Zhongzheng1 aZhang, Yuanyuan1 aLuo, Wei1 aTang, Hao1 aDeng, Baibiao1 aDeng, Jian1 aLi, Bin0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 173 p.432-440dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245009600202300001600298520153100314592002801845650001301873650001201886650001101898650001501909650001301924653001901937653001901956653002101975653001401996653002102010700001502031700001302046700001902059700001802078773012402096856008302220852000902303655001202312IND60633479420221120195141.0190326e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063347942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Miaosi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4802-371410aControlled addition of new liquid component into surface droplet arrays by solvent exchange  ap. 164-173.  aMicroscopic droplets integrating multiple functionalities are essential in the microcompartmentalized related reaction and applications. Solvent exchange is a simple approach for producing femtoliter surface droplets by the transit oversaturation created at the mixing front of a solution by a poor solvent. But it remains challenging to control the compositions in nanodroplets. Our hypothesis is the new liquid component can be added to the pre-formed surface droplets at certain ratios controlled by solvent exchange.In this work we investigate the growth of the droplets during addition of a new component by solvent exchange. Two-component droplets were formed on a microdomain patterned substrate as highly ordered arrays. The physical and chemical parameters that control droplet composition and a possible application of the binary droplet arrays were presented in this work.The added amount of the second component in the binary droplet can be quantitatively controlled by the solution and flow conditions. The theoretical prediction of the component ratio based on the droplet diffusive growth dynamics mode shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The results show that the solvent exchange on the surface with pre-formed droplets provides a highly efficient method to tune the droplet compositions to desired ratio. The unique feature of this approach enables a gradient structure of droplet composition over the surface, demonstrated by an application of different microlens performance on a surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aliquids 3amixing 3aprediction 3asolvents 0aDroplet arrays 0aMulticomponent 0aSolvent exchange 0aMicrolens 0aSurface gradient1 aYu, Haitao1 aBao, Lei1 aDyett, Brendan1 aZhang, Xuehua0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 May 01, v. 543 p.164-173dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010700152300002000259520125900279592002801538650001401566650001401580650001601594650001101610650001701621650001501638650003301653650002201686650002801708700001601736700002001752700001601772700001401788773013601802856007501938852000902013655001202022IND60537442320221120170929.0160809e20121226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053744232DNAL7 a10.1021/ie30197742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Miao12aA Novel Integrated Feature Selection Method for the Rational Synthesis of Microporous Aluminophosphate  ap. 16734-16740.  aIn this paper, an integrated feature selection model is proposed to explore the relationship between the synthetic factors and the specific resulting structure on the database of AlPO syntheses. Specifically, the proposed model can select the most significant synthetic factors for the generation of (6,12)-ring-containing structure. First, a random subspace method is employed to prerank the synthetic factors based on the predictive performance of a support vector machine. Then, the Fisher score is presented to rank the synthetic factors for getting a fusion weight. Finally, a sequential forward search method is utilized to select the most significant synthetic factors in view of the highest predictive performance. Specially, the principal-component-analysis method is adopted as guidance for estimating the random subspace dimension. The results are judged on the numerical prediction of (6,12)-ring-containing AlPO structures. Simultaneously, we compare our method with several classical feature selection methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits higher predictive accuracy with less synthetic factors. The results also provide an important guidance for the rational design and synthesis of microporous materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adatabases 3aengineering 3amodels 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aselection methods 3asupport vector machines1 aLi, Jinsong1 aWang, Jianzhong1 aLu, Yinghua1 aKong, Jun0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Dec. 26, v. 51, no. 51 p.16734-16740dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie30197743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245013400160300001400294520195800308592002802266650001502294650001102309650001402320650002802334650001302362650001302375650000702388650001502395650001502410650002202425650001602447650001102463650002302474650002002497650001802517650002702535650002802562700001902590700001602609700001702625773012002642856008102762852000902843655001202852IND4410212220221118010554.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441021222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-0013-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzsoy, T.12aA study of ionic composition and inorganic nutrient fluxes from rivers discharging into the Cilician Basin, Eastern Mediterranean  ap. 17-29.  aPresent water quality of the perennial rivers; Göksu, Lamas, Efrenk, Tarsus and Seyhan discharging into the Cilician Basin have been investigated. Monthly surface samples collected from three stations downstream of the rivers during the period of October 2004–May 2005 were analyzed to determine ionic composition (Cl⁻, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺ and K⁺), in addition to measurements of pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity and total hardness. The results have been compared with recommended water quality standards. Excluding Göksu, Seyhan and Efrenk river mouths, values for almost all measured parameters, except [Formula: see text], were found to be lower than the desirable limits. In particular, inorganic ammonium, phosphate and nitrate concentrations for Göksu and Seyhan Deltas were 10¹ or 10² orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of the rest of the samples. Temporal variation in levels, primarily observed in [Formula: see text], suggest the impact of agricultural fertilizers intensively used around Göksu and Seyhan Rivers. According to Turkish National Water Pollution Control Regulations, all rivers were found to be unpolluted with respect to their nitrate, chloride, sulfate and sodium ion contents, while they all could be considered as slightly polluted with respect to their phosphate contents. In contrast to nitrate and phosphate, ammonium exceeded the maximum permissible limits of water quality criteria in almost all samples. Among the sampled rivers, Tarsus River was better in water quality, with the lowest electrical conductivity, alkalinity, total hardness and nutrient concentration values. Calculated values of elemental inorganic N and P fluxes suggest a substantial increase in nitrogen loads within the last decade, compared to a significant decrease in phosphorus loads of the rivers during the same period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3abasins 3achlorides 3aelectrical conductivity 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution control 3ariver water 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater quality criteria 3awater quality standards1 aTürkoğlu, E.1 aDoğan, A.,1 aSerin, D.

To identify the best options, 40 plant configurations and two turbine configurations were simulated: Backpressure Turbine (BPT), Condensing-Extraction Turbine (CET); four types of EFB pretreatment: EFB Crude; EFB W/M; EFB D/M; EFB P; and five gas temperatures generated in the boiler (320 psig/320 °C; 320 psig/400 °C; 400 psig/450 °C; 600 psig/450 °C; 900 psig/500 °C). Results showed that configurations with the CET and steam at high pressure (>400 psig) with EFB type D/M produced the most energy. Generation with raw and pelletized EFB generated low amounts of energy due to vaporization heat requirements and energy consumption by peripheral equipment, especially with the BPT. CET configurations had the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) at 390 COP/kWh, which is close to the average energy price around Colombian palm mills. Initial cost estimates showed that CET with high pressure steam at weighted energy price >230 COP/kWh are currently profitable (NPV > 0). Commercialization of energy obtained from low pressure steam is only calculated to be profitable when the price of electricity is > 320 COP/kWh.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3acost estimates 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy costs 3aequipment 3afruits 3afuels 3aheat 3apalm oil mills 3apellets 3apower generation 3aprices 3asteam 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aEmpty fresh bunches (EFB) 0aPalm oil mill 0aPower generation 0aRankine cycle 0aLCOE1 aValdés, Carlos,1 aChaquea, Hernando1 aPecha, M.

The present study aimed to identify any potential association that may exist between TNF-α promoter gene polymorphism and parasitic infections. A total of 199 blood samples were evaluated from children who were part of the MAL-ED study cohort. The DNA was used to investigate polymorphism in the promoter region of the TNF-α gene at position -1031T/C. The polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) assay. The TC genotype at position -1031 was significantly higher in healthy controls children than in children who were infected with Entamoeba species (59.9% vs 29.4%, P = 0.015) and Entamoeba coli (59.1% vs 30.8%, P = 0.046), indicating that TC genotype may be protective against Entamoeba infections and Entamoeba coli infections. The CC genotype at position -1031 was more common among children with parasite and diarrhea and the results was statistically significant (P = 0.04). This study has revealed that the CC genotype may be is a risk factor for symptomatic parasitic infections while the TC genotype might be protective of Entamoeba infections among children in Dzimauli community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEntamoeba 3ablood 3adiarrhea 3agenes 3agenotype 3aintestines 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3arisk factors 3aSouth Africa 0aGenetics 0aImmunology 0aMicrobiology 0aMolecular biology 0aTNF-α 0aPCR-RFLP 0aDzimauli community 0aLimpopo province 0aSouth Africa1 aElBakri, A.K.1 aBessong, P.O.1 aSamie, A.0 tHeliyon.g2020 Oct., v. 6, no. 10 p.e05129-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e051293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012100175300001600296520093300312536007901245592002801324650002001352650003801372650001201410650001101422650002001433650001401453650001601467653001301483653002801496653002501524653001601549653002701565700001801592773014401610856008601754852000901840655001201849IND60737259920221123014804.0210827e20210519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073725992DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2020.18461642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelimont, Nicole M.10aSalivary cystatin SN is a factor predicting iron bioavailability after phytic acid rich meals in female participants  ap. 559-568.  aPhytic acid is an inhibitor of iron bioavailability, but it has been suggested that individuals may adapt to phytic acid over time, and that the salivary protein, cystatin SN, may be involved. This study evaluated the relationship between human cystatin SN levels and iron bioavailability after a phytic acid rich meal. Three groups of ten women consumed meals with: (1) 500 mg phytate sprinkles, (2) 500 mg phytate capsules, or (3) no phytic acid. Iron bioavailability was measured by the mealtime percentage of maximum iron recovery; cystatin SN was measured pre-and post-meal by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pre-to-post meal cystatin SN was positively correlated with improved iron bioavailability in group 1. Pre-to-post meal cystatin SN was correlated with improved iron absorption in groups 1 and 2. Cystatin SN recovery after phytic acid rich meals may be a physiological factor predicting iron bioavailability.  aThis project was funded by Wichita State University’s School of Nursing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3ahumans 3airon absorption 3anutrition 3aphytic acid 0aPhytates 0aantinutritional factors 0airon bioavailability 0acystatin SN 0anutritional adaptation1 aNickel, Sarah0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2021 May 19, v. 72, no. 4 p.559-568dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2020.18461643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003200110245008200142300001600224500001500240520221200255592002802467650001602495650001902511653001702530700001502547773011002562852000902672939003302681946001302714655001202727IND8211079120221119134245.0181002e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND821107912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortvedt, J.

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), cv. Nugaines, was grown on Mountview silt loam (limed to pH 5.5 and 7.5) treated with three commercial diammonium phosphate (DAP) products containing 48, 73, and 188 ppm Cd and reagent grade DAP alone (1 ppm Cd) or with added CdCl2 to supply 188 ppm Cd. Cadmium concentrations in wheat forage, grain, and straw were significantly increased with increasing Cd concentrations in DAP at both soil pH levels. Concentrations of Cd in plant tissues were higher from reagent DAP containing CdCl2 than from commercial DAP containing the same Cd concentration and also were higher in plant tissues from all fertilizer treatments on acid than on alkaline soil. Results of a second greenhouse experiment also showed that Cd concentrations in corn (Zea mays L.) forage from DAP products containing the same concentrations of Cd (131 ppm) decreased in the order: reagent DAP + CdCl2, commercial DAP, and reagent DAP + Cd3(PO4)2.In laboratory experiments, commercial DAP and superphosphate (TSP) containing 188 and 180 ppm Cd, respectively, and reagent DAP containing about the same concentrations of Cd added as several Cd salts were mixed with soil at a rate of 200 ppm P (0.19 ppm Cd). After incubation in moist soil at room temperature, levels of extractable Cd decreased in the order: DAP + CdCl2, commercial DAP and TSP, DAP + Cd(H2PO4)2, DAP + CdHPO4, and DAP + Cd3(PO4)2. Concentrations of Cd in extracts from each treatment in alkaline soil generally were lower than those in extracts from acid soil, followed the same trends with each experiment, and decreased in the order: 0.1 N HCl, 0.005 M DTPA, and deionized H2O. The decrease in level of extractable Cd in treated soil is in the same order as that of plant uptake results in the greenhouse experiments. Results therefore suggest that the chemical form of Cd contained in TSP and DAP is Cd(H2PO4)2, CdHPO4, or a mixture of these salts, which are Cd analogues of the P compounds in commercial P fertilizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3afertilizers 3asoil fertility 0asoil science1 aOSBORN, G.0 tSoil science.g1982 Sept., v. 134, no. 3 p.185-192dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19821109c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245011100170520126900281592002801550650001801578650001501596650001401611650001501625650001301640650002601653650001101679650001901690650001901709650001601728650001501744700002901759700002101788700002001809700002501829700002501854773012201879856008002001852000902081655001202090IND60754162620221120130431.0211023e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075416262DNAL7 a10.3390/biology101010612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandagopal, Pavitra 10aBioactive Metabolites Produced by Cyanobacteria for Growth Adaptation and Their Pharmacological Properties  aCyanobacteria are the most abundant oxygenic photosynthetic organisms inhabiting various ecosystems on earth. As with all other photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria release oxygen as a byproduct during photosynthesis. In fact, some cyanobacterial species are involved in the global nitrogen cycles by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Environmental factors influence the dynamic, physiological characteristics, and metabolic profiles of cyanobacteria, which results in their great adaptation ability to survive in diverse ecosystems. The evolution of these primitive bacteria resulted from the unique settings of photosynthetic machineries and the production of bioactive compounds. Specifically, bioactive compounds play roles as regulators to provide protection against extrinsic factors and act as intracellular signaling molecules to promote colonization. In addition to the roles of bioactive metabolites as indole alkaloids, terpenoids, mycosporine-like amino acids, non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, ribosomal peptides, phenolic acid, flavonoids, vitamins, and antimetabolites for cyanobacterial survival in numerous habitats, which is the focus of this review, the bioactivities of these compounds for the treatment of various diseases are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abyproducts 3aevolution 3aflavonoids 3anitrogen 3anonribosomal peptides 3aoxygen 3aphenolic acids 3aphotosynthesis 3apolyketides 3aterpenoids1 aSteven, Anthony Nyangson1 aChan, Liong-Wai 1 aRahmat, Zaidah 1 aJamaluddin, Haryati 1 aMohd Noh, Nur Izzati0 tBiology.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology101010613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008800162300002000250520102500270592002801295650002201323650003701345650002401382650001301406650001601419650002101435650001501456650003701471650000901508700001801517700002501535700001801560700001801578773013601596856007501732852000901807655001201816IND60537442520180425000000.0160809e20121226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053744252DNAL7 a10.1021/ie302096e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZydorczak, Barbara10aDissolution of Cr2O3(s) and the Behavior of Chromium in Concentrated NaOH Solutions  ap. 16537-16543.  aThe solubility of Cr₂O₃(s) in (1 and 6) mol kg–¹ sodium hydroxide solutions has been investigated at 25 °C. Even after 75 days of solid/solution contact the apparent solubility continued to increase slowly. Analysis of the solution phase by UV–vis spectrophotometry revealed that all of the dissolved chromium was present as Cr(VI), in the form of CrO₄²–(aq); no Cr(III) could be detected. Consistent with this finding, Cr(III) dissolved in 6 mol kg–¹ NaOH was found to be oxidized to CrO₄²–(aq) over of period of days. No significant changes to the solid phase, Cr₂O₃(cr), were found, either by X-ray diffraction or by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as a result of its contact with NaOH(aq). Both CrO₄²– and Cr(III) were found to be unreactive toward a range of organic and inorganic compounds in 6 mol kg–¹ NaOH over many days at ambient temperatures. However, CrO₄²– catalyzed the decomposition of L-ascorbate, and was rapidly reduced by elemental Zn to Cr(III) in NaOH(aq).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3achromium 3aengineering 3asodium hydroxide 3asolubility 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc1 aMay, Peter M.1 aMeyrick, Danielle P.1 aBátka, David1 aHefter, Glenn0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Dec. 26, v. 51, no. 51 p.16537-16543dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie302096e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010300162300001600265520111100281592002801392650001501420650001401435650001301449650002401462650001301486650001801499650001101517653002001528653001801548653002801566653002501594700001301619700001501632700001701647700001501664773012401679856008301803852000901886655001201895IND60633479720221120190301.0190326e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063347972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Bin10aNano sulfur particles decorated bi-lamella composites for superior electromagnetic wave absorption  ap. 138-146.  aSulfur nanoparticles decorated bi-lamella composites with multiple interfaces were constructed by introducing a handful of nano-S particles into the interlayer of graphene and poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene): poly (styrenesulfonate) (GSP). Graphene and PEDOT: PSS with large surface areas and abundant functional groups offer adequate contact sites for the chemical confinement of sulfur nanoparticles. Based on the equivalent circuit theory, insulating sulfur could commendably regulate hopping conduction by slowing down the hopping electrons among the layers. Meanwhile, the substantial conductivity differences result in evident interfacial polarization (MWS effect). With the favorable permittivity behavior and multiple interfacial polarizations, more microwaves could be brought into the interior of absorber and were consumed. The GSP-paraffin composites with 35 wt% GSP loading possess the minimum reflection loss (RL) value of −21.9 dB at 1.6 mm, and effective absorption bandwidth of 4.72 GHz. This work demonstrates the significant role of multi-interfaces on microwave absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3amicrowave radiation 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3asulfur 0aDual interfaces 0aIntercalation 0aElectrical conductivity 0aMicrowave absorption1 aLiu, Wei1 aXu, Guoyue1 aJi, Guangbin1 aDu, Youwei0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 May 01, v. 543 p.138-146dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04238naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010600170506011700276506007600393520191300469592002802382506003702410650002302447650003502470650002102505650002002526650001202546650001802558650001702576650002302593650002302616650002202639650001102661650001602672650001402688650004302702650002002745650002202765650001702787653001302804653001302817653002402830653001002854653001402864653002302878653001802901653001702919653002202936653001702958653001802975653001502993653002303008653002703031700001603058700002003074700002503094700002603119700005803145700002003203700005703223700005903280773009403339856008603433852000903519655001203528IND60715130120221207131414.0220517e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071513012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e051332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Pragati10aCombination of Pancreastatin inhibitor PSTi8 with metformin inhibits Fetuin-A in type 2 diabetic mice  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the preceding study, we delineated that high-fat diet (HFD) consumption in mice increases the circulatory level of pancreastatin (PST), which additionally enhances the free fatty acid (FFA) concentration in circulation. Consequently, the aggravated FFA activates Fetuin-A, which facilitates hepatic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance (IR), and culminates in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin (Met) is a widely known first-line drug for the treatment of T2D. We previously unveiled PSTi8, an inhibitor of PST, comprising antidiabetic property. Hence, we hypothesized that combination therapy of Met and PSTi8, at reduced therapeutic doses, would mitigate HFD-induced IR by inhibiting hepatic Fetuin-A in mice model of T2D. C57BL/6 mice were fed HFD for 12 weeks, followed by treatment with Met, PSTi8, and its combination for 10 days. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were conducted. Circulatory levels of PST, Fetuin-A, and lipid markers were determined. Also, the mRNA and protein expression of Fetuin-A was assessed by qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Moreover, the energy expenditure was measured by comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system (CLAMS). Combination therapy displayed improved PST, Fetuin-A, and lipid profile in plasma. We also found reduced hepatic Fetuin-A, which reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS and increased phosphorylation of AKT. Consequently, ameliorated hepatic lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and inflammation. Also, combination treatment attenuated Fetuin-A expression, lipid accumulation, and glucose production in palmitate-induced HepG2 cells. Altogether current study promulgates the beneficial effect of combination therapy of Met and PSTi8 (comparable to alone higher therapeutic doses) to ameliorate Fetuin-A activation, hepatic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and associated progressive pathophysiological alterations in T2D.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy expenditure 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afree fatty acids 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3alipid composition 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 0aDiabetes 0aFetuin-A 0aCombination therapy 0aPSTi8 0aMetformin 0aInsulin resistance 0aBiotechnology 0aBiochemistry 0aMolecular biology 0aPharmacology 0aEndocrinology 0aMetabolism 0aMetabolic disorder 0aPharmaceutical science1 aGarg, Richa1 aGoand, Umesh K.1 aRiyazuddin, Mohammed1 aReza, Mohammad Irshad1 aSyed, Anees A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0148-51481 aGupta, Anand P.1 aHusain, Athar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1086-23391 aGayen, Jiaur R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7703-93070 tHeliyon.g2020 Oct., v. 6, no. 10 p.e05133-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e051333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245012100179520123200300592002801532650002401560650001301584650001501597650002201612650001501634650001101649650002301660650002101683650001001704650001701714650002201731650002501753651001001778700002201788700002201810700002601832700002401858700002201882700002401904700002301928700002701951700001901978700002401997700002302021700002702044773012202071856008002193852000902273655001202282IND60754162820221120130625.0211023e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075416282DNAL7 a10.3390/biology101010592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDörr, Ambrosius Josef Martin10aPopulation Ecology and Genetic Diversity of the Invasive Alien Species Procambarus clarkii in Lake Trasimeno (Italy)  aThe deliberate or accidental introduction of invasive alien species (IAS) causes negative ecological and economic impacts altering ecosystem processes, imperiling native species and causing damage to human endeavors. A monthly monitoring program was performed in Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy) from July 2018 to July 2019 in order to provide an upgrade of the population ecology of Procambarus clarkii and to assess the genetic diversity by analyzing the relationships among mitochondrial DNA diversity. Our results confirmed that P. clarkii is well acclimatized in the lake, revealing a stable population structure favored by the resources and conditions typical of this ecosystem, which seem to be optimal for the maintenance of the species. Four distinct mitochondrial haplotypes were detected, but one of them was clearly overrepresented (76%), suggesting that a single predominant introduction event may have occurred in this area, likely followed by secondary events. The identification of the typical genetic variants provides a better understanding of the evolutionary scenarios of P. clarkii in this biotope and it can be helpful in management plans concerning the expanding populations of this invasive alien species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3abiotopes 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation structure 3aItaly1 aScoparo, Melissa 1 aCardinali, Irene 1 aLa Porta, Gianandrea 1 aCaldaroni, Barbara 1 aMagara, Gabriele 1 aPallottini, Matteo 1 aSelvaggi, Roberta 1 aCenci Goga, Beniamino,1 aGoretti, Enzo 1 aCappelletti, David 1 aLancioni, Hovirag 1 aElia, Antonia Concetta0 tBiology.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology101010593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245019900183506010400382506007600486520184800562592002802410506003702438650002302475650001302498650001202511650001402523650001602537650002002553650001102573650001902584650001202603653001502615653001302630653001802643653001302661653001802674653002702692700002802719700001702747700006202764700002002826700006002846773009402906856008603000852000903086655001203095IND60715130220221207131407.0220517e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071513022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e051352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyed Hashemi, Seyed Ghasem14aThe mediating effect of the cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity in the association between problematic internet use, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19 among Iranian online population  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWith the rapid growth of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), individuals may try to find related medical information using the internet to overcome their fears. Under such circumstances, individuals with the features of cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and metacognitive beliefs in negative thoughts may suffer more fears than those without these features. Therefore, the present study proposed a model to understand the associations between problematic internet use (PIU), cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19. Utilizing a cross-sectional online survey, 651 Iranians completed the following psychometric scales: Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Anxiety Sensitivity Questionnaire (ASI), Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Form (CSS-12), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV–19S), and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the proposed model via several fit indices. The indices include Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The fit indices (CFI = 0.948, TLI = 0.938, RMSEA = 0.053, and SRMR = 0.001) indicated the good fit between the data and the proposed model. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 was significantly and directly predicted by cyberchondria (β = 0.479, p < .001) and anxiety sensitivity (β = 0.286, p < .001). The relationship between PIU and cyberchondria with fear of COVID-19 was mediated significantly by anxiety sensitivity and metacognitive beliefs. Because fear of COVID-19 was found to be significantly associated with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity, healthcare providers may want to provide additional support for those with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity tendencies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3aanxiety 3aequations 3afearfulness 3ahealth services 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 0aPsychology 0aCOVID-19 0aCyberchondria 0aInternet 0aMetacognition 0aPsychological distress1 aHosseinnezhad, Shalaleh1 aDini, Solmaz1 aGriffiths, Mark D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8880-65241 aLin, Zhongying,1 aPakpour, Amir H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8798-53450 tHeliyon.g2020 Oct., v. 6, no. 10 p.e05135-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e051353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245019200164520184600356592002802202650001102230650001502241650001902256650003002275650001002305650001902315650001102334650001102345650001202356650001302368650001602381650002002397650001502417650001702432700002502449700002302474700001702497700002102514700002002535700002102555700002202576700001502598700002402613700002302637773012202660856008002782852000902862655001202871IND60754162920221117164955.0211023e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075416292DNAL7 a10.3390/biology101010622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayama, Emiko 10aInduced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes with SCN5A R1623Q Mutation Associated with Severe Long QT Syndrome in Fetuses and Neonates Recapitulates Pathophysiological Phenotypes  aThe SCN5A R1623Q mutation is one of the most common genetic variants associated with severe congenital long QT syndrome 3 (LQT3) in fetal and neonatal patients. To investigate the properties of the R1623Q mutation, we established an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cardiomyocyte (CM) model from a patient with LQTS harboring a heterozygous R1623Q mutation. The properties and pharmacological responses of iPSC-CMs were characterized using a multi-electrode array system. The biophysical characteristic analysis revealed that R1623Q increased open probability and persistent currents of sodium channel, indicating a gain-of-function mutation. In the pharmacological study, mexiletine shortened FPDcF in R1623Q-iPSC-CMs, which exhibited prolonged field potential duration corrected by Fridericia’s formula (FPDcF, analogous to QTcF). Meanwhile, E4031, a specific inhibitor of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, significantly increased the frequency of arrhythmia-like early after depolarization (EAD) events. These characteristics partly reflect the patient phenotypes. To further analyze the effect of neonatal isoform, which is predominantly expressed in the fetal period, on the R1623Q mutant properties, we transfected adult form and neonatal isoform SCN5A of control and R1623Q mutant SCN5A genes to 293T cells. Whole-cell automated patch-clamp recordings revealed that R1623Q increased persistent Na⁺ currents, indicating a gain-of-function mutation. Our findings demonstrate the utility of LQT3-associated R1623Q mutation-harboring iPSC-CMs for assessing pharmacological responses to therapeutic drugs and improving treatment efficacy. Furthermore, developmental switching of neonatal/adult Nav1.5 isoforms may be involved in the pathological mechanisms underlying severe long QT syndrome in fetuses and neonates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aautomation 3acardiomyocytes 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutants 3apatients 3aprobability 3asodium channels 3astem cells 3atherapeutics1 aFurutani, Yoshiyuki 1 aKawaguchi, Nanako 1 aSeki, Akiko 1 aNagashima, Yoji 1 aOkita, Keisuke 1 aTakeuchi, Daiji 1 aMatsuoka, Rumiko 1 aInai, Kei 1 aHagiwara, Nobuhisa 1 aNakanishi, Toshio 0 tBiology.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology101010623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245014600179300001600325520223000341592002802571650003402599650001202633650002002645650001502665650001802680650000902698650001402707650002102721650001502742650001302757650001102770650001902781650001402800650000702814650001902821650000902840650001802849650001302867650001302880650001302893650001102906651001102917651001002928653002602938653002002964653002402984653001403008653001803022700002503040700006103065700002903126700006403155700002203219700003403241700002003275773010703295856008503402852000903487655001203496IND60590799120221120232216.0190202e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059079912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Hernández, Yusniel10aFractionation and mobility of thallium in areas impacted by mining-metallurgical activities: Identification of a water-soluble Tl(I) fraction  ap. 154-165.  aMining and metallurgy generate residues that may contain thallium (Tl), a highly toxic metal, for which it is currently not feasible to determine its geochemical speciation through X-ray absorption spectroscopy due to a combination of very low contents and the interference of accompanying high arsenic contents. Therefore, fractionation studies in residues and soils are required to analyze the mobility and bioavailability of this metal, which in turn provide information to infer its speciation. For this purpose, in this work a modification of the BCR procedure was applied to residues and contaminated soils from three mining zones of Mexico and two mining zones of Spain, spanning samples with acidic to alkaline pH values.The Tl extraction procedure consisted of the following fractions: (1) water-extractable, (2) easily exchangeable and associated to carbonates, associated to (3) poorly-crystalline and (4) crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides, and (5) associated to organic matter and sulfides; and finally a residual fraction as associated to refractory primary and other secondary minerals. The extracted contents were analyzed by Inductively-Coupled Plasma with Mass Spectrometry.Surprisingly, water-soluble, in Tl(I) oxidation state, was detected in most areas, regardless of the pH, a fact that has not been reported before in these environments, and alerts to potential health risks not previously identified. Most of the samples from a metallurgy area showed high levels of Tl in non-residual fractions and a strong correlation was obtained between extracted Mn and Tl in the third fraction, suggesting its association to poorly crystalline manganese oxides. In the majority of samples from purely mining environments, most of the Tl was found in the residual fraction, most probably bound to alumino-silicate minerals. The remaining Tl fractions were extracted mainly associated to the reducible mineral fractions, and in one case also in the oxidizable fraction (presumably associated to sulfides).Capsule: Soluble Tl(I) was found in all soil samples contaminated with either mining or metallurgical wastes. Additionally, in those affected by metallurgical wastes a very strong Tl-Mn correlation was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acarbonates 3afractionation 3airon 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3ametallurgy 3aminerals 3amining 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3asoil sampling 3asulfides 3athallium 3atoxicity 3awastes 3aMexico 3aSpain 0aSequential extraction 0aMining residues 0aThallium speciation 0aMn oxides 0aWater-soluble1 aRuiz-García, Mismel1 aVillalobos, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2820-848X1 aRomero, Francisco Martin1 aMeza-Figueroa, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8934-03211 aGarrido, Fernando1 aHernández-Alvarez, Elizabeth1 aPi-Puig, Teresa0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 June, v. 237 p.154-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245015400167520100400321592002801325650002101353650004301374650001301417650001201430650002201442650001601464650001201480650001101492650001301503650001301516650001401529650001301543650001001556700002301566700001901589700002501608773012001633856007901753852000901832655001201841IND60646969920221118020213.0190614e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064696992DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy90502612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, Juan  B.10a<i>Wx</i> Gene in <i>Hordeum chilense:</i> Chromosomal Location and Characterisation of the Allelic Variation in the Two Main Ecotypes of the Species  aStarch, as the main grain component, has great importance in wheat quality, with the ratio between the two formed polymers, amylose and amylopectin, determining the starch properties. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), or waxy protein, encoded by the Wx gene is the sole enzyme responsible for amylose synthesis. The current study evaluated the variability in Wx genes in two representative lines of Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schult., a wild barley species that was used in the development of tritordeum (&times;Tritordeum Ascherson et Graebner). Two novel alleles, Wx-Hch1a and Wx-Hch1b, were detected in this material. Molecular characterizations of these alleles revealed that the gene is more similar to the Wx gene of barley than that of wheat, which was confirmed by phylogenetic studies. However, the enzymatic function should be similar in all species, and, consequently, the variation present in H. chilense could be utilized in wheat breeding by using tritordeum as a bridge species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum chilense 3aNDP-glucose-starch glucosyltransferase 3aTriticum 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abarley 3abreeding 3aecotypes 3aphylogeny 3apolymers 3awheat1 aCastellano, Laura 1 aRecio, Rocío 1 aCabrera, Adoración 0 tAgronomy.g2019 May 22, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90502613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245009300196300001500289520168900304592002801993650001402021650000802035650001602043650001702059650002302076650001402099650001202113650002002125650001502145650001802160650002102178650001402199650002002213650001402233650001602247650003002263650001302293650001402306650001202320650001402332700002002346700001802366700001902384773015102403856006902554856010402623990002302727852000902750655001202759IND60643469620221119110229.0190510e20131222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064346962DNAL7 a10.3791/509932doi7 aPMC41095852pmcid7 a243789092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRottloff, Sandy10aIsolation of viable multicellular glands from tissue of the carnivorous plant, Nepenthes  ap. e50993.  aMany plants possess specialized structures that are involved in the production and secretion of specific low molecular weight compounds and proteins. These structures are almost always localized on plant surfaces. Among them are nectaries or glandular trichomes. The secreted compounds are often employed in interactions with the biotic environment, for example as attractants for pollinators or deterrents against herbivores. Glands that are unique in several aspects can be found in carnivorous plants. In so-called pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes, bifunctional glands inside the pitfall-trap on the one hand secrete the digestive fluid, including all enzymes necessary for prey digestion, and on the other hand take-up the released nutrients. Thus, these glands represent an ideal, specialized tissue predestinated to study the underlying molecular, biochemical, and physiological mechanisms of protein secretion and nutrient uptake in plants. Moreover, generally the biosynthesis of secondary compounds produced by many plants equipped with glandular structures could be investigated directly in glands. In order to work on such specialized structures, they need to be isolated efficiently, fast, metabolically active, and without contamination with other tissues. Therefore, a mechanical micropreparation technique was developed and applied for studies on Nepenthes digestion fluid. Here, a protocol is presented that was used to successfully prepare single bifunctional glands from Nepenthes traps, based on a mechanized microsampling platform. The glands could be isolated and directly used further for gene expression analysis by PCR techniques after preparation of RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNepenthes 3aRNA 3aattractants 3abiosynthesis 3acarnivorous plants 3adigestion 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3aherbivores 3amechanization 3amolecular weight 3anectaries 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3apollinators 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3asecretion 3atissues 3atrichomes1 aMithöfer, Axel1 aMüller, Ute,1 aKilper, Roland0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Dec. 22, , no. 82 p.e50993-e50993dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/509933Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50993/isolation-viable-multicellular-glands-from-tissue-carnivorous-plant  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169300001800294500001900312520164300331536015201974592002802126596001902154650002202173650003702195650001402232650002002246650004902266650002902315650002002344650001302364650001302377650000702390650001502397650001502412650002502427653001802452653002702470653001902497653001602516653002802532700001402560700001802574700001702592700001302609700001502622773012002637856008502757852000902842655001202851IND60738161320221120085852.0210521e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073816132DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2019.16875862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yanshi12aA charcoal-shaped catalyst NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ in electro-Fenton: high activity, wide pH range and catalytic mechanism  ap. 1996-2008.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA charcoal-shaped catalyst NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ in electro-Fenton (EF) was synthesized by a facile precipitation approach via sintering products of oxalate co-precipitation. This obtained NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ catalyst was easily separated via an external magnetic field and was used as a heterogeneous electro-Fenton catalyst for rhodamine B (RhB, a target pollutant) degradation. Characteristics of NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ catalyst were assessed using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Barrett-Emmett-Teller (BET), respectively. SEM results revealed that the proposed NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ was charcoal-shaped with the size in the range of 0.5–5 μm. Experiment results show that the EF process with the proposed catalyst could work in a wide pH range from 3 to 9. Under optimized conditions, estimated 90% RhB degradation was achieved in 60 min under the following conditions: 0.6 g/L NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃, pH 3. Radical scavengers and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra results demonstrated that the main oxidant species involved was , accounting for RhB degradation in EF. Moreover, according to our research on interfacial reaction, was mainly generated from the homogenous Fenton reaction rather than the surface Fenton reaction, stimulating by the dissolved Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Ni²⁺ from catalyst. The reusability of NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ catalyst was evaluated for recycling the same catalyst for 5 runs. In conclusion, the facile fabrication NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ catalyst shows great potential in wastewater treatment with promising activity.  aThe research was supported by National Key Research and Development Plan of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China (No. 2016YFC0401102).  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0401102 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acoprecipitation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironmental technology 3amagnetic fields 3aoxalates 3aoxidants 3apH 3apollutants 3arhodamines 3awastewater treatment 0aNiFe2O4/Fe2O3 0aheterogeneous catalyst 0aelectro-Fenton 0arhodamine B 0aelectron spin resonance1 aQiu, Shan1 aDeng, Fengxia1 aZhu, Yingshi1 aMa, Fang1 aLi, Guojun0 tEnvironmental technology.g2021 June 7, v. 42, no. 13 p.1996-2008dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2019.16875863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012000164300001600284520150500300592002801805650002201833650003701855650001201892650002301904650002501927650002201952650001701974650000901991650001302000650001502013650001302028650003302041650001602074650003702090650001602127653002802143653002702171653002002198653001902218700001602237700001902253700001402272700001602286700001902302700001702321700001702338700001502355700001502370773012402385856008302509852000902592655001202601IND60633479920221122180828.0190326e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063347992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qiong10aEnhanced acetone sensor based on Au functionalized In-doped ZnSnO3 nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning method  ap. 285-299.  aNobel metal modification could be a valuable method for the fabrication of advanced chemiresistive gas sensor. Herein, a series of Au loaded In-doped ZnSnO3 nanofibers were prepared via electrospinning technique. The crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized materials were characterized by field-emission X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) analyses. The optimal sensor, which was based on 0.25 mol% Au loaded In-doped ZnSnO3 nanofibers, could detect 50 ppm acetone effectively, it possessed a high response (19.3) and fast response/recovery time (10/13 s) at low operating temperature (200 °C). The enhanced gas sensing performance was mainly derived from proper introduction of Au. Since the electronic catalysis of Au nanoparticles created Schottky barrier-type junctions at Au and ZnSnO3 interfaces which could cause tremendous change of resistance and induce to high sensitivity, meanwhile the chemical catalysis of Au nanoparticles promoted the chemisorption and dissociation of gas molecules which could accelerate the reaction with gas sensing material.

Without surface activation, the pristine electrospun nanofiber PVDF-HFP membrane with intrinsic re-entrant structure was directly fluorinated by 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) employing vapor deposition (VD). The fluorinated membrane exhibited excellent surface omniphobicity with high water and ethanol contact angle of 154.1 ± 0.1° and 122.6 ± 1.7°, respectively. The fluorinated membrane showed highly stable omniphobicity and mechanical properties at harsh conditions such as ultrasonic, boiling water, acid and base treatment. More importantly, the resultant omniphobic membrane exhibited robust wetting resistance to the saline feed containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.4 mM) in an 8-h dynamic direct contact MD (DCMD) test. This study provides an effective and benign approach to fabricate omniphobic nanofiber membranes which have great potential in treating saline wastewater containing low surface tension substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aboiling 3acontact angle 3adistillation 3aethanol 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial wastewater 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface tension 3aultrasonics 3avapors 0aOmniphobic 0aNanofiber membrane 0aVapor deposition 0aAnti-wetting 0aMembrane distillation1 aWu, Xing1 aWang, Ting-Yu1 aZhao, Lihua1 aTruong, Yen Bach1 aNg, Derrick1 aZheng, Yu-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3858-10371 aXie, Zongli0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 July 01, v. 606 p.118075-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1180753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245011300171520193900284592002802223650003502251650002102286650002202307650001502329650001602344650001202360650001502372650001802387650001802405650001602423650001402439650001202453650002302465650001202488650001002500650001002510650001902520650001202539650001102551650001802562650001302580650001702593650001702610650001602627651001302643651001502656651001202671700002102683700002202704700002302726700002102749700002502770700002602795773012002821856007902941852000903020655001203029IND60646970120221118110729.0190614e20190524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064697012DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy90502632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTidiane Sall, Amadou 10aDurum Wheat (<i>Triticum durum</i> Desf.): Origin, Cultivation and Potential Expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa  aDurum wheat is an important food crop in the world and an endemic species of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the highlands of Ethiopia and the oases of the Sahara this crop has been cultivated for thousands of years. Today, smallholder farmers still grow it on marginal lands to assure production for their own consumption. However, durum wheat is no longer just a staple crop for food security but has become a major cash crop. In fact, the pasta, burghul and couscous industry currently purchase durum grain at prices 10 to 20% higher than that of bread wheat. Africa as a whole imports over &euro;4 billion per year of durum grain to provide the raw material for its food industry. Hence, African farmers could obtain a substantial share of this large market by turning their production to this crop. Here, the achievements of the durum breeding program of Ethiopia are revised to reveal a steep acceleration in variety release and adoption over the last decade. Furthermore, the variety release for Mauritania and Senegal is described to show how modern breeding methods could be used to deliver grain yields above 3 t ha&minus;1 in seasons of just 92 days of length and in daytime temperatures always above 32 &deg;C. This review describes the potential of releasing durum wheat varieties adapted to all growing conditions of SSA, from the oases of the Sahara to the highlands of Ethiopia. This indicates that the new breeding technologies offer great promise for expanding the area of durum wheat production in SSA but that this achievement remains primarily dependent on the market ability to purchase these grains at a higher price to stimulate farmer adoption. The critical importance of connecting all actors along the semolina value chain is presented in the example of Oromia, Ethiopia and that success story is then used to prompt a wider discussion on the potential of durum wheat as a crop for poverty reduction in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3abreeding methods 3abreeding programs 3acash crops 3adurum wheat 3afarmers 3afood crops 3afood industry 3afood security 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3aimports 3aindigenous species 3amarkets 3aoases 3apasta 3aplant breeding 3apoverty 3aprices 3araw materials 3asemolina 3astaple crops 3asupply chain 3atemperature 3aEthiopia 3aMauritania 3aSenegal1 aChiari, Tiberio 1 aLegesse, Wasihun 1 aSeid-Ahmed, Kemal 1 aOrtiz, Rodomiro 1 aGinkel, Maarten van,1 aBassi, Filippo  Maria0 tAgronomy.g2019 May 24, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90502633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009500167300001600262500001500278520106100293592002801354650001401382650001901396650001101415650001801426650001801444650001801462650002301480650001401503650000901517650001301526650001101539650001001550650002501560650002001585650001601605650001701621650002201638650001801660650001301678653003701691653001701728700002201745700002201767700002101789700002301810700001901833773010101852856004801953852000902001655001202010IND4476535920221121124830.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447653592DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136110601302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlotnikova, E.

According to the results of 16S rDNA sequence alignment, strains B905, SMB11, SMB145, SF27, and DF14 show the highest sequence homology to the type strain of A. crystallopoietes (99.7%), and strain SN17, to the type strain of A. arilaitensis (99.8%). The isolated strains are capable of growing on naphthalene and phenanthrene (as the sole sources of carbon and energy) in the presence of 60 mg/l NaCl. Their cells contain large plasmids ranging in size from 85 to 130 kb. Plasmid elimination from Arthrobacter sp. SF27 has proved to result in the loss of capacity for growing on naphthalene and phenanthrene, suggesting a plasmid localization of genes responsible for degradation of these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3asalt tolerance 3aenergy 3aribosomal RNA 3aphenanthrenes 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence alignment 3aphylogeny 3asoil 3aplasmids 3acarbon 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3asodium chloride 3anaphthalene 3aArthrobacter 3asequence homology 3achemotaxonomy 3abacteria 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aYastrebova, O.

Combining biodegradability, good hemostatic properties and biocompatibility, gelatin is one of the most reliable materials clinically used for preventing internal bleeding in surgeries and for stopping external hemorrhage. Cross-linking is a useful method for enhancing the absorption capacity of gelatin and for controlling the degradation process. Existing and commonly used aldehyde-containing cross-linking agents lack reliability with respect to the control of hemostatic effect, solubility and toxicity. In this study; gelatin was cross-linked with sodium oxidized regenerated cellulose (NaORC) to produce hemostatic microparticles. The NaORC was used at different ratios; and the studies on hemostatic efficiency and cytotoxicity under in vitro conditions demonstrated rapid arrest of bleeding alongside biocompatibility. These microparticles employing NaORC as a cross-linking agent for the first time demonstrated a unique structure for stopping bleeding with biocompatibility, and opened the way for different forms of cross-linked structures to be used in other biomaterials applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3agelatin 3ahemorrhage 3ahemostasis 3amicroparticles 3aoxidation 3asodium 3asolubility 3asurgery 0aHemostasis 0aOxidized regenerated cellulose 0aGelatin 0aMicroparticle 0aCross-linking1 aKocer, Zeynep1 aSahin, İsa1 aAru, Basak1 aYanıkkaya Demirel, Gulderen1 aSezer, Serdar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6234-22710 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 200 p.624-632dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245008600162300001600248520123800264592002801502650001901530650002001549650001601569650001401585650001701599650001101616650002001627650001101647650002001658650001901678700001601697773009001713856004601803852000901849655001201858IND4477810420221118010547.0120727e199801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447781042DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10068244041412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa Matta, F.M.10aPhotoinhibition and recovery of photosynthesis in Coffea arabica and C. canephora  ap. 439-446.  aPhotosynthetic parameters were determined in disks from leaves of C. arabica cv.

Kouillou showed a relatively higher irradiance requirement for saturating photosynthesis, lower chlorophyll (Chl) content, and higher Chl a/b ratio than Catuaí. Photoinhibition of photosynthesis under bright irradiance was manifested by decreases in maximum photochemical efficiency (evaluated by the variable to maximum fluorescence ratio, Fv/Fm), as a consequence of an increased initial and a quenched maximum fluorescence. Restoration of Fv/Fm following photoinhibition in low irradiance was faster in Kouillou than in Catuaí. Chloramphenicol both accelerated photoinhibition (mainly in Kouillou) and blocked its recovery for at least 190 min in either cultivar. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution under photoinhibitory conditions was decreased by chloramphenicol; in control leaf disks this decrease was only observed in C. arabica, but with a rapid recovery within 90 min of low irradiance exposure. In both coffee cultivars, the depressed photochemical efficiency of photosystem 2 was not accompanied by a concomitant lowering in oxygen evolution during reversal from photoinhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3achloramphenicol 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3aoxygen 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II1 aMaestri, M.0 tPhotosynthetica.g1998 Jan., v. 34, no. 3 p.439-446dSpringer-Verlagx0300-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006824404141  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167300001600252520121400268592002801482650000801510650001401518650002201532650001801554650002101572650002201593650001301615650001901628650001301647650001701660700001701677700002101694700001801715700001701733700002501750700002001775700001801795700002101813700002201834700002001856773007101876856008401947852000902031655001202040IND60582199020221121235457.0171005e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058219902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.06.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelke, Julia10aCarbon materials for the positive electrode in all-vanadium redox flow batteries  ap. 220-230.  aThe electrode material in all-vanadium redox flow batteries often consists of fibrous carbon felts. It is believed that surface functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, e.g. introduced by heat-treatment, increase the activity of the carbon electrodes due to a facilitated electron transfer. However, other properties of the carbon material have not been investigated in detail. In this paper, the structure of morphologically different carbon materials, such as graphite flakes, two carbon blacks and a carbon fiber material, was correlated with the electrochemical activity obtained by cyclic voltammetry in a three-electrode configuration in vanadyl sulfate solution. Furthermore, the respective carbon materials were heat-treated in air at 400°C and the corresponding structural changes in sp2 carbon content and amount and kind of surface functional groups determined by NEXAFS analysis were correlated with the activity. Our work shows that the sp2 carbon content on the surface is an important parameter significantly affecting the activity. The results can be utilized to choose a suitable carbon powder material to impregnate the felts in order to increase their reactive surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abatteries 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbon fibers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3asulfates 3asurface area1 aJakes, Peter1 aLangner, Joachim1 aRiekehr, Lars1 aKunz, Ulrike1 aZhao-Karger, Zhirong1 aNefedov, Alexei1 aSezen, Hikmet1 aWöll, Christof,1 aEhrenberg, Helmut1 aRoth, Christina0 tCarbon.g2014 Nov., v. 78 p.220-230dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.06.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009800170300001400268520139200282592002801674650000901702650002901711650002101740650001301761650001101774650001401785650001201799650001501811650002401826650001901850650001801869650001601887650002101903650002101924653004301945653001801988653002102006653002702027653001202054700002002066700002402086700002002110700002202130700001702152700002202169773010602191856008602297852000902383655001202392IND60610106220221122005102.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061010622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.07.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNāz, Faraḥ,10aSynthesis and characterization of chitosan-based waterborne polyurethane for textile finishes  ap. 54-62.  aChitosan has gained an increased interest of researchers due to its nontoxic, biodegradable, biocompatible and renewable properties as well as its antimicrobial activity. In this work, a series of chitosan-based waterborne polyurethane (CS-WPU) emulsions were synthesized. The synthesis was accomplished by using a two-step emulsion polymerization process. The pre-polymer was prepared using hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW = 6 kDa). Afterwards, the chain extension step was performed by using different mole ratios of chitosan. Moreover, the effect of chitosan on physicochemical properties of the emulsion was studied. To evaluate textile performances such as tear strength, tensile strength and pilling, the CS-WPU emulsion was applied on different plain weave polyester cotton dyed and printed fabrics by using pad-dry cure techniques. The antimicrobial activity of the treated and untreated fabrics was also evaluated via the agar diffusion method. The results displayed that incorporation of chitosan has prominent effects on tensile tear strength, tear strength and antimicrobial activity of polyester cotton dyed and printed fabrics. Moreover, antimicrobial activity was considerably enhanced as the mole ratio of the chitosan was increased. The results emphasize that CS-WPU based on HDI exhibits a better performance as compared to IPDI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acotton 3aemulsions 3afabrics 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3aresearchers 3atensile strength 3atextile finishes 0aChitosan-based waterborne polyurethane 0aTear strength 0aTensile strength 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aPilling1 aZuber, Mohammad1 aMehmood Zia, Khalid1 aSalman, Mahwish1 aChakraborty, Jeet1 aNath, Ipsita1 aVerpoort, Francis0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 200 p.54-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.07.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001200306520124400318592002801562650002601590650002401616650001401640650001101654650002501665650001401690650001601704650002101720650002201741650001001763651001601773653002601789653002401815653002501839653001701864653001901881700002701900700001901927773010301946856008402049852000902133655001202142IND60122793720221119010316.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012279372DNAL7 a10.1080/21580103.2013.8145932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbino, Azyleah C.10aAssessment of species diversity, biomass and carbon sequestration potential of a natural mangrove stand in Samar, the Philippines  ap. 2-8.  aThis study was conducted to assess the species diversity and carbon sequestration potential of a natural mangrove stand in Botoc, Pinabacdao, Samar, the Philippines. Using the quadrat sampling technique, 12 plots with a size of 100 m ² were established to facilitate inventory and measurement of trees. Shannon-Wiener index and allometric equations were used to determine species diversity, and biomass and tree carbon storage, respectively. The community's species diversity (H ′ = 1.6365) was very low with a total of eight true mangrove species recorded, dominated by Avicennia officinalis with an importance value of 134.80%. Among the plots, a greater percentage of the total biomass was accounted to the above-ground biomass, corresponding to 74% (297.20 t ha ⁻¹), while the remaining 26% (103.87 t ha ⁻¹) was credited to the root biomass. The total carbon sequestered and stored in the biomass of the natural mangrove stand was 188.50 t C ha ⁻¹ equivalent to 691.81 t CO ₂ ha ⁻¹. The biomass and carbon density estimates acquired in this study suggest that natural mangrove forests in Botoc have the potential to sequester and store a huge amount of atmospheric carbon regardless of the very low species diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia officinalis 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aequations 3ainventories 3amangrove forests 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aPhilippines 0aAvicennia officinalis 0aallometric equation 0aabove-ground biomass 0aroot biomass 0acarbon storage1 aCastillo, Jose Alan A.1 aLee, Young Jin0 tForest science and technology.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 10, no. 1 p.2-8dTaylor & Francisx2158-07157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21580103.2013.8145933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001600281500001900297520084400316536029201160592002801452650001301480650001301493650001701506650002301523650001601546651001501562651001001577651001801587651002001605653001201625653001301637653002101650653001801671700002601689700002501715700001401740700003001754773012801784856008501912852000901997655001202006IND60737260720221117223655.0210514e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073726072DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2020.17834602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLokhande, Vini14aThe diatom genus Luticola D.G.

Of these, seven are considered to be new species and they are formally described here. They are compared with congeners based on valve size and shape, and ultrastructural features. Another two species described previously by H.P. Gandhi and originally assigned to the genus Navicula are formally transferred to Luticola. Over 25 species of Luticola have been reported from south-east Asia, most of them endemic to the region. The morphological variation of the genus is considered along with its systematics, biogeography and ecology. It appears that south-east Asia, Antarctica and South America are the areas of endemism for this genus.  aThe field expedition associated with this work was supported by National Geographic Society Exploration Grant (Grant Number: 9224-12), VL is supported by an Institute Intramural Grant (BOT 23), and RC is supported by a Science and Engineering Research Board Core Grant (EMR/2014/000308).  aPublisher supplied data 3aNavicula 3aalgology 3abiogeography 3aindigenous species 3anew species 3aAntarctica 3aIndia 3aSouth America 3aSouth East Asia 0aendemic 0aLuticola 0aPeninsular India 0aWestern Ghats1 aRadhakrishnan, Cheran1 aKociolek, J.

In this study potential protective strategies to prevent degradation were investigated. Metal ion chelating resin, or the chelators EDTA and desferrioxamine decreased monatin and indole loss for solutions kept either in darkness or exposed to light. Tannic acid and Chinese bayberry extract both afforded protection, but this did not arise from a light filtering effect. Plastics with defined absorbance characteristics provided protection with this being wavelength dependent; yellow transparent PET plastic was most effective. The contribution of these interventions (metal ion removal/binding; antioxidant; light absorption) was additive, with combinations providing the greatest protective effect against monatin and indole loss. These results indicate that it is possible to minimise monatin degradation by appropriate choices of treatments, additives and container.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aMorella rubra 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aadditives 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3achelating agents 3adeferoxamine 3ametal ions 3aplastics 3aprotective effect 3asweetness 3atannins 3awavelengths 0aMonatin 0aTryptophan 0aPhoto-oxidation 0aSweetener 0aMetal ions 0aRadicals 0aSinglet oxygen1 aPattison, David I.1 aKoehler, Jamie A.1 aGaspard, Dan S.1 aEvans, Jeff C.1 aHagestuen, Erik D.1 aDavies, M.

Seedlings  aAutotoxicity is a common problem being faced in protected vegetable cultivation system. Phytoremediation of plant autotoxicity is an emerging concept to minimize deterioration of soil environment and reduction of yield and quality of vegetable crops. Brassinosteroids (BRs) have been reported as a potential phytohormone to assist phytoremediation. However, the effects of BRs-induced autotoxicity stress on plant growth, photosynthesis and antioxidant defense system are poorly understood. Hence, we focused on the changes in physiological characteristics and ultrastructure of cucumber leaves in response to the application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) under autotoxicity stress conditions. The results showed that leaf area, plant height, fresh weight and dry weight of cucumber were obviously decreased under autotoxicity stress conditions. EBR application obviously improved the phenotypic characteristics of cucumber seedlings. Chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of cucumber leaves were markedly reduced under autotoxicity stress conditions. Application of EBR improved the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a by 15.80%, chlorophyll b by 18.70% and total chlorophyll content by 17.30%), net photosynthetic rate by 36.40% and stomatal opening of leaves under autotoxicity stress conditions. EBR application also maintained the integrity of chloroplast and thylakoid structures under autotoxicity stress conditions. The activity of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and antioxidative compounds ascorbate (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents were markedly decreased, however, these were obviously increased after EBR application under autotoxicity stress. EBR application also increased the soluble sugar and protein, and proline concentration by 59.70%, 7.22% and 36.58%, respectively in the leaves of cucumber, decreased malondialdehyde by 24.13% and reactive oxygen species contents (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> by 35.17%, O<inf>2</inf>&minus; by 12.01% and &bull;OH by 16.59%), and reduced the relative permeability of the cell membrane by 14.31%. These findings suggest that EBR application enhanced the photosynthetic capacity of leaves, maintained the integrity of chloroplast and thylakoid structures, and effectively alleviated the damage of membrane caused by lipid peroxidation and root damage under autotoxicity stress conditions. The growth inhibition effect of autotoxicity stress on cucumber was reduced by EBR application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abrassinosteroids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acucumbers 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3agrowth retardation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3apermeability 3aperoxidase 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3apigments 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aplant hormones 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3aseedlings 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asugars 3athylakoids 3aultrastructure 3avegetable crops 3avegetable growing1 aAzher Nawaz, Muhammad 1 aLi, Fuxin 1 aBai, Lisha 1 aLi, Jie 0 tAgronomy.g2019 May 26, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy90502653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245020000175300001600375520105600391592002801447596010001475650002401575650001701599650001501616650001001631650001201641650001401653650001201667650000901679650002401688650000901712650002801721650002201749650002001771650001301791650000901804700001601813700002001829700006901849773014401918856008202062852000902144655001202153IND60682035520221120090114.0200123e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068203552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-019-02766-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoniruzzaman, Mahammed10aEnzymatic, Non-enzymatatic Antioxidant Levels and Heat Shock Protein Expression as Indicators of Metal Induced Toxicity and Reproductive Modulation in Female Indian Major Carp Cirrhinus cirrhosus  ap. 235-244.  aEffects of zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) exposure on oxidative biomarkers and heat shock protein (HSP) expression, and their possible relation to ovarian steroidogenesis in fish were investigated. Female Cirrhinus cirrhosus were exposed to 1/10th of LC₅₀ of metals for 30 days, and kept for another 30 days without metal exposure. Metal concentrations, antioxidants, HSPs, 17β-estradiol and steroidogenic enzymes were analysed in brain and ovary after 15 and 30 days of exposure and a 15 and 30 day recovery period. Activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants showed duration dependent variation in both exposure and recovery period. HSP70 and HSP90 expressions increased following metal exposure, with the expression being higher in brain than ovary. 17β-Estradiol, steroidogenic enzymes decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after metal exposure. The present study suggests that metals have differential and tissue specific influence on oxidative status and manipulate ovarian steroidogenesis probably through the modulation of HSPs.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST-NPDF Programme (PDF/2017/001308)cDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of India 3aCirrhinus cirrhosus 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3aenzymes 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afish 3aheat shock proteins 3alead 3alethal concentration 50 3aprotein synthesis 3asteroidogenesis 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aDas, Debjit1 aDhara, Anindita1 aChakraborty, Suman Bhusan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1095-88590 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.235-244dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02766-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245023900167300001600406520149300422592002801915650003101943650002601974650001102000650001302011650001402024650002902038650001602067650001802083650001102101651001002112700002102122773011102143856008102254852000902335655001202344IND50072964420221119130528.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007296442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-013-0742-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhsawa, Masashi10aPossible altitude and temperature limits on pine wilt disease: the reproduction of vector sawyer beetles (Monochamus alternatus), survival of causal nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), and occurrence of damage caused by the disease  ap. 225-233.  aPine wilt disease is caused by the pine wood nematode [Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle]. In East Asia, an important vector of the nematode is Monochamus alternatus Hope. We determined the tolerance and reproductive ability of sawyer beetles and the nematode to altitude and temperature at elevations between 850 and 1,450 m on Mt. Fuji in Japan. The number of emergent adults decreased markedly along the altitudinal gradient, but the beetle could still reproduce at 1,050 m (8.2 °C annual mean temperature). Beetles with a 2-year life cycle increased rapidly in number with increasing altitude. The pine wood nematode survived through winter at all altitudes tested (850–1,450 m). The beetle population decreased between 950 (9.1 °C) and 1,150 m (8.3 °C). Therefore, the beetle population seems to be stable at 850 m (10.2 °C) and lower altitudes (higher temperatures) but cannot be maintained from 950 (9.1 °C) to 1,150 m (8.3 °C) without constant immigration of beetles from lower altitudes. The beetles could not reproduce at altitudes above 1,150 m (lower than 8.2 °C). From the mean and effective cumulative temperatures, we concluded that the beetle (and its population) can endure temperatures lower than those previously reported. Pine wilt disease also occurred at lower temperatures and higher altitudes than expected. We have summarized the principal strategies for controlling the disease at high altitudes based on these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aMonochamus alternatus 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aheat sums 3areproductive performance 3atemperature 3avascular wilt 3awinter 3aJapan1 aAkiba, Mitsuteru0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2014 Mar., v. 133, no. 2 p.225-233dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-013-0742-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006700173300001800240500001400258520108600272592002801358650000801386650000801394650000901402650001101411650001101422650001401433650001701447650002101464650001301485650001401498650001401512700007201526773011801598856008301716852000901799655001201808IND60715495920221120021626.0201027e20201013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071549592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerlyoung, April S.10aAssembly and Characterization of RNA/DNA Hetero-G-Quadruplexes  ap. 4072-4080.  aNAL-light  aTransient association of guanine-rich RNA and DNA in the form of hetero-G-quadruplexes (RDQs) has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating genome transcription and replication but relatively little is known about the structure and biophysical properties of RDQs compared with DNA and RNA homo-G-quadruplexes. Herein, we report the assembly and characterization of three RDQs based on sequence motifs found in human telomeres and mitochondrial nucleic acids. Stable RDQs were assembled using a duplex scaffold, which prevented segregation of the DNA and RNA strands into separate homo-GQs. Each of the RDQs exhibited UV melting temperatures above 50 °C in 100 mM KCl and predominantly parallel morphologies, evidently driven by the RNA component. The fluorogenic dye thioflavin T binds to each RDQ with low micromolar KD values, similar to its binding to RNA and DNA homo-GQs. These results establish a method for assembling RDQs that should be amenable to screening compounds and libraries to identify selective RDQ-binding small molecules, oligonucleotides, and proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3adyes 3agenome 3ahumans 3alibraries 3amitochondria 3aoligonucleotides 3aproteins 3ascreening 3atelomeres1 aArmitage, B.

Here, a luciferase assay system driven by the TSP50 gene promoter was used to screen the inhibitor of expression of TSP50. The study found that cardamonin, a flavone compound, could efficiently inhibit the expression of TSP50 in both mRNA and protein levels. Further results revealed that cardamonin also efficiently inhibited the viability of TSP50 high-expressing cancer cells by inducing G2/M-phase arrest and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Surprisingly, knocking down the expression of TSP50 gene had the same effects as treatment with cardamonin. Moreover, it has been found that cardamonin had an inhibitory potency on TSP50 high-expressing tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of TSP50 greatly decreased the cell sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of cardamonin and reversed the decreased tumor-inhibitory effect of cardamonin. Additionally, both TSP50 interference and treatment with cardamonin could suppress p65 nuclear translocation, and overexpression of TSP50 reversed the suppressive effect of cardamonin on p65 nuclear translocation. Taken together, these results suggest that cardamonin inhibited cell viability and tumorigenesis at least partially via blocking the activation of TSP50-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway, and cardamonin may be a promising anticancer drug candidate in the development of a novel agent for TSP50 high-expressing cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aproteinases 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aCardamonin 0aDrug screening 0aTSP50 inhibitor 0aAntitumor 0aApoptosis1 aSong, Zhen-Bo1 aSun, Lu-Guo1 aBao, Yong-Li1 aYu, Chun-Lei1 aWu, Yin1 aLi, Yu-Xin0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Apr., v. 73 p.63-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01209naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006500162300001800227520029300245592002800538650002700566650001100593650001900604650003400623700002300657700002200680773013400702856007400836852000900910655001200919IND60659799320221123033345.0190823e20130312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065979932DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc40444g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEichhorn, Johanna10aOn-surface polymerization of 1,4-diethynylbenzene on Cu(111)  ap. 2900-2902.  aThe polymerization of 1,4-diethynylbenzene was studied on a Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultra-high vacuum conditions.

O.10aQTL mapping and loci dissection for leaf epicuticular wax load and canopy temperature depression and their association with QTL for staygreen in Sorghum bicolor under stress  ap. 207.  aPlant waxes and staygreen are distinct phenotypic traits that have been independently implicated in heat and drought tolerance among grasses. The association between these two traits has not been fully explored, which makes the exploitation of synergy between them difficult. This study assessed the association between QTL regulating the staygreen (Stg) trait in sorghum and those regulating epicuticular wax load (WL) and associated canopy temperature depression (TD). Using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Tx642 and Tx7000, phenotypic data were collected in three replicated field trials and one greenhouse trial. High absolute TD generally corresponded to high WL. The r² of TD against WL was highest under non-stress conditions in the greenhouse while it was much larger in the cooler and irrigated field conditions compared to hotter, drier field trials. The genetic correlations between the two traits also followed this pattern. Composite interval mapping identified a total of 28 QTL, 15 of which had significant overlaps between different traits. Most of the wax QTL were associated with pre-anthesis drought tolerant Tx7000. However, one QTL for WL overlapped with a QTL for staygreen (Stg2) and was represented by a single, isolated marker near the centromeric region on the short arm of SBI-01. The marker is identified by a Cis-acting regulatory module and is part of a 2-kb multifunctional motif-rich region which includes core promoter and enhancer regions and transcription elements, including a drought-responsive MYB binding site. We suggest that this QTL may be pleiotropic for important stress tolerance mechanisms regulating both staygreen and leaf wax in sorghum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3abinding sites 3acanopy 3achromosome mapping 3adrought tolerance 3aepicuticular wax 3afield experimentation 3agenetic correlation 3agrasses 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3ainbred lines 3airrigated farming 3aleaves 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3awaxes1 aHays, D.

Twenty different kinds of fish, which represent the most common fish species consumed in the Arabian Gulf countries, were analyzed using alpha spectrometer technique. ²¹⁰Po activity concentrations in fish samples were found to vary over a wide range from 0.1 to 14.7 Bq kg⁻¹ fresh weight. This variation of ²¹⁰Po concentrations between various type of fish samples might be attributed to the feeding type pattern and the size of fish. The annual committed effective dose due to ingestion of ²¹⁰Po in fish species for adults in the Arabian Gulf countries was estimated and found to vary from 38 μSv in Bahrain to 85 μSv in Oman with an average value of 59 μSv. These values are considered relatively high compared to those reported in some other regions. However, it is still much lower than the world average ingestion dose due to natural radiation sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afish 3afish consumption 3aingestion 3apolonium 3aradionuclides 3aspectrometers 3aBahrain 3aOman 3aPersian Gulf 0a210Po 0aFish 0aCommitted effective dose 0aMarine environment 0aArabian Gulf1 aAbabneh, Anas M.1 aAlmasoud, Fahad I.1 aAlsagabi, Sultan1 aAlanazi, Yousef J.1 aAljulaymi, Ahmad A.1 aAljarrah, Khaled M.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 210 p.511-515dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005700188245010200245300001100347506007600358520144100434592002801875506003701903650002101940650002001961650001601981650001901997650001502016650002002031650002002051650000802071650002202079650001802101650001602119650001002135700002402145700002602169700001702195700002102212700001902233773015902252856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60574438020221207090640.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057443802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-017-0539-22doi7 aPMC54855862pmcid7 a286515972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenholm, Sari1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7560-093010aChange in body mass index during transition to statutory retirement: an occupational cohort study  ap. 85.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Retirement is a major life transition affecting health behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine within-individual changes in body mass index (BMI) during transition from full-time work to statutory retirement by sex and physical work characteristics. METHODS: A multiwave cohort study repeated every 4 years and data linkage to records from retirement registers. Participants were 5426 Finnish public-sector employees who retired on a statutory basis in 2000–2011 and who reported their body weight one to three times prior to (w₋₃, w₋₂, w₋₁), and one to three times after (w₊₁, w₊₂, w₊₃) retirement. RESULTS: During the 4-year retirement transition (w₊₁, vs. w₋₁) men showed decline in BMI, which was most marked among men with sedentary work (−0.18 kg/m², 95% CI −.30 to −0.05). In contrast, BMI increased during retirement transition in women and was most marked among women with diverse (0.14 kg/m², 95% CI 0.08 to 0.20) or physically heavy work (0.31 kg/m², 95% CI 0.16 to 0.45). Physical activity during leisure time or commuting to work, alcohol consumption or smoking did not explain the observed changes during retirement transition. CONCLUSIONS: In this study statutory retirement was associated with small changes in BMI. Weight loss was most visible in men retiring from sedentary jobs and weight gain in women retiring from diverse and physically heavy jobs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohol drinking 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3acohort studies 3aemployment 3ahealth behavior 3ahuman resources 3amen 3aphysical activity 3apublic sector 3aweight loss 3awomen1 aSolovieva, Svetlana1 aViikari-Juntura, Eira1 aAalto, Ville1 aKivimäki, Mika,1 aVahtera, Jussi0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.85-85dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-017-0539-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009800169300001600267520144400283592002801727650003301755650001601788650001001804650002201814650002101836650001901857650001101876650002201887650001201909650001301921650001201934650001101946650001901957650002501976650001402001650004302015650002602058650002002084653000802104653000902112653000902121653000802130653000902138653001102147653001502158653003302173653001702206653001902223653003102242700002602273700002002299700001502319700002502334700002502359700002102384700001802405773012102423856008702544852000902631655001202640IND60556504220221118221921.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055650422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaers, Jelle10aCharacterization of a neuropeptide F receptor in the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans morsitans  ap. 105-111.  aNeuropeptides related to mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY) and insect neuropeptide F (NPF) are conserved throughout Metazoa and intimately involved in a wide range of biological processes. In insects NPF is involved in regulating feeding, learning, stress and reproductive behavior. Here we identified and characterized an NPF receptor of the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans morsitans, the sole transmitter of Trypanosoma parasites causing sleeping sickness. We isolated cDNA sequences encoding tsetse NPF (Glomo-NPF) and its receptor (Glomo-NPFR), and examined their spatial and temporal expression patterns using quantitative PCR. In tsetse flies, npfr transcripts are expressed throughout development and most abundantly in the central nervous system, whereas low expression is found in the flight muscles and posterior midgut. Expression of npf, by contrast, shows low transcript levels during development but is strongly expressed in the posterior midgut and brain of adult flies. Expression of Glomo-npf and its receptor in the brain and digestive system suggests that NPF may have conserved neuromodulatory or hormonal functions in tsetse flies, such as in the regulation of feeding behavior. Cell-based activity studies of the Glomo-NPFR showed that Glomo-NPF activates the receptor up to nanomolar concentrations. The molecular data of Glomo-NPF and Glomo-NPFR paves the way for further investigation of its functions in tsetse flies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlossina morsitans morsitans 3aTrypanosoma 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3afeeding behavior 3aflight muscles 3aimagos 3ainsect physiology 3ainsects 3alearning 3amammals 3amidgut 3aneuropeptide Y 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproductive behavior 3atrypanosomiasis 0aNPF 0aNPFR 0aGPCR 0aCHO 0asNPF 0aInsect 0aTsetse fly 0aGlossina morsitans morsitans 0aNeuropeptide 0aNeuropeptide F 0aG protein-coupled receptor1 aVan Hiel, Matthias B.1 aPeymen, Katleen1 aZels, Sven1 aVan Rompay, Liesbeth1 aVan Den Abbeele, Jan1 aSchoofs, Liliane1 aBeets, Isabel0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2016 Oct.,  Nov., v. 93-94 p.105-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01076naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006300166300001600229520019800245592002800443650001400471650001200485650001900497653001900516653002800535653001200563773012000575856008200695852000900777655001200786IND60618948120221119034959.0181030e197210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061894812DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517572042010072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Jack10aRelation Between "Minority" Hooks and Neps in the Card Web  ap. 590-591.  aSchematic diagram of cylinder and doffer explains the relationship between the minority hooks and neps.

Across Europe, the ecologically and economically important tree species Fagus sylvatica is expected to suffer particularly under such conditions. The regional introduction of provenances from drier and warmer climates is one option to adapt beech forest ecosystems to these adverse effects of climate change. Marginal populations from the drought-prone southern and north-eastern edges of the species’ distribution come into focus in search of suitable candidates for Central European deciduous forests. Here, we test three marginal provenances (Spain, Bulgaria and Poland) and three provenances from the centre of the distribution range (Germany) for their response to drought in two different soil types (sand, loam) in a full factorial common garden experiment in Landau, Germany. Drought impacted all growth parameters negatively (leaf damage +22 % (percentage points), height −40 % and diameter increment −41 %), and the sandy substrate exacerbated this effect. However, provenances differed in their response to drought and soil type. Evidence for a local adaptation to summer drought was detected, especially in terms of mortality rates. The Bulgarian and Spanish provenance showed a stable performance under drought conditions (BG −27 % in diameter increment; ES −32 %), compared to the Polish (−48 %) or the most sensitive German provenances (−57 %), yet for Bulgaria on a low level of total increment. This may indicate a trade-off between drought tolerance and growth. Therefore, a sole focus on drought-resistant marginal provenances seems to not be conducive, as they might be less adapted to other climatic factors, e.g. frost, as well. However, intermixed with local Central European provenances, these may act as functional insurance in future drought-prone forest stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aadverse effects 3aclimatic factors 3adeciduous forests 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest stands 3aglobal warming 3ainsurance 3aleaves 3amortality 3aprovenance 3asand 3asoil types 3atrees 3aBulgaria 3aGermany 3aPoland 3aSpain1 aKreyling, Juergen1 aBackhaus, Sabrina1 aBeierkuhnlein, Carl1 aBuhk, Constanze1 aEgen, Kolja1 aHuber, Gerhard1 aKonnert, Monika1 aNagy, Laura1 aJentsch, Anke0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2014 Mar., v. 133, no. 2 p.247-260dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-013-0750-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245005900165300001800224500001400242520138800256592002801644650000801672650001601680650001601696650001001712650001801722650001601740650001301756650001401769650001101783650001101794650001101805650002401816650001701840650001901857650002301876650001801899700005301917700002501970700002601995700002202021700002602043700001902069700006102088700006102149773011802210856008302328852000902411655001202420IND60715496020221123034320.0201027e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071549602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Zhenkun14aThe NBDY Microprotein Regulates Cellular RNA Decapping  ap. 4131-4142.  aNAL-light  aProteogenomic identification of translated small open reading frames in humans has revealed thousands of microproteins, or polypeptides of fewer than 100 amino acids, that were previously invisible to geneticists. Hundreds of microproteins have been shown to be essential for cell growth and proliferation, and many regulate macromolecular complexes. One such regulatory microprotein is NBDY, a 68-amino acid component of the human cytoplasmic RNA decapping complex. Heterologously expressed NBDY was previously reported to regulate cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules known as P-bodies and reporter gene stability, but the global effect of endogenous NBDY on the cellular transcriptome remained undefined. In this work, we demonstrate that endogenous NBDY directly interacts with the human RNA decapping complex through EDC4 and DCP1A and localizes to P-bodies. Global profiling of RNA stability changes in NBDY knockout (KO) cells reveals dysregulated stability of more than 1400 transcripts. DCP2 substrate transcript half-lives are both increased and decreased in NBDY KO cells, which correlates with 5′ UTR length. NBDY deletion additionally alters the stability of non-DCP2 target transcripts, possibly as a result of downregulated expression of nonsense-mediated decay factors in NBDY KO cells. We present a comprehensive model of the regulation of RNA stability by NBDY.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3acell growth 3acells 3adeterioration 3ageneticists 3agranules 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3alength 3amodels 3aopen reading frames 3apolypeptides 3areporter genes 3aribonucleoproteins 3atranscriptome1 aLuo, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8709-01031 aSchofield, Jeremy A.1 aSmelyansky, Stephanie1 aKhitun, Alexandra1 aMuthukumar, Sowndarya1 aValkov, Eugene1 aSimon, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7423-52651 aSlavoff, Sarah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4443-20700 tBiochemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 59, no. 42 p.4131-4142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c006723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245011900193300001600312500001500328520125200343592002801595650001401623650001201637650002201649650001201671650001501683650002201698650001201720650002301732650001301755650009001768650004801858650001401906650004601920650002201966650001401988650001902002651001402021653001002035653000902045653002002054653001102074653000902085653001402094700002802108700002002136700002402156700002402180700001802204773011902222856008502341852000902426655001202435IND50066846020221117104532.0190403e20130726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006684602DNAL7 a235976522pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonfante, Francesco10aSusceptibility and intra-species transmission of the H9N2 G1 prototype lineage virus in Japanese quail and turkeys  ap. 177-183.  a2019-12-06  aAvian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have circulated in the poultry population in Asia, Far and Middle East since the mid-1990s. One of the most widespread lineages established in poultry is the G1 lineage. This lineage has undergone further evolution and reassortment since its first detection in 1997 and G1-like H9N2 viruses still circulate. In this study we have investigated the susceptibility of quail and turkeys to the H9N2 G1-lineage prototype strain (A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97). Contact transmission experiments were carried out in both avian species. Animals were infected oro-nasally with increasing doses of the virus (103–106 EID50/0.1ml) and sentinel birds were introduced 4 days post infection (pi) in each experimental group. Quail were more susceptible than turkeys, as they were readily infected with lower challenge doses. Interestingly, infection of turkeys was associated with worse clinical condition. Transmission was detected in both species. Quail infected with a dose less than or equal to 104 EID50 transmitted the virus to the sentinels without showing any signs of disease. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that quail may ensure the perpetuation of H9N2 viruses in poultry, acting as a silent reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3aturkeys 3aInfluenza A virus 3aviruses 3aprototypes 3aCoturnix japonica 2aAnimals 2aCoturnixxvirology 2aGenotype 2aInfluenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtypexclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aInfluenza in Birdsxtransmissionxvirology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesxtransmissionxvirology. 2aTurkeysxvirology 2aVirulence 2aVirus Shedding 3aEast Asia 0aQuail 0aH9N2 0aJapanese quails 0aTurkey 0aLPAI 0aInfluenza1 aPatrono, Livia Victoria1 aAiello, Roberta1 aBeato, Maria Serena1 aTerregino, Calogero1 aCapua, Ilaria0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 July 26, v. 165, no. 1-2 p.177-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01423naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011700154300001800271520035000289592002800639650001100667650001400678650002700692650002300719650002100742650001300763650001900776650001100795650001600806700001700822700001700839773013400856856007400990852000901064655001201073IND60659799520221123033219.0190823e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065979952DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc40448j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Dawei10aSnO₂@graphene nanocomposites as anode materials for Na-ion batteries with superior electrochemical performance  ap. 3131-3133.  aAn in situ hydrothermal synthesis approach has been developed to prepare SnO₂@graphene nanocomposites.

We specifically investigated a possible escape in space, with herbivorous insects moving to the few evergreen trees that occur in this ecosystem; and escape in time, with herbivores presenting an increased nocturnal rather than diurnal activity during the dry season. We determined the variation in the free-feeding herbivorous insects (sap-sucking and leaf chewing) between seasons (beginning and middle of both rainy and dry seasons), plant phenological groups (deciduous and evergreen trees) and diel period (diurnal and nocturnal) in a Brazilian TDF. We sampled a total of 5827 insect herbivores in 72 flight-interception traps. Contrary to our expectations, we found a greater herbivore diversity during the dry season, with low species overlap among seasons. In the dry season, evergreen trees supported greater richness and abundance of herbivores as compared to deciduous trees. Insects were also more active at night during the dry season, but no diel differences in insect abundance were detected during the rainy season. These results indicate that the strategies used by insect herbivores to withstand the severe climatic conditions of TDFs during the dry season include both small-scale escape in space and time, with evergreen trees playing a key role in maintaining resident insect herbivore populations in TDFs. Relatively more nocturnal activity during the dry season may be related to the avoidance of harsh climatic conditions during the day. We suggest that the few evergreen tree species occurring in the TDF landscape should be especially targeted for protection in this threatened ecosystem, given their importance for insect conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aclimatic factors 3adiel activity 3adiurnal activity 3adry forests 3adry season 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amastication 3anocturnal activity 3aphenology 3aphytophagous insects 3aspace and time 3atraps 3atrees 3awet season1 aLeal, Camila R.

Plants effectively help to eliminate environmental pollution by up taking of heavy metals and tolerate cadmium stress through a variety of mechanisms, but biochemical pathways and genes involved in the response of plants to cadmium stress have not been fully and comprehensively identified. Materials and methods Following proteomic studies on the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant in which AT2G37050 (receptor like kinase gene) was knocked-out, it was identified that 150 proteins that were present in the wild (control) plant have been disappeared in the mutant plant. In current study, biological function of AT2G37050 gene/GO terms has been investigated by GeneMANIA and agriGO algorithms. GO term is a controlled vocabulary system describing biological entities in three aspects (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component) in different organisms. Results Bioinformatics studies resulted from the GeneMANIA algorithm showed that the AT2G37050 gene is involved in the biological process of response to cadmium ion. The agriGO algorithm was then used to study GO terms at three levels of biological process, molecular function and cellular component, and role of the AT2G37050 gene and biological process of response to cadmium ion was reconfirmed. In addition, significant GO terms (FDR <0.05) such as "extracellular region", "plasmodesmata", "vacuole membrane" and "chloroplast" are associated with the mechanisms involved in plant tolerance to cadmium stress. This is another supporting evidence, which shows association of AT2G37050 gene and "response to cadmium ion". Conclusions In addition to suggesting a new effective gene in response to cadmium stress, the result of current study can be considered in order to construction of transgenic plants, which are able to purify soil from cadmium contamination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalgorithms 3abioinformatics 3acadmium 3agenes 3ahumans 3amutants 3aproteomics 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 0afunctional genomics 0aarabidopsis thaliana 0abioinformatics 0aresponse to cadmium ion 0aat2g370501 aAghajanzadeh, Tahereh A.1 aheydari, parviz1 aElzenga, Theo0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2020 Apr., v. 12, no. 1 p.1-22dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2020.14672.11663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245005100210300002000261500001900281520105400300592002801354650002101382650001801403650003001421650001801451650001101469650001501480650001101495650001401506650001301520650002001533700001801553700001901571700002201590700006101612700002201673700002001695773011701715856008401832852000901916655001201925IND60715496320210903000000.0201027e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071549632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c012412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, M.

Our method can be used to predict wetting behavior for a solid surface in contact with two liquids. We benchmarked our method against measurements of contact angle from water-in-oil on silica wafers and a range of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different compositions, ranging from oil-wet to water-wet. We also compared our predictions to literature data for wetting of a polydimethylsilane surface. By explicitly including deprotonation for silica surfaces and carboxylic acid SAMs, very good agreement was obtained with experimental data for nearly all surfaces. Poor agreement was found for amine-terminated SAMs, which could be the result of both method and model insufficiencies and impurities known to be present for such surfaces. Solid–liquid IFT cannot be measured directly, making predictions such as from our method all the more important.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic acids 3acontact angle 3adensity functional theory 3adeprotonation 3amodels 3aprediction 3asilica 3asolvation 3asolvents 3asurface tension1 aHassenkam, T.1 aMatthiesen, J.1 aNikolajsen, L.

Recently, a wealth of evidence has emerged that F-box proteins is critically involved in tumorigenesis in part through governing the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of cell cycle proteins, and dysregulation of this process leads to aberrant cell cycle progression and ultimately, tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this review, we describe the critical role of F-box proteins in the timely regulation of cell cycle. Moreover, we discuss how F-box proteins involve in tumorigenesis via targeting cell cycle-related proteins using biochemistry studies, engineered mouse models, and pathological gene alternations. We conclude that inhibitors of F-box proteins could have promising therapeutic potentials in part through controlling of aberrant cell cycle progression for cancer therapies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aF-box proteins 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3agenes 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 0aCell cycle 0aF-box protein 0aUbiquitination 0aUPS 0aCancer 0aDegradation1 aWang, Zhiwei1 aWei, Wenyi0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Apr., v. 73 p.99-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014400167300001600311520158200327592002801909650001301937650001301950650002701963650002001990650001602010650002402026650002502050650001302075650001902088650001102107650001602118650001802134650002502152653002102177653003102198653002202229653003502251653003102286700001702317700005702334700001302391700001602404700001802420700001502438700001302453700001802466700001802484773011902502856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60605253520221122175632.0190705e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060525352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Pei10aTreatment of rural domestic wastewater using multi-soil-layering systems: Performance evaluation, factorial analysis and numerical modeling  ap. 536-546.  aThe discharge of wastewater in rural areas without effective treatment may result in contamination of surrounding surface water and groundwater resources. This study explored the wastewater treatment performance of multi-soil-layering (MSL) systems through interactive factorial analysis. MSL systems showed good performances under various operating conditions. The COD and BOD5 removal rates in MSL systems could reach 98.53 and 93.66%, respectively. The performances of MSL systems in TP removal stayed at high levels ranged from 97.97 to 100% throughout the experiments. The NH4+ − N removal rates of the well performed MSL systems reached highest levels ranging from 89.96 to 100%. The TN removal rates of aerated MSL systems ranged from 51.11 to 64.44% after 72 days of operation. The independent effects of bottom submersion, microbial amendment and aeration, as well as most interactions were significant. The performance of MSL systems was mainly affected by bottom submersion and aeration as well as their interactions. Aeration was the most positive factor for the removal of organic matter, TP and NH4+ − N. However, oxygenated environment was unfavorable for NO3− − N removal. In the submerged area with limited oxygen, the microbial transformation of NO3− − N still occurred. A stepwise-cluster inference model was developed for tackling the multivariate nonlinear relationships in contaminant removal processes. The results can help obtain a better understanding of the complicated processes among contaminant removal in MSL systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aammonium 3achemical oxygen demand 3afactor analysis 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3arural areas 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 0aRural wastewater 0aMulti-soil-layering system 0aOperating factors 0aInteractive factorial analysis 0aStepwise-cluster inference1 aHuang, Guohe1 aAn, Chunjiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7350-23651 aShen, Ju1 aZhang, Peng1 aChen, Xiujuan1 aShen, Jian1 aYao, Yao1 aZheng, Rubing1 aSun, Chaoxing0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 644 p.536-546dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013300167300001600300500001500316520057100331592002800902650001400930650004400944650002500988650001501013650001601028650001201044650001501056650002201071650002601093653001101119700001901130700002101149700002101170700002201191773011801213856008101331852000901412655001201421IND60596554620221117223543.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059655462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2387-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakovleva, M.P.10aSynthesis of Optically Active Macrolides From L-Menthone Derivatives and Hydrazides of Adipic and 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic Acids  ap. 496-498.  a2019-12-06  aEfficient syntheses of two potentially useful optically active macroheterocycles with esters and dihydrazides of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic and adipic acids starting from available natural L-menthol and passing through intermediate 8-hydroxy-2,6R-dimethyloctan-3-one were developed.

Sponges are important components of deep-sea ecosystems and can be particularly sensitive to elevated suspended sediment concentrations. In this study, we exposed the deep-sea New Zealand sponge Ecionemia novaezealandiae (Dendy, 1924) (Demospongiae: Ancorinidae) to a range of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) (32, 78 and 475 mg l⁻¹) and control conditions (no added sediment) continuously for two weeks. Survival was high (97%), with only one death (at the highest SSC). Half of the sponges in the 475 mg l⁻¹ treatment showed partial necrosis by the end of the two-week exposure. Respiration rates of sponges in the sediment addition treatments decreased relative to control sponges by 27, 37 and 60%, respectively, after day 1; and by 7, 17, and 27%, respectively, after 14 days of suspended sediment exposure. At the end of the experiment, sectioning of the sponges revealed sediments deep in the tissue of all specimens, including controls, indicating previous incorporation of sediment occurred in their natural environment. Despite the high survival, the decreased respiration rates and partial necrosis with increasing SSC indicated a decline in sponge condition that could affect this species beyond the disturbance period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDemospongiae 3abenthic organisms 3adeath 3ahumans 3anecrosis 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3aNew Zealand 0aPorifera 0aSeafloor 0aRespiration 0aSedimentation 0aDisturbance1 aCummings, Vonda J.1 aClark, Malcolm R.1 aTracey, Dianne1 aBell, James J.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 541 p.151579-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.1515793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007100170300001600241520146300257592002801720650002101748650002001769650002701789650001701816700002301833700002401856700002401880773012001904856008302024852000902107655001202116IND60614092520221121124218.0181002e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409252DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e31824f179c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallico, Carmine10aScaling Effect of the Hydraulic Conductivity in a Confined Aquifer  ap. 385-391.  aPrevious studies showed that the values of the representative parameters of an aquifer, such as the hydraulic conductivity (k), increase with the scale, that is, with the aquifer volume involved in the measurement. The main cause of this behavior is commonly ascribed to the heterogeneity of the porous media. Heterogeneity influences the scaling behavior differently for laboratory or field measurement, but the scale dependence of hydraulic conductivity is not dependent on the specific measurement method. In the present study, the scaling law of this parameter was determined on a real confined aquifer, using measurements obtained, both in the laboratory (flow cells) and the field (slug tests and aquifer tests). The corresponding data were statistically analyzed. A scaling law was proposed for both the laboratory and field scale, using the data obtained from flow cells, slug tests, and aquifer tests. Afterward, the scaling law was estimated at just the field scale, first using the slug tests and aquifer tests and then using only the aquifer test data.The scale dependence of the storativity was also investigated for all field measurements and then using only the aquifer test data. In conclusion, for both hydraulic conductivity and storativity, the trend to reach an upper bound increasing the scale parameter was investigated in the scale ranges of 67 and 99 m, respectively, examining only the data set relative to aquifer test measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfined aquifer 3adata collection 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aporous media1 aVita, Maria Chiara1 aDe Bartolo, Samuele1 aStraface, Salvatore0 tSoil science.g2012 June, v. 177, no. 6 p.385-391dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e31824f179c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013600182520191600318592002802234650001402262650002102276650001502297650001602312650001802328650002602346650001502372650000902387650001502396650002002411650001802431650001702449650001802466653001002484653001302494653003502507653001802542653003602560653002302596700005902619700002102678700002502699700001902724773010502743856008602848852000902934655001202943IND60738515720221121081958.0211017e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073851572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTangdamrongsub, Natthachet10aOptimizing GRACE/GRACE-FO data and a priori hydrological knowledge for improved global terrestial water storage component estimates  aThe comprehensive information of global terrestrial water storage (TWS) components (soil moisture, groundwater, snow, surface water) is essential for effective assessment of water resource availability, climate variation, and disaster mitigation measures. Observational data provided by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions offer global TWS variation (ΔTWS) in terms of an integrated water column. However, GRACE spatial resolution is relatively coarse (i.e., 3°), and the vertically integrated value cannot be separated into ΔTWS components directly. This study demonstrates the feasibility to estimate ΔTWS components at any desired spatial-vertical resolution by effectively maintaining the native resolution of the employed hydrological knowledge. It utilizes a least-squares with constraints (LSC) approach to rigorously incorporate GRACE and GRACE-FO data and a priori hydrological knowledge, with the aim to improve global ΔTWS components’ accuracy and spatial resolution. The 3°×3° GRACE mascon derived ΔTWS data is disaggregated into the 0.5°×0.5° anomalous soil moisture storage (ΔSMS), groundwater storage (ΔGWS), snow water equivalent (ΔSWE), and surface water storage (ΔSWS) based on the covariance information obtained from the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) and the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) models. Evaluation with different ground measurements and satellite products between 2002 and 2019 exhibits significantly improved accuracy in all individual ΔTWS components. This improvement is of particular note in ΔGWS and ΔSWS, where the LSC approach increases the globally averaged correlation values by approximately 0.13 and 0.05, respectively. Reliable prior knowledge leads to a more accurate ΔTWS component estimate, and the use of ensemble-mean knowledge yields the best result.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3aclimatic factors 3acovariance 3agroundwater 3aleast squares 3aobservational studies 3asatellites 3asnow 3asoil water 3asurface storage 3asurface water 3awater budget 3awater storage 0aGRACE 0aGRACE-FO 0aLeast-squares with constraints 0aTWS component 0aA priori hydrological knowledge 0aSpatial resolution1 aHwang, Cheinway1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3322-353X1 aBorak, Jordan S.1 aPrabnakorn, Saowanit1 aHan, Jiancheng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 July, v. 598 p.126463-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245014900172300001600321520160700337592002801944650002301972650002501995650002502020650002002045650002002065650001302085650002002098650001702118650002202135650000902157650002002166650001502186650001302201650002102214650001502235650001702250650004102267650001902308650001202327650002002339650001002359650001102369650002102380650002502401650001302426653000902439653002502448653002502473653002402498653002102522700002202543773009102565856009002656852000902746655001202755IND60609810320221122001450.0200509e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060981032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Anamika10aMonitoring the stress resistance of Pennisetum purpureum in Pb (II) contaminated soil bioaugmented with Enterobacter cloacae as defence strategy  ap. 495-502.  aLead (Pb) is reported to have negative effects on the biogeochemical behaviour of the plant growth. In recent years, the significance of rhizoremediation of heavy metals has been of great focus aiding in the development rates of plants under stressed conditions. The present study evaluated the physio-biochemical response of Pennisetum purpureum to different concentrations of Pb (II) viz., 0, 50, 100 and 150 mg kg⁻¹ in the form of lead (II) nitrate. The pre-characterized PGPR strain, Enterobacter cloacae - KU598849 was used to augment the plants. After Pb exposure for 45 d, parameters such as plant growth, lead accumulation, H₂O₂ content, MDA content, protein, proline content and antioxidant enzymatic activities were quantified. Results illustrated that increasing Pb concentration reduced the early growth, metal accumulation, protein content and affected physio-biochemical changes by causing oxidative damage in plants. Upon augmentation of the bacterial inoculum, the plants significantly resisted the toxic effects of Pb. Increased Pb bioaccumulation pattern was recorded in roots than shoots, were highest uptake was found to be 72 mg kg⁻¹ dry weight when exposed to 150 mg kg⁻¹ Pb concentration. Lead supplementation increased the activities of malonylaldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) in P. purpureum. Bacterial bioaugmentation resulted in the reduction of the oxidative stress aided with reduced antioxidant enzyme activities indicating the minimization of the damages under stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abioaccumulation 3abioaugmentation 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apolluted soils 3aproline 3aprotein content 3aroots 3ashoots 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 0aLead 0aPennisetum purpureum 0aEnterobacter cloacae 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aOxidative damage1 aOsborne, Jabez W.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 210 p.495-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245008500204300001800289506007600307520079200383592002801175506003701203650002301240650001201263650001201275650001501287650002001302650001501322650002201337650001901359650001601378773013901394856007901533852000901612655001201621IND60114888120221207140721.0141124e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488812DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0723972doi7 aPMC39276992pmcid7 a244770372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorobey, John10aPhysical activity in infancy: developmental aspects, measurement, and importance  ap. 729S-733S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRelative to work on nutrient intake and growth in infancy and toddlerhood, research on physical activity (PA) from birth to age 24 mo is limited. In this review, the developmental course of PA in infancy and toddlerhood is described, and the issues that surround its measurement are addressed. Of the variety of techniques that allow for gauging PA in infancy and toddlerhood, caregiver questionnaires, direct observations, and motion sensors have been used most frequently. Although each method has shown utility, the limitations of each are also acknowledged. In addition, the relation of early PA to nutrition and overweight in infants is considered. Despite the challenges to accurately monitoring early PA, its possible contribution to early excess weight gain should be recognized.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical nutrition 3ainfancy 3ainfants 3amonitoring 3anutrient intake 3aoverweight 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aweight gain0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 99, no. 3 p.729S-733SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0723973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245014600171300002000317520153300337592002801870650002301898650002201921650003001943650002101973650001401994650001202008650001302020650001602033650003702049700001902086700002102105700002202126700002102148700001902169700001902188700002302207700002002230700002302250773014502273856007502418852000902493655001202502IND60781590320221122172533.0220629e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078159032DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta02821b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-González, Nicolás10aUnderstanding the effect of lattice polarisability on the electrochemical properties of lithium tetrahaloaluminates, LiAlX₄ (X = Cl, Br, I)  ap. 13467-13475.  aEstablishing links between the structure and physical properties of solid-state ionic conductors contributes not only to a rationale of their fundamental nature, but also provides design principles to accelerate the discovery of new materials. Lithium ion conduction in complex halides is not well-elucidated and so the interplay between lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and electrochemical properties in such halides has been explored in the isostructural family of lithium tetrahaloaluminates LiAlX₄ (X = Cl, Br, I). Using a combination of experimental methods (diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy, pulse-echo speed of sound measurements, Raman spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering) and periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations, we demonstrate that softer lattices (quantified in terms of Debye frequencies or Li-phonon band centres as a function of X) provide lower activation energies for Li⁺ migration. However, the relationship between polarisability and Li⁺ conductivity is not straightforward. In line with expectations emergent from the Meyer–Neldel rule, the activation energy for Li⁺ hopping, Eₐ, and the pre-exponential terms collated as σ₀ in the Arrenhius equation for activated conductivity, correlate. It is also evident that the electrochemical oxidative potential limit correlates with the X⁻ phonon band centre in the Vibrational Density of States (VDOS) and that the Electrochemical stability Window (EW) and optical band gap are interlinked, as expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aequations 3alithium 3aneutrons 3areflectance 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLópez, Martí1 aMinafra, Nicolò1 aBohnenberger, Jan1 aViñes, Francesc1 aRudić, Svemir1 aKrossing, Ingo1 aZeier, Wolfgang G.1 aIllas, Francesc1 aGregory, Duncan H.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 June 28, v. 10, no. 25 p.13467-13475dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta02821b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007600168300001600244500018000260520150400440592002801944650002101972650001201993650001702005650002902022650001602051650003102067650001202098650002002110650001402130650000702144650001202151650001502163650001702178650001902195650002102214650001002235650002002245650002002265650002102285650001302306650001602319650002702335650002102362700002102383700002402404773012002428856008302548852000902631655001202640IND60614092720221121124139.0181002e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409272DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e31825642022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRevell, Ken T.10aInfluence of Poultry Litter Biochar on Soil Properties and Plant Growth  ap. 402-408.  aAffiliations: 1Department of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia. 2Biological Engineering Department, Utah State University, Logan, Utah.  aBiochar created from poultry litter is a way to produce a value-added soil amendment that is lighter and less expensive to transport out of manure nutrient excess areas, but effects on soil properties are unknown. Two studies were conducted with a Sandy loam and a Silt loam. First, lettuce seeds were germinated across biochar incorporation rates from 0% to 100% biochar, and second, a greenhouse trial was conducted in which peppers were grown in soils with up to 5% biochar by weight. Elemental analysis was completed on the biochar, and soils were analyzed for bulk density, water-holding capacity, pH, cation exchange capacity, and extractable nutrients. Biochar increased lettuce germination by almost 50% in the Sandy loam at low rates but became toxic at rates greater than 2.5% in both soils probably due to salt toxicity. Water-holding capacity increased linearly with biochar additions. For example, adding 15% biochar nearly doubled the water-holding capacity of the Sandy loam from 15% to 27%. The biochar had a pH of 9.3, and additions increased the pH of both soils. Total phosphorus (P) in the biochar was 43 g kg, and although almost none of this was water soluble in the pure biochar, the Mehlich 1 P and Olsen P were greatly increased in biochar amended soils. Biochar consistently increased the cation exchange capacity only at high rates. Biochar made from poultry litter showed several benefits as a soil amendment, but application rates would be limited by soil test P and pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3abulk density 3acation exchange capacity 3agermination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alettuce 3anutrient excess 3anutrients 3apH 3apeppers 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apoultry manure 3asandy loam soils 3aseeds 3asilt loam soils 3asoil amendments 3atotal phosphorus 3atoxicity 3avalue added 3awater holding capacity 3awater solubility1 aMaguire, Rory O.1 aAgblevor, Foster A.0 tSoil science.g2012 June, v. 177, no. 6 p.402-408dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e31825642023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245010900211300001400320506007600334520115800410592002801568506003701596650001201633650001401645650001101659650001101670650002001681650001301701650001001714650002301724650001601747650001301763650001401776650001601790653001201806653001401818653002301832653001101855653001301866653002601879700002601905700001701931700002201948700002501970700003001995773009902025856008602124852000902210655001202219IND50070049520221207125549.0190319e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007004952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2013.04.0182doi7 aPMC38195172pmcid7 a245917532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbson, Rachael12aA comparison of the sensory and rheological properties of molecular and particulate forms of xanthan gum  ap. 85-90.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA particulate form of xanthan gum was prepared by extrusion cooking. The temperature dependence of the viscosity of this form shows similarities to starch with an increase in viscosity to a maximum with increasing temperature as a result of the swelling of the particles. The rheology and mixing behaviour with water of the particulate and conventional molecular forms of xanthan were compared with a modified starch. The particulate xanthan products mixed rapidly with water in a similar way to ungelatinised starch, whereas conventional molecular xanthan systems mixed poorly. Using an experienced sensory panel, model tomato products thickened with the three systems were compared at equal shear viscosities. The panel could not discriminate between the tomato flavour of the three products, but found that the xanthan products were perceived as being significantly thicker. These observations were consistent with previous work. Salt perception for both xanthan products was poorer than for the starch thickened systems. A hypothesis to explain why xanthan does not fit into the previously postulated link between mixing and perception is presented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acooking 3aextrusion 3aflavor 3amixing 3amodified starch 3arheology 3asalts 3asensory evaluation 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 0aXanthan 0aExtrusion 0aFlavour perception 0aStarch 0aRheology 0aParticulate structure1 aGaddipati, Sanyasi R.1 aHort, Joanne1 aMitchell, John R.1 aWolf, B.q(Bettina),1 aHill, S.

While it is widely established that pathogen‐mediated selection maintains MHC diversity through balancing selection, the role of mate choice in shaping MHC diversity is debated. Here, we investigate female mating preferences for MHC class II (MHCII) in the bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), a passerine bird with high levels of extra‐pair paternity and extremely duplicated MHCII. We genotyped family samples with mixed brood paternity and categorized their MHCII alleles according to their functional properties in peptide binding. Our results strongly indicate that females select extra‐pair males in a nonrandom, self‐matching manner that provides offspring with an allelic repertoire size closer to the population mean, as compared to offspring sired by the social male. This is consistent with a compatible genes model for extra‐pair mate choice where the optimal allelic diversity is intermediate, not maximal. This golden mean presumably reflects a trade‐off between maximizing pathogen recognition benefits and minimizing autoimmunity costs. Our study exemplifies how mate choice can reduce the population variance in individual MHC diversity and exert strong stabilizing selection on the trait. It also supports the hypothesis that extra‐pair mating is adaptive through altered genetic constitution in offspring.  aPublisher supplied data  a107585/V40cNorwegian Research Council  a146984/432cNorwegian Research Council  a147/98cNansen Endowment  cNatural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway 3aLuscinia svecica 3aadaptive immunity 3aallelic variation 3aautoimmunity 3abirds 3aecology 3afemales 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amales 3amating behavior 3amodels 3apaternity 3apathogens 3apeptides 3aprogeny 3avariance1 aAnmarkrud, Jarl Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7496-44301 aLifjeld, Jan T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9172-99851 aJohnsen, Arild1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4864-62840 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 23 p.5133-5144dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.152733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245012200186520219600308592002802504650001102532650001302543650001402556650001702570650001202587650001402599653002602613653001702639653002502656653002102681653002302702700005802725773010502783856008602888852000902974655001202983IND60738515920221121081938.0211017e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073851592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzemder, A.T.M. Shahidul Huqe10aIntra-pore tortuosity and diverging-converging pore geometry controls on flow enhancement due to liquid boundary slip  aThe liquid boundary slip, in contrast to the conventional no-slip boundary condition, exists due to a less wetting or the non-wetting nature of sediment grains, which can significantly control fluid hydraulics of porous media, specifically which consists of smaller pore-throats, e.g., siltstones and mudstones. Most studies to date presume a no-slip boundary condition and a few who have investigated the aspects of slip-boundary presume a simplified straight tube or a non-tortuous pore shape. Therefore, how the degree of tortuosity and pore-geometry control flow enhancement in porous media remains underexplored. In this computational study, we design a set of diverging-converging staggered tortuous (DCST) pores, which account for a variable amount of intra-pore tortuosity. To compare, a set of capillary pores are designed that can account for tortuosity by taking the form of sinusoidal and helical shapes. Our results quantify how the diverging-converging nature of pore geometry and its intra-pore tortuosity alone have a significant impact on modifying the microscopic flow behavior -accounting of which is a key in upscaling these effects to a macroscopic continuum or the Darcy-scale. We find, DCST pores contribute to an asymptotic flow enhancement behavior in response to boundary slip.In comparison, capillary pores lead to a linearly ‘unlimited’ flow enhancement. This unlimited nature of flow enhancement can lead to differences over several orders in magnitude. We test theoretical models to predict flow enhancement from all pores. We determine constitutive relations that can predict flow enhancement as a function of intra-pore tortuosity and hydraulic shape factor. We examine the physical mechanisms of energy dissipation and find that the microscopic fluid-structure interactions can contribute to significant variation in how intra-pore geometry and boundary slip manifest as the flow enhancement factor relevant to the continuum-scale. We find that the ‘asymptote’ in the flow enhancement factor of DCST pores manifests as a result of an equilibrium between energy dissipation and enhancing flow due to boundary slip, at least in the laminar flow regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ahydrology 3alaminar flow 3aliquids 3asediments 0aIntra-pore tortuosity 0aPermeability 0aLiquid boundary slip 0aFlow enhancement 0aEnergy dissipation1 aSingh, Kuldeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2366-24800 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 July, v. 598 p.126475-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245005500156300001800211520044900229592002800678650002700706650002300733650002300756650001500779650001400794650001300808650000700821650001300828650001700841700001800858700001800876700001800894700001700912773013400929856007401063852000901137655001201146IND60659800220221119084518.0190823e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065980022DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc40465j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoo, Yongho10aOpening and blocking the inner-pores of halloysite  ap. 4519-4521.  aAggregation and dispersion behaviours of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were influenced by pH.

Their main feature is the use of the Cowpea Mosaic Virus hypertranslational “CPMV-HT” expression system, which provides high yields of recombinant protein through extremely high translational efficiency without the need for viral replication. Since their creation, the pEAQ vectors have been used to produce a wide variety of proteins in plants. Viral proteins and Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) have been of particular interest, but other types of proteins including active enzymes have also been expressed. While the pEAQ vectors have mostly been used in a transient expression context, through agroinfiltration of leaves, they have also been shown to be suitable for the production of stably transformed lines of both cell cultures and whole plants. This paper looks back on the genesis of the pEAQ vectors and reviews their use so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCowpea mosaic virus 3aagroinfiltration 3acell culture 3aenzymes 3aleaves 3aplant proteins 3aplasmids 3arecombinant proteins 3aviral proteins 3avirus replication 3avirus-like particles 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aComovirusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Vectorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLipasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTime Factors 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVaccinesxbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aLomonossoff, George P.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2013 Sept., v. 83, no. 1-2 p.51-58dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-013-0036-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010100178300001300279520116600292592002801458650002101486650001101507650002601518650002001544650002201564650001501586650001201601650002101613653001201634653000901646653000901655653000801664653000901672653000801681653000801689653000901697653000801706653000901714653000901723653000701732653000901739653000801748653000901756653000801765653000901773653001901782653002701801653002101828653002101849700002201870700002001892700002401912700006701936700002202003773012802025856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60530289720221119095617.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053028972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamerbeek, Constanza B.10aDiacylglycerol levels modulate the cellular distribution of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  ap. 1-11.  aDiacylglycerol (DAG), a second messenger involved in different cell signaling cascades, activates protein kinase C (PKC) and D (PKD), among other kinases. The present work analyzes the effects resulting from the alteration of DAG levels on neuronal and muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) distribution. We employ CHO-K1/A5 cells, expressing adult muscle-type AChR in a stable manner, and hippocampal neurons, which endogenously express various subtypes of neuronal AChR. CHO-K1/A5 cells treated with dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) for different periods showed augmented AChR cell surface levels at short incubation times (30min–4h) whereas at longer times (18h) the AChR was shifted to intracellular compartments. Similarly, in cultured hippocampal neurons surface AChR levels increased as a result of DOG incubation for 4h. Inhibition of endogenous DAG catabolism produced changes in AChR distribution similar to those induced by DOG treatment. Specific enzyme inhibitors and Western blot assays revealed that DAGs exert their effect on AChR distribution through the modulation of the activity of classical PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC) and PKD activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3acholinergic receptors 3adiacylglycerols 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ametabolism 3aneurons 3aprotein kinase C 0a4α-PMA 0aAChR 0aaPKC 0aBTX 0acPKC 0aCPT 0aDAG 0aDAGK 0aDOG 0aGGOH 0anPKC 0aPC 0aPDBu 0aPKD 0aPVDF 0aROT 0aTTBS 0aDiacylglycerol 0aAcetylcholine receptor 0aProtein kinase C 0aProtein kinase D1 aMateos, Melina V.1 aVallés, Ana S.1 aPediconi, María F.1 aBarrantes, Francisco J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4745-681X1 aBorroni, Virginia0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 May, v. 74 p.1-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007800170300001600248520135900264592002801623650001501651650001201666650001001678650001801688650001501706650001901721650001501740650001901755650000701774650002001781650002301801650001801824700002201842773012001864856008301984852000902067655001202076IND60614092920221121194437.0181002e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409292DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e318256bc0c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, Sabine10aRole of Organic Matter on Boron Adsorption-Desorption Hysteresis of Soils  ap. 417-423.  aIn this study, we evaluated the boron (B) adsorption-desorption reaction of six soils and examined the extent to which organic matter content, as well as incubation time, affected B release. Six soils varying in initial pH, clay content, and organic matter content were selected for the study. Adsorption experiments were carried out to determine B adsorption isotherms using 0.01 M NaCl solutions containing 0 to 100 mg B kg. The soils were equilibrated for 23 h. Boron desorption was investigated after replacing aliquots with B-free 0.01 M NaCl solution three times. Three of the soils were also spiked with 0 to 100 mg B kg and equilibrated for up to 23 months at field capacity water content in a temperature-controlled room at 25°C. At various intervals, sub-samples were extracted with DTPA-sorbitol, boiling water, and 0.1 M NaCl. The B adsorption-desorption behavior of all six soils was found to be nonhysteretic in the short-term experiment, regardless of organic matter content. Apparent hysteresis of B adsorption can result from difficulties in the experimental procedure itself. Some B adsorption hysteresis was found for two soils with all three extractants after long-term equilibrations of 1 to 23 months. Our results do not support the hypothesis that B desorption hysteresis increases in soils with increasing organic matter content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aboiling 3aboron 3aclay fraction 3adesorption 3afield capacity 3ahysteresis 3aorganic matter 3apH 3asodium chloride 3asorption isotherms 3awater content1 aSuarez, Donald L.0 tSoil science.g2012 July, v. 177, no. 7 p.417-423dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e318256bc0c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245012200158506002800280520070100308592002801009506003701037650002201074650001501096650002001111650001801131650001401149650001901163650001801182650001301200650000901213653007201222700002001294700002001314773014301334856008201477852000901559655001201568IND60739035520221215142547.0210202s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073903552DNAL7 a10.30598//ijcr.2021.8-kur2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurnia10aStudy Microstructure of Fe3O4 Modification Using PEG 4000 form Iron Sand at Wari Ino Beach As A Biosensor Application  aResource is Open Access  aFe3O4 encapsulated PEG form iron sand at wari ino beach has been successfully synthesized by co-precipitation method.

Thus, much public attention has been focused on mining issues and the need for monitoring of environmental disturbances in mining areas. An automated method for identifying mining disturbances, and for characterizing recovery of vegetative cover on disturbed areas using multitemporal Landsat imagery is described. The method analyzes normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to identify sample points with multitemporal spectral characteristics (“trajectories”) that indicate the presence of environmental disturbances caused by mining. A typical disturbance template of mining areas is created by analyzing NDVI trajectories of disturbed points and used to describe NDVI multitemporal patterns before, during, and following disturbances. The multitemporal sequences of disturbed sample points are dynamically matched with the typical disturbance template to obtain information including the disturbance year, trajectory type, and the nature of vegetation recovery. The method requires manual analysis of randomly selected sample points from within the study area to calculate several thresholds; once those thresholds are determined, the method's application can be automated. We applied the method to a stack of 26 Landsat images over a 32-year period, 1984 to 2015, for mining areas of Martin County KY and Logan County WV in eastern USA. When compared with the samples determined by direct interpretation, the method identified mining disturbances with 97% accuracy, the disturbance year with 90% accuracy, and disturbance-recovery trajectory type with 90% accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aautomation 3acoal 3aecology 3aenvironmental quality 3ahuman population 3amining 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3aspectral analysis 3avegetation 3aEastern United States 0aAppalachia 0aCoal mining 0aDynamic matching 0aLandsat 0aNDVI 0aVegetation recovery1 aLi, Jing1 aZipper, Carl E.1 aShen, Yingying1 aMiao, Hui1 aDonovan, Patricia F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 644 p.916-927dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015800174300001600332520168000348592002802028650001502056650002102071650002402092650001402116650001502130650001602145650002302161650001602184650001402200650001702214650001402231650001102245650003102256650002002287653002802307653002402335653001602359653001502375653002302390700001602413700001802429700001402447700001502461700001702476773009102493856009002584852000902674655001202683IND60609810820221122001743.0200509e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060981082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yingying10aComparison of organic matter removals in single-component and bi-component systems using enhanced coagulation and magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) adsorption  ap. 672-682.  aNatural organic matter (NOM) in aquatic environments have a significant impact on NOM-organic compound interactions, which could strongly affect the distribution and transformation of organic compounds during water treatment. This study focused on the removals of NOM (humic acid, HA) and synthetic organic matter (ibuprofen, IBP) through enhanced coagulation and magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin adsorption in single and bi-component systems. Two coagulants, traditional aluminum sulfate (AS) and lab-prepared polyaluminum chloride (PACl), were employed. The charge properties, particle size distribution, and fractal dimension (Df) during organic matter removal were studied in both the single and bi-component systems to explore the purification behaviors and mechanistic effects of interactions between coagulants, MIEX, and organic matters. The experimental results indicated that the Al-based coagulants could remove over 80% of HA in both the single and IBP-HA combined systems, while the presence of HA could considerably improve the IBP removal rate. The aggregates formed during single-component coagulation were larger, but weaker and more loosely structured than those formed in the bi-component system under the same coagulation conditions. In the single-component system, the maximum removal efficiencies of IBP and HA by MIEX adsorption were 65% and 72%, respectively, at a resin dosage of 20.0 mL/L and mixing time of 60 min. Under the same conditions, the removals of these components in the bi-component system were improved to 68% and 98%, respectively. The reaction rate between IBP and MIEX resin was found faster than that between HA and MIEX resin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum sulfate 3aaquatic environment 3achlorides 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3afractal dimensions 3ahumic acids 3aibuprofen 3aion exchange 3amagnetism 3amixing 3aparticle size distribution 3awater treatment 0aSingle-component system 0aBi-component system 0aCoagulation 0aMIEX resin 0aSynergistic effect1 aXu, Weiying1 aZhu, Hongjian1 aWei, Dong1 aWang, Ning1 aLi, Mengting0 tChemosphere.g2018 Nov., v. 210 p.672-682dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04409naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010100206300001100307506007600318520248300394592002802877506003702905650001802942650001302960650001402973650001102987650001602998650002203014650002403036650002003060650001603080650001503096651001403111651002903125651001803154651002803172700001803200700002803218700002103246700001803267700001803285700002003303700002603323700001703349700001703366700001503383700002003398700002003418700001903438700002203457700001803479710003703497773015903534856008103693852000903774655001203783IND60574439120221207091417.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057443912DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-017-0526-72doi7 aPMC54502672pmcid7 a285587472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Flo10aWeather and children’s physical activity; how and why do relationships vary between countries?  ap. 74.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Globally most children do not engage in enough physical activity. Day length and weather conditions have been identified as determinants of physical activity, although how they may be overcome as barriers is not clear. We aim to examine if and how relationships between children’s physical activity and weather and day length vary between countries and identify settings in which children were better able to maintain activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced. METHODS: In this repeated measures study, we used data from 23,451 participants in the International Children’s Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Daily accelerometer-measured physical activity (counts per minute; cpm) was matched to local weather conditions and the relationships assessed using multilevel regression models. Multilevel models accounted for clustering of days within occasions within children within study-cities, and allowed us to explore if and how the relationships between weather variables and physical activity differ by setting. RESULTS: Increased precipitation and wind speed were associated with decreased cpm while better visibility and more hours of daylight were associated with increased cpm. Models indicated that increases in these variables resulted in average changes in mean cpm of 7.6/h of day length, −13.2/cm precipitation, 10.3/10 km visibility and −10.3/10kph wind speed (all p < 0.01). Temperature showed a cubic relationship with cpm, although between 0 and 20 degrees C the relationship was broadly linear. Age showed interactions with temperature and precipitation, with the associations larger among younger children. In terms of geographic trends, participants from Northern European countries and Melbourne, Australia were the most active, and also better maintained their activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced compared to those in the US and Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: We found variation in the relationship between weather conditions and physical activity between ICAD studies and settings. Children in Northern Europe and Melbourne, Australia were not only more active on average, but also more active given the weather conditions they experienced. Future work should consider strategies to mitigate the impacts of weather conditions, especially among young children, and interventions involving changes to the physical environment should consider how they will operate in different weather conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaccelerometry 3achildren 3adatabases 3amodels 3aphotoperiod 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awind speed 3aAustralia 3aNorthern European region 3aUnited States 3aWestern European region1 aGoodman, Anna1 avan Sluijs, EstherM.

Orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are critical long-distance pollinators and may be highly susceptible to forest fragmentation given their reliance on forest habitat. Previous studies on the impact of forest fragmentation on euglossines have been geographically limited, have largely ignored β-diversity, and have not compared fragments with continuous forest. To contribute to addressing these gaps, we sampled male euglossine bees in 18 forest fragments (area range: 2.5–33 ha) and at eight locations within a large (3500 ha) continuous forest in the Chocó biodiversity hotspot of Ecuador during the dry season in 2014. We assessed how euglossine abundance, richness, and evenness related to fragment area, isolation, and edge:area ratio. We also compared fragments to continuous forest, in terms of α- and β-diversity. In fragments, a single species (Euglossa tridentata) comprised 78% of captures, and we found no significant effect of fragment area, isolation, or edge on abundance, richness, or evenness among fragments. Forest fragments and continuous forest differed in both community composition and evenness, but not in abundance or species richness. Spatial turnover (β-diversity) showed a non-significant trend toward changing more rapidly in continuous forest relative to fragments. These results underscore the conservation value of continuous forest for orchid bee diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglossa 3abees 3acommunity structure 3adeforestation 3adry season 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland cover 3amales 3apollinators 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3aEcuador1 aWalter, Scott T.1 aKarubian, Jordan1 aGonzález, Nelson,1 aDobbs, Emily K.1 aBrosi, Berry J.0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2017 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.633-643dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-017-0006-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009000210300001600300506007600316520174600392592002802138506003702166650001302203650002802216650002102244650002302265650002802288650001402316650001802330650002402348650001402372650002102386650001302407650002202420650002702442650001402469650002302483700002302506700002502529700002302554700001602577700002102593700003202614700002302646773013702669856007902806852000902885655001202894IND60114888820221207140728.0141124e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488882DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0699972doi7 aPMC39538802pmcid7 a245224452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasarskis, Edward J10aEstimating daily energy expenditure in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ap. 792-803.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience progressive limb weakness, muscle atrophy, and dysphagia, making them vulnerable to insufficient energy intake. Methods to estimate energy requirements have not been devised for this patient group.Objective: The goal was to develop equations to estimate energy requirements of ALS patients.Design: We enrolled 80 ALS participants at varying stages of their illness and studied them every 16 wk over 48 wk. At each time, we determined total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) in the home setting over a 10-d period by using the doubly labeled water method. We then developed statistical models to estimate TDEE by using factors easily obtained during a routine clinical visit.Results: The most practical TDEE models used the Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St Jeor, or Owen equations to estimate resting metabolic rate (RMR) and 6 questions from the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) that relate to physical activity. We developed a Web-based calculator to facilitate its use. In the research setting, measuring body composition with bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy enabled the estimation of RMR with the Rosenbaum equation and the same 6 questions from the ALSFRS-R to estimate TDEE. By using these models, the estimate of TDEE for nutritional maintenance was ±500 kcal/d across the spectrum of ALS progression.Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of physical function and body composition in estimating TDEE. Our predictive equations can serve as a basis for recommending placement of a feeding gastrostomy in ALS patients who fail to meet their energy requirements by oral intake.

Most duplicated genes revert to single copy genes and only a small proportion are retained. However, it remains unclear why some duplicate genes persist in the genome for an extended time. We investigate this question by analysing retained gene duplicates in the fungal genus Epichloë, ascomycete fungi that form close endophytic symbioses with their host grasses. Retained duplicates within this genus have two independent origins, but both long pre‐date the origin and diversification of the genus Epichloë. We find that loss of retained duplicates within the genus is frequent and often associated with speciation. Retained duplicates have faster evolutionary rates (Ka) and show relaxed selection (Ka/Ks) compared to single copy genes. Both features are time‐dependent. Through comparison of conspecific strains, we find greater evolutionary rates in coding regions and sequence divergence in regulatory regions of retained duplicates than single copy genes, with this pattern more pronounced for strains adapted to different grass host species. Consistent with this sequence divergence in regulatory regions, transcriptome analyses show greater expression variation of retained duplicates than single copy genes. This suggest that cis‐regulatory changes make important contributions to the expression patterns of retained duplicates. Coupled with supporting observations from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these data suggest that genetic robustness and regulatory plasticity are common drivers behind the retention of duplicated genes in fungi.  aPublisher supplied data  a14‐MAU‐007cRoyal Society of New Zealand  cTertiary Education Commission via the Bio‐Protection Research Centre0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aconspecificity 3aendophytes 3agrasses 3ahosts 3aplasticity 3atranscriptome 3ayeasts1 aCox, Murray P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1936-02360 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 23 p.5103-5114dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.152753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012400175300001800299520131000317592002801627650002901655650001001684650001701694650001301711650002601724650001401750650003101764650001101795650001201806700002501818700001901843773010701862856004801969852000902017655001202026IND50069722620221118163113.0131017e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006972262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0960-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllé Resa, Carolina P.10aEffect of Natamycin on Physical Properties of Starch Edible Films and Their Effect on Saccharomyces cerevisiae Activity  ap. 3124-3133.  aThe effectiveness of using a tapioca starch-glycerol matrix containing natamycin to control Saccharomyces cerevisiae activity in a model system was studied and the effect of the formulation on physico-chemical properties was also evaluated. The presence of natamycin tended to depress firmness at break and Young modulus and to increase strain at break. Colour was also affected by antimycotic presence. The importance of these changes will be determined by the characteristics of the product to which the antimicrobial film will be applied. The films developed were capable of acting as a hurdle against S. cerevisiae in food systems during storage: they acted as an effective reservoir of the antimycotic which was also available to prevent an external contamination. The films containing 1.85 mg natamycin/dm2 of natamycin developed a fungistatic effect till 72 h of storage, while those with a 3.70-mg natamycin/dm2 concentration developed a fungicidal action allowing the selection of the proper formulation according to the antimicrobial goal pursuit. As natamycin addition affects mechanical properties and colour of the films, it is advisable to use the lower natamycin concentration that allows the attainment of the goal pursued for film application. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acolor 3aedible films 3afirmness 3amechanical properties 3anatamycin 3aphysicochemical properties 3astarch 3atapioca1 aGerschenson, Lía N.1 aJagus, Rosa J.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Nov., v. 6, no. 11 p.3124-3133dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0960-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013600166500001900302520240900321592002802730650001902758650002502777650001302802650001102815650001702826650001402843651001202857653002702869653003302896653003002929653002502959700001502984700003002999700002403029700002803053773010503081856008603186852000903272655001203281IND60738516420221123041822.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073851642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Zuhao10aImpact of sub-core scale heterogeneity on CO2/brine multiphase flow for geological carbon storage in the upper Minnelusa sandstones  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims at understanding effects of sub-core scale petrophysical heterogeneity on CO₂-brine multiphase flow properties during CO₂ injection in samples of the Minnelusa Formation in Wyoming, representing differing lithofacies. Unsteady-state CO₂-brine drainage tests were performed on a core sample from a dune deposit with laminated bedding and poorly sorted grain distribution. To highlight the role of low-porosity and low-permeability bedding layers (LLBL) on CO₂ migration during CO₂ injection, a contrasting coreflooding experiment was conducted on a sample of well-sorted sandstone collected from an interdune deposit. Assisted history matching was used to estimate the corresponding core-scale relative permeability curves, a procedure that reveals heterogeneity-dependent behavior. The simulated brine production from the optimal history matching case suggests that the main variation in multiphase flow properties could be attributed to internal permeability structures, i.e. sub-core scale LLBL, leading, in turn, to capillary pressure heterogeneity. CO₂ sweep efficiency and distribution in heterogeneous Eolian sandstone are hard to estimate based solely on the limited number of coreflooding experiments, due to LLBL properties variability. Consequently, sensitivity analyses for the properties of sub-core scale LLBL on core-scale brine production were conducted using the developed model. Analyses indicate that the residual brine saturation and thickness of LLBL have a more significant effect on bulk brine production, whereas the impact of CO₂ end-point relative permeability of LLBL on bulk brine production is negligible. In addition, comparison results show that ignoring the sub-core scale heterogeneity (e.g. sub-core scale relative permeability) during CO₂ injection can create significant uncertainties in storage and fluid flow displacement in simulated results, due to important flow effects and thereby physically insightful responses. Overall, this study provides us with a deeper understanding of core-scale CO₂-brine multiphase flow properties for CO₂ geological storage in heterogeneous sandstones and gained us insights into CO₂-brine multiphase flow upscaling in heterogeneous geological models. Our approach needs to be incorporated in upscaling procedures to avoid smearing key small-scale features, relevant to multiphase flow behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adrainage 3amodels 3apermeability 3asandstone 3aWyoming 0aCO2 geological storage 0aSub-core scale heterogeneity 0aResidual brine saturation 0aNumerical simulation1 aWang, Heng1 aAlvarado, V.q(Vladimir),1 aFred McLaughlin, J.1 aQuillinan, Scott Austin0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Aug., v. 599 p.126481-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1264813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007800170300001400248520185400262592002802116650001802144650003102162650001702193650001202210650001302222650001802235650002102253650001302274650001702287650002002304650001602324650001902340650001102359650001702370650001502387650001102402650000902413650001202422650003202434650004002466653001502506653002502521653002102546653003502567653004602602653004702648700002502695700002002720700002102740773012902761856008502890852000902975655001202984IND60530290020221119093628.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053029002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherif, Iman O.10aUroprotective effect of oleuropein in a rat model of hemorrhagic cystitis  ap. 12-17.  aHemorrhagic cystitis is one of the devastating complications seen after receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Oleuropein is the most important phenolic compound of olive leaves that mediates most of its beneficial pharmacological properties. Herein, we investigated the possible uroprotective effect of oleuropein against cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in a rat model. For this purpose, we measured bladder nitric oxide, reduced glutathione, catalase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor levels in addition to the bladder gene expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 after induction of hemorrhagic cystitis in the presence or absence of oleuropein. Histopathological examination of bladder tissues was also performed. After cyclophosphamide injection, we demonstrated a significant decrease in bladder reduced glutathione (39%) and catalase (55.4%) levels and a significant increase of nitric oxide (5.6 folds), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (3.3 folds), vascular endothelial growth factor (2 folds) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (8 folds) bladder contents when compared to those in normal control rats. Administration of oleuropein induced a marked elevation in bladder reduced glutathione (37.8%), catalase (100.4%) with a prominent reduction of bladder nitric oxide (40%), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (35.9%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (56.2%) levels along with downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 bladder expression (73.1%) in comparison to cyclophosphamide treated rats levels. Our data demonstrated that oleuropein counteracts the harmful effects of cyclophosphamide on the bladder through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oleuropein exerts a definite uroprotective effect against cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abladder 3acatalase 3acell adhesion 3acyclophosphamide 3acystitis 3adrug therapy 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3aleaves 3anitric oxide 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3arats 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aOleuropein 0aHemorrhagic cystitis 0aCyclophosphamide 0aTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 0aVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 0aIntercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)1 aNakshabandi, Ziad M.1 aMohamed, Mie A.1 aSarhan, Osama M.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 May, v. 74 p.12-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009500168300001600263520054400279592002800823650001500851650001100866650001300877650001200890650001500902650001200917650001300929650001300942650001300955650001300968650001400981650001200995650001301007650002101020650001201041650001901053650001401072653001101086653001001097653004901107653001301156653002901169653003201198653004701230653002401277653001001301653001001311653000901321653003201330653003801362653003801400653002201438700001601460773012001476856008201596852000901678655001201687IND60618949420221119035335.0181030e197211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061894942DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517572042011132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Jack N.10aImproved Isotope Tagging Detection Procedures for Synthetic Fibers Using the LEPD Detector  ap. 681-688.  aA new type of nuclear detector known as a low-energy photon detector (LEPD) has been developed by the nuclear industry which will enable textile firms to optimize the technique of neutron activatior analysis as applied to the tagging of synthetic textile monofilaments with rare earths and other elements.

Herein, we present the first successful preparation of a new family of daisy chain dendrimers, in which the individual [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units serve as the branches of dendrimer skeleton. In particular, the third-generation daisy chain dendrimer with 21 [c2]daisy chain rotaxane moieties was realized, which might be among the most complicated discrete high-order MIMs comprised of multiple [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units. Interestingly, such unique topological arrangements of multiple stimuli-responsive [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes endowed the resultant daisy chain dendrimers controllable and reversible nanoscale dimension modulation through the collective and amplified extension/contraction of each [c2]daisy chain rotaxane branch upon the addition of acetate anions or DMSO molecules as external stimulus. Furthermore, on the basis of such an intriguing size switching feature of daisy chain dendrimers, dynamic composite polymer films were constructed through the incorporation of daisy chain dendrimers into polymer films, which could undergo fast, reversible, and controllable shape transformations when DMSO molecules were employed as stimulus. The successful merging of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes and dendrimers described herein provides not only a brand-new type of high-order mechanically interlocked systems with well-defined topological arrangements of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes, but also a successful and practical approach toward the construction of supramolecular dynamic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanions 3acomposite polymers 3adendrimers 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afilms (materials) 3amoieties 3arotaxanes1 aWang, Wei1 aWang, Xu-Qing1 aLi, Mu1 aKe, Yubin1 aYao, Rui1 aWen, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6136-87711 aYin, Guang-Qiang1 aJiang, Bo1 aLi, Xiaopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9655-95511 aYin, Panchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2902-83761 aYang, Hai-Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-16180 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 142, no. 18 p.8473-8482dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c024753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245009700171300002000268520117200288592002801460650001501488650001101503650001301514650002101527650001901548650001201567650001301579700001601592700001801608700001501626700001801641700001801659773014501677856007501822852000901897655001201906IND60781591120221122144652.0220629e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078159112DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta03389e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Việt Phương,10aBoosted Zn²⁺ storage performance of hydrated vanadium oxide by defect and heterostructure  ap. 13428-13438.  aThe inherent sluggish Zn²⁺ diffusion and poor electronic conductivity limit the ion intercalation/deintercalation process in aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) using an oxide-based cathode. Here, we demonstrated that a heterostructure in the form of defective hydrated vanadium oxide embedded in the porous carbon textile (d-VOH@CT) could tackle these issues. The additional edges created by crystal defects significantly promoted facile Zn-ion adsorption and intercalation. Expanded interlayer spacing and reduced crystalline domain size kinetically facilitated fast Zn-ion diffusion in d-VOH flakes with shortened diffusion paths. Moreover, the heterostructure of d-VOH on the conductive carbon textile triggered rapid charge transfer, leading to high rate capability and structural stability. The ZIBs fabricated using the d-VOH@CT cathode delivered a preferable reversible capacity of 416 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹, an impressive energy density of 293 W h kg⁻¹ and long cycle life. In addition, the d-VOH@CT heterostructure was able to be used as a freestanding cathode for a flexible ZIB with outstanding mechanical robustness and electrochemical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3afabrics 3avanadium1 aPark, Ji Su1 aYuk, Jong Min1 aOh, Minsub1 aKim, Jae-Hyun1 aLee, Seung-Mo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 June 28, v. 10, no. 25 p.13428-13438dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta03389e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003500153245008800188300001600276520125900292592002801551650001901579650002001598650001401618650001201632650002001644650001201664650002301676650001901699650001501718650001801733650001801751650002201769650002101791651000901812653002201821653001801843653003001861653002701891653002601918700002401944700002801968773011901996856008802115852000902203655001202212IND60605254420221120190903.0190705e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060525442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayrol Azril Mohamed Shaffril,12aA systematic review on Asian's farmers' adaptation practices towards climate change  ap. 683-695.  aClimate change in Asia is affecting farmers' daily routines. Much of the focus surrounding climate change has targeted the economic and environmental repercussions on farming. Few systematic reviews have been carried out on the social impacts of climate change among farmers in Asia. The present article set out to analyse the existing literature on Asian farmers' adaptation practices towards the impacts of climate change. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review of the Scopus and Web of Science databases identified 38 related studies. Further review of these articles resulted in six main themes – crop management, irrigation and water management, farm management, financial management, physical infrastructure management and social activities. These six themes further produced a total of 35 sub-themes. Several recommendations are highlighted related to conducting more qualitative studies, to have specific and a standard systematic review method for guide research synthesis in context of climate change adaptation and to practice complimentary searching techniques such as citation tracking, reference searching, snowballing and contacting experts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop management 3adatabases 3aexperts 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3ameta-analysis 3asocial impact 3asystematic review 3awater management 3aAsia 0aSystematic review 0aAsian farmers 0aClimate change adaptation 0aEnvironment management 0aCommunity development1 aKrauss, Steven Eric1 aSamsuddin, Samsul Farid0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 644 p.683-695dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245006300172300001600235500017400251520165200425592002802077650001702105650002502122650002902147650002002176650000902196650001602205650001102221650001702232650002402249650002302273650001202296651001802308700003102326700002302357700002102380700001702401773012002418856008302538852000902621655001202630IND60614093220221122003612.0181002e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409322DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e318254494d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhuri, Sriroop10aEarly C Sequestration Rate Changes for Reclaimed Minesoils  ap. 443-450.  aAffiliations: 1Division of Plant and Soil Sciences, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV. 2Division of Resource Management, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV.  aReclaimed minesoils have well-defined ages (time since reclamation), making them suitable for studying temporal changes in terrestrial carbon sequestration. The objective of this research was to assess the effect of time since reclamation on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and related soil properties such as texture, bulk density, and cation exchange capacity in three West Virginia minesoils along a chronosequence. The minesoils’ surface 750 Mg ha (0–6 cm) was sampled at 1, 4, and 21 years and again at 2, 5, and 22 years postreclamation, giving a total of 6 site-years of information. Average SOC stocks (Mg C ha) were highest in the oldest minesoils. Soil bulk density was highest and unrelated to SOC concentration in the youngest minesoil, reflecting recent compressive reclamation techniques. The cation exchange capacity of older minesoils was influenced more by SOC than by clay, whereas the opposite was observed in younger minesoils. The relationship of SOC stock to time since reclamation was best described by a logarithmic diminishing returns model. Short-term (1 year) SOC sequestration rates (Mg C ha y) were not appropriate to describing the change in SOC sequestration rate occurring along the chronosequence. When taken as the first derivative of the diminishing returns model, long-term SOC sequestration rates were shown to decline precipitously (80%) in the first 5 years after reclamation. The model predicts that the surface 750 Mg ha of minesoil will contain about 13.3 Mg SOC ha at 50 years after reclamation. About 75% of that SOC storage is predicted to be achieved in the first decade after reclamation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon sequestration 3acation exchange capacity 3achronosequences 3aclay 3amined soils 3amodels 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3atemporal variation 3atexture 3aWest Virginia1 aPena-Yewtukhiw, Eugenia M.1 aMcDonald, Louis M.1 aSkousen, Jeffrey1 aSperow, Mark0 tSoil science.g2012 July, v. 177, no. 7 p.443-450dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e318254494d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245019600175300001400371520183500385592002802220650002302248650001002271650001902281650002402300650001402324650002502338650000902363650002102372650000902393650002402402650001602426650002202442650001402464650001602478650003202494650001802526650001802544650002002562650001102582653001102593653001002604653001502614653001402629653002002643700002102663700002802684773010902712856008702821852000902908655001202917IND60556505920221118221453.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055650592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEconomou, Katerina10aStage and cell-specific expression and intracellular localization of the small heat shock protein Hsp27 during oogenesis and spermatogenesis in the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata  ap. 64-72.  aThe cell-specific expression and intracellular distribution of the small heat protein Hsp27 was investigated in the ovaries and testes of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (medfly), under both normal and heat shock conditions. For this study, a gfp-hsp27 strain was used to detect the chimeric protein by confocal microscopy. In unstressed ovaries, the protein was expressed throughout egg development in a stage and cell-specific pattern. In germarium, the protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the somatic cells in both unstressed and heat-shocked ovaries. In the early stages of oogenesis of unstressed ovaries, the protein was mainly located in the perinuclear region of the germ cells and in the cytoplasm of the follicle cells, while in later stages (9–10) it was distributed in the cytoplasm of the germ cells. In late stages (12–14), the protein changed localization pattern and was exclusively associated with the nuclei of the somatic cells. In heat shocked ovaries, the protein was mainly located in the nuclei of the somatic cells throughout egg chamber’s development. In unstressed testes, the chimeric protein was detected in the nuclei of primary spermatocytes and in the filamentous structures of spermatid bundles, called actin cones. Interestingly, after a heat shock, the protein presented the same cell-specific localization pattern as in unstressed testes. Furthermore, the protein was also detected in the nuclei of the epithelial cells of the deferent duct, the accessory glands and the ejaculatory bulb. Our data suggest that medfly Hsp27 may have cell-specific functions, especially in the nucleus. Moreover, the association of this protein to actin cones during spermatid individualization, suggests a possible role of the protein in the formation and stabilization of actin cones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratitis capitata 3aactin 3aanimal ovaries 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytoplasm 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3aepithelial cells 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3ainsect physiology 3aoogenesis 3aplant ovary 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3asomatic cells 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 0aMedfly 0aHsp27 0aExpression 0aOogenesis 0aSpermatogenesis1 aKotsiliti, Elena1 aMintzas, Anastassios C.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2017 Jan., v. 96 p.64-72dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245008700202300001400289500001900303500002000322520085300342592002801195596001501223650002501238650001101263650001301274650001001287700001701297700002401314773012901338856007901467852000901546655001201555IND60682032020221121053219.0200123e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068203202DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.128122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuels, Toby1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9850-123010aCasamino acids slow motility and stimulate surface growth in an extreme oligotroph  ap. 63-69.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental cues that regulate motility are poorly understood, but specific carbon and nitrogen sources, such as casamino acids (CAA), are known to stimulate motility in model organisms. However, natural environments are commonly more nutrient‐limited than laboratory growth media, and the effect of energy‐rich CAA on the motility of oligotrophic microorganisms is unknown. In this study, an extreme oligocarbotroph, Variovorax paradoxus YC1, was isolated from weathered shale rock within a disused mine level in North Yorkshire, UK. The addition of 0.1% CAA to minimal media significantly reduced the motility of YC1 after 72 h and inhibited swimming motility resulting in enhanced surface growth. We propose this response to CAA is a physiological adaptation to oligotrophy, facilitating the colonization of nutrient‐rich environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cICL Boulby 3aVariovorax paradoxus 3acarbon 3anitrogen 3ashale1 aPybus, David1 aCockell, Charles S.0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2020 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.63-69dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.128123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012900168300001600297520141600313592002801729650003201757650002201789650003001811650001901841650001101860650001601871653002201887653002001909653003101929653003001960653002001990700005402010700005202064700006502116773011402181856008502295852000902380655001202389IND60633477320221120150000.0190516e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063347732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shaoqiang10aβ-Cyclodextrin-copper (II) complex as chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis for the enantioseparation of β-blockers  ap. 233-240.  aThe Copper (II) complex of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), β-CDCu2, was prepared and used as a chiral selector for the enantioseparation of 11 β-blockers by capillary electrophoresis. Resolution for 10 pairs of enantiomers was greater than 1.9 and for the four stereoisomers of labetalol (with two chiral centers), the closest two peaks had a resolution of 1.2. The resolution was superior to that obtained by β-CD itself as well as using anionic cyclodextrin, sulfated-β-cyclodextrin (S-β-CD). In order to elucidate the separation mechanism, the conditional binding constants between the enantiomers and the complex chiral selector and the elctrophoretic mobilities of the diastereomeric complexes were calculated by nonlinear regression. It was found that binding difference and mobility difference are two effects that are responsible for enantiomeric separation. When the concentration of selector is low, the differences in binding were dominant in the separation, while at high concentrations, differences in mobility were dominant in the separation. It was possible to achieve changes in migration orders for two of the drugs tested, with the remainder showing robust resolution due to compound effects of mobility and conditional formation constant. The complex chiral selector provides good separation for the enantiomers or stereoisomers of all the drugs tested which cannot be resolved by β-CD itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3acopper 3aenantiomers 0aChiral separation 0aChiral selector 0aCyclodextrin-metal complex 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aMigration order1 aZhang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6845-99641 aLi, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8088-19811 aBreadmore, Michael C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5591-43260 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 July 05, v. 1596 p.233-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245008800168300001600256500001500272520172400287650002402011650000902035650001102044650001202055650002002067650001402087650001702101650001002118653000902128653001502137653001902152653001502171653002102186653001002207700001402217773008202231852000902313856009202322930003302414945001302447946001102460655001202471IND2206138620221120042007.0000801e199912  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220613862DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2494.1999.00188.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUngar, E.D.10aBite horizons and dimensions for cattle grazing herbage to high levels of depletion  ap. 357-364.  a2019-12-04  aA simple model of depletion by a grazing ruminant was tested at high depletion levels and for different sizes of feeding station. The model divides an initially uniform sward profile into grazing horizons, dependent on bite depth, and assumes a constant within-horizon bite area. Two grazing experiments were conducted using cattle. Uniform areas of oats and alfalfa herbage were grazed individually to a high level of depletion (approximately equal to 150 bites m-2). Feeding station areas were 0.16, 0.30 and 0.53 m2. Initial sward heights were 10 and 20 cm in oats and 20 cm in alfalfa. Size of area did not significantly affect the observed number of bites removed per square metre, the mean residual herbage height or mass, or the proportion of each grazing horizon depleted, derived from the frequency distribution of residual heights. The mean residual height for all treatment combinations could be explained by assuming a 'take half' rule for mean bite depth, and allowing for the derived proportion of the area of each grazing horizon depleted. A simple bite placement simulator was used to generate, for a single grazing horizon and for a given maximum potential area of a bite, the expected relationship among mean effective area of a bite, the proportion of the area of the horizon grazed and the number of bites removed per unit area. The simulator mimics a loosely systematic grazing style. The observed bite numbers and the derived proportions of grazing horizon depleted can be reconciled if the within-horizon mean effective bite area is not constant but declines as predicted by the bite placement simulator. The implications for the shape of the gain function within a feeding station are discussed. 3amathematical models 3aarea 3acattle 3agrazing 3aMedicago sativa 3afrequency 3aAvena sativa 3asward 0asize 0adry matter 0acutting height 0asimulation 0afeeding behavior 0abites1 aRavid, N.0 tGrass and forage science.g1999 Dec., v. 54, no. 4 p.357-364x0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2494.1999.00188.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02429naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011000169300001600279520135400295650001301649650001401662653002601676700001701702700001801719700001801737700003201755700001901787700002201806773012501828852000901953856008501962930003302047946001102080655001202091IND4444346520221120042044.0101029e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444434652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10654-010-9484-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBexelius, Christin 10aInteractive Voice Response and web-based questionnaires for population-based infectious disease reporting  ap. 693-702.  aThe authors aimed to evaluate the web and an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone service as vehicles in population-based infectious disease surveillance. Fourteen thousand subjects were randomly selected from the Swedish population register and asked to prospectively report all respiratory tract infections, including Influenza-like Illness (ILI—clinical symptoms indicative of influenza but no laboratory confirmation), immediately as they occurred during a 36-week period starting October 2007. Participants were classified as belonging to the web or IVR group based on their choice of technology for initial registration. In all, 1,297 individuals registered via IVR while 2,044 chose the web. The latter were more often young and well-educated than those registered via IVR. Overall, 52% of the participants reported at least one infection episode. The risk of an infectious disease report was 14% (95% CI: 6, 22%) higher in the web group than in the IVR group. For ILI the excess was 27% (95% CI: 11, 47%). After adjustments for socio-demographic factors, statistically non-significant excesses of 1 and 8% remained, indicating trivial differences potentially attributable to the two reporting techniques. With attention to confounding, it should be possible to combine the web and IVR for simple reporting of infectious disease symptoms. 3aInternet 3ainfluenza 0aSentinel surveillance1 aMerk, Hanna 1 aSandin, Sven 1 aNyrén, Olof 1 aKühlmann-Berenzon, Sharon 1 aLinde, Annika 1 aLitton, Jan-Eric 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2010 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.693-702dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-010-9484-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03511naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245008100188300001800269500002400287500001500311520181400326650001402140650001802154650002002172650001702192650001102209650001502220650001702235650002502252650002302277650001002300650001902310650001602329650001302345650000702358650001902365650001002384650001302394650002102407650004102428650002402469650001402493650005002507650005402557650000902611653001902620700002202639700002202661700002302683700002102706773009402727852000902821856009102830655001202921IND4461496620221120031409.0110817s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446149662DNAL7 a209655292pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Alfredo10a2-Methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine in grape berries and its dependence on genotype  ap. 2190-2198.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a2-Methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) contributes a bell pepper aroma to many grape cultivars and has a reported aroma threshold of 2 ng L−1 in water. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC–MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC–MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L−1 and 2 ng L−1, respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity. MIBP was detected in all berries of Cabernet Sauvignon regardless the graft configuration. The data indicate that MIBP or its precursors originate in the berry and its formation depends upon grape genotype. 3acultivars 3asweet peppers 3adetection limit 3abiosynthesis 3agrapes 3amonitoring 3asmall fruits 3atotal soluble solids 3aheadspace analysis 3avines 3afruit maturity 3agrape juice 3agenotype 3apH 3aVitis vinifera 3aodors 2aCapsicum 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Structure 2aOdorants. 2aPyrazinesxanalysisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aVitisxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aWine 0asoluble solids1 aDoyle, Carolyn L.1 aMatthews, Mark A.1 aWilliams, Larry E.1 aEbeler, Susan E.0 tPhytochemistry.g2010 Dec., v. 71, no. 17-18 p.2190-2198dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.09.0063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01850naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006100171300001400232520093000246650001501176653001001191653001401201653001101215653001301226700002701239773014401266852000901410856008501419930003301504946001101537655001201548IND4448872920221120031604.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444887292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10064-010-0269-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuenkajorn, Kittitep 10aEstimation of cavern configurations from subsidence data  ap. 53-61.  aAn analytical method has been developed to predict the location, depth and size of caverns created at the interface between salt and overlying formations. A governing hyperbolic equation is used in a statistical analysis of the ground survey data to determine the cavern location, maximum subsidence, maximum surface slope and surface curvature under the sub-critical and critical conditions. The regression produces a set of subsidence components and a representative profile of the surface subsidence under sub-critical and critical conditions. Finite difference analyses using FLAC correlate the subsidence components with the cavern size and depth under a variety of overburden strengths and deformation moduli. Empirical equations are proposed which correlate the subsidence components with the cavern configurations and overburden properties, allowing prediction of cavern configurations from the subsidence components. 3asubsidence 0aBrine 0aSalt rock 0aCavern 0aSinkhole1 aArcheeploha, Sarayuth 0 tBulletin of engineering geology and the environment.g2011 Feb., v. 70, no. 1 p.53-61dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-95297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-010-0269-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03458naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001400149245012300163300001600286500002400302500001500326506007600341520102300417506003701440650001701477650002301494650002501517650001601542650001701558650001201575650002501587650001301612650002601625650003601651650002001687650002201707650002701729650002601756650004501782650001701827650002501844650003101869650004401900650001301944650001601957650002701973650004002000653003402040653002502074653002402099653004002123653001702163653003802180653001502218653002602233653004202259653003302301700001602334700001902350700001302369700001502382700003002397773015102427852000902578856005402587930003302641945001302674946001302687655001202700IND2243511120221207131327.0010307e200011  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224351112DNAL7 a110802752pmid7 aPMC591972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuire, C.10aCellular localization of isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes in Marchantia polymorpha.

Using antibodies raised against several isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes, we investigated their intracellular compartmentation by in situ immunolocalization from Marchantia polymorpha. The enzymes examined were deoxy-xylulose phosphate synthase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, monoterpene synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase, phytoene synthase, and phytoene desaturase. Our results show that liverwort oil bodies, which are organelles bound by a single unit membrane, possess isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes similar to those found in plastids and the cytosol. We postulate that oil bodies play a dynamic role in cell metabolism in addition to their role as sites of essential oil accumulation and sequestration. The occurrence of such enzymes in different cellular compartments might be due to multiple targeting of gene products to various organelles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3achemical reactions 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aisoprenoids 3alipid bodies 3acytosol 3abiochemical pathways 3aplastids 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3aphytoene synthase 2aButadienesxmetabolism 2aCell Compartmentation 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aHemiterpenes 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aOils, Volatilexmetabolism 2aOrganellesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPentanes 2aPlant Cells 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxenzymologyxultrastructure. 0afarnesyl diphosphate synthase 0amonoterpene synthase 0acell ultrastructure 0ageranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 0alocalization 0adeoxy-xylulose phosphate synthase 0ametabolism 0aphytoesene desaturase 0ageranylgeranyl disphosphate reductase 0ageranyl diphosphate synthase1 aBouvier, F.1 aBackhaus, R.A.1 aBegu, D.1 aBonneu, M.1 aCamara, B.c(Illustrator)0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Nov., v. 124, no. 3 p.971-987dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02428naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245010400157300001800261520127300279650001301552650002301565650001201588650003301600650001601633650001101649650002301660650002001683650001901703650002301722700001501745700001901760773014201779852000901921856007801930930003302008946001302041655001202054IND4410754820221117163131.0080926e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441075482DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.229802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Min-Jeong10aSilicon-containing azo polymers with paired mesogens and their applications to optical memory media  ap. 6734-6745.  aWe synthesized a novel photoresponsive monomer, silicon-containing azo monomer with paired mesogens in the side chain, by reacting 3-methacryloxypropylmethyldichlorosilane with 2-[2-(4-cyano-azobenzene-4'-oxy)ethylene-oxy]ethyl alcohol, a mesogenic group. Corresponding homopolymer and copolymers with methyl methacrylate were generated via radical polymerization with AIBN as a radical initiator. Investigations of their thermal properties and optical textures confirmed the monomer and the homopolymer have smectic structures. Homo- and copolymer films showed high potential as reversible data recording media via photoinduced alignment of azobenzene groups with irradiation of a linearly or circularly polarized light. Out of all the samples, the copolymer films with high azo dye contents showed the best resolution in the recorded data as well as the fastest response to a pump beam due to large optical birefringence induced in a write-in process. Strong dependence of the stability of the data stored in the films on the glass transition temperature of the polymers was also observed. In addition, high-quality holographic grating patterns were inscribed even on the copolymer film with azo molar content of only 7.0% using a modified two-wave mixing technique. 3aazo dyes 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3aglass transition temperature 3airradiation 3amixing 3aoptical properties 3apolarized light 3apolymerization 3athermal properties1 aJi, Han-Na1 aHan, Yang-Kyoo0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6734-6745dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.229803Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01117naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002800110245010200138300001600240500011400256520022200370650001300592650002100605650001400626650002100640700002100661700001900682773007300701852000900774939003300783946001100816655001200827IND9200354220221117163122.0920124e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920035422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNārāyaṇasvāmi, Pi.10aEffects of inter-varietal crosses and open pollination on fruit set in certain cultivars of mango  ap. 142-144.  aPaper presented at the "Second International Symposium on Mango," Volume I, May 20-24, 1985, Bangalore India.  aBombay Green was found to be best polliniser for South Indian mangoes whereas Pairi was poor polliniser.

Sejnovo amounting to 55,22% and MB-24 with 53,77%; the lowest was recorded for the cv. G-120 amounting to 42,84% and G139 amounting to 42,91%. The cvs. MB-24, Elit, G-139 and Mayette got the best estimation for the colour of the kernel, while the taste of the kernel was the best on the cvs. Elit, Petovio, MB-24, Mayette, G-120, Parisienne and G-139. 3aJuglans 3acultivars 3aYugoslavia0 tActa horticulturae.g1990 Oct., , no. 284 p.167-173x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01913naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009500128300001600223500014500239520096500384650002001349650001201369651001001381653002101391653001901412700001401431700001401445700001401459773007301473852000901546930003301555946001101588655001201599IND9200339020221123041027.0920122e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920033902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJawanda, J.S.10aEffect of indolebutyric acid and shoot portion on the rooting of cuttings in Japanese plum  ap. 189-197.  aPaper presented at the "IUth International Symposium on Plum and Prune Genetics, Breeding and Pomology," July 24-28, 1989, Bordeaux, France.  aInvestigations on the rooting of stem cuttings of Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) cv. Kataru Chak and Lalri were conducted in the fruit Nursery of Khalsa College, Amritsar during 1985-86. Basal and sub-apical stem cuttings were taken from semi-mature previous season's wood and treated with Indolebutyric acid at the concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm. In general, all the IBA treatments promoted the rooting percentage, number of roots per cutting, root length, root weight, number of shoots per cutting, shoot length, shoot thickness, number of leaves per cutting and leaf area. However, in all the above parameters IBA 100 ppm proved to be best treatment. The basal stem cuttings gave more per cent rooting success as compared to sub-apical stem cuttings. The shoot length and thickness, number of shoots per cutting, number of leaves per cutting, number of roots per cutting and root weight was found to be greater in basal stem cuttings. 3aPrunus salicina 3arooting 3aIndia 0arooting capacity 0ashoot cuttings1 aSingh, A.1 aSingh, S.1 aBal, J.S.0 tActa horticulturae.g1990 Dec., , no. 283 p.189-197x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a20051011b20051102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01377naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006000128300001600188500011400204520060800318650002100926650001500947651001000962653001300972773007300985852000901058939003301067946001101100655001201111IND9200354620221123024354.0920124e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920035462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunjate, R.T.10aStandardization of stone grafting for the Konkan region  ap. 164-167.  aPaper presented at the "Second International Symposium on Mango," Volume I, May 20-24, 1985, Bangalore India.  aThe various factors affecting success in stone grafting have been studied and the technique has been standardized for commmercial use. The survival of stone grafts prepared in June and July was the maximum. The rootstocks up to two weeks old could be used for stone grafting. There was no need of prior delofiation of scion shoots. The survival and growth of stone grafts was significantly better when twoo rootstocks were used for a single scion. This technique has revolutionized vegetative propagation of mango in the Konkan region and more than 5 lakhs of stone grafts are being produced every year. 3aMangifera indica 3arootstocks 3aIndia 0agrafting0 tActa horticulturae.g1989 Aug., , no. 231 p.164-167x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01865naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245003100178300001400209500001500223520078400238650002601022650001201048650001501060650001701075650002601092650001801118650001801136650002401154650002001178650002101198650002001219653001701239773007801256852000901334856009201343939003301435946001101468655001201479IND4479468820221123024344.0140411e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447946882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00360.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenkrantz, Wayne S.10aPemphigus: current therapy  ap. 90-98.  a2019-12-05  aPemphigus is an autoimmune skin disease that can present in a variety of forms and can be a challenging disease to manage and treat.

The animals, an 11-year-old, neutered male and two 10-year-old, neutered female short hair European cats, presented with a 2-month history of transparent liquid oozing from the skin of the groin and caudal abdomen. On physical examination the neutered male cat and one of the females were slightly depressed and showed loss of weight. Skin lesions were similar in all cats and characterized by the presence of alopecia and moist dermatitis in the ventral abdomen, groin and inner thigh. The hair at the periphery appeared matted by the fluid. In all three cases, histopathological examination of skin biopsies from the abdomen identified poorly defined neoplasia involving dermis and subcutis, characterized by proliferation of spindle cells aligned along pre-existing collagen bundles. The dissection of collagen bundles gave rise to irregular shaped anastomosing, often blind-ending vascular channels and trabeculae. Vascular spaces were mostly optically empty. These histological features were strongly suggestive of lymphangiosarcoma. Neoplastic cells were positive for the blood vascular marker Von Willebrand factor, and a lymphatic vascular marker LYVE-1 (Lymphatic Vessel Endothelial receptor – 1), demonstrating the mixed vascular origin of the tumour. Ultrastructural findings confirmed the final diagnosis of lymphangiosarcoma. 3aabdomen 3aalopecia 3abiopsy 3ablood 3ablood coagulation factors 3acats 3aclinical examination 3acollagen 3adermatitis 3adermis 3afemales 3ahistopathology 3amales 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3askin lesions 3aveterinary medicine 3aweight loss1 aBarzagli, Fabio1 aVercelli, Antonella1 aMillanta, Francesca1 aPoli, Alessandro1 aJackson, David G.1 aAbramo, Francesca0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2004 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.13-18x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00354.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140415  aNon-US 7aarticle03072naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245012300166300001400289520177100303650001702074650001002091650001702101650001702118650001502135650002002150650001602170650001802186650002302204650001202227650001402239650001202253650001702265650001502282651001802297653001302315700001802328700002502346773008802371852000902459856008902468930003302557945001302590946001102603655001202614IND2201991220221122231150.0991216s1999    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220199122DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.1999.97548232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfun, J.V.K.14aThe effects of weed residue management on pests, pest damage, predators and crop yield in upland rice in Cote d'Ivoire  ap. 47-58.  aThe effects of weed residues on the abundance and activity of generalist arthropod predators and insect pests and on rice yields in upland rice were studied. Weed residues were placed in the experimental plots in three ways: (1) residues left in situ where weeds are uprooted; or (2) placed in small piles throughout the field; or (3) removed from the field but heaped at the edges to be burnt when dry. The study investigated the effects of residue disposal in upland rice under research station conditions designed to simulate conditions in farmers' fields. Spider activity was significantly greater in plots with scattered residues and strips of residue and least in plots from which residues had been removed. Staphylinid beetle activity was significantly greater in plots with a supplementary weed mulch than in other treatments. By contrast, spider density was greater when residue was piled or used as mulch rather than when scattered but the smallest populations occurred in the no-residue plots. Carabid beetles were significantly more abundant in plots with strips or piles of weeds and staphylinid beetles were most abundant in the mulched plots. Ants were not affected by weed residue placement. Among the ten pest groups studied, the abundance of only Chaetocnema sp., was significantly greater in plots with strips and piles than in other treatments, populations of other pests being unaffected by weed residue placement. In 1994, mean percentage of deadhearts (stem-borer damage) was significantly greater in the residue-free plots than in other treatments but in 1995 the differences between treatments were not significant. In both years, grain yield was not affected significantly by weed residue placement but was lowest in the residue-free plots. 3aOryza sativa 3aweeds 3aweed control 3ainsect pests 3acrop yield 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 3aStaphylinidae 3apopulation density 3amulches 3aCarabidae 3aAraneae 3aplant litter 3apopulation 3aCote d'Ivoire 0ainjuries1 aJohnson, D.E.1 aRussell-Smith, Tony.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g1999, v. 17, no. 1 p.47-58x0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.1999.97548233Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01892naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005300125300001400178500014500192520107300337650003901410650001301449650002101462651001901483773007101502852000901573939003301582946001101615655001201626IND9200360420221122220302.0920123e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920036042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrobny, J.10aGenetical improvement of plums in Czechoslovakia  ap. 83-94.  aPaper presented at the "IVth International Symposium on Plum and Prune Genetics, Breeding and Pomology," July 24-28, 1989, Bordeaux, France.  aThe traditional plum assortment grown in Czechoslovakia involved mostly clones of 'Domestic plum'. After the plum pox spreading in the Sixties 'Reine Claude' group was preferred and in the last 10 years also some cultivars tolerant to Plum Pox Virus (PPV), mainly 'Stanley' and 'Cacanska najbolja'. From the cultivars bred here in the past some 5 are still important and they are also recommended as parents for further breeding. In the present breeding programs developed since the Fifties 5 plum rootstocks were bred, the most perspective of them the P. myrobalana clone MY-KL-A and the vegetative plum rootstock S-BUPR-A. All the source material of cultivars and rootstocks is already virus-free. In breeding new cultivars 3 advanced selections were obtained, which are tested in the State Varietal Trials. In the frame of the wide collection investigations 260 cultivars were tested, 8 of them are now recommended for growing and others for further breeding. Now the evaluations are oriented on PPV tolerance and on the resistance to some other diseases and pests. 3aagricultural programs and projects 3abreeding 3aPrunus domestica 3aCzechoslovakia0 tActa horticulturae.g1990 Dec., , no. 283 p.83-94x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01956naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007700129300001400206500014500220500001500365520099400380650002101374650003901395650002301434651001601457653001301473700001301486700001901499773007101518852000901589939003301598946001101631655001201642IND9200360320221122193400.0920123e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920036032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKellerhals, M.10aSelection of plum varieties (Prunus domestica L.) for a breeding program  ap. 75-82.  aPaper presented at the "IVth International Symposium on Plum and Prune Genetics, Breeding and Pomology," July 24-28, 1989, Bordeaux, France.  a2019-12-05  aThe appropriate choice of parental material is essential for a successful breeding program. Beginning in 1984/85 we in Wadenswil used the results of variety testing work to initiate a small breeding program aimed at breeding new early and late maturing European plum varieties for fresh consumption. Preference was given to selfincompatible varieties as female parents. The following varieties were used as parent: Auerbacher, Belle de Paris (Bonne de Bry), Chrudimer, Cacaks Early, Opal, Ortenauer, President, Prune d'Ente, Richards Early Italian, Ruth Gerstetter, Schwabs, Zimmers and FAW 1/41 (Zimmer X Italian Prune). Besides different tree characters the following fruit characters of the donors were observed: harvest time, fruit size (weight), appearance, texture (firmness), juiciness, flavor, freeness of stone, cracking resistance, soluble solids, acidity and anthocyanins in the skin. In an additional survey, the storage potential of a few late maturing varieties was examined. 3aPrunus domestica 3aagricultural programs and projects 3aselection criteria 3aSwitzerland 0abreeding1 aHohn, E.1 aRusterholz, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g1990 Dec., , no. 283 p.75-82x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02358naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245006500160300001800225520138700243650002401630650001801654653002201672700001601694700002001710700001401730700001501744700001701759773011801776852000901894856008501903930003301988946001102021655001202032IND4444057620221122193346.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444405762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9611-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Qiqi 12aA meta-analysis of alcohol intake and risk of bladder cancer  ap. 1843-1850.  aObjective Epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results relating alcohol intake to bladder cancer risk. A meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies was conducted to pool the risk estimates of the association between alcohol intake and bladder cancer. Methods Eligible studies were retrieved via both computer searches and review of references. We analyzed abstracted data with random effects models to obtain the summary risk estimates. Dose-response meta-analysis was performed for studies reporting categorical risk estimates for a series of exposure levels. Results Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis. No association with bladder cancer was observed in either overall alcohol intake group (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.10) or subgroups stratified by sex, study design, geographical region, or smoking status. However, in the analysis by specific beverages, both beer (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.96) and wine (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.00) consumption exhibited a negative dose-response relationship with bladder cancer. Conclusion The overall current literature on alcohol consumption and the risk of bladder cancer suggested no association, while the consumption of beer and wine was associated with reduced risk of bladder cancer. Further efforts should be made to confirm these findings and clarify the underlying biological mechanisms. 3aalcoholic beverages 3ameta-analysis 0aBladder neoplasms1 aLin, Yiwei 1 aZheng, Xiangyi 1 aQin, Jie 1 aYang, Kai 1 aXie, Liping 0 tCancer causes & control.g2010 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.1843-1850dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9611-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02472naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245015700172300001400329500002400343520140600367650001701773650001401790650002401804650001101828650001301839650000901852651001101861700002101872700002201893773012801915852000902043856009402052655001202146IND4461382320221122153500.0110812s1994    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446138232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00976.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMERILÄ, JUHA10aEvolution of morphological differences with moderate genetic correlations among traits as exemplified by two flycatcher species (Ficedula; Muscicapidae)  ap. 19-30.  aIncludes references  aTheoretical work on multivariate evolution predicts that genetic correlations can act to constrain the rate at which new adaptive peaks are reached, but there is very limited empirical information available on this issue so far. To evaluate the importance of genetic correlations for evolutionary change, we studied the morphological differences between two flycatcher species (Ficeduia albicollis and F. hypoleuca) using both univariate and multivariate quantitative genetic models. Comparison of the results obtained using these different models revealed that even relatively low genetic correlations between traits will considerably increase the net selection forces needed for evolutionary changes in morphology. In particular, the divergence in wing and tail length, which are positively genetically correlated, would require a considerable amount of antagonistic selection. Because of the genetic correlations, strong selection will be needed to retain certain traits unchanged while others are changing. Based on these results, we argue that it is unlikely that small morphological differences such as between these two species could have evolved during a short (200 years) time period, i.e. the period of sympatry of these species in Sweden. These findings support the hypothesis that even relatively low genetic correlations may constrain short-term adaptive evolution in natural populations. 3aMuscicapidae 3aevolution 3agenetic correlation 3amodels 3asympatry 3atail 3aSweden1 aBJÖRKLUND, MATS1 aGustafsson, Lars.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1994 May, v. 52, no. 1 p.19-30dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw2226x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00976.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03331naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245007100199300001800270520195400288650001402242650001202256650004402268650003502312650001102347650002902358650003802387650003802425653001702463653002702480653003102507653001702538653002902555653002202584700003002606773012602636852000902762856009202771930003302863946001302896655001202909IND4440858720221122153415.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444085872DNAL7 a205340072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06849.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina-Holgado, Eduardo10aMending the broken brain: neuroimmune interactions in neurogenesis  ap. 1277-1290.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1277-1290. Neuroimmune networks and the brain endocannabinoid system contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis. Cytokines and chemokines are important neuroinflammatory mediators that are involved in the pathological processes resulting from brain trauma, ischemia and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. However, they are also involved in brain repair and recovery. Compelling evidence obtained, in vivo and in vitro, establish a dynamic interplay between the endocannabinoid system, the immune system and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) in order to promote brain self-repair. Cross-talk between inflammatory mediators and NSC might have important consequences for neural development and brain repair. In addition, brain immune cells (microglia) support NSC renewal, migration and lineage specification. The proliferation and differentiation of multipotent NSC must be precisely controlled during the development of the CNS, as well as for adult brain repair. Although signalling through neuroimmune networks has been implicated in many aspects of neural development, how it affects NSC remains unclear. However, recent findings have clearly demonstrated that there is bi-directional cross-talk between NSC, and the neuroimmune network to control the signals involved in self-renewal and differentiation of NSC. Specifically, there is evidence emerging that neuroimmune interactions control the generation of new functional neurones from adult NSC. Here, we review the evidence that neuroimmune networks contribute to neurogenesis, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms that favour the immune system (immune cells and immune molecules) as a novel element in the coordination of the self-renewal, migration and differentiation of NSC in the CNS. In conjunction, these data suggest a novel mode of action for the immune system in neurogenesis that may be of therapeutic interest in the emerging field of brain repair. 3aneuroglia 2aAnimals 2aBrainxcytologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aCell Communicationximmunology 2aHumans 2aNeurogenesisximmunology 2aNeuroimmunomodulationximmunology 2aStem Cellsxcytologyximmunology. 0abrain repair 0aendocannabinoid system 0aneurodegenerative diseases 0aneurogenesis 0aneuroimmune interactions 0aneuroinflammation1 aMolina-Holgado, Francisco0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 114, no. 5 p.1277-1290dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06849.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245006000164300001600224520171900240650001801959650001601977650001401993650002002007650001202027650002102039650001302060650001502073650001202088651001102100653001102111653001802122700001802140773009002158852000902248856008902257930003302346945001302379946001102392655001202403IND2327583820221122112808.0020617s2001    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232758382DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2001.97549172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitter, E.10aPotassium uptake from the subsoil by green manure crops  ap. 127-141.  aThe aim of this experiment was to compare crops commonly used as green manure or forage crops in temperate climatic regions in terms of their total K uptake and the proportion of K taken up from the subsoil. Two techniques were used to determine K uptake from the subsoil: The 'open-ended pot' technique based on a decrease in the K-to-Rb ratio of plants grown in Rb-enriched topsoil compared with plants grown in pots without access to the subsoil, and a technique based on injection of Rb, as tracer for K, at different soil depths. The green manure crops tested were chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), red clover (Trifolium pretense L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), birds-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.). The latter four crops were grown for one season, the others two seasons. In the first year of establishment, all green manure crops, except chicory, took up K from the subsoil and topsoil in much the same proportion as the cash crop barley, with 41-67% of the K taken up originating from the subsoil. K uptake from the subsoil was mainly determined by differences in the crop's total K uptake. Chicory had the highest total uptake amounting to 124 kg ha(-1) in the first year and twice that in the second year. A period of drought in the second year reduced growth of most crops, except chicory and lucerne. This did not result in a higher uptake of Rb injected at 60 and 90 cm relative to uptake at 10 cm, but it is possible that chicory and lucerne took up substantial amounts of K from depths greater than 1 m, not accessible to the other crops. 3agreen manures 3acover crops 3apotassium 3anutrient uptake 3asubsoil 3anutrient content 3arubidium 3asoil depth 3adrought 3aSweden 0agrowth 0arooting depth1 aJohansson, G.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2001, v. 19, no. 2 p.127-141x0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2001.97549173Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245010100167300001600268500001500284520114800299650001601447650001801463650001901481650002201500650002501522650001201547650002401559650002601583650002301609653002201632653002901654700001701683700001901700700001601719773009001735852000901825856008901834930003301923945001301956946001101969655001201980IND2327584320221122112804.0020617s2001    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232758432DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2001.97549202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, H.R.10aSmallholder farmers and organic certification: accessing the EU market from the developing world  ap. 183-199.  a2019-12-04  aOrganic imports into the EU from the developing world are growing rapidly. Certification regulations for the import of organic products are very rigorous and smallholder farmers, in common with all farmers, must comply with a complex array of rules and procedures to access this market. This paper investigates the many challenges faced by smallholder farmers in acquiring certification as well as the benefits to farmers of being able to export certified organic produce. Certification costs are high but, as the paper explains, can be overcome by smallholders forming producer groups, acquiring external funding, selling on contract and, in some countries, being able to utilize national rather than EU certification bodies. The bureaucracy and paperwork of certification are problematic to smallholders, who must also choose the 'right' certifier to ensure acceptance in the market. Another issue for smallholders examined in the paper is the necessity for reliable marketing linkages. Although there are obstacles, there are also benefits from certification and the paper evaluates evidence of benefits both to individuals and communities. 3asmall farms 3acertification 3afood marketing 3acosts and returns 3adeveloping countries 3aimports 3ainternational trade 3acost benefit analysis 3aorganic production 0aeconomic analysis 0aeuropean union countries1 aBrowne, A.W.1 aHarris, P.J.C.1 aCadoret, K.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2001, v. 19, no. 2 p.183-199x0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2001.97549203Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245015000170300001600320520153300336650001501869650002301884650001901907650001101926650002001937650001501957650001001972650001901982650002102001650002302022651001902045653001502064773009002079852000902169856008902178930003302267945001302300946001102313655001202324IND2328686920221122112732.0020827s2001    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232868692DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2001.97549272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacNaeidhe, F.S.10aEffect of application of basic slag and superphosphate on herbage yield and on soil and herbage concentrations of phosphorus in organic grassland  ap. 231-245.  aThe experiment was carried out at an organic farm in 1996 and 1997. The purpose of the experiment was to test the effectiveness of basic slag (7% P) as a P fertilizer on an organic perennial ryegrass/white clover sward. Superphosphate (16% P) was used as a standard comparison. There was no difference between fresh weight or dry matter yields of grass or clover or of total herbage yields in plots treated with different rates of basic slag or superphosphate in the first harvest at the end of July 1996. In the second harvest, recorded at the end of August 1996, increasing rates of P gave increased yields. P source had no effect on herbage fresh weight or dry matter yield. P source and rate of P application had no effect on herbage yield in 1997. The percentage dry matter in herbage was unaffected by P source. Increasing rates of basic slag and superphosphate had no effect on the percentage dry matter in the herbage. There was no difference in the soil P concentrations obtained with basic slag or superphosphate when these were applied at equivalent rates. Increasing rates of P, when applied as basic slag or superphosphate at rates of 7, 14 and 28 kg ha(-1), gave an increase in soil P concentration at 128 days after application. No increase was recorded at 531 days after application. Superphosphate gave the largest initial increase in herbage concentrations of P but was no more effective at raising the soil and herbage concentrations of this element than equivalent rates of basic slag over a two year period. 3agrasslands 3aorganic production 3asuperphosphate 3ayields 3amineral content 3aphosphorus 3aslags 3asoil fertility 3aapplication rate 3abiomass production 3aIrish Republic 0adry matter0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2001, v. 19, no. 3 p.231-245x0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2001.97549273Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02461naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002200183245008200205300001600287500002400303506007600327520105300403506003701456650003101493650004301524650002201567650001101589650001001600650001101610650004601621650001201667650002501679650002201704650002501726650001401751650002401765700001901789700002001808773009601828852000901924856008201933655001202015IND4461695120221207133620.0110908s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446169512DNAL7 a213035122pmid7 aPMC30416932pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-53-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokotovic, Branko10aGenetic diversity of Actinobacillus lignieresii isolates from different hosts  ap. 894-899.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic diversity detected by analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) of 54 Actinobacilus lignieresii isolates from different hosts and geographic localities is described. On the basis of variances in AFLP profiles, the strains were grouped in two major clusters; one comprising strains isolated from horses and infected wounds of humans bitten by horses and another consisting of strains isolated from bovine and ovine hosts. The present data indicate a comparatively higher degree of genetic diversity among strains isolated from equine hosts and confirm the existence of a separate genomospecies for A. lignieresi-like isolates from horses. Among the isolates from bovine and ovine hosts some clonal lines appear to be genetically stable over time and could be detected at very distant geographic localities. Although all ovine strains investigated grouped in a single cluster, the existence of distinct genetic lineages that have evolved specificity for ovine hosts is not obvious and needs to be confirmed in other studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacillus lignieresii 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3ahorses 3ahosts 3ahumans 2aActinobacillusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aHorsesxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aSheepxmicrobiology1 aAngen, Oystein1 aBisgaard, Magne0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2011 Feb., v. 53 p.894-899dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02473naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010400164300001800268520098700286650002201273650001501295650002401310650001501334650002601349650001901375650002201394650001201416650002101428650001101449650001101460650001901471650002101490653001301511653003001524653002501554653000901579700001701588700002701605700002301632700002001655700003001675773013601705852000901841856008501850930003301935946001101968655001201979IND4449167120221122084620.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444916712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3968-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Ian L. 14aThe potential of microelectrode arrays and microelectronics for biomedical research and diagnostics  ap. 2313-2329.  aPlanar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are devices that can be used in biomedical and basic in vitro research to provide extracellular electrophysiological information about biological systems at high spatial and temporal resolution. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) is a technology with which MEAs can be produced on a microscale featuring high spatial resolution and excellent signal-to-noise characteristics. CMOS MEAs are specialized for the analysis of complete electrogenic cellular networks at the cellular or subcellular level in dissociated cultures, organotypic cultures, and acute tissue slices; they can also function as biosensors to detect biochemical events. Models of disease or the response of cellular networks to pharmacological compounds can be studied in vitro, allowing one to investigate pathologies, such as cardiac arrhythmias, memory impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, or vision impairment caused by ganglion cell degeneration in the retina. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aarrhythmia 3abiomedical research 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease models 3aelectrophysiology 3aganglia 3ain vitro studies 3amemory 3aretina 3asemiconductors 3avision disorders 0aBiochips 0aElectroanalytical methods 0aMicroelectrode array 0aCMOS1 aLivi, Paolo 1 aLewandowska, Marta K. 1 aFiscella, Michele 1 aRoscic, Branka 1 aHierlemann, A.q(Andreas)0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 399, no. 7 p.2313-2329dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3968-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20110211b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02746naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245005400153300001800207520122300225650001301448650001301461650001801474650002801492650001201520650004701532650002401579650004001603650003201643650003701675650000901712650002601721650002401747650003101771650003601802650003201838650003401870650000901904650002601913650003301939650003001972650000902002653002402011773014202035852000902177939003302186945000802219946001302227655001202240991612862870742620221122084545.0820928e198206  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820011422DNAL7 a62826562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubin, Emanuel.10aAlcohol and the heart: theoretical considerations  ap. 2460-2464.  aExtract: Consumption of ethyl alcohol, both acute and chronic, exerts deleterious effects on the heart. The presence of alcohol increases membrane fluidity, a condition that leads to an adaptive change in the phospholipid composition of the membranes, with resultant greater rigidity of the membranes. The effects of alcohol on the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, when combined with other nonspecific insults, may lead to a drastic increase in calcium permeability; the resulting calcium influx may cause cell necrosis and initiate irreversible cardiomyopathy. It is likely that changes in membrane fluidity also exert profound effects on enzyme and transport activities of membrane-bound proteins. Alcohol may interact directly with the hygrophobic regions of proteins. Such interactions may play an important role not only in membrane-bound proteins, but also in alcohol-induced changes in contractile proteins of the heart. It is suggested that the effects of alcohol are similar to those of other anesthetic agents, and that the elucidation of the pathogenesis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy may require a deeper understanding of the physical interaction among alcohol, phospholipids, and proteins.

The ancestor of all animals may thus have been much more complex than anticipated. To facilitate and support analysis of genomic and transcriptomic resources in early branching metazoans, we have established a local bio-computational platform, Compagen (http://www.compagen.org). The platform contains searchable databases with selected raw genomic and EST sequence datasets from sponges and cnidarians up to the lower vertebrates. In addition to the public datasets, Compagen also provides processed data like CAP3 assembled ESTs or predicted peptides. Evaluating the efficacy of the platform by screening for genes reported to be essential in controlling stem-cell behavior in higher organisms uncovered ancient origins for some but not all components of the vertebrate stem-cell system.

The metabolites of TBT [dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT)] were also measured in different tissues of the whelks (digestive, reproductive and remaining organs) during the exposure and depuration periods. By the end of the exposure period, all of the female whelks developed imposex after TBT exposure, and both the relative penis size index and the vas deferens sequence index were positively correlated with the tissue burden of TBT. However, biomagnification of TBT did not occur in the whelks. TBT was rapidly accumulated in their digestive and reproductive organs from both routes of exposure, and both elimination and biotransformation of TBT were also rapid. The redistribution of TBT among tissues was obvious during the exposure period but negligible during depuration. MBT was generally the major metabolite in each tissue, indicating a significant metabolism of TBT by the whelks. Accumulation, transformation, as well as elimination, were more significant following dietary exposure than following aqueous exposure. In particular, we observed gender-related differences in the biokinetics of TBT. Rapid biotransformation and elimination of TBT were detected in the male whelks, while the female whelks had higher bioaccumulation but lower elimination of TBT in their reproductive organs. Internal remobilization of TBT from digestive to reproductive organs was also more obvious in the females, indicating that the reproductive organs of females were the main targets of TBT accumulation. 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3acorrelation 3adietary exposure 3aexposure duration 3afemales 3agender differences 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoysters 3apenis 2aAnimals 2aDisorders of Sex Developmentxchemically inducedxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aSnailsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTrialkyltin Compoundsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aFang, Chao1 aHong, Huasheng1 aWang, Wen-Xiong0 tAquatic toxicology.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 99, no. 3 p.413-422dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.06.001 7aarticle01308naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097040001800132100001400150245007700164300001400241520026000255650002100515650001800536650001600554650002300570650002800593650002100621650002100642651001900663653002000682653002700702773007100729852000900800856008500809930003300894945000800927946001100935655001200946991612860680742620221122041546.0920803s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920025002DNAL7 a10.1108/000707092100104812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoppy, J.10aFood for the heart: a health education authority healthy eating campaign  ap. 10-11.  aDescribes the Food for the Heart campaign.

There is extensive karyotypic variation within many of the morphologically defined species, including A. munita (Schrader) which is here reported to have diploid chromosome counts ranging from 6 to more than 100. Each of the three morphologically defined subspecies of A. munita also displays considerable chromosomal variation: A. m. tereticornuta Gullan (2n= 6, 8, 20, 22 or 24), A. m. malleensis Gullan (2n= 6, 20, 22, 24 or 26), and A. m. munita (Schrader) (2n= 54 or >100). Apiomorpha munita appears to occur only on eucalypts of the informal subgenus Symphyomyrtus, with each of the subspecies of A. munita restricted to discrete symphyomyrt sections. Several different karyotypic forms within each subspecies of A. munita appear to be restricted to only one or a few eucalypt species or series. The association between apparent host specificity and chromosomal rearrangements in A. munita suggests that both may be playing an active role in taxon divergence in Apiomorpha. 3aEriococcidae 3achromosomes 3ascale insects 3ahost specificity 0aHemiptera0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2001 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.265-278dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw1007x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2001.tb01316.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02340naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245013200174300001600306500002400322520123000346650001401576650001401590650002701604650001601631650002701647650002501674650001301699651001001712700002001722700002601742773013101768852000901899856009401908655001202002IND4460570420221122005445.0110729s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446057042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2001.tb01315.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTANABE, TSUTOMU10aMorphological difference and reproductive isolation: morphometrics in the millipede Parafontaria tonominea and its allied forms  ap. 249-264.  aIncludes references  aThin-plate spline and other multivariate statistical methods were used to examine the variation in genital morphology and body size in 74 populations of the millipede Parafontaria tonominea and its allied forms in central Japan. Although the study populations included nine sympatric pairs of two reproductively isolated forms, the variations in genital morphology and body size observed were continuous across the study group. Analyses of the sympatric pairs using bootstrapping revealed that the degree of morphological difference between sympatric populations varied considerably from pair to pair. These results demonstrate that the degree of difference in genital morphology and body size may not correspond with the establishment of reproductive isolation. Significant correlation in the pattern of geographic variation was observed for many combinations of morphological components. However, it was not possible to detect a significant correlation between morphology and geographic distance in many of the morphological components studied. This study suggests that the incorporation of genital characters in classification should be done carefully, particularly for animal groups with low vagility, such as millipedes. 3aDiplopoda 3abody size 3ageographical variation 3amorphometry 3areproductive isolation 3astatistical analysis 3asympatry 3aJapan1 aKATAKURA, HARUO1 aMAWATARI, SHUNSUKE F.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2001 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.249-264dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw1007x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2001.tb01315.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01809naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245013900176300001600315500002400331520079700355650001301152650001101165650001201176650002501188650001401213650002401227700002201251773013101273852000901404856009401413655001201507IND4460570120221122005356.0110729s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446057012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2001.tb01312.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGuire, Jimmy A.10aPhylogenetic systematics of Southeast Asian flying lizards (Iguania: Agamidae: Draco) as inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequence data  ap. 203-229.  aIncludes references  aPhylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence data using maximum parsimony, minimum evolution (of log-determinant distances), and maximum-likelihood optimality criteria provided a robust estimate of Draco phylogenetic relationships.

Bats were sampled at 12 localities along a 1200 km latitudinal transect that paralleled the eastern flanks of the Western Ghats. The geographic pattern of variation in external morphology of C. sphinx conforms to the predictions of Bergmann's Rule, as indicated by a steep, monotonic cline of increasing body size from south to north. This study represents one of the first conclusively documented examples of Bergmann's Rule in a tropical mammal and confirms that latitudinal clines in body size are not exclusively restricted to temperate zone homeotherms. Body size was indexed by a multivariate axis derived from principal components analysis of linear measurements that summarize body and wing dimensions. Additionally, length of forearm was used as a univariate index of structural size to examine geographic variation in a more inclusive sample of bats across the latitudinal transect. Multivariate and univariate size metrics were strongly and positively correlated with body mass, and exhibited highly concordant patterns of clinal variation. Stepwise multiple regression on climatological variables revealed that increasing size of male and female C. sphinx was associated with decreasing minimum temperature, increasing relative humidity, and increasing seasonality. Although patterns of geographic size variation were highly concordant between the sexes, C. sphinx also exhibited a latitudinal cline in the magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism. The size differential reversed direction across the latitudinal gradient, as males averaged larger in the north, and females averaged larger in the south. The degree of female-biased size dimorphism across the transect was negatively correlated with body size of both sexes. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that male- and female-biased size dimorphism were based on contrasting sets of external characters.

Firstly, we show by optical sectioning and three-dimensional image reconstruction that the cooriented pairs of centromeres of all seven bivalents lie virtually parallel to each other in the metaphase I spindle, parallel to the long axis of the spindle. Secondly, we likewise show that the four centromeres of the chain quadrivalent are aligned in the metaphase I spindle in, essentially, a two-dimensional array, not in a three-dimensional array, as proposed by some other authors. This two-dimensionality has its basis, we argue, in the principle that poleward directed spindle forces minimise centromere-to-pole distances and therefore align pairs of centromeres connected to opposite poles most axially (vertically) in the spindle. These distances are minimised for the quadrivalent as a whole only when it lies in two dimensions, i.e. in a plane parallel to the spindle axis. 3acentromeres 3aAllium triquetrum 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 0achromosome disposition 0achromosomes 0abivalents1 aRickards, G.K.0 tChromosoma.g1993 Dec., v. 102, no. 10 p.728-733x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF006509003Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02424naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002400170245012900194300001800323500002400341520063100365650002300996650001701019650001701036650001701053650001101070650002801081650001901109650001701128650009001145650003701235650001101272650008201283650001901365650002401384650004501408650003301453650002001486650002401506650006901530651001301599700002101612700001901633700001601652700001301668700001901681773009401700852000901794856009101803655001201894IND4461497220221121224340.0110817s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446149722DNAL7 a210447922pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, M.

Members of this BMC1 family reveal several features typical of the L1 (long interspersed sequence one) family of mammals, except for species specific elements. The number of BMC 1 elements is estimated to be approximately 3500 per haploid genome. Elements containing the full length unit of 5.1 kb are dispersed throughout the genome and their restriction sites are conserved, although most members are preferentially truncated to varying extents at their 5' ends. DNA sequencing indicates that this element contains six tandem repeats of 15 bp CpG-rich sequence in the 5' proximal region. It terminates with a 3' oligo(A) stretch, and is flanked at both ends by a 7-10 bp target sequence duplication. In addition, there is significant evidence for amino acid sequence homology with reverse transcriptase domains of other L1 families, especially F, Doc and Jockey of Drosophila melanogaster. No large open reading frame is present. The BMC1 element is suggested to be dispersed in the genome by a transposition mechanism involving RNA intermediates. 3aretrotransposons 3arestriction mapping 3agenome 3aBombyx mori 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDinucleoside Phosphatesxgenetics 2aGenome 2aGenomic Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0agenbank/d26007 0agenbank/d26005 0agenbank/d26013 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d26011 0along terminal repeat 0achromosome mapping 0agenbank/d26004 0agenbank/d26003 0agenbank/d26009 0agenbank/d26010 0agenbank/d26012 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/d26006 0agenbank/d26014 0agenbank/d26008 0arepetitive sequences1 aOkano, K.1 aTsuchida, K.1 aMiyajima, N.1 aTanaka, H.1 aTakada, N.1 aIzumi, S.1 aTomino, S.1 aMaekawa, H.0 tChromosoma.g1994 Sept., v. 103, no. 5 p.311-323x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0041200500383Available from publisher's Web site  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02088naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245004700124300001600171500014500187520121400332650002001546650001701566650001501583651001001598700001701608700001601625700001901641773007301660852000901733939003301742946001101775655001201786IND9200338920221121164327.0920121e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920033892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBal, J.S.10aStudies on harvesting and handling of plum  ap. 179-188.  aPaper presented at the "IUth International Symposium on Plum and Prune Genetics, Breeding and Pomology," July 24-28, 1989, Bordeaux, France.  aPlum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) is a delicious fruit which ripens during the summer months when other fruits are not available in plenty. Thus, it sells at remumerative price in the market. The fruit reaches ripe stage in 12 weeks after fruit-set. The peak season for plum harvest in North India is second fortnight of May. Plum fruits develop the best dessert quality on the tree. When it is to be consumed locally, it should be allowed to ripen on the trees. When required to be sent to distant markets, the fruits have to be picked a few days in advance of proper maturity. The change of colour for each variety would determine its stage of maturity e.g. dark brown colour in Kala Amritsar and deep purple red in Titron at proper maturity. The yield varies in different varieties, but a grown up tree may yield 30-35 kg fruits. The ripe fruits of 'Kala Amritsar ̀plum could be stored for 4 days in paper-bags at room temperature after treating with 3-6 per cent wax-emulsion. The shelf-life of fruits can be enhanced upto 40 days in cold storage (30-35 degrees F temp. with RH 85-90%) after treating with 3-6 per cent wax-emulsion for 30 sec. and storing in perforated polythene bags of 100 gauge thickness. 3aPrunus salicina 3aharvest date 3ashelf life 3aIndia1 aBindra, A.S.1 aBajwa, G.S.1 aMinhas, P.P.S.0 tActa horticulturae.g1990 Dec., , no. 283 p.179-188x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04953naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245015500160300001800315520400100333650001204334650002704346650001004373650002204383650002304405700001504428773007204443852000904515856008104524939003304605946001304638655001204651IND9304003320221121132231.0930708e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930400332DNAL7 a10.1002/bip.3603212072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisenhaber, F.10aMonte Carlo simulation of the hydration shell of double-helical amylose: a left-handed antiparallel double helix fits best into liquid water structure  ap. 1643-1664.  aThe conformation of double-helical amylose is influenced by its water environment [A. Imberty, H. Chanzy, S. Perez, A. Buleon, and V. Tran (1988) Journal of Molecular Biology, Vol. 201, pp. 365-378; A. Imberty and S. Perez (1988) Biopolymers, Vol. 27, 1205-1221]. For several low-energy conformations of left-handed amylose double helices, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the (N, V, T)-ensemble of configurations of water molecules surrounding a single duplex. The crucial point of this simulation is the use of cylindrical periodical boundary conditions with a relatively small asymmetric unit comprising a limited number of water molecules. The output data consists of local maxima of water density in the space near the macromolecule and information on one- and two-membered water bridges between polar groups of amylose as well as energetic characteristics of the system under study. A left-handed antiparallel-stranded conformation of the amylose double helix (rise and twist per glucose unit are 0.343 nm and -58.1 degrees) corresponds to the global minimum of intraduplex potential energy [W. Schulz and H. Sklenar (1993) Biopolymers, submitted; W. Schulz, H. Sklenar, W. Hinrichs, and W. Saenger (1993) Biopolymers, to be published]. We found that this conformation is favored also by its hydration shell characteristics in comparison to parallel-stranded structures. Three hydration sites per glucose unit in the vicinity of HO6, O6, and O3 could be identified. Regular water bridges forming a network around the duplex were observed. A moderate change of the helical parameters within the family of left-handed antiparallel structures (to a rise and twist per glucose unit of 0.233 nm and -45 degrees) does not have noteworthy consequences for the characteristics of the hydration shell. The location of the hydration sites with respect to the polar groups of amylose and the observed water bridges are in excellent agreement with the hydration geometry of the heavily hydrated antiparallel-stranded left-handed double helix of p-nitrophenyl alpha-maltohexose described in a high-resolution crystal study [W. Hinrichs, G. Buttner, M. Steifar, Ch. Betzel, V. Zabel, B. Pfannemuller, and W. Saenger (1987) Science, Vol. 238, pp. 205-208; W. Hinrichs and W. Saenger (1990) Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 112, pp. 2789-2796]. In the case of parallel-stranded (nonsymmetric or symmetric) double helices, only one hydration site near the (H) O3 group could be identified. No systematic water bridges with sufficient high probability were observed. The sum of the average potential energies of the amylose-water and water-water interactions is not favourable in comparison with the energy for antiparallel-stranded double helices. The water-water interaction is high, i.e., parallel-stranded amylose breaks the structure of liquid water. This effect would explain the insolubility of natural amylose in cold water and support the occurrence of parallel-stranded double helices in crystallites of starch granules and in amylose microcrystals having only low water content [see Imberty et al. (1988) and Imberty and Perez (1988) above]. Symmetric parallel-stranded double helices have very well-exposed polar groups and their conformation should be favored in crystals by the ability to form extensively interduplex hydrogen bonds directly or via single water molecules. Single water molecules incorporated into the crystal would compensate for the shortage of donors of hydrogen bonds on the surface of the symmetric parallel-stranded double helix. Indeed, in accordance with diffraction data [see Imberty and Perez (1988) above; also A. Imberty, H. Chanzy, S. Perez, A. Buleon, V. Tran (1987) Macromolecules, Vol. 20, pp. 2636-2638] a critical amount of water increases the crystallinity of amylose and only symmetric parallel-stranded double helices would fit into a crystallographic unit cell with c = 1.05 nm.

This confirms that pentobarbitone can block stimulated, as well as resting, cortisol secretion. In general, blood glucose concentrations were not increased above 90 mg/100 ml until at least 30 min after the start of transport; however, this increase was also blocked by pentobarbitone administered 30 min into the 2 h journey. Significant increases in respiratory and heart rates occurred within 15 min of the start of transport; pentobarbitone caused an immediate decrease in these parameters. In conclusion, pentobarbitone was shown to reverse many metabolic changes induced by transport. 3agoats 3apentobarbital 3aanimal transport 3aanesthesia 3acortisol 3ablood plasma 3ablood glucose 3aheart rate 0arespiration rate 0astress1 aJones, R.S.1 aDobson, H.0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1991 , v. 47, no. 1 p.42-48x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02755naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100001700218245013300235300001800368506007600386520110600462506003701568650002901605650001101634650002601645650002201671650001701693650002401710650001301734650002601747650002001773650002001793650001401813653003001827653001601857700002901873700002301902773017301925852000902098856008302107930003302190945002502223946001302248655001202261IND4406001620221207134339.0080523e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440600162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08010871052doi7 aPMC24382262pmcid7 a184432842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPuria, Rekha10aNuclear translocation of Gln3 in response to nutrient signals requires Golgi-to-endosome trafficking in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 7194-7199.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has developed specialized mechanisms that enable growth on suboptimal nitrogen sources. Exposure of yeast cells to poor nitrogen sources or treatment with the Tor kinase inhibitor rapamycin elicits activation of Gln3 and transcription of nitrogen catabolite-repressed (NCR) genes whose products function in scavenging and metabolizing nitrogen. Here, we show that mutations in class C and D Vps components, which mediate Golgi-to-endosome vesicle transport, impair nuclear translocation of Gln3, NCR gene activation, and growth in poor nitrogen sources. In nutrient-replete conditions, a significant fraction of Gln3 is peripherally associated with light membranes and partially colocalizes with Vps10-containing foci. These results reveal a role for Golgi-to-endosome vesicular trafficking in TORC1-controlled nuclear translocation of Gln3 and support a model in which Tor-mediated signaling in response to nutrient cues occurs in these compartments. These findings have important implications for nutrient sensing and growth control via mTor pathways in metazoans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3atranscription factors 3aprotein transport 3acell nucleus 3asignal transduction 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3afungal proteins 3aGolgi apparatus 3aendosomes 0aGln3 transcription factor 0aTor protein1 aZurita-Martinez, Sara A.1 aCardenas, Maria E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 May 20, v. 105, no. 20 p.7194-7199dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08010871053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/04  aOther US 7aarticle01860naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245005200159300001300211520096600224650001801190650001801208650001401226651002101240651001901261700001401280700001901294773007001313852000901383856008501392930003301477945001301510946001101523655001201534IND2043149320221121095416.0941109s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204314932DNAL7 a10.1108/000707094100609982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoddy, G.10aOrganic food: a description of the Irish market  ap. 3-10.  aDescribes the current status of the organic food market in Ireland--current trading arrangements of wholesalers, distributors and retailers and the perceptions of organic food at different stages of the marketing chain. There are three certification bodies for organic foods in Ireland. The value of the market is estimated at 1.5 million IR pounds. Fruit and vegetables are the most important organic foods. Other organic foods are available such as flour, grains, breakfast cereals, meat, yogurt and cheese. Organic foods can be purchased in some of the larger supermarkets, in healthfood/wholefood shops, at local markets or at farm gate. Some of the constraints to development of the industry are limited range and supply of products. Premium levels are also a constraint on development as consumers generally perceive organic products to be too expensive.

Animals were inoculated three times subcutaneously in the right supramammary region with heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus antigen (HKS) at 1 month intervals. Prior to immunization and 1 week following each injection, 3 and 6 day cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were made to determine proliferative responses of lymphocytes to HKS and the polyclonal T cell mitogen phytohemagglutin (PHA). Periphal blood lymphocytes responded to significantly to both HKS and PHA in 3 day cultures after the second injection and showed peak responses after the final immunization, suggesting that repeated l ocal injection of S. aureus antigen at the supramammary region, can induce an anamnestic response to the antigen in the peripheral blood of these animals with a concomitant increase in the responsiveness to the polyclonal mitogen, PHA. In contrast, initial antigen challenge induced little, if any, increase in responses to the specific antigen or mitogen when compared to pre-injection states. These data may also suggest that non-reactivity of perpheral blood lymphocytes to the HKS antigen immediately after the primary injection of antigen may be the result of local retention of antigen-reactive cells at the sites of infection. 3ainfection 3agoats 3amammary glands 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacterial antigens 3alymphocytes 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aEpitopesximmunology 2aFemale 2aGoat Diseasesximmunology 2aGoats 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aImmunizationxveterinary 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aLymphocytesximmunology 2aMale 2aMastitisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus aureusximmunology 0aphytohemagglutinins 0asupramammary region 0alocal infections 0alymphocyte recirculation1 aYang, T.J.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g1992 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.41-46x0147-95717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02287naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001500138245012500153300001600278500001500294520115800309650002601467650002001493650001901513650002101532650001901553650002501572650002801597653001101625653001901636653001701655700001601672773006901688852000901757856007801766930003301844945001301877946001101890655001201901IND2036361220221121074730.0931217e199307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203636122DNAL7 a10.1007/BF003570992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, R.J.10aCytological structure of the native polytene salivary gland nucleus of Drosophila melanogaster: a microsurgical analysis  ap. 446-456.  a2019-12-04  aThe polytene salivary gland nucleus of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated and fractionated by microsurgery at physiological pH and ionic strength. This procedure permits observation of native components of the nucleus including polytene chromosomes, nucleoli, micronucleoli and the nuclear envelope. The three dimensional organisation of the chromosomes within the nucleus is seen to vary as a function of time and can be externally controlled. Evidence is adduced for previously unrecorded stage-related changes in the physical state of the polytene chromosomes. The first en face electron micrographs of the isolated D. melanogaster salivary gland nuclear envelope are presented. In addition, direct light microscopic observations are reported of a new sub-nuclear structure (organelle?) consisting of characteristic beaded fibres, some of which interconnect different chromosomal segments, while others connect the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope. These new structures are candidates for the physical basis of the "tracks in the cell nucleus" phenomenon seen indirectly by other approaches or could have some other, as yet undefined, role. 3achromosome morphology 3asalivary glands 3acell nucleolus 3anuclear membrane 3aultrastructure 3apolytene chromosomes 3aDrosophila melanogaster 0anuclei 0amicronucleolus 0acell biology1 aWhytock, S.0 tChromosoma.g1993 July, v. 102, no. 7 p.446-456x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003570993Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02341naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245013600183300001800319500002400337520093800361650000801299650002401307650001101331650002701342650001001369650002101379650001201400650001301412650001301425650001301438650001101451650001101462650001501473650001801488650002301506650004701529650002401576650002201600650001101622700001601633700001701649700002001666773009901686852000901785856005301794655001201847IND4439682420221121050510.0100709e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443968242DNAL7 a206054442pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, I.10aPerformance evaluation of oxygen, air and nitrate for the microaerobic removal of hydrogen sulphide in biogas from sludge digestion  ap. 7724-7730.  aIncludes references  aThe removal performance of hydrogen sulphide in severely polluted biogas produced during the anaerobic digestion of sludge was studied by employing pure oxygen, air and nitrate as oxidant reactives supplied to the biodigester. Research was performed in a 200-L digester with an hydraulic retention time (HRT) of ∼20days under mesophilic conditions. The oxygen supply (0.25Nm³/m³ feed) to the bioreactor successfully reduced the hydrogen sulphide content from 15,811mg/Nm³ to less than 400mg/Nm³. The introduction of air (1.27Nm³/m³ feed) removed more than 99% of the hydrogen sulphide content, with a final concentration of ∼55mg/Nm³. COD removal, VS reduction and methane yield were not affected under microaerobic conditions; however, methane concentration in the biogas decreased when air was employed as a result of nitrogen dilution.

Here we characterized two genetically modified animal models to test separate but related questions about the effects that retromer deficiency has on the brain. First, testing for cognitive defects, we investigated retromer-deficient mice and found that they develop hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic dysfunction, which was associated with elevations in endogenous Aβ peptide. Second, testing for neurodegeneration and amyloid deposits, we investigated retromer-deficient flies expressing human wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and found that they develop neuronal loss and human Aβ aggregates. By recapitulating features of the disease, these animal models suggest that retromer deficiency observed in late-onset Alzheimer's disease can contribute to disease pathogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aDiptera 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acognition 3ahumans 3amemory 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apathogenesis 3atransgenic animals1 aFlores, Ingrid1 aZhang, Hong1 aYu, Rui1 aStaniszewski, Agnieszka1 aPlanel, Emmanuel1 aHerman, Mathieu1 aHo, Lingling1 aKreber, Robert1 aHonig, Lawrence S.1 aGanetzky, Barry1 aDuff, Karen1 aArancio, Ottavio1 aSmall, Scott A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 May 20, v. 105, no. 20 p.7327-7332dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08025451053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02992naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002800156245009800184300001600282500001500298520143900313650001201752650002001764650002101784650002301805650002901828650001201857650002401869650002001893650004101913650001801954650001201972650001201984650004301996650003802039650006202077650003802139653003802177653001402215653002502229700001902254773006902273852000902342856007802351930003302429945001302462946001102475655001202486IND2036405920221121023231.0931221e199306  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203640592DNAL7 a83653502pmid7 a10.1007/BF003604062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollingsworth, R.E. Jr.10aYeast pre-meiotic DNA replication utilizes mitotic origin ARS1 independently of CDC7 function  ap. 415-420.  a2019-12-04  aIn budding yeast, mitotic DNA replication initiates at sequence-specific replication origins, the prototype for which is ARS1. Initiation serves as the primary control point for mitotic DNA replication, and is catalyzed by the Cdc7 protein kinase. In contrast, premeiotic DNA replication apparently does not require Cdc7, and the existence and nature of specific replication origins in the meiotic division cycle have not been previously reported. We have begun to investigate the mechanism of premeiotic DNA synthesis by determining whether or not ARS1 functions as a DNA replication origin in meiosis. We have taken advantage of the fact that transcription through ARS1 disrupts its ability to function as an origin to show that ARS1 is required for premeiotic DNA replication of a plasmid bearing this element. Further, premeiotic replication from ARS1 still occurs in a cdc7 mutant strain held at conditions non-permissive for Cdc7 protein kinase activity. These findings reveal that premeiotic DNA replication can initiate from origins also used in mitosis, and is not regulated by Cdc7. Taken together with previous findings implicating Cdc7 in meiotic DNA recombination and induced mutagenesis, these findings prompt us to postulate that the Cdc7 protein kinase regulates some step common to several DNA metabolic processes such as local disassembly of chromatin or activation of a key component of the DNA metabolic machinery. 3amitosis 3aDNA replication 3astructural genes 3areplication origin 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ameiosis 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Fungalxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMeiosis 2aMitosis 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinases. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 0aautonomously replicating sequence 0acdc7 gene 0anucleotide sequences1 aSclafani, R.A.0 tChromosoma.g1993 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.415-420x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003604063Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01498naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097040001800132100001500150245006400165300001400229520049600243650001600739650002100755650001800776650001900794650001300813650001300826650001700839650001600856653002700872653002000899773007100919852000900990856008500999939003301084945000801117946001101125655001201136991612846460742620221121012412.0910927s1990    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910028942DNAL7 a10.1108/000707090100009612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeeson, R.10aMaintaining food safety: the use of cryogenic refrigeration  ap. 42-46.  aThe reason for the focus of new legislation on temperature control is considered.

Restriction enzymes that cleave C. reinhardtii DNA relatively frequently produce a number of high molecular weight DNA fragments in addition to the bulk of low molecular weight DNA fragments. pTANC 1.5 contains a 1.5 kb Sau3A fragment cloned from one of these large bands. pTANC 1.5 hybridized to at least three large arrays (200 to 700 kb) of tandemly repeated DNA sequences in the cell-wall-deficient strain cw1.5. These arrays are composed of repeat units that are each cleaved once by BamHI into bands of 1.5, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.5 kb in size. The copy numbers of the 1.5, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.5 kb BamHI bands vary between different C. reinhardtii strains. Chlamydomonas smithii and a number of C. reinhardtii strains are deficient in all four BamHI bands. Genetic analysis of wild-type strain 137c, which is deficient in the 2.0 kb BamHI band, indicates that the 1.5, 1.9 and 2.5 kb BamHI bands derive from at least five loci. The 1.5, 1.9 and 2.5 kb repeat units are not extensively interspersed with each other in strain 137c. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of intact C. reinhardtii chromosomes indicates that TANC arrays are present on more than one chromosome. 3aSouthern blotting 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3asatellite DNA 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgenetics 2aDNA Restriction Enzymes 2aDNA, Protozoanxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Satellitexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenome 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 0arepetitive sequences1 aJobling, M.1 aDay, A.0 tChromosoma.g1993 July, v. 102, no. 7 p.500-507x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003571063Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04162naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245011700173300001600290500001500306520213800321650002402459650002402483650002302507650000902530650002402539650001602563650001002579650002502589650002502614650002802639650002102667650001202688650001802700650005602718650004502774650005402819650006702873650001802940650003602958650002002994650002503014650002403039650002703063653001303090653001603103653003403119653001403153653001303167653001403180653001503194653001403209700001503223700001903238700001803257773006903275852000903344856007803353930003303431945001303464946001103477655001203488IND2039130120221121012404.0940428e199311  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203913012DNAL7 a83068272pmid7 a10.1007/BF003523132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorcillo, G.10aHSP90 associates with specific heat shock puffs (hsr-omega) in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila and Chironomus  ap. 648-659.  a2019-12-04  aThe heat shock protein HSP90, which is mainly cytoplasmic, has recently been reported to be present in the nucleus. We have found a specific chromosomal localization of HSP90 in different species of Drosophila and Chironomus using immunocytochemical techniques with different mono- and polyclonal antibodies for this hsp. HSP90 was found associated with heat shock-induced puffs at 93D and 48B in salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei, respectively. The localization of HSP90 to locus 93D occurred rapidly after the onset of heat shock and disappeared during recovery, concomitant with puff regression. The association of HSP90 with the 93D locus was strictly heat shock dependent as shown by the absence of HSP90 in puff 93D induced by either benzamide or colchicine. No specific nuclear staining was observed in unstressed control cells. HSP90 was also found in the temperature-induced telomeric Balbiani ring puffs (T-BRs) in Chironomus thummi and in one heat shock puff at I-1C in Chironomus tentans. Other heat shock puffs also appeared lightly stained with the HSP90 polyclonal antibody in both species of Chironomus. HSP90 was absent from the T-BRs when RNA synthesis was inhibited with Actinomycin D suggesting that the localization of HSP90 is dependent on transcription. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not prevent association of this hsp with the T-BRs, indicating that pre-existing HSP90 can associate with this locus. HSP90 did not associate with any telomeric chromosomal regions of unstressed cells. The present observations suggest that heat shock gene products such as HSP90 may somehow be involved in the regulation at the chromosomal level of other members of the heat shock gene family. Puffs 93D (D. melanogaster) and 48B (D. hydei) are equivalent and correspond to homologous gene loci (hsr omega) that have unusual features that distinguish them from other heat shock puffs. The binding of HSP90 at T-BRs and at puff I-1C in the genus Chironomus is the first demonstration, albeit indirect, of the existence of hsr omega analogous loci in species other than Drosophila. 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aChironomus tentans 3aloci 3aChironomus riparius 3aheat stress 3agenes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3apolytene chromosomes 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDrosophila hydei 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aChironomidaexgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aChromosomesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aGenes, Insect 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription, Genetic 0a93d gene 0achromosomes 0atelomeric balbiana ring puffs 0ai-lc geme 0a48b gene 0a93d locus 0ai-1c locus 0a48b locus1 aDiez, J.L.1 aCarbajal, M.E.1 aTanguay, R.M.0 tChromosoma.g1993 Nov., v. 102, no. 9 p.648-659x0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003523133Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle00918naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245012000134300001600254520007300270651001000343653002300353653008400376700001700460773011400477852000900591939003300600945000800633946001100641655001200652991612844840742620221120231335.0830901e198105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830078342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhotra, S.K.10aRedescription of Raillietina (Raillietina) kordofanensis Meggitt and Subramanian, 1927 with a taxonometric approach  ap. 333-336.  aRaillietina korodofanensis, redescription, teratological aberrations 3aIndia 0aAnomalies, Cestoda 0aRaillietina (Raillietina) kordofanensis (Cestoda)Columba livia domestica (Host)1 aCapoor, V.N.0 tProceedings.

Differences from the earlier version are summarised. The Revised Specification is a considerable improvement in chemical terms and offers increased protection for importers, deemed to be the manufacturers of consignments from the producing countries, and for food processors responsible for making labelling declarations. Unfortunately the maximum degree of safety assurance for consumers, which they are entitled to expect, is stiff not guaranteed. The revised specification remains inadequate to ensure that gum arabic in foodstuffs originates from the specified source, or complies in terms of identity, composition and quality with that of the test article selected for the toxicological evaluations that led to its classification as "ADI not specified" in 1983. The loopholes available to companies which may not be prepared voluntarily to accept the principles of good manufacturing practice are indicated. 3agum arabic 3afood safety 3afood additives 3aguidelines 3atoxicity 3aEuropean Union 3afood industry 3alaws and regulations0 tBritish food journal.g1991, v. 93, no. 1 p.20-24x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707091101429813Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03364naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001600153245007700169300001400246500002400260520199200284650002102276650002802297650000902325650001102334650001302345650001202358650001202370650001102382650002302393650002402416650001102440650002002451650001102471650001602482650001002498650001402508650002002522650001602542650001002558651001402568700001602582700001802598700001602616700001502632700001502647773011902662852000902781856005602790655001202846IND4386961820221120222815.0070118e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438696182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEustace, I.13aAn alternative process for cleaning knives used on meat slaughter floors  ap. 23-27.  aIncludes references  aTraditionally on slaughter floors operator knives are cleaned by rinsing in hand wash water at 20-40 °C followed by brief immersion in baths termed “sterilisers” which contain water no cooler than 82 °C. Under Australian legislation, both domestic and export, it is possible for a meat processing establishment to apply to the Controlling Authority for permission to implement an alternative procedure providing that it is at least the equivalent of that legislated. No firm evidence appears to exist for the 82 °C requirement and the possibility of replacing this element of the knife cleaning procedure with an alternative procedure using 60 °C water and a longer immersion time was investigated at an abattoir slaughtering cattle and sheep. Knives were tested at a range of work stations located along beef and mutton slaughter floors for Aerobic Plate Counts (APCs) and E. coli. For knives used on the beef chain the mean log APC/cm2 was 2.18 by the current knife cleaning process and 1.78 by the alternate procedure (P < 0.001). Using the current system E. coli was isolated from cleaned knives on 20/230 (8.7%) occasions compared with 21/230 (9.1%) occasions using the alternative system. The mean log E. coli of positive knives was 0.43/cm2 and 0.61/cm2 from the current and alternative systems, respectively. On the mutton chain the mean log APC/cm2 was 1.95 using the current knife cleaning process and 1.69 by the alternative procedure (P = 0.014). Using the current system E. coli was isolated from cleaned knives on 24/130 (18.5%) occasions compared with 29/130 (22.3%) occasions using the alternative system. The mean log E. coli of positive knives was 0.90/cm2 and 0.76/cm2 from the current and alternative systems, respectively. It is concluded that using two knives alternatively, rinsing them in hand wash water, then immersing them between uses in 60 °C water provides a microbiological outcome equivalent to rinsing them and momentary dipping in 82 °C water. 3aEscherichia coli 3abacterial contamination 3abeef 3acattle 3acleaning 3adipping 3aexports 3afloors 3afood contamination 3ahot water treatment 3aknives 3ameat processing 3amutton 3aplate count 3asheep 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3asterilizers 3awater 3aAustralia1 aMidgley, J.1 aGiarrusso, C.1 aLaurent, C.1 aJenson, I.1 aSumner, J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2007 Jan. 1, v. 113, no. 1 p.23-27dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.06.034 7aarticle03020naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245013800210300001800348506007600366520165300442506003702095650001302132650001702145650001102162650000902173650001702182650001702199700002202216700002302238700002502261700002502286773017302311852000902484856008302493930003302576946001302609655001202622IND4406218420221207134940.0080530e20080527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440621842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08020361052doi7 aPMC23967112pmcid7 a184959332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenberg, Kenneth J.10aComplementary dimerization of microtubule-associated tau protein: Implications for microtubule bundling and tau-mediated pathogenesis  ap. 7445-7450.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTau is an intrinsically unstructured microtubule (MT)-associated protein capable of binding to and organizing MTs into evenly spaced parallel assemblies known as "MT bundles." How tau achieves MT bundling is enigmatic because each tau molecule possesses only one MT-binding region. To dissect this complex behavior, we have used a surface forces apparatus to measure the interaction forces of the six CNS tau isoforms when bound to mica substrates in vitro. Two types of measurements were performed for each isoform: symmetric configuration experiments measured the interactions between two tau-coated mica surfaces, whereas "asymmetric" experiments examined tau-coated surfaces interacting with a smooth bare mica surface. Depending on the configuration (of which there were 12), the forces were weakly adhesive, strongly adhesive, or purely repulsive. The equilibrium spacing was determined mainly by the length of the tau projection domain, in contrast to the adhesion force/energy, which was determined by the number of repeats in the MT-binding region. Taken together, the data are incompatible with tau acting as a monomer; rather, they indicate that two tau molecules associate in an antiparallel configuration held together by an electrostatic "zipper" of complementary salt bridges composed of the N-terminal and central regions of each tau monomer, with the C-terminal MT-binding regions extending outward from each end of the dimeric backbone. This tau dimer determines the length and strength of the linker holding two MTs together and could be the fundamental structural unit of tau, underlying both its normal and pathological action.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3adimerization 3aenergy 3amica 3amicrotubules 3apathogenesis1 aRoss, Jennifer L.1 aFeinstein, H.

Thirty-one pennate diatom taxa were identified. Taxa consisted of facultative planktonic and periphytic, circumneutral to alkaliphilous or pH-indifferent forms with known adaptations to saline conditions and fluctuations in salinity in NaCl dominated waters. Data were analysed by ordination (MDS and PCA), hierarchical clustering (CLUSTER), permutation-based hypothesis testing (ANOSIM) and comparative tests on similarity matrices (RELATE). Water depth accounted for the majority of variation in the environmental data. REALTE comparisons of environmental and taxa data did not produce a significant correlation value. We propose that the poor concurrence of the datasets was influenced by the wide ecological tolerances of the taxa recorded, some crucial unmeasured environmental variable/s, possible geographical regionalisation and/or unsampled taxa variability owing to the stochastic nature of the wetlands. Broad patterns of distribution were related to hydroperiod and some taxa groups were loosely associated with environmental groups consistent with established ecological tolerances for the taxa. 3aplayas 3alakes 3aBacillariophyta 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3aplankton 3aperiphyton 3apH 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asaline water 3adepth 3aWestern Australia1 aGell, P.1 aEliot, I.1 aKnott, B.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2008, v. 56, no. 2 p.131-143dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT060993Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02375naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245013500170300001400305520123000319650001101549650002201560650001101582650000901593650001601602650002001618650002201638650001801660650002401678650001401702650001101716650001501727650002401742773007801766852000901844856009201853939003301945946001101978655001201989IND4479481320221120221943.0140415e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447948132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00355.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, H.A.10aEleven cases of vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus in Shetland sheepdogs and rough collies: clinical management and prognosis  ap. 37-41.  aA cutaneous ulcerative disease is recognized to affect the adult Shetland sheepdog and rough collie. This has a distinct clinical and histological appearance consistent with a vesicular variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (VCLE). Retrospective information on the clinical outcome and response to therapy was collected from 11 cases of histologically confirmed VCLE. In 8/11 dogs the onset of disease was in the summer; in three dogs recrudescence occurred in subsequent summers. In eight dogs the skin disease was judged to be 75–100% controlled with therapy after a minimum follow-up of 9 months. Successful treatment in seven of these cases comprised immunosuppressive doses of oral glucocorticoids, alone (one dog), in combination with azathioprine (five dogs) and doxycycline (one dog). One case responded to topical fluocinolone. Three dogs were euthanased for reasons directly related to the disease, one prior to initiating any therapy. Vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus in the rough collie and Shetland sheepdog can be a debilitating skin disease which is best managed with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Sun avoidance or the use of sunscreens is an important additional management recommendation. 3aCollie 3aShetland Sheepdog 3aadults 3adogs 3adoxycycline 3aglucocorticoids 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3alupus erythematosus 3aprognosis 3asummer 3asunscreens 3aveterinary medicine0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2004 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.37-41x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00355.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140415  aNon-US 7aarticle02674naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012600175300001600301520133200317650002201649650002601671650002101697650001801718650001801736650001601754650001001770650001401780650002201794650001101816650001301827650001101840650001101851650002001862650002401882700002301906700001801929700002601947700001801973773008001991852000902071856009202080939003302172946001102205655001202216IND4480657620221120212205.0140504e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448065762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00390.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriello, Karen A.10aDevelopment of an in vitro, isolated, infected spore testing model for disinfectant testing of Microsporum canis isolates  ap. 175-180.  aThe isolated infected hair model is a commonly used technique to test the fungicidal efficacy of topical therapies against Microsporum canis. The most commonly used model uses mats of infective hairs, and results from various laboratories have differed. The objectives of this study were to develop a method to produce spores for testing when only mycelial forms were available and to develop a semiquantitative testing method that used only infective spores from hairs, and not pooled hair samples for testing. Ten isolates of M. canis were used in this study. Juvenile guinea pigs were easily infected using mycelial forms of M. canis and large numbers of spores were easily harvested for testing. Eight dilutions of disinfectants were tested. Fungal culture data were evaluated using an endpoint dilution at which there was 100% fungicidal activity, i.e. no growth on the plates. The 10 samples showed identical results. Chlorhexidine and Virkon® S were ineffective even when used at ×4 the manufacturer's recommended dilution. Lime sulphur (1 : 33), enilconazole (20 µL mL−1), and bleach (1 : 10) were consistently effective when used at the recommended dilution. In addition, lime sulphur and enilconazole were 100% fungicidal even when the recommended concentration was diluted 1 : 4 or ×4 as dilute as recommended. 3aMicrosporum canis 3aantifungal properties 3ableaching agents 3achlorhexidine 3adisinfectants 3aguinea pigs 3ahairs 3ajuveniles 3amicrobial culture 3amodels 3amycelium 3aspores 3asulfur 3atopical therapy 3aveterinary medicine1 aDeBoer, Douglas J.1 aVolk, Lynn M.1 aSparkes, A.q(Andrew)1 aRobinson, Ann0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2004 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.175-180x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00390.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140504  aNon-US 7aarticle05412naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001800159245019200177300001600369500001500385520387100400650001904271650000804290650002504298650001804323650002104341650001804362650001604380650001904396650003604415650001904451650002804470650003004498650004104528650003604569650001904605653001904624700002004643700001604663700001604679700001804695773006904713852000904782856008104791939003304872946001304905655001204918IND9304040920221120191329.0930709e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930404092DNAL7 a13916342pmid7 a10.1002/bip.3603207122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoktycz, M.J.10aStudies of DNA dumbbells. I. Melting curves of 17 DNA dumbbells with different duplex stem sequences linked by T4 endloops: evaluation of the nearest-neighbor stacking interactions in DNA  ap. 849-864.  a2019-12-04  aSeventeen DNA dumbbells were constructed that have duplex sequences ranging in length from 14 to 18 base pairs linked on the ends by T4 single-strand loops. Fifteen of the molecules have the core duplexes with the sequences (5')G-T-A-T-C-C-(W-X-Y-Z)-G-G-A-T-A-C(3'), where (W-X-Y-Z) represents a unique combination of A-T, T-A, G-C, and C-G base pairs. The remaining two molecules have the central sequences (W-X-Y-Z) = A-C and A-C-A-C-A-C. These duplex sequences were designed such that the central sequences include different combinations of the 10 possible nearest-neighbor (n-n) stacks in DNA. In this sense the set of molecules is complete and serves as a model system for evaluating sequence-dependent local stability of DNA. Optical melting curves of the samples were collected in 25, 55, 95, and 115 mM [Na+], and showed, regardless of solvent ionic strength, that the transition temperatures of the dumbbells vary by as much as 14 degrees for different molecules of the set. Results of melting experiments analyzed in terms of a n-n sequence-dependent model allowed evaluation of nine independent linear combinations of the n-n stacking interactions in DNA as a function of solvent ionic strength. Although there are in principle 10 possible different n-n interactions in DNA, these 10 are not linearly independent and therefore can not be uniquely determined. For molecules with ends, there are 9 linearly independent combinations, as opposed to circular or semiinfinite repeating copolymers where only 8 linear combinations of the 10 possible n-n interactions are linearly independent. The n-n interactions are presented as combinations of the deviations from average stacking for the 5'-3' base-pair doublets, delta G(i), and reveal several interesting features: (1) Titratable changes in the values of delta G(i) with changing salt environment are observed. In all salts the most stable unique combination is delta G(4) = (delta G(GpC) + delta G(CpG))/2, and the least stable is the GpG/CpC, delta G(2) = delta G(GpG/CpC). (2) The chi squared values of the fits of the evaluated delta G(i)'s to experimental data increased with decreasing [Na+], suggesting that significant interactions beyond nearest neighbors become more pronounced, particularly at 25 mM Na+. (3) In 85 and 115 mM Na+, where the n-n approximation seems to be most valid, the absolute value of delta G(i) for any n-n stack or average of two n-n stacks is not more than approximately 220 cal/mole, indicating that deviations from average stacking due to n-n interactions represent about 15% of the total stability of a base pair. The overall thermodynamic stability of DNA is predominantly determined by the sequence content (%G.C) Even though the contribution of n-n interactions to overall stability are intrinsically small, reliable predictions of DNA transition temperatures de novo from sequence can be significantly compromised by cumulative errors in the delta G(i)'s. (4) Comparisons of our set of n-n linear combinations evaluated in 115 mM Na+ with various published sets evaluated from melting experiments of long restriction fragments, synthetic polymers, and short oligomers, and those obtained from a reanalysis of published melting data of synthetic polymers, are presented. The analysis reveals a major consensus agreement between n-n free energies evaluated from melting data of restriction fragments and long synthetic repeating copolymers. In contrast, only a minor consensus agreement is obtained between our n-n set and these values or those obtained from melting analysis of a combination of short oligomers and long polymers or those theoretically calculated. Results of these comparisons suggest the values of n-n interactions evaluated from DNA melting curves depend on the length of the melted duplex regions of the DNA molecules that comprise the sample set. 3aheat stability 3aDNA 3anucleotide sequences 3amelting point 3aDNA conformation 2aBase Sequence 2aCalorimetry 2aDNAxchemistry 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxchemistry 2aDrug Stability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistry 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThermodynamics 0athermodynamics1 aGoldstein, R.F.1 aPaner, T.M.1 aGallo, F.J.1 aBenight, A.S.0 tBiopolymers.g1992 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.849-864x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bip.3603207123Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02794naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245014900172300001800321500002400339500001500363520128700378650001101665650002301676650001001699650001301709650001901722650002001741650003301761650001501794650000701809650002001816650001101836650001601847650001401863650002101877650002101898650001401919650002301933653001001956700001901966700002301985700002702008700002302035700002702058700002702085773010702112852000902219856004802228655001202276IND4443226920221120181927.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444322692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-010-9319-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZadeh, Shahram Shakiba10aAssessment of growth condition for a candidate probiotic, Shewanella algae, isolated from digestive system of a healthy juvenile Penaeus monodon  ap. 1017-1026.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo conquer disease problem in shrimp industries, probiotic biocontrol is a well-known remedy now. The antagonistic ability of separated isolates from different parts of juvenile P. monodon was screened against shrimp Vibrio pathogens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus. The most antagonistic effect was observed for an isolate that primarily identified as Shewanella algae using conventional method followed by Biolog GN and GP microplates. Since adaptability to the host optimum cultural condition of the target organism is of the great importance, response surface methodology, with central composite design, was applied to assess log cell count response of S. algae in different incubation conditions. Therefore, four independent variables were assumed as: temperature (10-50°C), pH (6-10), NaCl concentration (0-50‰) and time (12-60 h). The coefficients of multiple determinations (R ²) for the responses log cell count of S. algae being 0.827. Temperature was the merely significant independent variable that affected the log cell count of the candidate probiotic. The candidate probiotic was revealed a reasonable growth response in quite wide range of temperature, pH and NaCl concentration in which the maximum levels were in same range of optimum shrimp culture. 3aVibrio 3ashellfish diseases 3ahosts 3aindustry 3ashrimp culture 3aPenaeus monodon 3aresponse surface methodology 3aprobiotics 3apH 3asodium chloride 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3ascreening 3adigestive system 3aShewanella algae 3apathogens 3abiological control 0aAlgae1 aSaad, Che Roos1 aChristianus, Annie1 aKamarudin, Mohd Salleh1 aSijam, Kamaruzaman1 aShamsudin, Mariana Nor1 aNeela, Vasantha Kumari0 tAquaculture international.g2010 Oct., v. 18, no. 6 p.1017-1026dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-010-9319-6 7aarticle03515naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100002200171245014500193300001600338500002400354500001500378520193800393650001602331650001402347650002302361650001702384650001702401650001902418650002102437650002002458650001202478650001702490650002302507650000902530650002102539650002202560650001002582651002302592653002702615653002102642700002402663700002202687773009902709852000902808856007502817930003302892945002502925946001102950655001202961IND4410810720221120165624.0080930s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441081072DNAL7 a10.1071/BT080402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aF600 0aK001 0aB2001 aBaker, Patrick J.14aThe dendrochronology of Callitris intratropica in northern Australia: annual ring structure, chronology development and climate correlations  ap. 311-320.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study we demonstrate the significant dendrochronological potential of Callitris intratropica, a native conifer distributed across much of the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. We developed two rigorously cross-dated chronologies from sites in the Northern Territory, Australia. The first chronology (1965-2004) was developed from plantation C. intratropica of known-age at Howard Springs and was heavily replicated both within and among trees to evaluate the quality of cross-dating for the species. The second chronology (1847-2006) was developed from trees growing naturally near Pine Creek and compared with long-term instrumental climate records to assess the potential for dendroclimatic reconstructions. Both chronologies had mean interseries correlations >0.65, the highest reported for a tropical tree species. The Howard Springs chronology demonstrated that C. intratropica produces anatomically distinct annual growth rings with the consistent ring-width variation within and among trees necessary for rigorous dendrochronological studies. The Pine Creek chronology exhibited statistically significant correlations with rainfall and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI; integrated measures of plant water stress), and to a lesser extent temperature. The strongest correlations between the climate data and tree-ring width indices were for early monsoon rainfall (October-December; Pearson's r = 0.53) and late monsoon PDSI (May; Pearson's r = 0.41). Our study demonstrates the significant potential of high-quality dendrochronological research on mainland Australia in general, and of C. intratropica, specifically, to reconstruct historical variation of the Australian monsoon system. In addition, C. intratropica may be able to provide novel insights into the dynamics of forests in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia and the role of disturbances, such as fire and cyclones, on these ecosystems. 3atree growth 3aCallitris 3aforest plantations 3agrowth rings 3aforest trees 3amonsoon season 3atropical forests 3aair temperature 3adrought 3awater stress 3aseasonal variation 3arain 3aclimatic factors 3adendroclimatology 3awidth 3aNorthern Territory 0aCallitris intratropica 0adendrochronology1 aPalmer, Jonathan G.1 aD'Arrigo, Rosanne0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2008, v. 56, no. 4 p.311-320dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT080403Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01933naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245002300146300001300169500001500182520060200197650002300799650002300822650002000845650000900865650001400874650002500888650001200913650006900925650004400994650003101038650002001069650003201089650002001121650002701141650001501168653003501183653003001218653002301248700001901271700001701290773007801307852000901385930003301394945001301427946001101440655001201451IND2040073120221120165654.0940606e199401  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204007312DNAL7 a80258412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron, E.R.10aTransgenic science  ap. 9-24.  a2019-12-05  aThe ability to manipulate the genome of the whole animal has, for the past 10 years, provided researchers with an alternative route of inquiry into many complex biological processes.

The weight-average molecular weight M(W) of four aggregates tested ranged from 1,700,000 to 5,500,000. The translational diffusion coefficient D(0) of native OA at infinite dilution was estimated as 8.70 X 10(-7) cm2/s, which gave 56.0 angstroms as the diameter of the rigid spherical particle. The intensity autocorrelation function of linear OA polymers was analyzed with the cumulant method to obtain the first cumulant. The dependence of the first cumulant on the scattering vector q at very low polymer concentration was found intermediate between those of a flexible chain and a rigid rod. The translational diffusion coefficient D(tr) [identical with (the first cumulant/q(2)(q approaches the limit of 0)) was in proportion to M(-0.55/W), and the magnitude was in good agreement with a value calculated from the wormlike cylinder model with values of three parameters determined in an earlier study, M(L) = 1600 angstroms, d = 120 angstroms, and Q = 230 angstroms, where M(L), d, and Q are the molecular weight per unit length, diameter, and persistence length, respectively. Based on these results, a new model, to be called as the dimer model was proposed to interpret the formation mechanism of linear OA polymers induced by thermal denaturation. 3aovalbumin 3amolecular conformation 3apolymerization 3athermal degradation 3aheat treatment 3athermal properties 3aoptical properties 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aHot Temperature 2aLight 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aOvalbuminxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Denaturation 2aScattering, Radiation 2aSolutions 2aWater1 aKoike, A.1 aOsaki, K.1 aKoseki, T.1 aDoi, E.0 tBiopolymers.g1993 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.551-559x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bip.3603304053Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03127naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011000157300001600267500001500283520183900298650001302137650003202150650001302182650002302195650001102218650001202229650001602241650001302257650001902270650001502289650002202304650002702326650001502353653003102368653001702399653001302416653001902429700001602448773006902464852000902533856008102542939003302623946001302656655001202669IND9304042220221120165609.0930709e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930404222DNAL7 a10.1002/bip.3603304092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouawad, L.10aDiagonalization in a mixed basis: a method to compute low-frequency normal modes for large macromolecules  ap. 599-611.  a2019-12-04  aLow-frequency collective motions in proteins are generally very important for their biological functions. To study such motions, harmonic dynamics proved most useful since it is a straightforward method; it consists of the diagonalization of the Hessian matrix of the potential energy, yielding the vibrational spectrum and the directions of internal motions. Unfortunately, the diagonalization of this matrix requires a large computer memory, which is a limiting factor when the protein contains several thousand atoms. To circumvent this limitation we have developed three methods that enable us to diagonalize large matrices using much less computer memory than the usual harmonic dynamics. The first method is approximate; it consists of diagonalizing small blocks of the Hessian matrix, followed by the coupling of the low-frequency modes obtained for each block. It yields the low-frequency vibrational spectrum with a maximum error of 20%. The second method consists, after diagonalizing small blocks, of coupling the high- and low-frequency modes using an iterative procedure. It yields the exact low-frequency normal modes, but requires a long computational time with convergence problems. The third method, DIMB (Diagonalization in a Mixed Basis), which has the best performance, consists of coupling the approximate low-frequency modes with the mass-weighted cartesian coordinates, also using an iterative procedure. It reduces significantly the required computer memory and converges rapidly. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by this method are without significant error in the chosen frequency range. Moreover, it is a general method applicable to any problem of diagonalization of a large matrix. We report the application of these methods to a deca-alanine helix, trypsin inhibitor, a neurotoxin, and lysozyme. 3alysozyme 3aprotein secondary structure 3apancreas 3atrypsin inhibitors 3acattle 3aalanine 3aneurotoxins 3apeptides 3abacteriophages 3aalgorithms 3acomputer analysis 3amolecular conformation 3aScorpiones 0amathematics and statistics 0adeca-alanine 0amatrices 0ahessian matrix1 aPerahia, D.0 tBiopolymers.g1993 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.599-611x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bip.3603304093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02527naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001700159245014200176300001600318500001500334520073600349650001301085650003001098650004401128650001401172650002201186650002501208650001601233650001301249650002201262650002201284650002701306650001501333650002401348650001201372650001101384650003601395650002801431650002501459650002401484650003401508650002501542653003101567653002401598653002001622700001501642700001701657700001401674700001701688700001601705773006801721852000901789856008101798939003301879946001301912655001201925IND9304042520221120162401.0930709e199305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930404252DNAL7 a83435792pmid7 a10.1002/bip.3603305122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsposito, G.10aProbing protein structure by solvent perturbation of NMR spectra.

Leaves were sampled from the middle third of the plants at 15-day intervals throughout the biological cycle, and used to determine the concentrations of both of chlorophyll and the main carbohydrates. Carbohydrate contents, in contrast to other parameters, differed between the two species. Highest foliar concentrations of glucose, fructose saccharose and starch appeared in tomato plants treated with the fertilizer containing the lowest exogenous and endogenous N, but in cucumber, maximum levels were recorded in plants treated with the highest amount of N. In tomato, the different treatments led to no highly significant differences in chlorophyll levels (a, b and total), while in cucumber, only chlorophyll a remained unchanged with the different treatments. Changes in concentrations of pigments and carbohydrates provided only an approximate reflection of the nutritional status of the plants. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aCucumis sativus 3agreenhouse production 3anitrogen fertilizers 3achlorophyll 3acarbohydrates 0aplant analysis1 aSanchez, A.1 aLorente, F.A.1 aRio, A. del.1 aRomero, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g1991 May, , no. 287 p.477-483x0567-75727nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010300204300001800307506007600325520116600401506003701567650001701604650002201621650002101643650002901664650001101693650001301704650003701717650001801754650001201772650001301784650001901797650001401816650002001830650003301850650001701883650001301900700002401913700002001937700002101957700001901978700002601997700001902023700002002042700002302062773017302085852000902258856008302267930003302350946001302383655001202396IND4406003020221207134113.0080523e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440600302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07104681052doi7 aPMC24382402pmcid7 a184802642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellmuth, Klaus10aSpecific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking  ap. 7275-7280.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is a positive regulator of growth factor signaling. Gain-of-function mutations in several types of leukemia define Shp2 as a bona fide oncogene. We performed a high-throughput in silico screen for small-molecular-weight compounds that bind the catalytic site of Shp2. We have identified the phenylhydrazonopyrazolone sulfonate PHPS1 as a potent and cell-permeable inhibitor, which is specific for Shp2 over the closely related tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 and PTP1B. PHPS1 inhibits Shp2-dependent cellular events such as hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)-induced epithelial cell scattering and branching morphogenesis. PHPS1 also blocks Shp2-dependent downstream signaling, namely HGF/SF-induced sustained phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 MAP kinases and dephosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, PHPS1 efficiently inhibits activation of Erk1/2 by the leukemia-associated Shp2 mutant, Shp2-E76K, and blocks the anchorage-independent growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines. The PHPS compound class is therefore suitable for further development of therapeutics for the treatment of Shp2-dependent diseases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3adephosphorylation 3aepithelial cells 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine1 aGrosskopf, Stefanie1 aLum, Ching Tung1 aWürtele, Martin1 aRöder, Nadine1 avon Kries, Jens Peter1 aRosario, Marta1 aRademann, Jörg1 aBirchmeier, Walter0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 May 20, v. 105, no. 20 p.7275-7280dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07104681053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01972naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245013800201300001800339500002400357500001500381506007600396520053900472506003701011650001601048650003001064650002001094650001201114650001101126653003001137700002001167700002201187700002301209700002201232700001701254700002401271700001901295773013501314852000901449856008001458655001201538IND4449855820221207122312.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985582DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02109-102doi7 aPMC30672862pmcid7 a211936772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Khomaini10aBiochemical Characteristics of the Novel Haloalkane Dehalogenase DatA, Isolated from the Plant Pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58  ap. 1881-1884.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the biochemical characterization of a novel haloalkane dehalogenase, DatA, isolated from the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.

The conversion is promoted by raising the peptide concentration. The tetramer is held together by hydrophobic forces. We have changed the net charge to -6 by acylation with acetylcitric anhydride (a new acylating agent); this anionic derivative forms tetrameric helix at neutral pH, without salt, and at relatively low concentration, conditions under which the cationic MLT does not become helical. Thus, a high net charge is not sufficient to prevent association and helix formation. We have synthesized an anionic melittin analogue of MLT (E-MLT; net charge -4) in which all five lysine and arginine residues are replaced with glutamate, and acetyl and succinyl derivatives of E-MLT (net charges -5 and -6). All three of these are resistant to helix formation. They require much higher NaCl or NaClO4 concentration for helix formation than does MLT. Even CaCl2, MgCl2, and spermine . 4HCl are less effective in helicizing E-MLT than MLT. MLT, at pH 7.2, shows increasing helix as the peptide concentration increases (8-120 micromolars), but E-MLT and its acyl derivatives do not. MLT and acylated MLTs in the helical tetramer show both cold- and heat-induced unfolding, with maximum stability near room temperature. At high temperature, a significant amount of residual structure remains. Heating (to 100 degrees C) monomeric MLT (i.e., MLT at low concentration) or E-MLT results in a monotonic increase in negative ellipticity. In 1.0 M NaCl, E-MLT (at sufficiently high concentration) also shows cold and hot unfolding. The results are discussed in respect to charge-charge and charge-dipole interactions, and hydrophobic effects. E-MLT is also discussed in relation to proteins of halophilic bacteria, which have higher proportions of anionic residues than do corresponding proteins of nonhalophiles. 3aApis mellifera 3amelittin 3amolecular conformation 3apH 3aionic strength 3atemperature 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3acharge characteristics 3aprotein secondary structure 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistry 2aCircular Dichroism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMelittenxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aModels, Chemical 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPeptidesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aProtein Conformation 2aTemperature 0aanalogs1 aAimoto, S.1 aBello, J.0 tBiopolymers.g1992 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.981-992x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bip.3603208093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02431naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010400175300001600279500002400295520126000319650001601579650002601595650001001621650001801631650001501649650001801664650002101682650002601703650002501729650001201754650001401766650001301780650001901793650002101812650001101833700002001844773009301864852000901957856005501966655001202021IND4429844420221120140152.0091211e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442984442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05925.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedriani, José M.10aFunctional diversity in fruit-frugivore interactions: a field experiment with Mediterranean mammals  ap. 983-992.  aIncludes references  aUsing field seed sowings, we assessed how four mammal species (Meles meles, Vulpes vulpes, Sus scrofa, and Oryctolagus cuniculus) influenced seed germination in three fleshy-fruited Mediterranean shrubs (Corema album, Pyrus bourgaeana, and Rubus ulmifolius). We predicted that gut passage and removal away from mother plants would enhance the quantity, speed, and asynchrony of seed germination. Results showed that percent germination was altered by gut passage, but that the magnitude and even the direction of such effects varied according to plant and disperser species. Likewise, dispersal away from mother plants affected the percentage and germination speed in some species but not others. Gut passage increased asynchrony of germination in Rubus and Pyrus, and removal from the mother plant increased asynchrony in Rubus, which likely enhances plant fitness in unpredictable environments. Gut passage generally had a stronger effect on germination than removal away from mother plants, but for some species both factors were similarly influential. Therefore, the combined effects of both seed dispersal services varied individually among fruit and frugivore species, leading to unusually high functional diversity in this seed dispersal mutualism. 3aMeles meles 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aPyrus 3aRubus inermis 3aSus scrofa 3aVulpes vulpes 3adigestive system 3afield experimentation 3afunctional diversity 3amammals 3amutualism 3aplanting 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3asowing1 aDelibes, Miguel0 tEcography.g2009 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.983-992dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05925.x 7aarticle01454naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008300124300001500207500012100222520069100343650001801034650001401052651000901066773007201075852000901147939003301156946001101189655001201200IND9200352620221120120308.0920122e199010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920035262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtefi, J.10aPreliminary research of persian walnut and correlation between pair characters  ap. 97-104.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Walnut Production, September 25-29, 1989, Budapest, Hungary.  aIran is known as one of the most important center for origin of walnuts.

The article takes the view that an individual consumer is prepared to pay a premium for what he/she regards as high quality. The article examines some of the characteristics which apply to those products at the expensive end of the range -- and suggests that they may be categorized into those of genuine quality and those of pseudo quality. Genuine quality refers to products which provide real improvements, e.g. nutrition or keeping quality. when compared with the basic end of the range -- and incur extra costs to produce. By contrast, pseudo quality confers no additional benefit on the consumer in terms of the food and often exploits consumer ignorance. Concludes that the food industry should place much greater emphasis on genuine quality. By doing so, public confidence in the industry would be raised. 3anutritive value 3afood choices 3aconsumer attitudes 0aconsumer behavior 0afood quality0 tBritish food journal.g1992, v. 94, no. 3 p.39-43x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707092100105713Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01523naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234500011500250520060000365650002100965650001800986650002601004651001001030700001901040700001601059700002001075773007301095852000901168939003301177946001101210655001201221IND9200350620221120084820.0920122e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920035062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuva, H.P.10aResponse of intercropping on economics and effects on main crop of mango under South Gujarat conditions  ap. 316-320.  aPaper presented at the "Second International Symposium on Mango," Volume I, May 20-24, 1985, Bangalore, India.  aA study on the effect of different intercrops (two long duration, i.e., banana and tapioca and two short duration, i.e., tomato followed by cluster bean and brinjal followed by cowpea) on yield and its economics were carried out in newly planted orchard of mango cv Rajapuri for three years.

A 2-h van journey increased plasma cortisol to > 25 ng/ml and blood glucose to > 5 mmol/l. Respiratory rates were increased to > 40 breaths per min and heart rates by > 100 beats per min. Xylazine alone (0.01 mg/kg) suppressed resting plasma cortisol concentrations, increased blood glucose concentrations to 4.5 +/- 0.8 mmol/l and suppressed respiratory rates by 5-10 breaths per min and heart rates by 20 beats per min. Cortisol concentrations were suppressed by xylazine treatment if given before a 20-min van journey, and for approximately 60 min if given 20 min after the start of a 2-h journey. When combined with transport, xylazine caused an additive effect on glucose concentrations, but suppressed respiratory and heart rates. However, for the latter criteria and the timing of suppression was different depending on the time of onset and duration of the stressor. Injection of 50 micrograms ovine corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) caused an immediate elevation of cortisol concentrations (but not glucose) which lasted for at least 6 H compared with the return to baseline within 60 min after either length of journey. Xylazine pretreatment did not alter the cortisol response to CRF, suggesting that xylazine must act centrally above pituitary level when blocking the cortisol response to transport. It is proposed that under resting conditions the hypothalamus is under alpha2-adrenergic suppression. Stimulation of cortisol secretion in response to a stressor can be inhibited by an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. 3agoats 3axylazine 3aanimal transport 3acortisol 3ablood plasma 3ablood glucose 3aheart rate 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aGoat Diseasesxprevention & control 2aGoats 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aMale 2aRespirationxdrug effects 2aStress, Physiologicalxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aTransportation 2aXylazinextherapeutic use 0atiming 0arespiration rate 0aroad transport 0astress1 aJones, R.S.1 aDobson, H.0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1992 , v. 148, no. 2 p.119-128x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03203naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100002100153245010500174300001600279500002400295500001500319520172000334650002002054650001202074650002502086650002202111650001302133650002002146650001302166650001802179650002602197650002302223650002202246650001802268650002502286650001702311650002002328651002502348653002202373653002302395700001502418773009902433852000902532856007502541930003302616945002502649946001102674655001202685IND4410809820221120064300.0080930s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441080982DNAL7 a10.1071/BT061482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK0011 aSerong, Merrilyn14aThe timing and nature of floristic and structural changes during secondary succession in wet forests  ap. 220-231.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe timing and nature of floristic and structural changes to vegetation were documented during secondary succession in wet forests in the Victorian Central Highlands from 3 to > 100 years after severe disturbance by timber-harvesting or wildfire. A chronosequence of five forest age-classes was employed. Vegetation surveys were conducted in two 15 x 50 m sampling quadrats in each of 12 replicate sites in each forest age-class between April 2000 and June 2001. Frequencies of occurrence of 67 floristic variables (plant taxa, other vegetation elements and litter components) were used to distinguish among plant communities in the different forest age-classes. Structural comparisons were made among the age-classes using species richness, floristic variability (i.e. spatial heterogeneity), trunk diameter and stem density of Mountain Ash Eucalyptus regnans F.Muell. and heights of forest strata. Most patterns of change showed a clear unidirectional trend from the youngest to the oldest age-class. Much of the floristic change occurred within a few decades of disturbance, but some of the structural changes continued throughout succession. Vegetation changes were generally attributable to natural succession, but a few differences between young forests that regenerated after timber-harvesting and older forests that originated after wildfire were likely to be due to the different disturbance histories. The pattern of vegetation change during secondary succession in forests after severe disturbance can influence the pattern of forest use by birds. The findings of this study thus formed the foundation of an examination of the community and behavioural responses of diurnal birds to secondary succession. 3achronosequences 3alogging 3afunctional diversity 3aforest succession 3adiameter 3amontane forests 3atree age 3aforest litter 3abotanical composition 3aEucalyptus regnans 3asecondary forests 3astand density 3anatural regeneration 3aforest fires 3astand structure 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aplant communities 0aforest age-classes1 aLill, Alan0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2008, v. 56, no. 3 p.220-231dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT061483Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245010200197300001800299506007600317520131900393506003701712650001301749650001601762650001601778650002201794650002801816650001701844650002101861650001301882650003301895700001601928700001401944700001301958700001601971700001801987700001902005700001502024700001802039700001402057773017302071852000902244856008302253930003302336946001302369655001202382IND4406000920221207122400.0080523e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440600092DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07100181052doi7 aPMC24382202pmcid7 a184776992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lei10aEB1 promotes Aurora-B kinase activity through blocking its inactivation by protein phosphatase 2A  ap. 7153-7158.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEB1 (end-binding protein 1) is a key player in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. In concert with its binding partners, adenomatous polyposis coli and p150glued, EB1 plays a crucial role in a variety of microtubule-based cellular processes. In this study we have identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen the mitotic kinase and chromosome passenger protein Aurora-B as a binding partner of EB1. GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal a specific interaction between Aurora-B and EB1 both in cells and in vitro. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that these two proteins colocalize on the central spindle in anaphase and in the midbody during cytokinesis. Kinase assays using both immunoprecipitated and purified Aurora-B demonstrate that EB1 is not a substrate of Aurora-B. Rather, EB1 positively regulates Aurora-B kinase activity. EB1 overexpression remarkably enhances Aurora-B activity and knockdown of its expression impairs Aurora-B activity. Our data further show that EB1 is able to protect Aurora-B from dephosphorylation/inactivation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by blocking PP2A binding to Aurora-B. These findings establish Aurora-B as an EB1-interacting protein and suggest that EB1 stimulates Aurora-B activity through antagonizing its dephosphorylation/inactivation by PP2A.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanaphase 3achromosomes 3acytokinesis 3adephosphorylation 3afluorescence microscopy 3amicrotubules 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteins 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aGao, Jinmin1 aDong, Xin1 aLiu, Min1 aLi, Dengwen1 aShi, Xingjuan1 aDong, Jin-Tang1 aLu, Xianyu1 aLiu, Chunyong1 aZhou, Jun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 May 20, v. 105, no. 20 p.7153-7158dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07100181053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02124naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002600128245014000154300001500294500001500309520079500324650001701119650002401136650001301160650001501173650002201188650001001210650001201220650003201232650002501264650004101289650001501330650003501345650004801380650001001428653001701438653001901455653002801474700001801502773008001520852000901600930003301609945001301642946001101655655001201666IND2045241920221120053321.0950324e199501  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204524192DNAL7 a77358742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStadtlander, C.T.K.H.10aAttachment of Mycoplasma mobile 163 K to piscine gill arches and rakers--light, scanning and transmission electron microscopic findings  ap. 89-100.  a2019-12-05  aExplant cultures of gill arches and rakers were established to evaluate the attachment and colonization characteristics as well as the cytotoxic effects of the piscine bacterium, Mycoplasma mobile 163 K on piscine gill epithelium.

The presenting signs may consist of exercise intolerance, inspiratory stridor, inspiratory dyspnoea, gagging, coughing and dysphonia. Two forms of laryngeal paralysis exist, hereditary and acquired. The hereditary form is found in young dogs and transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene. At present little is known about the aetiology of acquired laryngeal paralysis and therefore treatment is directed at relieving the laryngeal obstruction. Recent reports indicate that arytenoid lateralization achieves the best results as a method of surgical correction. 3adogs 3amedical treatment 3agenetic disorders 3asurgery 3aparalysis 3alarynx 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxgeneticsxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aLarynxxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aVocal Cord Paralysisxveterinary 0aetiology 0asymptoms 0aanimal anatomy 0aliterature reviews 0aacquired laryngeal paralysis 0aphysiological functions0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1995 , v. 151, no. 1 p.71-82x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245017300157300001800330520128400348650004401632650001901676650001301695650001601708700002501724700001801749700001901767700002301786700002301809700002701832773014201859852000902001856007802010930003302088946001302121655001202134IND4410755820221120030013.0080926e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441075582DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.229912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdeleva, Maria10aHydrogen-transfer reaction in nitroxide mediated polymerization of methyl methacrylate: 2,2-Diphenyl-3-phenylimino-2,3-dihydroindol-1-yloxyl nitroxide (DPAIO) vs. TEMPO  ap. 6828-6842.  aIn a recent article, we have showed that the nitroxide mediated polymerization of methyl methacrylate was possible up to 80% conversion for reasonable masses Mn = 60,000 g mol⁻¹ when 2,2-diphenyl-3-phenylimino-2,3-dihydroindol-1-yloxyl nitroxide (DPAIO) was used as control agent. We have claimed that the success of this experiment relied on the absence of H-transfer reaction both in the alkoxyamine and between alkyl and nitroxyl radical. In this article, the decomposition of 4-nitrophenyl 2-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-yloxy)-2-methylpropionate (1a) and 4-nitrophenyl 2-(2,2-diphenyl-3-phenylimino-2,3-dihydroindol-1-yloxy)-2-methylpropanoate (2a) has been studied by ¹H NMR in the presence and in the absence (persistent radical effect condition) of scavenger (thiophenol PhSH). At temperature lower than the one used for polymerization, fast and quantitative H-transfer reaction was observed for 1a whereas no H-transfer reaction was observed for 2a. The scavenging technique proved for the first time that the H-transfer was an intermolecular process for 1a. However, the slow side-reaction of N----OC bond homolysis, which did not impede the control of the polymerization but may exert a detrimental effect on the livingness, was observed and quantified for 2a. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aMarque, Sylvain R.A.1 aBertin, Denis1 aGigmes, Didier1 aGuillaneuf, Yohann1 aMorozov, Sergey V.1 aBagryanskaya, Elena G.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6828-6842dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.229913Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01051naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245002300126300001600149500012300165520034000288650001800628650001300646651001200659773007300671852000900744939003300753946001100786655001200797IND9200341420221120030109.0920121e199010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920034142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoiko, R.E.10aApomixis of walnut  ap. 233-236.  aPaper presented at the "First International Symposium on Walnut Production," September 25-29, 1989, Budapest, Hungary.  aThe seedlings of Juglans regia L. and Juglans regia L. var.

Greenhouses must be adapted to this mild, semi-arid, high radiation region which offers relatively high efficiency in respect to input energy requirements. Secondly, the low windspeeds inherent to these structures mean that special effort should be given to supplying CO2 to the leaf surfaces even though the greenhouse may be fully ventilated. Existing structures now, on the average, transmit only about 60% of outside solar radiation. Therefore, efforts should be made to enhance transmittance in order to avoid yield reduction in the mid-winters. The use of percent relative humidity should be discouraged, with humidity control based upon absolute vapor concentration and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The Mediterranean climate offers the best opportunities for economic application of solar heating. 3agreenhouses 3aclimatic factors 3aMediterranean region0 tActa horticulturae.g1991 May, , no. 287 p.23-34x0567-75727nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002500138245013200163300001800295520115000313650001601463650002401479650001201503650002301515650004401538650001901582650001301601700002301614700002401637700002601661700002401687700002301711773014201734852000901876856007801885930003301963946001301996655001202009IND4410756720221120022632.0080926e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441075672DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.230022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadchenko, Alexei V.10aKinetic study on the living/controlled cationic polymerization of p-methoxystyrene coinitiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane  ap. 6928-6939.  aA kinetic study of the living cationic polymerization of p-methoxystyrene using 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol (1)/B(C₆F₅)₃ initiating system in a mixture of CH₃CN with CH₂Cl₂ 1:1 (v/v) at room temperature was carried out utilizing a wide variety of conditions. The polymerization proceeded in a living fashion even in the presence of a large amount of water ([H₂O]/[B(C₆F₅)₃] ratio up to 20) to afford polymers whose Mn increased in direct proportion to monomer conversion with fairly narrow MWDs (Mw/Mn <= 1.3). The investigation revealed that the rate of polymerization was first-order in B(C₆F₅)₃ concentration, while a negative order in H₂O concentration close to -2 was obtained. It was also found that the rate of polymerization decreased with lowering temperature, which could be attributed to a decreased concentration in free Lewis acid, the true coinitiator of polymerization. A mechanistic scheme to explain the kinetic behavior of living p-methoxystyrene polymerization is proposed, which has been validated by PREDICI simulation on multiple-data curves obtained by ¹H NMR in situ polymerization experiment. 3aLewis acids 3aambient temperature 3aethanol 3amethylene chloride 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aKostjuk, Sergei V.1 aVasilenko, Irina V.1 aGanachaud, François.1 aKaputsky, Fyodor N.1 aGuillaneuf, Yohann0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6928-6939dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.230023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01893naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002300133245006000156300001600216520073400232650001200966650002600978650001601004650002101020650002101041650002301062650003101085650002001116650001101136650001101147650002701158650002901185650002001214650002201234650001601256653002401272653002101296773007901317852000901396939003301405945000801438946001301446655001201459991612821360742620221117172319.0810115e198002  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810002282DNAL7 a73515852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinberg, Laurence.10aOne milk for all--not ever likely and certainly not yet  ap. 240-241.  aAlthough artificial formulas do not seem to equal human milk in providing total nutrition and immunological protection to infants, breast milk is unsuitable for some premature infants or babies with metabolic intolerances.

Reaction kinetics analysis indicated that the graft copolymerization is living and controllable. The self-assembly and thermosensitive property of the obtained EC-g-P(PEGMA) amphiphilic copolymers in water were investigated by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and transmittance. It was found that the EC-g-P(PEGMA) amphiphilic copolymers can self-assemble into spherical micelles in water. The size of the micelles increases with the increase of the side chain length. The spherical micelles show thermosensitive properties with a lower critical solution temperature around 65 °C, which almost independent on the graft density and the length of the side chains. The obtained EC-g-P(PEGMA) graft copolymers have both the unique properties of poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose, which may have the potential applications in biomedicine and biotechnology. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiotechnology 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3amedicine 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransmittance1 aLiu, Ruigang1 aLiu, Wenyong1 aKang, Hongliang1 aWu, Min1 aHuang, Yong0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6907-6915dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.230003Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02021naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245014200143300001600285500001500301520074600316650001801062650002401080650001601104650001101120650000801131650001501139650002201154650002201176650003101198650002101229650002301250650002701273650004001300650003101340650003101371653002301402700001601425700001401441773006501455852000901520939003301529946001301562655001201575IND9203679820221123040538.0920609e19870731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920367982DNAL7 a30383342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohara, Y.14aThe physical map of the whole E. coli chromosome: application of a new strategy for rapid analysis and sorting of a large genomic library  ap. 495-508.  a2019-12-04  aThirty-four hundred lambda phage clones containing segments of the E. coli chromosome were isolated and used to construct a 4700 kb long integrated restriction map for eight six-base-recognizing enzymes by a rapid mass-analysis method. Our strategy was to measure the sizes of partial restriction enzyme digests by hybridization with a vector probe in a manner analogous to nucleotide sequencing. The data were sorted into groups by a computer program and the boundary clones were further correlated with each other using a mass hybridization method. These clones can be exploited for the isolation of any desired E. coli genes if their map positions are known. Also, the strategy is applicable to analyses of the genomes of other organisms. 3aDNA libraries 3arestriction mapping 3achromosomes 3agenome 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aEscherichia coli 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aDNA Restriction Enzymesxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 0achromosome mapping1 aAkiyama, K.1 aIsono, K.0 tCell.g1987 July 31, v. 50, no. 3 p.495-508x0092-86747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01950naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245005400145300001400199520061100213650002900824650001600853650002500869650001800894650002300912650003500935650002800970650002800998650003401026650002601060650002801086650003901114653002801153700002201181700002701203700001401230700001901244700002001263700001601283700001401299700002101313700001401334773006701348852000901415939003301424946001101457655001201468IND9203680320221123030816.0920609e19920507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920368032DNAL7 a15741252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, S.G.14aThe complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome III  ap. 38-46.  aThe entire DNA sequence of chromosome III of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined.

The success of epicotyl grafting was maximum in glasshouse followed by under partial shade and the least success was recorded in greenhouse. The number of days required for sprouting of scion bud was minimum in glasshouse, maximum in greenhouse and intermediate in control. Bartlett index and CVE values for the sprouting of scion were computed. The CVE did not differ much in different propagation structures as well as urea application. However, the BI showed some differences. BI was found to be the least (0.152) in case of plants kept in greenhouse.

Cows (n=10) were divided into two groups: Group 1=single embryo recipient cows (n=5); and group 2=twin-embryo recipient cows (n=5). Mean plasma cortisol concentrations remained basal (2-4 ng ml(-1)) in both groups up to 2 days prepartum increased significantly (P<0.05) to peak at parturition day, and then declined rapidly 1 day post-partum. Twin-bearing cows had significantly (P<0.01) higher mean plasma cortisol concentration on the day of parturition than in the singleton cows. There was no effect of the stage of gestation on cortisol levels in either group (P>0.1), except in the last 48 h prior to parturition. A single cow giving birth prematurely had 100% higher plasma cortisol levels on the day of parturition and 1 day post-partum than cows giving birth at term. 3adairy cows 3apregnancy 3acortisol 3ablood plasma 3apremature birth 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aEmbryo Transferxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHydrocortisonexbloodxphysiology. 2aLabor, Obstetricxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxbloodxphysiology. 2aPregnancy, Multiplexbloodxphysiology. 2aTwins 0atwinning 0apregnancy stage 0asingle births1 aTakahashi, T.1 aTakenouchi, N.1 aHirako, M.1 aSasaki, N.1 aDomeki, I.0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1996 July, v. 152, no. 4 p.425-432x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02695naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003900142245011900181500001400300520146900314592002801783650001101811650001101822650001701833650001901850650001501869650001101884650001101895650001501906650002501921650001301946650001401959650002001973650001201993650001002005650001602015650001902031700002002050773011802070856007602188852000902264655001202273IND60724495520221123030248.0210122e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072449552DNAL7 a10.3390/land100100482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves Carvalho Nascimento, Lorena 10aIntegrating Diverse Perspectives for Managing Neighborhood Trees and Urban Ecosystem Services in Portland, OR (US)  aNAL-light  aMunicipalities worldwide are increasingly recognizing the importance of urban green spaces to mitigate climate change’s extreme effects and improve residents’ quality of life. Even with extensive earlier research examining the distribution of tree canopy in cities, we know little about human perceptions of urban forestry and related ecosystem services. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the variations in socioeconomic indicators and public perceptions by asking how neighborhood trees and socioeconomic indicators mediate public perceptions of ecosystem services availability. Using Portland, Oregon (USA) as our case study, we assessed socioeconomic indicators, land cover data, and survey responses about public perceptions of neighborhood trees. Based on over 2500 survey responses, the results indicated a significant correlation among tree canopy, resident income, and sense of ownership for urban forestry. We further identified the extent to which the absence of trees amplifies environmental injustices and challenges for engaging communities with landscape management. The results suggested that Portland residents are aware of tree maintenance challenges, and the inclusion of cultural ecosystem services can better address existing environmental injustices. Our assessment of open-ended statements suggested the importance of conducting public outreach to identify specific priorities for a community-based approach to urban forestry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOregon 3acanopy 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3aincome 3aland cover 3alandscape management 3aoutreach 3aownership 3aquality of life 3asurveys 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurban forestry1 aShandas, Vivek 0 tLand.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100100483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002300168245008800191300001800279520119200297592002801489653001701517653001801534653001501552653002701567653002201594700002401616700002501640773012001665856010201785852000901887655001201896IND60130879220221121023700.0151127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013087922DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[1303:HRAHTO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeckerly, Floyd W.10aHunter-effort––harvest-size relationships among hunt types of white-tailed deer  ap. 1303-1311.  aInformation on hunter-effort––harvest-size relationships relevant to managing and monitoring hunted populations with multiple hunt types has not been examined in detail. We estimated harvest size from hunter effort in 6 types of hunts for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and compared intercepts and slopes to assess whether harvest size differed with hunting effort. The 6 hunt types were (age––sex class of population hunted and weapons allowed) as follows: antlerless gun (shotgun, centerfire rifle), either-sex archery, either-sex gun, either-sex muzzleloader, buck-only gun, and buck-only muzzle-loader. The data set was a 12-year harvest record from a hunt program in western Tennessee. We measured hunter effort by hunter days (number of hunters and days they hunted). We detected differences in intercepts but not slopes among hunt types. Hunt types with largest harvest sizes were >4 times larger than hunt types with smallest harvest sizes, controlling for hunter effort. Because slopes of regressions were similar, hunter effort among hunt types can be adjusted so that a harvest size:hunter effort ratio can be used to track relative deer population change.  aPublisher supplied data 0aharvest size 0ahunter effort 0ahunt types 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0awhite-tailed deer1 aKennedy, Michael L.1 aStephenson, Steve W.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.1303-1311dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[1303:HRAHTO]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245009600178300001400274520075800288592002801046650001701074650002801091650002201119650002001141650002601161650001401187653001401201653002501215653001701240653002001257653001701277653002901294700002301323773010001346856008201446852000901528655001201537IND60525127320221117183250.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Élison Fabrício B.10aSystematic relationships of the Thripidae subfamily Sericothripinae (Insecta: Thysanoptera)  ap. 24-32.  aMorphological character states are examined among sericothripines and related Thysanoptera-Terebrantia, and generic and suprageneric relationships are explored.

A survey of preweaning calf-rearing practices was conducted using a farmer questionnaire. The survey included 136 farms, representing 11.9% of all dairy cows in the Czech Republic. Mean herd size (± standard deviation) was 326±131.4 cows, and mean milk production 7,413±1,389.5kg per cow per year. We evaluated 59 farms with Holsteins (H) and 77 with the Czech Fleckvieh breed (C). The survey revealed that (1) calving in group pens predominated (67.6% of farms); (2) no disinfection of calf navels occurred on 11.8% of herds; (3) pooled colostrum was fed on 15.4% of farms; (4) colostrum quality was controlled on only 44.1% of farms, and only 73.5% of farms had reserve colostrum stocks; (5) nonmarket waste milk was fed in 64.7% of herds but it was pasteurized in only in 6.8% of herds and acidified in 35.2% of herds; (6) milk replacer was mixed with nonmarket waste milk on 52.9% of farms; (7) 58.8% of farms enabled calves to obtain milk by sucking and 41.2% by drinking from a bucket; (8) the main criterion in weaning was calf age (61.7%), followed by acceptance of starter and concentrated feed (19.9%) and lack of housing capacity (18.4%); and (9) newborn calves were individually housed on 96.7% of farms and group-housed on 3.3% of farms. The most marked differences in calf-rearing management between Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh farms were (1) a higher proportion of operations calving in tie-stalls or stanchions in C (6.5%) versus H (1.7%) farms; (2) a higher proportion of untreated navels on C (15.6%) versus H (6.8%) farms; (3) a lower proportion of C (11.7%) versus H (20.4%) farms feeding pooled colostrum; (4) a lower proportion of C (39%) versus H (50.9%) farms monitoring colostrum quality; (5) sucking milk from nipple buckets predominated (61%) on C farms, whereas drinking from an open bucket was most common (64.4%) on H farms; (6) age was the main criterion in weaning calves of both breeds (C farms: 55.8%, H farms: 69.5%), whereas the second most important criterion was lack of housing capacity (28.6% of farms) on C farms and the amount of consumed starter (25.4%) on H farms. We observed a difference in duration of colostrum period between C herds (median 5d) and H herds (median 4d). A tendency was observed for age of calves at weaning (C herds: median at 9.1wk, H herds: median at 10wk).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aSimmental 3abuckets 3acalves 3acalving 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3adisinfection 3adrinking 3afarmers 3afarms 3aherd size 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilk replacer 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3aquestionnaires 3arearing 3astanchions 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3atie stalls 3aweaning 3aCzech Republic 0acalf 0arearing 0afarm management 0awelfare1 aZink, V.1 aDoležal, O.1 aŠtolc, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.3973-3981dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-73253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010800163300001600271500001500287520236500302592002802667650002002695650001802715650000902733650001102742650002202753650001202775650001402787650001602801650001002817650002002827650001302847650000902860650001002869650001802879650001102897650001802908650001502926650002002941651001002961653001802971653001302989653001203002653001303014653001103027653001803038653001003056700001703066700001803083700001403101700001303115700001403128773008703142856008503229852000903314655001203323IND60542467120221118185635.0190403e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054246712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aEffects of crop rotation and rainfall on water erosion on a gentle slope in the hilly loess area, China  ap. 205-214.  a2019-12-06  aCultivation on steep land has long been blamed as a major contributor of water erosion in many fragile regions of the world. Soil and water loss from gentle slopes, however, are always subjectively considered less important and are even neglected in practice. In this study, 21 plots including seven crop-rotation types (CRTs) under three different slight gradients (10°, 15°, 20°), were established in Dingxi, a typical semiarid hilly loess area in China. Eight consecutive years of erosion data under different gentle-slope cultivation conditions were compared and analyzed. The most interesting and key finding is that water erosion remained far higher on slopes with gradients of less than 20° than the tolerable criterion, even when some CRT measures and field treatments (e.g., contour cultivation, stiletto, minimum tillage, and crop-shrub intercropping) were implemented. Newfield techniques targeting erosion control on gentle slopes should be developed. Secondly, compared with other crop species, potato cultivation under sloping conditions was confirmed to cause the highest soil and water loss and should be strictly forbidden at large scales. Being a major source of income for local farmers, potato plantation under terracing conditions, rather than on slopes, is strongly recommended as the first choice for achieving the double advantages of erosion control and farmer income. Thirdly, water erosion on gentle slopes was reduced significantly when different CRTs coupled with land-closure treatments (e.g., farmland abandonment, leaving artificial grassland under natural succession, and consecutive fallows) were conducted simultaneously. This result confirms that these measures are effective for conserving soil and water, and are feasible in practice. Finally, water erosion depended significantly on the timing and proportion of rainstorms in certain periods. The sensitivity of water erosion to natural rainfall, however, was also dependent on the specific surface status. In summary, a higher occurrence of rainstorms coupled with crops that have poor resistance to erosion (e.g., potato, flax, and wheat) and up–down cultivation will certainly accelerate runoff and erosion on slopes, whereas natural succession without human disturbance or appropriate CRTs with contour farming practices can markedly reduce water erosion rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aminimum tillage 3awater erosion 3aflax 3ahumans 3aagricultural land 3afarmers 3aterracing 3afarm income 3awheat 3aerosion control 3apotatoes 3arain 3aloess 3aintercropping 3arunoff 3acrop rotation 3agrasslands 3acontour farming 3aChina 0aLoess Plateau 0aRainfall 0aErosion 0aKeywords 0aRunoff 0aCrop rotation 0acrops1 aChen, Liding1 aZhang, Handan1 aYang, Lei1 aYu, Yang1 aChen, Jin0 tCatena.g2014 Dec., v. 123 p.205-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245017200171500001400343520137100357592002801728650001601756650002801772650003101800650003001831650002901861650002101890650002401911650001601935650001201951650002201963650001501985650001902000650001202019650001402031650001702045650001802062650001002080650000902090650001302099650001602112650002502128650001302153650001602166650001102182650001302193650001502206650001802221650001602239700002002255700002502275700002502300700002202325700002002347700002702367700001902394700001802413700002202431773011902453856007602572852000902648655001202657IND60711668220221121013037.0200928e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071166822DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90912392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez, José Antonio,10aBioconversion of Fish Discards through the Production of Lactic Acid Bacteria and Metabolites: Sustainable Application of Fish Peptones in Nutritive Fermentation Media  aNAL-light  aIn the current work, we study the capacity of 30 peptones obtained by enzyme proteolysis of ten discarded fish species (hake, megrim, red scorpionfish, pouting, mackerel, gurnard, blue whiting, Atlantic horse mackerel, grenadier, and boarfish) to support the growth and metabolite production of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of probiotic and technological importance. Batch fermentations of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, L. casei, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in most of the media formulated with fish peptones (87% of the cases) led to similar growths (quantified as dry-weight biomass and viable cells) and metabolites (mainly lactic acid) than in commercial control broth (MRS). Comparisons among cultures were performed by means of the parameters obtained from the mathematical fittings of experimental kinetics to the logistic equation. Modelling among experimental and predicted data from each bioproduction was generally accurate. A simple economic assessment demonstrated the profitability achieved when MRS is substituted by media formulated with fish discards: a 3–4-fold reduction of costs for LAB biomass, viable cells formation, and lactic and acetic acid production. Thus, these fish peptones are promising alternatives to the expensive commercial peptones as well as a possible solution to valorize discarded fish biomasses and by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapros aper 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLepidorhombus whiffiagonis 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3aScorpaena scrofa 3aTrachurus trachurus 3aacetic acid 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acell viability 3aenzymes 3aequations 3afermentation 3afish discards 3afoods 3ahake 3akinetics 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amackerel 3ametabolites 3amodels 3apeptones 3aprobiotics 3aprofitability 3aproteolysis1 aDurán, Ana  I.1 aMenduíña, Araceli 1 aNogueira, Margarita 1 aGomes, Ana Maria,1 aAntunes, Joana 1 aFreitas, Ana Cristina,1 aDagá, Esther 1 aDagá, Paula 1 aValcarcel, Jesus 0 tFoods.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90912393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100002300182245008600205300001600291500001900307506007600326520082700402592002801229596011601257596007901373596013901452506003701591650002201628650002201650650001001672650001601682650001301698650001901711650001101730650001401741650002001755650002201775650002701797650001201824653001801836653001701854653002301871700005901894700002501953700002501978773013302003856007502136852000902211655001202220IND60672694420221207112615.0191017e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269442DNAL7 a10.1093/bfgp/elx0422doi7 aPMC62524032pmcid7 a292530802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazniewski, Michal14aThe structural variability of the influenza A hemagglutinin receptor-binding site  ap. 415-427.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHemagglutinin (HA) is a transmembrane protein of the influenza A virus and a key component in its life cycle. The protein allows the virus to enter a host cell by recognizing specific glycans attached to transmembrane proteins of the host, which leads to viral endocytosis. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the structural relationship between changes in the HA receptor-binding site (RBS) and the sialylated glycans that bind them. Several mutations were identified in the HA RBS that allows the virus to change host tropism. Their impact on binding the analogs of human and avian receptors was determined with X-ray crystallography. In this article, we provide a short overview of the HA protein structure and briefly discuss the adaptive mutations introduced to different HA subtypes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/15/B/ST6/05082a2013/09/B/NZ2/00121cPolish National Science Centredhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004281  aTEAMcFoundation for Polish Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001870  a1U54DK107967-01c‘Nucleome Positioning System for Spatiotemporal Genome Organization and Regulation’ within 4DNucleome NIH program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aX-ray diffraction 3abirds 3aendocytosis 3agenomics 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein structure 3atransmembrane proteins 3aviruses 0ahemagglutinin 0ahost tropism 0aadaptive mutations1 aDawson, Wayne K1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7751-77781 aSzczepińska, Teresa1 aPlewczynski, Dariusz0 tBriefings in functional genomics.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 17, no. 6 p.415-427dOxford University PresswJournal:27071x2041-26577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elx0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245007100159300001600230520068400246592002800930596004900958650001801007650001401025650001701039650001401056650001301070650001801083653002201101653001601123653001101139700002001150700001401170700001301184700002201197700001301219773013301232856007501365852000901440655001201449IND60672694520221122115616.0191017e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269452DNAL7 a10.1093/bfgp/ely0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, An-Liang10aGenomic and epigenomic perspectives of T-cell exhaustion in cancer  ap. 113-118.  aIn chronic infection and cancer, T cells gradually become exhausted because of the persistent stimulation by antigens. In this process, the overexpression of multiple inhibitory receptors is induced, the production of effective cytokines decreases and the cytotoxicity and proliferation of T cells impairs, all contributing to the failure of T cells in fighting against cancer. Reversing T-cell exhaustion is a promising immunotherapy for cancer that has yielded encouraging results. In this review, we discuss the genomic and epigenomic landscape of T-cell exhaustion in cancer. Also, we introduce the relevant therapeutic interventions for T-cell exhaustion in clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data  a81772596cNatural Science Fundation of China 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3aepigenome 3agenomics 3aimmunotherapy 0aT-cell exhaustion 0aepigenomics 0acancer1 aWang, Jin-Cheng1 aYang, Kun1 aJi, Dong1 aHuang, Zheng-Ming1 aXu, Yong0 tBriefings in functional genomics.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 18, no. 2 p.113-118dOxford University PresswJournal:27071x2041-26577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/ely0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010000159520144300259592002801702650001201730650002901742650002001771650001301791650002201804650002501826650001401851650001801865650002801883650001501911651001001926700001301936700001301949700001601962700001201978773012801990856007402118852000902192655001202201IND60652661020221121181653.0190713e20181019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065266102DNAL7 a10.3390/su101037922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xuedong10aEvaluation and Policy Research on the Sustainable Development of China’s Rare Earth Resources  aAs rare earth resources are indispensable raw materials for modern society, they have become strategic global reserve resources. Even though China is the world&rsquo;s largest producer and exporter of rare earth, the industry has low efficiency and severe problems with over-exploitation and environmental pollution; therefore, there needs to be a greater focus on the sustainable exploitation of rare earth resources. This paper establishes an innovative evaluation index system for the sustainable development of China&rsquo;s rare earth resources from six main aspects; economic development, social progress, environmental protection, technological innovation, rare earth development and utilization, and rare earth protection in which the indicators are assessed using an entropy method. Grey correlation analysis was used to evaluate China&rsquo;s rare earth sustainable development level from 2006&ndash;2016, from which it was found that sustainable development was poor from 2006&ndash;2010 and marginally better from 2011&ndash;2016. The main factor affecting rare earth sustainable development in China was found to be the lag in the development of environment protection system and rare earth protection system. Policy recommendations for improving China&rsquo;s rare earth protection, environmental protection, and technological innovation are proposed to guide government regulations and assist rare earth industry personnel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3aenvironmental protection 3ahuman resources 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apollution 3araw materials 3asustainable development 3atechnology 3aChina1 aYe, Meng1 aYang, Li1 aFu, Wanbing1 aLi, Zhi0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 19, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101037923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008900165300001600254520206600270592002802336650002302364650001602387650000902403650001202412650001802424650001002442650001702452650003902469650001302508650001702521653002402538653001302562653001502575653001502590653001402605700001902619700001702638700001402655700001502669773016002684856008502844852000902929655001202938IND60778849320221118040316.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, S.10aSelenium deficiency is associated with polyneuropathy in primary Sjögren's syndrome  ap. 212-217.  aSelenium plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Selenium deficiency is associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a common comorbidity in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Therefore we aimed to identify whether or not selenium deficiency is also associated with pSS. 107 consecutive female patients with pSS and, as a control, 59 female patients with axial spondyloarthritis were recruited. Later, 11 male pSS patients, 5 of these suffering from polyneuropathy, and 15 male axSpA patients were additionally recruited in order to confirm the results from the female patients. All patients were consulted about their diet and food intolerances and their plasma selenium concentrations were analyzed. Current and previous extraglandular manifestations of pSS were recorded. Patients complaining of misperceptions and tingling paraesthesia underwent measurement of nerve conduction velocity. The proportion of patients and controls with a selenium deficiency was compared using Fisher's exact test. The proportion of female pSS patients with a low selenium concentration <0.63 μmol/L (22.4%) was significantly higher than of the controls (1.7%) (p < 0.001). Within the group of female patients with pSS, selenium deficiency was significantly associated with the presence of polyneuropathy (45.8% with vs 14.5% without polyneuropathy, p = 0.003) and particularly polyneuropathy with motor nerve involvement measured by nerve conduction velocity (41.7% with vs 10.8% without motor neuropathy, p = 0.001). The mean selenium concentrations of the 5 male pSS patients with polyneuropathy were significantly lower compared to the 6 pSS patients without polyneuropathy and to the 15 male axSpA controls. PSS and in particular its complication polyneuropathy is associated with selenium deficiency. Measurement of the selenium concentration in blood is advisable in patients with pSS and in particular in the subset of patients with polyneuropathy. Substitution of selenium may be a possible therapy of polyneuropathy associated with pSS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3acomorbidity 3adiet 3afemales 3aimmune system 3amales 3anerve tissue 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aselenium 3atherapeutics 0aSjögren's syndrome 0aSelenium 0aDeficiency 0aNeuropathy 0aHashimoto1 aSkripuletz, T.1 aSeeliger, T.1 aWitte, T.1 aThiele, T.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Aug., v. 50 p.212-217dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010100169300001400270520134300284592002801627650001301655650001801668650001101686650001301697650001201710650003901722650002001761650000901781650001301790650001201803650001101815650002101826650003301847650001701880651001001897653001801907653001301925653001501938653000801953653001701961653000801978653000901986700002401995700001702019773010002036856008202136852000902218655001202227IND60525127820221121014619.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2016.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzpila, Krzysztof10aFirst documentation of early preimaginal stages of the blowfly Bengalia (Diptera: Calliphoridae)  ap. 16-23.  aAdult blowflies of the large tropical genus Bengalia present a peculiar predacious behaviour, while breeding habits and morphology of their preimaginal instars have remained almost entirely unknown. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were successfully adopted for the first documentation of morphology of eggs and first instar larvae of two species of Bengalia obtained in West Bengal, India. General egg morphology resembles the ground plan known from necrophagous blowflies, with similar form and structure of median area, hatching pleats and micropyle. The structure of the chorion, with subducted central parts of hexagons, is most similar to eggs of parasitic Pollenia and Rhinophoridae. Morphology of the first instar larvae of Bengalia is entirely different from known larvae of necrophagous blowflies. The complex anterior part of the cephaloskeleton in first instar Bengalia is unique within the Calyptratae, although the pseudocephalic sensory organs resemble those found in parasitic species of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae with a free-living first instar larva penetrating the soil environment. However, larval biology in Bengalia and in particular the function of their unique mouthhooks need further studies with an integrated field and laboratory approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPollenia 3aSarcophagidae 3aadults 3abreeding 3achorion 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aedaphic factors 3aeggs 3ahatching 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alight microscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asense organs 3aIndia 0aCalliphoridae 0aBengalia 0aMorphology 0aEgg 0aFirst instar 0aSEM 0aCLSM1 aSinha, Shuvra Kanti1 aPape, Thomas0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2016 July, v. 263 p.16-23dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010400159300001800263500002000281520141200301592002801713650003101741650001501772650001801787650001901805650001401824650001701838650001901855650001601874650001901890650001601909650001301925700001901938700002001957700002001977700002401997700001902021700001802040700001602058773015002074856007302224852000902297655001202306IND60594344720221119181234.0180511e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434472DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraga, Adelaide13aAn adsorptive bioprocess for production and recovery of resveratrol with Corynebacterium glutamicum  ap. 1661-1668.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The growing interest in polyphenols has led to the design of industrial‐scale processes able to produce them by fermentation and recover them in a more sustainable way. The goal of this work is to present two integrated approaches for the recovery of resveratrol, obtained through fermentation. The production of resveratrol using Corynebacterium glutamicum and its continuous removal using a hydrophobic resin is described. Batch production is compared with in situ product removal, where Amberlite XAD‐7HP is either directly added to the medium (direct adsorption) or is present in an external column (external adsorption). RESULTS: For both adsorption strategies tested, the amount of extracellular resveratrol increased from 75% to at least 90% of the total amount produced. However, lower total resveratrol concentrations were attained – 3.6 and 2.2 mg L‐¹, for the external and direct contact strategies, respectively, versus 5.3 mg L‐¹ for batch experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed in situ removal strategies demonstrated the potential of increasing the excretion of resveratrol produced intracellularly. These process configurations may not only lead to a simpler downstream process design, but also to the avoidance of potential problems with the toxicity of polyphenols to the cells, especially when larger titers are obtained. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aadsorption 3abioprocessing 3adirect contact 3aexcretion 3afermentation 3ahydrophobicity 3apolyphenols 3aprocess design 3aresveratrol 3atoxicity1 aSilva, Marcelo1 aOliveira, Joana1 aSilva, Ana Rita1 aFerreira, Patricia,1 aOttens, Marcel1 aRocha, Isabel1 aFaria, Nuno0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 93, no. 6 p.1661-1668dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011900163500001400282520191700296592002802213650003002241650001702271650000902288650001602297650002102313650002102334650001802355650002402373650003302397650001702430650001802447650001002465650001602475650001902491650001502510650001002525650002002535650001402555650001602569650001302585650001402598650002802612650001602640650001502656650002402671650001302695650001502708650001402723650001702737650001102754650001102765650001602776650001302792650001102805650001602816650001802832700002802850700002502878700002102903773011902924856007603043852000903119655001203128IND60711668620221121002001.0200928e20200905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071166862DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90912432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkendi, Adriana 10aAdvances on the Valorisation and Functionalization of By-Products and Wastes from Cereal-Based Processing Industry  aNAL-light  aCereals have been one of the major food resources for human diets and animal feed for thousands of years, and a large quantity of by-products is generated throughout the entire processing food chain, from farm to fork. These by-products mostly consist of the germ and outer layers (bran) derived from dry and wet milling of the grains, of the brewers’ spent grain generated in the brewing industry, or comprise other types obtained from the breadmaking and starch production industries. Cereal processing by-products are an excellent low-cost source of various compounds such as dietary fibres, proteins, carbohydrates and sugars, minerals and antioxidants (such as polyphenols and vitamins), among others. Often, they are downgraded and end up as waste or, in the best case, are used as animal feed or fertilizers. With the increase in world population coupled with the growing awareness about environmental sustainability and healthy life-styles and well-being, the interest of the industry and the global market to provide novel, sustainable and innovative solutions for the management of cereal-based by-products is also growing rapidly. In that respect, these promising materials can be valorised by applying various biotechnological techniques, thus leading to numerous economic and environmental advantages as well as important opportunities towards new product development (NPD) in the food and feed industry and other types such as chemical, packaging, nutraceutical (dietary supplements and food additives), cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. This review aims at giving a scientific overview of the potential and the latest advances on the valorisation of cereal-based by-products and wastes. We intended it to be a reference document for scientists, technicians and all those chasing new research topics and opportunities to explore cereal-based by-products through a circular economy approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aantioxidants 3abran 3abreadmaking 3abrewing industry 3acircular economy 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afarm to fork 3afeed industry 3afeeds 3afertilizers 3afood additives 3afood chain 3afoods 3ahuman nutrition 3amaterials 3amethodology 3aminerals 3apackaging 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolyphenols 3apopulation 3aproduct development 3aproteins 3ascientists 3asolutions 3aspent grains 3astarch 3asugars 3atechnicians 3avitamins 3awastes 3awet milling 3aworld markets1 aZinoviadou, Kyriaki  G.1 aPapageorgiou, Maria 1 aRocha, João  M.0 tFoods.g2020 Sept. 05, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90912433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009200168500001900260520145100279592002801730650002501758650002801783650001201811650001301823650002301836650002401859650002201883650000901905650001401914650002201928650001401950650001301964653001601977653001801993653001902011653001802030653003302048700001902081700001802100700001302118700005502131700006402186700001602250773010702266856008502373852000902458655001202467IND60713443620221119111554.0210114e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071344362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Zhi-Cong10aCadmium hyperaccumulation as an inexpensive metal armor against disease in Crofton weed  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvasive plants readily invade metal-contaminated areas. The hyperaccumulation of toxic heavy metals is not an uncommon feature among plant species. Although several hypotheses were proposed to explain this phenomenon, it is currently unclear how hyperaccumulation may benefit plants. The invasive Crofton weed (Ageratina adenophora) is a known hyperaccumulator of chromium and lead. We previously found that the species can also hyperaccumulate cadmium. The role of phytoaccumulation in defense to pathogen attack is unclear. We inoculated A. adenophora plants with a common generalist pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani) to test its resistance under cadmium treatment. We found evidence that cadmium hyperaccumulation reduced pathogen infection in A. adenophora. Our findings indicate elemental defense is highly cost efficient for hyperaccumulators inhabiting metal-contaminated sites, where plants were only modestly affected by cadmium. The reduction in pathogen damage conferred by cadmium was relatively high, particularly under lower cadmium levels. However, the benefits at higher levels may be capped. Elemental defense may be a key mechanism for plant invasion into polluted sites, especially in regions with widespread industrial activity. Our study highlights the importance of testing different metal concentrations when testing plant resistance and the importance of considering enemy attack when selecting plants for phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina adenophora 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3acadmium 3achromium 3acost effectiveness 3aecological invasion 3ahyperaccumulators 3alead 3apathogens 3aphytoaccumulation 3apollution 3atoxicity 0aHeavy metal 0aEnemy release 0aPlant pathogen 0aPlant defense 0aElemental defense hypothesis1 aCai, Hong-Hong1 aQi, Shan-Shan1 aLi, Jian1 aZhai, De-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5957-24821 aWan, Justin Siu Hung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3184-86831 aDu, Dao-Lin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Dec., v. 267 p.115649-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245016400167500001400331520153400345592002801879650002301907650001401930650001101944650002201955650001001977650001401987650001402001650001002015650003202025650002502057650001702082650001502099650001402114650004302128650002602171650001702197700001702214700002402231700002602255700002402281700001602305773011902321856007602440852000902516655001202525IND60711668820221121001953.0200928e20200907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071166882DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90912452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhalliyil, Pradheep12aA Real-Time Quantitative PCR Method Specific for Detection and Quantification of the First Commercialized Genome-Edited Plant [Erratum: February 2022, v.11(4)]  aNAL-light  aDiscussion regarding the regulatory status of genome-edited crops has focused on precision of editing and on doubts regarding the feasibility of analytical monitoring compliant with existing GMO regulations. Effective detection methods are important, both for regulatory enforcement and traceability in case of biosafety, environmental or socio-economic impacts. Here, we approach the analysis question for the first time in the laboratory and report the successful development of a quantitative PCR detection method for the first commercialized genome-edited crop, a canola with a single base pair edit conferring herbicide tolerance. The method is highly sensitive and specific (quantification limit, 0.05%), compatible with the standards of practice, equipment and expertise typical in GMO laboratories, and readily integrable into their analytical workflows, including use of the matrix approach. The method, validated by an independent laboratory, meets all legal requirements for GMO analytical methods in jurisdictions such as the EU, is consistent with ISO17025 accreditation standards and has been placed in the public domain. Having developed a qPCR method for the most challenging class of genome edits, single-nucleotide variants, this research suggests that qPCR-based method development may be applicable to virtually any genome-edited organism. This advance resolves doubts regarding the feasibility of extending the regulatory approach currently employed for recombinant DNA-based GMOs to genome-edited organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiosafety 3acanola 3acommercialization 3acrops 3adetection 3aequipment 3afoods 3agenetically modified plants 3aherbicide resistance 3alaboratories 3amonitoring 3aprecision 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asocioeconomic factors 3atraceability1 aIlves, Heini1 aKazakov, Sergei  A.1 aHoward, Stephanie  J.1 aJohnston, Brian  H.1 aFagan, John0 tFoods.g2020 Sept. 07, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90912453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245012800213506011700341506007600458520103600534592002801570506003701598650002201635650001501657650001501672650002401687650001101711650001701722650001601739650001701755650002201772650001301794650001701807653002901824653002301853653003001876653002901906700002201935700006101957700001502018700006402033773009302097856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60778849720221207101402.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarasenka, Natalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7902-793210aPhotoluminescent neodymium-doped ZnO nanocrystals prepared by laser ablation in solution for NIR-II fluorescence bioimaging  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe work reports on the use of laser ablation and post-ablation irradiation techniques for the preparation Nd³⁺ doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). The focus has been made on photoluminescence of Nd-doped ZnO NPs in the second near infrared (NIR-II) spectral window (1000–1700 nm) of the biological transparency. Morphology, phase composition and optical properties of the synthesized NPs were studied by absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. Near-infrared luminescence of Nd³⁺ doped ZnO nanocrystals in the region of 1000–1400 nm was detected both upon excitation from the ground state (800 nm) and upon UV excitation. The latter proves the incorporation of the Nd³⁺ into ZnO lattice as photoluminescence occurs through the transfer of excitation energy from the ZnO matrix to the Nd³⁺ ion. The possibility of control over the luminescence properties by a variation of solvent composition and by additional laser irradiation was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3abioimaging 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3airradiation 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 0aZinc oxide nanoparticles 0aDoped nanocrystals 0aLaser ablation in liquids 0aNIR-II photoluminescence1 aKornev, Vladislav1 aRamanenka, Andrei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6336-05781 aLi, Ruibin1 aTarasenko, Nikolaĭ,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2222-93890 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09554-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015600158520163500314592002801949650001401977650001201991650001102003650001502014650001002029650001002039700001902049700001802068773012802086856007402214852000902288655001202297IND60652661520221121181641.0190713e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065266152DNAL7 a10.3390/su101037972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang-Yun10aEvaluation of Progressive Collapse Resistance of Steel Moment Frames Designed with Different Connection Details Using Energy-Based Approximate Analysis  aThis study evaluates the progressive collapse resistance performance of steel moment frames, individually designed with different connection details. Welded unreinforced flange-bolted web (WUF-B) and reduced beam section (RBS) connections are selected and applied to ordinary moment frames designed as per the Korean Building Code (KBC) 2016. The 3-D steel frame systems are modeled using reduced models of 1-D and 2-D elements for beams, columns, connections, and composite slabs. Comparisons between the analyzed results of the reduced models and the experimental results are presented to verify the applicability of the models. Nonlinear static analyses of two prototype buildings with different connection details are conducted using the reduced models, and an energy-based approximate analysis is used to account for the dynamic effects associated with sudden column loss. The assessment on the structures was based on structural robustness and sensitivity methods using the alternative path method suggested in General Services Administration (GSA) 2003, in which column removal scenarios were performed and the bearing capacity of the initial structure with an undamaged column was calculated under gravity loads. According to the analytical results, the two prototype buildings satisfied the chord rotation criterion of GSA 2003. These results were expected since the composite slabs designed to withstand more than 3.3 times the required capacity had a significant effect on the stiffness of the entire structure. The RBS connections were found to be 14% less sensitive to progressive collapse compared to the WUF-B ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3agravity 3amodels 3aprototypes 3aslabs 3asteel1 aNoh, Sam-Young1 aLee, Dongkeun0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101037973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009500211506011700306506007600423520162700499592002802126506003702154650002802191650001802219650001802237650001902255650001702274650001602291650001802307650001002325651001002335653001102345653001902356653001602375653004102391700002002432700002402452700005802476700001802534700002002552700006302572773009302635856008602728852000902814655001202823IND60778849820221207101355.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdanero, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1168-213710aOral health status of 6- to 12-year-old children in Madrid, Spain: A cross-sectional study  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBased on the results of the 2015 oral health survey in Spain, the prevalence of untreated dental caries in temporary dentition, in the six-year cohort was 27,8%, and in the twelve-year cohort 14,6%. Due to the magnitude of the problem, the high health cost and the possibilities of prevention, monitoring the oral health status of the child population is extremely important, as it will allow the implementation of prevention and early care strategies. Objectives: To study the caries prevalence and malocclusion in the mixed dentition in children aged 6–12 years in Madrid, Spain. . Materials and methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study carried out in the city of Madrid during the 2018–2019 school year. Fifth year students of the European University of Madrid through health surveys, calibrated and supervised by the two main researchers, collected the data. The schoolchildren assessed were students from different schools in the city of Madrid, between 6 and 12 years old. According to WHO standards, data were collected in 2 months. Results: The total number of students examined was 303 students from 4 different schools in the community of Madrid. The prevalence of caries in our sample in the primary dentition was 45.21% with dmf> 0 and in the permanent dentition it was 23.7 % with a DMF> of 0. Conclusions: The oral health survey carried out in the sample shows a high prevalence of caries, as well as in the dmf and DMF indicators. Most of the children needed fluoride applications, so it would be interesting to evaluate which of them can be prevented with different public health projects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across-sectional studies 3adental caries 3ahealth status 3ahealth surveys 3amalocclusion 3aoral health 3apublic health 3ateeth 3aSpain 0aCaries 0aSchoolchildren 0aOral health 0aMalocclusion and epidemiology survey1 aBaquero, Lucía1 aBerasategui, María1 aVelayos, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3097-21481 aEspí, Miguel1 aPiñeiro, Marta1 aMiegimolle, Mónica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-57890 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09557-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245015200178300001600330506002800346520118700374592002801561506003701589650001501626650001201641650000701653650001301660650001101673653002901684653002701713653001901740653001601759653001401775700002701789700002101816773018601837856008302023852000902106655001202115IND60780032020221207054501.0220516e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078003202DNAL7 a10.14710/jksa.25.4.161-1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjunaidi, Muhammad Cholid10aSynthesis of Ionic Imprinted Membrane (IIM) Based on Sulfonated Polyeugenol for Selective Transport of Gold (III) Metal Ions from Motherboard Waste  ap. 161-168.  aResource is Open Access  aIonic imprinted membrane (IIM) was successfully synthesized using sulfonated polyeugenol, a derivative of eugenol as a functional polymer, with PVA as a base membrane and PEGDE as a crosslinker. IIM Au(III) is a membrane with an Au(III) ion template. This study aimed to determine the pH effect of a feed phase for selective transport of IIM Au(III), comparing it with a non-imprinted membrane (NIM) against Au3+ metal ions from motherboard waste. It also aimed to compare the membrane selectivity of Au3+ metal ions to Cu2+ metal ions, which are also found in motherboard waste. Gold samples were prepared using H(AuCl4) standard and leaching solutions from motherboard waste. The leaching of the motherboard used aqua regia and the assistance of a microwave to accelerate the leaching process. The optimum transport of Au3+ metal ions was when using IIM Au(III) at pH 3. This proved that the presence of a template affected IIM Au(III) to recognize Au(III) ions. IIM Au(III) showed higher selectivity than NIM, as evidenced by the percentage in the receiving phase of the Au3+ metal ions, which was more significant than the Cu2+ metal ions from the motherboard leaching solution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqua regia 3aeugenol 3apH 3apolymers 3awastes 0aionic imprinted membrane 0asulfonated polyeugenol 0agold metal ion 0amotherboard 0amicrowave1 aRahmayani, Fadjrin Nur1 akhabibi, Khabibi0 tJurnal Kimia Sains dan Aplikasi.g2022 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.161-168dChemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, Diponegoro UniversitywJournal:27751x2597-99147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.14710/jksa.25.4.161-1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245007800158500001400236520142500250592002801675650002201703650002201725650002201747650001701769650002201786650001601808650001401824651001001838700002001848700002101868773011801889856007602007852000902083655001202092IND60724496620221117163427.0210122e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072449662DNAL7 a10.3390/land100100582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chao 10aTracing Agricultural Land Transfer in China: Some Legal and Policy Issues  aNAL-light  aThis paper traces the evolution of land tenure changes in contemporary China since 1949. The transfer of land from peasant households to family farms and commercial sized units is on a vast scale and forms one of the greatest land reforms we have ever seen. The agrarian question forms both the policy and academic context in which this legislative account of land transfer is assessed and raises the question of whether land assembly in China resembles previous agricultural transformation policy and processes in industrialized countries or to what extent it has special characteristics of its own. The security of land holding in rural China, established with the household responsibility system, is seen to mature slowly over three to four periods of adjustment, always protecting the rights of peasants while improving conditions for increasing land productivity, resulting in an extension of the two rights of peasant holdings to three rights in the new millennium. The introduction of a third right, a land management right which is transferable from peasants to outsiders, has enabled a huge land assembly movement affecting millions of small holdings. This process of land tenure restructuring raises such questions as the consequences of the capitalization of agriculture, peasant land dispossession, proletarianization, and the prospect of a future land market in rural China, all topics for further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3aland markets 3aland productivity 3aland tenure 3apeasantry 3aChina1 aLiang, Yunjuan 1 aFuller, Anthony 0 tLand.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100100583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245015400164300001800318500002000336520144900356592002801805650002301833650001301856650001901869650001501888650001701903650002201920650001901942650000901961650001301970650001401983650000701997650001902004650001802023650001502041650002402056650001802080650002102098650001302119700002302132700002102155773015002176856007302326852000902399655001202408IND60594345120221122051121.0180511e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434512DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsoumachidou, Sophia10aHeterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic degradation of psychoactive drug Fluvoxamine: kinetic study, inorganic ions and phytotoxicity evaluation  ap. 1705-1713.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Pharmaceutically active compounds, emerging extensively in ecosystems as pollutants, have become an important environmental and public health issue, since they can contaminate drinking water and pose threats to wildlife and human health. As a result, efforts should be made to develop methods to inactivate or eliminate this class of substance in the environment. RESULTS: The photocatalytic degradation of psychoactive drug Fluvoxamine has been investigated. In the case of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation, the effect of TiO₂ P25 concentration (0.1–1 g L‐¹), initial concentration of H₂O₂ (0.25–0.2 g L‐¹) and Fe³⁺ (0.00175–0.014 g L‐¹) and pH of the solution on initial reaction rates were evaluated, while for homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation the effect of the amount of H₂O₂ (0.25–0.2 g L‐¹) and Fe³⁺ (0.00175–0.014 g L‐¹) were investigated. In addition, the conversion of the heteroatoms in the FVX molecule to inorganic ions (NO₃‐, NH₄⁺, F‐) during the photocatalytic process has been observed and phytotoxicity testing, using three plant species, was carried out in order to examine the effect of photocatalytic oxidation on the toxicity of FVX. CONCLUSION: According to the results presented in this study, both heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation is an efficient methodology for FVX degradation. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aammonium 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainorganic ions 3airon 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphytotoxicity 3apollutants 3apsychotropic agents 3apublic health 3atitanium dioxide 3awildlife1 aKouras, Athanasios1 aPoulios, Ioannis0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 93, no. 6 p.1705-1713dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013000164500001900294520188500313592002802198650003102226650002902257650001102286650002002297650000902317650000902326650001702335650002802352650002302380650002302403650001502426651001002441653002002451653001302471653001402484653001102498700001502509700001602524700001502540700001202555700001202567700001202579773011602591856008402707852000902791655001202800IND60714993320221119003036.0210506e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071499332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aSpatial-temporal trends of rainfall erosivity and its implication for sustainable agriculture in the Wei River Basin of China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater and soil are important natural resources for agricultural development. Soil erosion is a worldwide problem threatening sustainable agriculture development. Rainfall is one of the major natural factors that cause soil erosion. The study of the spatial distribution and temporal trends of rainfall erosivity is practical and important for the assessment of soil erosion hazards, the planning of soil and water conservation measures, and the sustainable agriculture development. In this study, the data of daily rainfall in the Wei River Basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected, the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of rainfall and rainfall erosivity were analyzed. The results show that the regional mean annual rainfall varies from 315.0 to 807.3 mm, which shows an increasing spatial trend from northwest to southeast. The mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin ranges from 751.4 to 2600.0 MJ⋅mm⋅hm-2⋅h-1, which has a similar pattern of spatial distribution as the rainfall. The monthly rainfall erosivity changing pattern is a single-peak type. High erosivity of rainfall was mainly observed from July to September. The peaks mostly occur in July and August. The temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity ranges from −6.6–10.1 MJ⋅mm⋅hm-2⋅h-1 per year, the Loess Plateau and the Qinling Mountains in the southern basin show an increasing trend, and the surroundings of Xifeng, Changwu and Huanxian have the statistical significance of P < 0.05. In the midstream and downstream of the basin and the Guanzhong Plain, the rainfall erosivity shows an insignificant decreasing trend. The North Atlantic Oscillation obviously influences the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades. The study results may helpful for the scientific management, soil erosion prevention and sustainable agricultural development of the Wei River Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aagricultural development 3abasins 3aerosion control 3arain 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asustainable agriculture 3atemporal variation 3awater conservation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aWei river basin 0aRainfall 0aErosivity 0aTrends1 aChao, Yang1 aFan, Ruirui1 aRen, Feier1 aQi, Bin1 aJi, Kai1 aXu, Bin0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 245 p.106557-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012800169300001800297520134500315592002801660650002201688650001201710650002301722700003001745700002201775700002701797700002101824700006301845700002801908700005701936700005801993700006302051700006202114700006102176773013602237856008002373852000902453655001202462IND60746866520220217000000.0210806e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c050822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalán, Laura Abad10aExploring the Concept of Dimerization-Induced Intersystem Crossing: At the Origins of Spin–Orbit Coupling Selection Rules  ap. 8572-8580.  aSinglet–triplet interconversions (intersystem crossing, ISC) in organic molecules are at the basis of many important processes in cutting-edge photonic applications (organic light-emitting devices, photodynamic therapy, etc.). Selection rules for these transitions are mainly governed by the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) phenomenon. Although the SOC relies on complex relativistic phenomena, theoreticians have, with time, developed increasingly sophisticated and efficient approaches to gain access to a satisfactory evaluation of its magnitude. However, recent works have highlighted the remarkable and somehow unexpected efficiency of dimers of small conjugated molecules in terms of ISC quantum yields, whose origin has not been completely investigated. In this work, we bring a coupled experimental and theoretical analysis of the origin of the unusually large ISC efficiency on a series of such dimers that differ by their nature (covalent or supramolecular). We show that considering the dynamical nature of the SOC, and especially its dependence on angular orientations between the dimer subunits sometimes overlooked in the literature, it is necessary to rationalize some counterintuitive experimental observations. This combined experimental and theoretical work paves the way for new molecular engineering rules for SOC control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotons 3aphysical chemistry1 aAndrés Castán, José M.1 aDalinot, Clément1 aMarqués, Pablo Simón1 aGaliana, Joachim1 aBlanchard, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9408-81081 aAndraud, C.q(Chantal),1 aDumont, Elise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2359-111X1 aMaury, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4639-643X1 aCabanetos, Clément1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3781-887X1 aMonnereau, Cyrille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8928-24161 aLe Bahers, Tangui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2166-081X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 22, v. 125, no. 30 p.8572-8580dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c050823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005900167300001600226520087500242592002801117650001501145650002501160650001001185650001301195650001201208650001601220650001201236650001501248650003101263650001901294700002601313700002301339773009101362856008101453990002301534852000901557655001201566IND60113490020221119141114.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011349002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamileri, Irene10aNucleotide excision repair: new tricks with old bricks  ap. 566-573.  aNucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major DNA repair pathway that ensures that the genome remains functionally intact and is faithfully transmitted to progeny. However, defects in NER lead, in addition to cancer and aging, to developmental abnormalities whose clinical heterogeneity and varying severity cannot be fully explained by the DNA repair deficiencies. Recent work has revealed that proteins in NER play distinct roles, including some that go well beyond DNA repair. NER factors are components of protein complexes known to be involved in nucleosome remodeling, histone ubiquitination, and transcriptional activation of genes involved in nuclear receptor signaling, stem cell reprogramming, and postnatal mammalian growth. Together, these findings add new pieces to the puzzle for understanding NER and the relevance of NER defects in development and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aabnormal development 3agenes 3ahistones 3amammals 3anucleosomes 3aprogeny 3astem cells 3atranscriptional activation 3aubiquitination1 aKarakasilioti, Ismene1 aGarinis, George A.0 tTrends in genetics.g2012 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.566-573dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245010500211300001800316520104400334592002801378650001501406650001301421650002601434650002301460650001801483700006101501773013601562856008001698852000901778655001201787IND60746866820221120184118.0210806e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c054382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaulkner, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5142-810910aPredicting the Membrane Permeability of Fentanyl and Its Analogues by Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 8443-8449.  aThe lipid membrane is considered a crucial component of opioid general anesthesia. The main drug used for the induction and maintenance of opioid anesthesia is fentanyl and its various analogues. However, these drugs have different clinical effects, and detailed atomic-level insight into the drug–membrane interactions could lead to a better understanding how these drugs exert their anesthetic properties. In this study, we have used extensive umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to study the permeation process of fentanyl and three of its analogues into a variety of simple phospholipid membrane models. Our simulations show that we can accurately predict the permeability coefficients of these drug molecules, which is an important process in understanding how pharmaceuticals reach their molecular targets. We were also able to show that one phospholipid provides more accurate predictions than other lipids commonly used in these types of permeation studies, which will aid future studies of these types of processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3afentanyl 3amembrane permeability 3amolecular dynamics 3aphospholipids1 ade Leeuw, Nora H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8271-05450 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 125, no. 30 p.8443-8449dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c054383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006100173520105000234592002801284650001601312650001301328650001201341650001301353653001301366653001701379653002101396653001801417653002101435653001601456700001701472700005801489700002801547773010801575856008601683852000901769655001201778IND60718219620221120224641.0220606e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071821962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1174142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Zohreh10aChitosan as a machine for biomolecule delivery: A review  aThe major role of biomolecules in treatment of different diseases has been proven by several studies.

In this regard, many polymeric vehicles have been introduced for protecting and delivery of biomolecules to the target site. Chitosan as a unique biopolymer with special properties has been widely used for biomolecule delivery. Several research groups have focused on developing and applying of chitosan as a versatile machine in biomolecule delivery. In this review the unique properties of chitosan have been discussed at first and then its application as a delivery machine for different types of biomolecules include protein and peptides, nucleic acids and vaccines has been considered. Furthermore, the targeting approach by conjugation of various ligands to the chitosan and also the current challenges for development of chitosan vehicles will be discussed for biomolecule delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3aligands 3apeptides 0aChitosan 0aBiomolecules 0aProtein delivery 0aGene delivery 0aVaccine delivery 0aBio-polymer1 aEini, Maryam1 aRastegari, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7365-35341 aTehrani, Morteza Rafiee0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 256 p.117414-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1174143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013400170300001800304520168900322592002802011596008102039596013702120596009302257596011002350650001402460650001302474650001902487650002002506650002302526650001602549700005602565773011402621856008502735852000902820655001202829IND60786080420221123044107.0220802e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorbora, Angana10aDesign of a Super-Liquid Crystal-Phobic Coating for Immobilizing Liquid Crystal μ-Droplets─Without Affecting Their Sensitivity  ap. 9221-9228.  aThe aqueous interface of nematic liquid crystal (LC) that undergoes a triggered change in ordering transition of mesogens under an appropriate stimulus has emerged as an important tool for various relevant applications. Further, the confinement of LC into a micrometer dimension appeared to be a facile approach for improving their relevant features and performance. However, the optical characterization of ordering transition in a single micrometer-sized, bare, and free-floating LC droplet in the aqueous phase is an extremely challenging task due to unavoidable Brownian motion, which limits its scope for practical applications. Here, we exploited the 1,4-conjugate addition reaction to report a multilayer coating of a reactive nanocomplex that displayed an extreme repellence to beaded LC droplets with tailored adhesive force through the association of adequate orthogonal chemical modifications with glucamine and selected alkyl acrylates. Further, a spatially selective underwater adhesive super-LC-phobic pattern on a hydrophobic background was developed for immobilizing bare and micrometer-sized LC droplets from their aqueous dispersion without having any arbitrary spillage of the aqueous medium. The settled micrometer-sized LC droplets remained efficient for the triggered change in ordering transition from bipolar (having boojum defects at poles) to radial (with a single defect in the center) configuration. Eventually, a simple and fundamentally distinct chemical strategy of immobilizing a soft and functional material by associating bio-inspired wettability allowed to demonstrate the repetitive triggered LC ordering transition in a single and bare LC droplet.  aPublisher supplied data  a1216042cAlexander von Humboldt-Stiftungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005156  aBT/PR45283/NER/95/1919/2022cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001407  aNAcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001412  a5(1)/2021-NANOcMinistry of Electronics and Information technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008628 3aacrylates 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid crystals 3aoptical properties 3awettability1 aManna, Uttam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3204-158X0 tLangmuir.g2022 June 29, v. 38, no. 30 p.9221-9228dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009800174300001800272520202300290592002802313650002002341650001702361650002402378650002402402650002602426650002302452650002802475650002302503650001502526650002202541650002002563650002202583650001002605650001502615651001102630651001602641700001902657700002302676700004402699700002102743773011602764856008102880852000902961655001202970IND60580074120221120150704.0170908e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058007412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1461-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Jacqueline A.10aHome and away: biogeographical comparison of species diversity in Thymus vulgaris communities  ap. 2533-2542.  aWe examined the effects of Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) on associated vegetation in both its native and introduced range. We compared local (within-community) and landscape (among-community) species richness and community composition between thyme-dominated communities in France (native range) and New Zealand (introduced range). From 7 native sites (France) and 10 introduced sites (New Zealand), all plant species present in 20 (New Zealand, 25 in France) randomly placed 100 cm × 50 cm quadrats were recorded. Local species richness was determined by calculating mean species richness/quadrat inside and outside thyme-dominated plant communities and tested for significance with the factors of range and across sites. Landscape scale differences were determined by comparing total species richness inside and outside thyme communities across all sites from both ranges. Species differences between native and introduced thyme communities were analysed using similarity percentages. We found native range microenvironments with thyme harbour more species than microenvironments without thyme and this pattern was reversed in the introduced range with thyme decreasing local species richness. A higher percentage of shared species occurred both with and without thyme in the native range compared to the introduced range. In both ranges and across all sites (except for one) species composition of thyme-associated plant communities differed from communities without thyme. Native plant communities with thyme were more similar in species composition than plant communities without thyme, but in the introduced range species composition was most similar in plant communities without thyme. These results suggest thyme’s ecosystem engineering consequences are context-dependent. Thyme may filter out competitive species that could negatively impact local species richness in its native range, but when introduced to a disturbed landscape in a novel biogeographic region, thyme reduces local species richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThymus vulgaris 3abiogeography 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3aecosystem engineering 3aindigenous species 3ainterspecific variation 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3aspecies diversity 3athyme 3avegetation 3aFrance 3aNew Zealand1 aGrøndahl, Eva1 aCallaway, Ragan M.1 aDickinson, K.

In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences), Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present. There is an urgent need to set up conservation strategies for the endangered plants found in these shrinking habitats on the Pacific islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPouteria 3aSantalum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aartificial intelligence 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aendangered species 3aequipment 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3amodels 3aoverstory 3aplants (botany) 3aprediction 3arare species 3aremote sensing 3aFrench Polynesia1 aMeyer, J.-Y.q(Jean-Yves),1 aTaputuarai, Ravahere1 aStoll, BenoÃ®t0 tEcological informatics.g2012 May, v. 9 p.37-46dElsevier B.V.x1574-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013400176520180100310592002802111650001602139650003202155650001902187650002002206650001802226650001702244650004102261650002102302650002602323650002902349650001602378650002402394650001102418650001502429653003402444653001702478653002002495700002202515700001602537700001902553700002702572700002002599700001902619700002902638773011202667856008602779852000902865655001202874IND60654522320221120191121.0190801e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Ricardo,10aMulti-residue method for enantioseparation of psychoactive substances and beta blockers by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  aCurrently, consumption of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals has increased significantly. Many of these substances are chiral and can be available as racemates or enantiomerically pure. Determination of the enantiomeric fraction (EF) in wastewater is useful for: i) distinguishing between the consumption of prescribed and illicit drugs; ii) identification of possible local of illegal synthesis; iii) illegal discharge of sewage and estimation of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals consumption by a community (wastewater-based epidemiology). This work describes the development of an indirect method by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) for enantiomeric quantification of chiral substances namely psychoactive drugs and β-blockers based on the formation of diastereomers using (R)-(−)-α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride ((R)-MTPA-Cl) as chiral derivatization reagent. The developed method presented linearity (R2 > 0.99) for 20 compounds, 9 diastereomer pairs and paroxetine (PAR) and sertraline (SER). Recovery ranged from 80.7 to 114.5% (RSD < 9.1%) and accuracy between 84.6 and 118% (RSD < 9.9%). The limits of detection (LOD) varied from 0.03 and 26.0 ngL−1 and limits of quantification (LOQ) from 0.15 and 104 ngL−1. Results showed the occurrence of amphetamine (AMP), illicit drugs as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (MAMP), alprenolol (ALP), norfluoxetine (NFLX), (SER), metoprolol (MET) and propranolol (PHO) at concentrations ranging from 21.7 ngL−1 (MDMA) to 622 ngL−1 (PHO). Measured concentrations were used to estimate the drug loads of the target chiral substances in a specific population. The EF was determined providing valuable information about the consumption and origin of the target drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphetamine 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adiastereomers 3aepidemiology 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amethamphetamines 3amultiresidue analysis 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apropranolol 3apsychotropic agents 3asewage 3awastewater 0aWastewater-based epidemiology 0aChiral drugs 0aPharmaceuticals1 aRibeiro, Claudia,1 aCravo, Sara1 aCunha, Sara C.1 aPereira, José Augusto1 aFernandes, J.O.1 aAfonso, Carlos1 aTiritan, Maria Elizabeth0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 1125 p.121731-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1217313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168300001800310520098000328592002801308650002101336650001401357650001901371650002201390650002001412650001101432650001201443650000901455700001401464700001701478700001201495700001601507700001701523700001601540773009801556856008501654852000901739655001201748IND60087924720221122011233.0141102e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008792472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zongquan10aChanges of anionic groups in alkaline peroxide-impregnated aspen chemithermomechanical pulp during subsequent alkaline peroxide bleaching  ap. 1041-1046.  aThe effect of alkaline peroxide bleaching on the total anionic groups (AGs) and surface AGs in aspen chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) fibers was investigated. Alkaline treatment, especially alkaline peroxide bleaching resulted in the formation of new AGs and surface AGs in the CTMP fibers. The carboxylic groups in uronic acid units, including 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid units were the main contributors to the AGs in the fibers. However, the oxidized lignin accounting for more than 30% of the total AGs in the bleached CTMP fibers, was the main origin of the new AGs formed during the peroxide bleaching. In addition, the new AGs were also formed by extensive deesterification of the residual esterified uronic acids in pectins and lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). Although some uronic acid units were dissolved in the process water, both the total AGs and surface AGs in the fibers increased after alkaline peroxide bleaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali treatment 3ableaching 3aesterification 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucuronic acid 3alignin 3apectins 3apulp1 aQin, Ying1 aQin, Menghua1 aLiu, Na1 aXu, Qinghua1 aFu, Yingjuan1 aYuan, Zaiwu0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 88, no. 3 p.1041-1046dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245014200161500001900303520211200322592002802434650002802462650001702490650001302507650001202520650001202532650001502544650002202559650002102581651001002602653003402612653001802646653001702664653002202681653002102703700001202724700001202736700001202748700001302760773011602773856008402889852000902973655001202982IND60714993820221119002701.0210506e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071499382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Z.10aNew indexes to evaluate the effect of segmental variations of distributed ditches on their pollutant retention in agricultural landscapes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDistributed drainage ditches and ponds in agricultural landscape can reduce chemicals export from farmlands; their distributed features, however, result in variations in pollutant removal capacities among different segments. In this paper, we proposed three descriptive indexes to characterize segmental variations of distributed ditches and ponds systems: a size index (α - segmental size vs. system size) to represent the static feature of the system, a flow index (β - segmental flow rate vs. system flow rate) and an initial concentration index (γ - segmental inflow concentration vs. initial field drainage concentration) to represent the dynamic feature of the system. Subsequently, a segmental efficiency indicator (η) was derived from these indexes to represent the pollutant removal differences calculated with and without considering segmental variations of distributed ditch systems. The proposed indexes were tested with two hypothetic ditch layouts first, and then applied to a case study site where 18 segments of ditches and ponds are distributed around paddy fields in southeastern China. The two hypothetical layouts include a ‘slender’ distribution and a ‘square’ distribution of ditches; both have the same number of identical segments and serve the same area. The ‘slender’ layout represents more spread distributions while the ‘square’ layout represents more concentrated systems. Calculated indexes showed that the ‘slender’ layout produced greater segmental variations than the ‘square’ layout. For the case study, the calculated size index and the flow index varied greatly due to segmental size differences and the complex flow connections. This in turn led to greater variation in the pollutant removal efficiencies (η), ranging from 0.021 to 0.63 for low removal rate, and 0.021–0.42 for high removal rate. The results indicate that the proposed indexes can be used to examine the variable nature of the distributed ditch systems and help provide technical guidance for proper management of the distributed buffer systems in agricultural landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural landscapes 3acase studies 3adrainage 3aexports 3apaddies 3apollutants 3apollution control 3awater management 3aChina 0aDistributed ditch/pond system 0aDynamic index 0aStatic index 0aPollutant removal 0aSystem variation1 aYin, X.1 aLuo, W.1 aZou, J.1 aChen, C.0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 245 p.106567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300002000294520121100314592002801525650002501553650001801578650002401596650001301620650001201633650002101645650002001666650001601686650002001702650001001722650001601732650001801748650002301766650001701789650001101806650002001817650001701837700001601854700001601870700001701886700001601903773012401919856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60666983320221122073921.0190919e20150123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066698332DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11371c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Runqiang10aCalcium mitigates the stress caused by ZnSO₄ as a sulphur fertilizer and enhances the sulforaphane formation of broccoli sprouts  ap. 12563-12570.  aIn order to improve the growth condition of broccoli sprouts under ZnSO₄ application, exogenous CaCl₂ was added in the cultural medium, and the growth profiles, key bioactive substances (glucosinolates, sulforaphane, ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds), antioxidant capacity, myrosinase activity and related genes expression of the broccoli sprouts were evaluated. Results showed that the stressful condition caused by ZnSO₄ was effectively mitigated by CaCl₂. Consequently, ascorbic acid and the total phenolics content as well as the antioxidant capacity of the broccoli sprouts decreased compared with that of the sole ZnSO₄ treatment. However, sulforaphane formation increased because a higher glucoraphanin content, myrosinase activity and related gene expression was induced after the CaCl₂ treatment. The glucoraphanin content and sulforaphane formation of the water-treated sprouts decreased steadily during germination. However, the sulforaphane formation of the sprouts treated with ZnSO₄ plus CaCl₂ increased after germinating for 2 days. These results suggest that CaCl₂ could mitigate the stress caused by ZnSO₄ and enhance the sulforaphane formation of broccoli sprouts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3abroccoli 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizers 3agene expression 3agenes 3agermination 3aglucoraphanin 3aphenolic compounds 3asulforaphane 3asulfur 3athioglucosidase 3azinc sulfate1 aGuo, Liping1 aZhou, Yulin1 aShen, Zhang,1 aGu, Zhenxin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 23, v. 5, no. 17 p.12563-12570dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra11371c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010800163300002000271520184900291592002802140650001502168650001102183650001102194650001102205650002302216650001702239650001602256700002202272700002802294700005802322773013802380856008002518852000902598655001202607IND60746867220220217000000.0210806e20210726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c017962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingfeng10aPoint Defects and Related Excess Electrons in the Dielectric Profile of the Reduced TiO₂(110) Surface  ap. 16652-16663.  aThe dielectric behavior of the reduced TiO₂(110) rutile surface has been explored by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy as a function of oxygen exposure, temperature, and crystal orientation (dielectric anisotropy) to highlight at once the electrical transport of excess electrons and the associated band gap states (BGS) and to establish a dielectric model that encompasses the surface region as a whole. Never explored distribution profiles were determined in two steps: charge carriers and then defects themselves. First, surface and bulk carrier excitations were directly evidenced by the temperature-dependent broadening of the quasi-elastic peak and changes in loss features, which legitimates fits via a previous dielectric model accounting for phonons, interband transitions, plasmon excitations, and BGS. The density profile of excess electrons, involving a dead zone, a rich subsurface, and a lower bulk concentration was quantitatively optimized. Surface/bulk concentrations and donor/Fermi levels match tabulated values. In a second step, three types of defects were distinguished, i.e., Ob(vac), surface Tiᵢₙₜ, and bulk Tiᵢₙₜ thanks to changes in surface/bulk plasmon and BGS strengths upon oxygen exposure of the reduced surface. Each of them exhibits a specific behavior. While the surface conductivity requires the presence of Ob(vac), both Ob(vac) and surface Tiᵢₙₜ participate in surface reactions, and all three species contribute to band bending which evidence that defects, alone or by cross influences, shape the location and the properties of excess electrons. Making it crucial to take into account the fact, often overlooked, that excess electrons do not behave independently of their source, the finding suggests studying defects taken individually or within controlled combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aenergy 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aChenot, Stéphane1 aJupille, J.q(Jacques),1 aLazzari, Rémi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2354-19530 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 26, v. 125, no. 30 p.16652-16663dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c017963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009500163300001800258520175000276592002802026650002702054650001302081650001502094650002702109650001302136650001902149650001902168650002302187650001302210650001802223650003202241650001702273700002002290700006102310700006102371700005602432700005802488700006002546773011402606856008502720852000902805655001202814IND60786080820221123042559.0220802e20220723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu10aEffect of Surface Hydrophobicity on the Adsorption of a Pilus-Derived Adhesin-like Peptide  ap. 9257-9265.  aBacterial colonization of abiotic surfaces such as those of medical implants, membrane filters, and everyday household items is a process of tremendous importance for public health. Bacteria use adhesive cell surface structures called adhesins to establish contact with abiotic surfaces. Among them, protein filaments called type IV pili are particularly important and found in many Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Understanding the interaction of such adhesin proteins with different abiotic surfaces at the molecular level thus represents a fundamental prerequisite for impeding bacterial colonization and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. In this work, we investigate the interaction of a synthetic adhesin-like peptide, PAK128-144ox, derived from the type IV pilus of P. aeruginosa with hydrophilic and hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and spectroscopic investigations, we find that PAK128-144ox has a higher affinity for hydrophobic than for hydrophilic surfaces. Additionally, PAK128-144ox adsorption on the hydrophobic SAM is furthermore accompanied by a strong increase in α-helix content. Our results show a clear influence of surface hydrophobicity and further indicate that PAK128-144ox adsorption on the hydrophobic surface is enthalpically favored, while on the hydrophilic surface, entropic contributions are more significant. However, our spectroscopic investigations also suggest aggregation of the peptide under the employed experimental conditions, which is not considered in the MD simulations and should be addressed in more detail in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadhesins 3aadsorption 3abacterial colonization 3afimbriae 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3apublic health 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3aspectroscopy1 aHuang, Jingyuan1 aDornbusch, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3635-46901 aGrundmeier, Guido1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2755-65141 aFahmy, Karim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8752-58241 aKeller, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7139-31101 aCheung, David L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3994-22950 tLangmuir.g2022 July 23, v. 38, no. 30 p.9257-9265dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008600167300001800253520095600271592002801227650001301255650002101268650001301289650001701302650001801319650001201337650001801349650001801367650000701385650002201392700001701414773009801431856008501529852000901614655001201623IND60087924920221122011117.0141102e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008792492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.01.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Atif10aControlled delivery of drug from pH sensitive chitosan/poly (vinyl alcohol) blend  ap. 1055-1060.  aThe blends of chitosan (CS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) react with tetraethoxy silane (TEOS) to give network structure and their selective crosslinking give hydrogel properties. The swelling properties against different media are changed by varying the amount of PVA in CS/PVA blend. The degree of swelling in water is decreased with increasing amount of PVA. The most significant behavior of these blends is their response against pH, exhibiting low swelling in acidic and basic pH conditions and maximum swelling at neutral pH. This unique behavior along with the biocompatibility of the components made them suitable for oral delivery of enzymes and medicines. Dexamethasone has been selected as a model drug.

An oxidized Pd/Al₂O₃ catalyst was reduced by using H₂-saturated cyclohexane at 70 °C, and reduction was followed in real time by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), high-energy X-ray diffraction (XRD), and quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to obtain the perspective from different materials properties. We show that dynamic Pd speciation changes can be monitored during reduction in the liquid phase. XRD and XAS indicated that the isothermal PdO reduction passes through an intermediate Pd⁰ phase toward the formation of a well-defined Pd hydride phase. Based on the different sensitivities of the two techniques, XRD suggested that the process ends with a dominant Pd hydride phase, while XAS revealed an equal proportion of Pd⁰ and Pd hydride. The time-resolved XAS data suggested that the isothermal reduction of PdO in cyclohexane to Pd⁰ occurs through a nucleation mechanism and that Pd⁰ is rapidly converted into the hydride phase according to a contracting sphere model. The identification and the presence of a mixed Pd⁰/PdHₓ phase appears crucial in view of the relevance of these species in for instance hydrogenation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acyclohexanes 3ahydrides 3ahydrogenation 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aliquids 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aAlxneit, Ivo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9389-98491 aClark, Adam H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5478-96391 aChecchia, Stefano1 aDi Michiel, Marco1 aKröcher, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7268-72571 aNachtegaal, Maarten1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1895-96261 aFerri, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9354-52310 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 16, v. 125, no. 30 p.16473-16482dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c018823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245014400180300001800324520115700342592002801499650001201527650003101539650002001570650001701590650002201607650001801629650001901647650001401666650001701680650001801697650002801715650001601743650001201759650001601771700001801787700002001805700002301825700001901848700001701867773008701884856009001971852000902061655001202070IND60090348620221116234954.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009034862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwarnakar, Nitin K.10aOral bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy and reactive oxygen species scavenging properties of coenzyme Q10-loaded polymeric nanoparticles  ap. 6860-6874.  aThe present investigation consists in the development and characterization of CoQ10 loaded PLGA nanoparticles (CoQ10-NPs, size < 100 nm) by a scalable emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. Thermal and crystallinity analysis collectively corroborated that CoQ10 was entrapped into the NPs in amorphous form. The lyophilized CoQ10-NPs were found to be stable for a period of 6 months (at room temperature). In vitro cell culture studies indicated that CoQ10-NPs significantly quenched ROS with nearly 10 fold higher efficacy than free CoQ10. Further, positively charged CoQ10-NPs were localized in two major sources of ROS generation: mitochondria and lysosomes. CoQ10-NPs showed improved oral bioavailability (4.28 times) as compared to free CoQ10. Finally remarkably higher hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory activity of CoQ10-NPs as compared to free CoQ10 was observed due to mitigation of deleterious effects associated with the generation of free radicals. As elucidated by live noninvasive animal imaging, the higher anti-inflammatory activity of CoQ10-NPs can be attributed to significant accumulation of these NPs in the inflamed tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioavailability 3acell culture 3acrystal structure 3afreeze drying 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amitochondria 3ananoparticles 3areactive oxygen species 3atemperature 3atissues 3aubiquinones1 aJain, Amit K.1 aSingh, Raman P.1 aGodugu, Chandraiah1 aDas, Manasmita1 aJain, Sanyog0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Oct., v. 32, no. 28 p.6860-6874dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012300172500001900295520210200314592002802416650002002444650002202464650001502486650002202501650002102523650002302544651000902567653002202576653003402598653002602632653002802658653002102686700003102707700002202738773011602760856008402876852000902960655001202969IND60714994220221119002653.0210506e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071499422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaghazchi, Afsaneh10aSimulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery systems with a Hybrid Bayesian network model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRegular appraisal performance of the irrigation water distribution systems from the adequacy, equity, and sustainable operation perspectives are essential due to the significant water losses that has been led by the improper adjustments of the hydraulic structures. Appropriate operational strategies could be adapted when the irrigation district authorities have a pragmatic approach to assess the hydraulic behavior of the system. This study develops an intelligent model for i) hydraulic simulation and ii) operational performance evaluation of the agricultural water distribution systems by employing a Hybrid Bayesian Networks (HBNs). The developed model was tested on a real test case located in Iran and under the different operational scenarios. In this regard, firstly, a hydrodynamic model of the test case was developed, calibrated, and validated to simulate the hydraulic condition of the irrigation canal based on a wide range of the canal inflow variations, called operational scenarios. Then, performance assessment was conducted for the scenarios based on adequacy, equity, and efficiency of water distribution perspectives. The results were employed for the training of the HBNs model. The HBNs model configuration was selected based on the irrigation district manages expectations, where the performance indicators of "adequacy," "efficiency" and "equity" of water delivery, needs to be calculated for the canal inflow variations in different operational scenarios. Validation of the developed HBNs model reveals that Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Coefficient of Determination (R²) of the superior model within the entire output nodes are 17.31% and 0.96, respectively. The results indicated the ability of the HBNs Model for the "Simulation/Performance Appraisal" of any operating systems in the irrigation districts. The developed model is a useful tool for i) periodic appraisal performance of the distribution system, ii) operational personals and ditch-riders, and iii) regionalization of the district to facilitate the recurrent inspections and field visiting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3airrigation canals 3airrigation water 3awater distribution 3aIran 0aIntelligent model 0aWater distribution simulation 0aPerformance appraisal 0aHybrid Bayesian network 0aSurrogate models1 aHashemy Shahdany, S.

The effect of this pollutant on O. anthropi DE2010 has been studied assessing changes in viability and biomass, sorption yields and removal efficiencies. Furthermore, and for the first time, its capacity for immobilizing Cr(III) from culture media was tested by a combination of High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging coupled to Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).The results showed that O. anthropi DE2010 was grown optimally at 0–2 mM Cr(III). On the other hand, from 2 to 10 mM Cr(III) microbial plate counts, growth rates, cell viability, and biomass decreased while extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production increases. Furthermore, this bacterium had a great ability to remove Cr(III) at 10 mM (q = 950.00 mg g−1) immobilizing it mostly in bright polyphosphate inclusions and secondarily on the cellular surface at the EPS level. Based on these results, O. anthropi DE2010 could be considered as a potential agent for bioremediation in Cr(III) contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchrobactrum anthropi 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acell viability 3achromium 3aculture media 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aimage analysis 3aplate count 3apollutants 3apolymers 3asorption 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aOchrobactrum anthropi DE2010 0aCLSM 0aICP-OES 0aHAADF-STEM EDX 0aPolyphosphate inclusions1 aBallesteros, Belén1 aObiol, Aleix1 aMillach, Laia1 aEsteve, Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3703-4362 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3703-43621 aSolé, Antonio0 tChemosphere.g2020 Jan., v. 238dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017600170300001800346520077400364592002801138596011601166650001401282650001501296650000801311650001001319650004301329650001201372650001301384650002501397700002401422700002701446700002201473700006001495700006001555773011401615856008501729852000901814655001201823IND60786081120221120163813.0220802e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Hoang, Phuc10aCrucial Role of Surfactants in Improving the Extraction Efficiency of β-Amyrin from Dischidia major Using Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction Coupled with Gas Bubble Flotation  ap. 9285-9293.  aUltrasound-assisted extraction coupled with gas bubble flotation was developed as a green method for extracting β-amyrin fromDischidia major. The solvent system was water:ethanol (9:1). To improve the adsorption of β-amyrin onto the air/liquid interface during flotation, surfactants were employed; however, the positive effect was only observed with cationic surfactants. High-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric detection (HPLC-PDA) was, for the first time, applied to quantify the β-amyrin content in D. major and its extracts. With the assistance of surfactants, the foam layer collected from flotation showed high selectivity toward β-amyrin. The product content was notably increased after surfactants had been removed from the solution.  aPublisher supplied data  a106.02.2018.315cNational Foundation for Science and Technology Developmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007224 3aDischidia 3aadsorption 3aair 3afoams 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquids 3asolvents 3aultrasonic treatment1 aPhan, Thy Dang Uyen1 aDuong, Phuong Vu Quynh1 aVan Tran, Anh Thi1 aNguyen, Khoi Tan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3934-03711 aPhan, Nam Van Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4496-30710 tLangmuir.g2022 July 19, v. 38, no. 30 p.9285-9293dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008500167300001800252500001100270520197900281592002802260650000802288650001902296650001402315650001502329650002202344650002402366650001002390650001402400650001002414650001902424650002402443650001802467650001702485650001702502650001302519650001402532650001402546650002002560650001402580650001502594650001702609650002202626700002102648700001902669700001602688773012202704856008102826852000902907655001202916IND60548312520221118005841.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054831252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2747-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamthan, Ayushi10aGenetically modified (GM) crops: milestones and new advances in crop improvement  ap. 1639-1655.  aReview  aKEY MESSAGE : New advances in crop genetic engineering can significantly pace up the development of genetically improved varieties with enhanced yield, nutrition and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Genetically modified (GM) crops can act as powerful complement to the crops produced by laborious and time consuming conventional breeding methods to meet the worldwide demand for quality foods. GM crops can help fight malnutrition due to enhanced yield, nutritional quality and increased resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, several biosafety issues and public concerns are associated with cultivation of GM crops developed by transgenesis, i.e., introduction of genes from distantly related organism. To meet these concerns, researchers have developed alternative concepts of cisgenesis and intragenesis which involve transformation of plants with genetic material derived from the species itself or from closely related species capable of sexual hybridization, respectively. Recombinase technology aimed at site-specific integration of transgene can help to overcome limitations of traditional genetic engineering methods based on random integration of multiple copy of transgene into plant genome leading to gene silencing and unpredictable expression pattern. Besides, recently developed technology of genome editing using engineered nucleases, permit the modification or mutation of genes of interest without involving foreign DNA, and as a result, plants developed with this technology might be considered as non-transgenic genetically altered plants. This would open the doors for the development and commercialization of transgenic plants with superior phenotypes even in countries where GM crops are poorly accepted. This review is an attempt to summarize various past achievements of GM technology in crop improvement, recent progress and new advances in the field to develop improved varieties aimed for better consumer acceptance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabiotic stress 3abiosafety 3acisgenesis 3acommercialization 3aconsumer acceptance 3acrops 3acultivars 3afoods 3agene silencing 3agenetic improvement 3ahybridization 3aintragenesis 3amalnutrition 3amutation 3anucleases 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aphenotype 3atransgenes 3atransgenesis 3atransgenic plants1 aChaudhuri, Abira1 aKamthan, Mohan1 aDatta, Asis0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Sept., v. 129, no. 9 p.1639-1655dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2747-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245009400214300002000308520155800328592002801886650001501914650001601929650001501945650000901960650001101969650001301980700002201993773013802015856008002153852000902233655001202242IND60746867520221120184011.0210806e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c023812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoblhoff-Dier, Katharina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5981-943810aModeling the Gouy–Chapman Diffuse Capacitance with Attractive Ion–Surface Interaction  ap. 16664-16673.  aThe interfacial capacitance of a metal electrode in contact with a dilute electrolyte is generally expected to follow the behavior predicted by the Gouy–Chapman–Stern model. Recent experiments [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 711], however, have shown that a deviation from the Gouy–Chapman behavior is observed even in dilute electrolytes on platinum and gold single-crystal electrodes. Such deviations are usually attributed to an interaction between the surface and the electrolyte ions. However, a quantitative model showing that the strong deviations from the Gouy–Champan behavior observed for Pt can be ascribed to such an effect is still lacking, particularly as other experimental observables do not indicate a strong ion adsorption. Here, we propose a double-layer model that is capable of reproducing the main experimental findings in a simple and (in parts) analytical way. The analytical model thereby includes the attractive ion–surface interaction via an additional capacitive element connected in parallel to the Gouy–Chapman capacitance. By comparing the model predictions to experiment, we subsequently infer characteristics of the ion–surface interaction. In particular, we find that the model predicts the attractive interaction to be weak (weaker than a typical chemical bond formed when contact adsorbing) and that the interaction has to be very similar for all ions. Furthermore, for a good agreement with experiment, ion-size effects are suggested to play a role in determining the potential of minimum capacitance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3aelectrodes 3agold 3amodels 3aplatinum1 aKoper, Marc T.

We investigated for the first time whether the sensory and nutrient cues associated with becoming full (satiety) would be filtered out in a similar manner. One-hundred and twenty participants consumed either a low-satiety (75 kcal) or high-satiety (272 kcal plus thicker texture) beverage, delivered via an intra-oral infusion device while participants simultaneously completed a task which was either low or high in perceptual demand. Among participants who performed the low perceptual load task, ingestion of the high-satiety beverage increased rated satiety and reduced consumption at a subsequent snack test. However, both effects were eliminated by the high perceptual load task. Therefore, the processing of satiety cues was dependent on the availability of attention, identifying a novel perceptual load mechanism of inattentive eating and supporting more recent cognitive models of appetite control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abeverages 3acognition 3ainformation 3aingestion 3amodels 3aresearch 3asatiety 3atexture 0aAttention 0aPerceptual load 0aFood intake1 aVi, Chi Thanh1 aObrist, Marianna1 aForster, Sophie1 aYeomans, Martin R.0 tAppetite.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 155 p.104813-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1048133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100009400155245021400249500002200463520194500485592002802430650001002458650001502468650001002483650001402493650001102507650001402518650002202532650001502554650001302569650002502582650001402607650001902621650001902640650001502659650001702674650002002691650002102711650001702732650002502749650001602774653003702790653001702827653002002844653001802864653002102882700001802903700001902921700001402940700001502954700001602969700009102985773007803076856009003154852000903244655001203253IND60661524220221119075652.0190830e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalska, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7285-6623 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7285-662310aRemoval of carbamazepine, diclofenac and trimethoprim by solar driven advanced oxidation processes in a compound triangular collector based reactor: A comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous processes  aPre-press version  aContaminants of emerging concern (including pharmaceuticals) are not effectively removed by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), so particular concern is related to agricultural wastewater reuse due to their possible uptake in crops irrigated with WWTPs effluents. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and solar AOPs have been demonstrated to effectively remove pharmaceuticals from different aqueous matrices. In this study, an heterogeneous photocatalytic process using powdered nitrogen-doped TiO2 immobilized on polystyrene spheres (sunlight/N–TiO2) was compared to the benchmark homogenous AOP sunlight/H2O2 in a compound triangular collector reactor, to evaluate the degradation of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), trimethoprim (TMP)) in water. The degradation of the contaminants by sunlight and sunlight-AOPs well fit the pseudo-first order kinetic model (but for TMP under sunlight). High removal efficiency by solar photolysis was observed for DCF (up to 100%, half-life sunlight cumulative energy QS,1/2 = 2 kJ L−1, half-life time t1/2 = 32 min), while CBZ (32%, QS,1/2 = 28 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 385 min) and TMP (5% removal after 300 min) removal was poor. The degradation rate of CBZ, TMP and DCF was found to be slower during sunlight/H2O2 (QS,1/2 = 5 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 77 min; QS,1/2 = 20 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 128 min; QS,1/2 = 4 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 27 min, respectively) compared to sunlight/N–TiO2 (QS,1/2 = 4 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 55 min; QS,1/2 = 3 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 42 min; QS,1/2 = 2 kJ L−1, t1/2 = 25 min, respectively). These results are promising in terms of solar technology upscale because the faster degradation kinetics observed for sunlight/N–TiO2 process would result in smaller treatment volume, thus possibly perspective compensating the cost of the photocatalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3ahalf life 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation 3akinetics 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apolystyrenes 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3atrimethoprim 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 0aContaminants of emerging concern 0aN-doped TiO2 0aPharmaceuticals 0aSunlight/H2O2 0aWastewater reuse1 aManiakova, G.1 aCarotenuto, M.1 aSacco, O.1 aVaiano, V.1 aLofrano, G.1 aRizzo, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1449-9116 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1449-91160 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 24, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014800171300001200319520201200331592002802343650001502371650001302386650001902399650002502418650001002443650001002453650001202463650001202475650001502487650001302502650001402515650001802529650001702547650001502564650001702579650001302596650000902609651001302618700005802631700002402689700002502713773015202738856008202890852000902972655001202981IND60580074920221120150758.0180619e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058007492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-6189-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashmi, MaazMaqsood10aAssessing transhumance corridors on high mountain environments by least cost path analysis: the case of yak herds in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan  ap. 488.  aMountain environments in the world host highly specialized flora and fauna which are vulnerable because of land use and climate change. Transhumance and other land use traditional practices are present in most of the mountains of the world, and management tools able to cope with new socioeconomic settings and environmental changes are urgently needed. During past centuries, yak (Bos grunniens) herding in Northern Pakistan involved the migration of herds to high mountain international rangelands, but the recent establishment of international borders breaks the traditional transhumance paths, promoting several ecological problems. In this paper, we propose the use of least cost path (LCP) algorithm to identify the most efficient corridors of transhumance for yak herds on northern high altitudes of Pakistan. Specifically, LCP was implemented to identify the critical grazing areas and the connecting zones to be accounted in a new management plan for the yaks in the region. The LCP analysis showed that some grazing areas are connected with several paths, whereas other areas are connected to a lesser extent. The analyses identified a set of best minimum cost paths able to guarantee local connectivity. We also delineated several medium and low efficient paths that could play a crucial role for maintaining regional connectivity which is essential for reducing the isolation of herds and the consequent inbreeding problems. The analytical framework implemented in this study allowed to (1) provide valuable information concerning the movement of yak herds in Gilgit-Baltistan, (2) identify potential corridors that are able to promote herd movement between villages and high mountain rangelands, and (3) identify critical areas for the connectivity of yaks by ranking of the potential corridors according to their length and permeability. The analysis would be extended to other transhumant herds and high mountain areas that are facing sociopolitical transformations and environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3afauna 3aflora 3agrazing 3aherding 3ainbreeding 3aland use 3amountains 3apath analysis 3apermeability 3arangelands 3atranshumance 3avillages 3ayaks 3aPakistan1 aFrate, Ludovico1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6663-68431 aNizami, SyedMoazzam1 aCarranza, MariaLaura0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Oct., v. 189, no. 10 p.488-488dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6189-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245007200171300001600243520113300259592002801392650001901420650002201439650001401461650001701475650002001492650001601512650001701528650001201545650001101557653003201568653002201600653002101622653001701643700002601660700002401686700001601710773009501726856008901821852000901910655001201919IND60525727620221122082458.0190319e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052572762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUstaoglu, E.10aEconomic evaluation of agricultural land to assess land use changes  ap. 125-146.  aLand-use models express the relationship between various driving forces of land-use changes and are increasingly employed in practical applications to predict possible future land uses. The relationship between the agricultural land market and land-use changes is often neglected in such models. The objective of this study is to assess the production values of agricultural land to be integrated in an operational land-use model with the aim to improve understanding of land-use changes in all 28 European Union countries. This economic evaluation of agricultural land is based on the Net Present Value (NPV) method, a method that aims at uncovering the operational production values of land rather than real estate market value. The scientific relevance of this work is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the economic evaluation of agricultural land uses in different EU countries, the integration of economic production values of land to the local suitability approach in the studied land-use model and the provision of a EU-wide database of the NPVs of agricultural land uses, including various energy crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural land 3adatabases 3aenergy crops 3aland use change 3aland values 3amarket value 3amarkets 3amodels 0aAgricultural land valuation 0aNet Present Value 0aLand-use changes 0aEU countries1 aPerpiña Castillo, C.1 aJacobs-Crisioni, C.1 aLavalle, C.0 tLand use policy.g2016 Nov., v. 56 p.125-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156300001800267520088400285592002801169650001101197650002201208650003101230650001901261650001901280650001301299700001801312700001401330700001201344700001801356773012101374856007401495852000901569655001201578IND60666984220221120235716.0190919e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066698422DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11391h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Li-yang10aPoly(4-methyl-1-pentene)/alkylated graphene oxide nanocomposites: the emergence of a new crystal structure  ap. 4238-4244.  aModified graphene oxide (GO) not only offers a wrinkled structure but may also transform the crystal structure, giving it a potential application in high performance polymer/filler composites. In this work, alkylated graphene oxide (GO–ODA) is obtained via mutual electrostatic interaction between the epoxide group of GO and the amine group of octadecylamine (ODA). Then nanocomposites are obtained via introducing different contents of GO–ODA to poly(4-methy-1-pentene) (PMP or TPX) using a solution approach. It is found that the obtained GO–ODA has no effect on the crystallinity of TPX. It is worth noting that GO–ODA changes the crystal structure. GO, as a kind of nanofiller, is used to change the crystal structure of polymer/filler composites for the first time, which is an important finding and obviously provides a good example to widen the application of GO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3acrystal structure 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3apolymers1 aYan, Huai-wen1 aGong, Lei1 aYin, Bo1 aYang, Ming-bo0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 5, no. 6 p.4238-4244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra11391h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006200154245009400216300001400310520151000324592002801834650003501862650002601897650001601923650001601939650001301955650002201968650001501990651002802005651001202033653001602045653002302061653002302084653001202107773009602119856008902215852000902304655001202313IND60525727820221122082543.0190319e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052572782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJürgenson, Evelin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2103-433310aLand reform, land fragmentation and perspectives for future land consolidation in Estonia  ap. 34-43.  aLand fragmentation has been shown to limit agricultural production and more broadly rural development in many countries across the world. In the Central and Eastern European countries that gained independence during the early 1990s, land fragmentation has often occurred as a side-effect of land reforms aimed at restoring land ownership to the pre-WWII situation. This article provides an overview of the Estonian approach to land reform, an analysis of how this has led to more fragmented land tenure compared to 1940 and a discussion of the prospects for land consolidation in Estonia. The analysis was based on archival records, legal acts, and a comparison of two study areas using a GIS. In both study areas, post-1990 land reform had led to: (i) an increase in the number of land plots; (ii) a reduction in the average area of land plots. Most Western European and some Central and Eastern European countries have long traditions of land consolidation with the main objective being reducing the disadvantages caused by land fragmentation. In Estonia land consolidation projects were implemented after independence in 1919 and again during the 1990s. Unfortunately this activity has stopped and land consolidation tools have not been developed further. To develop a modern land consolidation tool, political will is required, as is the awareness of politicians, government institutions, land owners and land users and there is a need to amend the existing legal framework to make it fit for purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland reform 3aland tenure 3apolitics 3arural development 3atraditions 3aEastern European region 3aEstonia 0aLand reform 0aLand fragmentation 0aLand consolidation 0aEstonia0 tLand use policy.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 57 p.34-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245015200175500001400327520214500341592002802486650001702514650001602531650001802547650001402565650001302579650001602592650001302608650002102621650001402642650001102656650001702667650002802684650001302712650001802725650001102743650001202754650001702766650002302783650002002806650001802826650001002844650000802854650001102862653001002873653000902883653001602892653001402908700002102922700002102943700002002964700001602984700001903000700002203019700002203041773009503063856008403158852000903242655001203251IND60707477620221117032054.0210112e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070747762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1048262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSylvetsky, Allison C.10aBeyond taste and easy access: Physical, cognitive, interpersonal, and emotional reasons for sugary drink consumption among children and adolescents  aNAL-light  aConsumption of sugary drinks is associated with the development of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases among children and adolescents. In addition to high added sugar content, many sugary drinks also contain caffeine. However, whether the combination of sugar and caffeine uniquely influences children's sugary drink intake is presently unknown. This study aimed to evaluate contextual factors surrounding children's sugary drink consumption and investigate reasons for sugary drink intake among children and adolescents, with a specific focus on caffeinated sodas and sweet tea. We also evaluated how sugary drink consumption makes children feel and how they anticipated that they would respond if sugary drinks were restricted. Focus group discussions (n = 9, 2–8 participants per group) were conducted with 37 predominantly AfricanAmerican children and adolescents, ages 8–14 years, who consumed ≥1 caffeine-containing sugary drink(s) daily, based on parental report. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were independently coded by two coders, after which emergent themes were identified. Reported reasons for sugary drink consumption encompassed five themes: 1) perceived need (e.g., satisfy cravings, quench thirst); 2) physical and cognitive benefits (e.g., provide energy, improve attention); 3) emotional and interpersonal benefits (e.g., relieve anger, facilitate socializing); 4) sensory properties (e.g., taste, carbonation); and, 5) external cues (e.g., family/peer modeling, availability). Negative consequences resulting from excess intake were also reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, fatigue, hyperactivity, and chronic disease. Perceived physical, cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal benefits encourage sugary drink consumption and exacerbate well-described challenges of sugary drink reduction, including their palatability, accessibility, and affordability. Findings also suggest that incorporation of strategies to enhance physical, cognitive, and emotional health may hold promise in reducing sugary drink consumption among children and adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadded sugars 3aadolescents 3aaffordability 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3acarbonation 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3acognition 3aenergy 3afocus groups 3agastrointestinal system 3aheadache 3amental health 3amodels 3aobesity 3apalatability 3asensory properties 3asocial behavior 3asugar content 3ataste 3atea 3athirst 0aSugar 0aSoda 0aSoft drinks 0aPediatric1 aVisek, Amanda J.1 aHalberg, Sabrina1 aRhee, Dong Keun1 aOngaro, Zoe1 aEssel, Kofi D.1 aDietz, William H.1 aSacheck, Jennifer0 tAppetite.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 155 p.104826-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1048263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010700173500001900280520097000299592002801269650002201297650001501319650001601334650001401350650003501364650001401399650001701413650001201430650001901442650003201461651001101493653001001504653000901514653001801523653001901541700002401560700002501584700002101609700002201630700002401652700002401676700002401700700002101724700002401745700002701769700002201796773014101818856008401959852000902043655001202052IND60718220820221121220716.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071822082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2020.1015952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Flávia T.R.10aVertical transmission of Toxoplasma gondii in naturally infected ewes in the semiarid region of Brazil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo evaluate transplacental transmission of Toxoplasma gondii in naturally infected ewes, blood samples were collected from 55 pregnant ewes and their offspring, before ingestion of colostrum.

The colostrum antibody titers decreased every week, and only 20 % (2/10) of the lambs in continued to present detectable antibody titers until day 56 after birth. Therefore, vertical transmission of T. gondii in lambs was indication of occur and is an important route for transferring and maintaining the agent in sheep herds in the Brazilian semiarid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acolostrum 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aingestion 3amicrobiology 3aprogeny 3asemiarid zones 3atransplacental transmission 3aBrazil 0aLambs 0aIFAT 0aToxoplasmosis 0aTransplacental1 aNogueira, Denise B.1 aOliveira, Maria A.G.1 aSilva, Samara S.1 aSilva, Rômulo F.1 aSarmento, Wlysse F.1 aAzevedo, Sérgio S.1 aGennari, Solange M.1 aPena, Hilda F.J.1 aBrasil, Arthur W.L.1 aVilela, Vinícius L.R.1 aFeitosa, Thais F.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2021 Feb., v. 74 p.101595-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2020.1015953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100009300155245016600248500002200414520119900436592002801635650004401663650001301707650002701720650002201747650001101769650001701780650001501797650002101812650000901833650001301842650001201855650001901867650000701886650001601893650001901909650001501928653003401943653003401977653001402011700001602025700001302041700001602054700009002070700001902160773007802179856009002257852000902347655001202356IND60661524620221119075706.0190830e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6606-3643 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6606-364310aComparative study on treatment of methylene blue dye wastewater by different internal electrolysis systems and COD removal kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism  aPre-press version  aIn this study, Fe/Cu, Fe/Al/Cu, Fe/Cu/C and Fe/Al/Cu/C internal electrolysis systems (IESs) were constructed and used to treat methylene blue dye (MB) wastewater. The effects of filler mass ratio, filler dosage, solution pH, reaction time and reaction temperature on COD removal were discussed, while the kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism of COD removal were also investigated. The results showed that when the COD removal rates were basically the same, the reaction times of Fe/Al/Cu, Fe/Cu/C and Fe/Al/Cu/C IESs were shorter, and the filler dosages were lower. For the four systems, the appropriate pH was around 5, while the suitable reaction temperature was in the range of 20–25 °C. The COD removals of these four IESs were generally greater than 90%. The COD removal processes of the four systems could be better described by the improved pseudo-second-kinetic model, and the liquid film diffusion was the rate-controlling step. Moreover, the COD removal was a spontaneous and endothermic process. MB was degraded into inorganic substances in four steps. In addition, the FTIR characterization of the fillers before and after reaction suggests the four IESs have good stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3achemical oxygen demand 3acomparative study 3acopper 3aelectrolysis 3aendothermy 3ainorganic matter 3airon 3akinetics 3aliquids 3amethylene blue 3apH 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awastewater 0aMethylene blue dye wastewater 0aInternal electrolysis systems 0aMechanism1 aHe, Dongwei1 aPan, Fei1 aHuang, Rong1 aLin, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-8210 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-82101 aZhang, Xuehong0 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 24, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006200168300001800230520096600248592002801214596009601242596009401338596009401432650001301526650001901539650002301558650001501581650001801596650001201614650001801626650002901644700005601673773011401729856008501843852000901928655001201937IND60786081720221120193950.0220802e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c011552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, Zhi Xuan10aDesign of Aerosol Nanoparticles for Interfacial Catalysis  ap. 9037-9042.  aInterest in multifunctional nanoparticles is currently rising due to the increasing demand in green energy and environmental applications. The aerosol-based synthetic route emerges as a promising method for enabling the fabrication of multifunctional nanoparticles in a continuous and scalable manner.

Wildfires in these forests are impactful owing to conifer infilling during prolonged fire suppression post-Euro-American settlement. Here, restoration cuttings seek to impact wildfire behavior and aspen growing conditions. In this study, we explored how actual and hypothetical cuttings with a range of conifer removal intensity altered surface fuel and overstory structure at stand and fine scales. We then simulated wildfires, examining fire behavior and effects on post-fire forest structures around aspen trees. We found that conifer removal constrained by lower upper diameter limits (<56 cm) had marginal effects on surface fuel and overstory structure, likely failing to enhance resource conditions sufficiently to sustain aspen. Increasing the diameter limit also led to a higher likelihood of fire spread and a higher rate of spread, owing to greater within-canopy wind speed, though crown fire activity decreased. Our simulations suggest heavier treatments could facilitate reintroduction of fire while also dampening the effects of wildfires on forest structure. Cutting specifications that relax diameter limits and remove a substantial portion of conifer overstory could better promote aspen restoration and mitigate fire hazard.  aPublisher supplied data  cPacific Northwest Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000133930 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3aconifers 3afire hazard 3afire spread 3afire suppression 3aforests 3alakes 3aoverstory 3arisk 3awildfires 3awind speed1 aHoffman, Chad  M.1 aCollins, Brandon  M.1 aLong, Jonathan W.,1 aDagley, Christa  M.1 aMell, William 0 tFire.g2020 Sept. 09, v. 3, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire30300513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004000140245007300180500002000253520121200273592002801485650004401513650002201557650001201579650001601591650002401607650002101631650001201652650001901664650002601683650001301709650003801722650001801760650001801778650001101796650001101807650001501818650001401833650001301847700003501860700002901895773014201924856007402066852000902140655001202149IND60594342020221119181452.0180511e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434202DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.135942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez‐Monterroza, Ezequiel José10aEncapsulation of avocado oil in amylose solution from cassava starch  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEncapsulation of avocado oil was carried out mixing it with amylose extracted from cassava starch. Then, the oleogel formed was retrograded at 8 and −18 °C for 24 hr and later dried by freeze‐drying or vacuum at 3.3 kPa at 60 °C. Samples were characterized by X‐ray diffractometry, FT‐IR spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The lutein and neoxanthin content was also determined. Results obtained from DSC and FT‐IR spectroscopy indicated no formation of inclusion complexes V‐type of amylose. Nevertheless, the results from X‐ray diffractometry showed that samples had a diffraction pattern characteristics from V‐type amylose complex. The samples that retrograded at −18 °C and dried using freeze‐drying had a slight higher encapsulation degree than the samples retrograded at 8 °C. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Xerogels and cryogels from amylose of cassava can be considered an interesting tool for encapsulation of edible oil rich in bioactive compounds such as lutein and neoxanthin. Xerogels and cryogels are a potential biodegradable matrix for loading biocompounds, as well as an alternative for formulating controlled delivery systems of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylose 3aavocado oil 3abioactive compounds 3abiodegradability 3acassava 3acassava starch 3acooking fats and oils 3acryogels 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3alutein 3amixing 3aneoxanthin 3anutrients 3axerogels1 aChaux‐Gutiérrez, Ana María1 aNicoletti, Vânia Regina0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2018 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.e13594-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.135943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009800156520153900254592002801793650001101821650001101832650003501843650001501878650001701893651001001910700001501920700001501935773012801950856007402078852000902152655001202161IND60652658720221123032545.0190713e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065265872DNAL7 a10.3390/su101037712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Pingtao10aEvaluation and Prediction of City Sustainability Using MCDM and Stochastic Simulation Methods  aCity sustainability is an important issue in the urbanization process. In this paper, the sustainability of 14 cities in Liaoning province in China is evaluated and predicted. The process of evaluating city sustainability is viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. A simple additive weighting method is used for aggregating the normalized sustainability criteria data, built based on the three-pillar model and the associated weights. The results indicate that although the sustainability of the cities in Liaoning province is not perfect, the cities show better development momentum. For example, only two cities&rsquo; (Shenyang and Dalian) average performance scores in 2010&ndash;2016 were over 0.5, but all the cities&rsquo; sustainability improved in 2016 compared to 2010. We develop a stochastic simulation procedure used for predicting a city&rsquo;s sustainability in future years. Many prediction results were obtained, including the maximum, minimum, and average performance scores of the cities, the pairwise priority matrix representing the ratio of one city outperforming another, and the ranking of cities&rsquo; sustainability with probabilities. The prediction results indicate various degrees of increase for almost all the cities&rsquo; sustainability in the future, which is consistent with the judgment of better development momentum determined from the evaluation results. Moreover, the cities of Dandong, Panjin may exceed Shenyang, Dalian, and rank in the top among all the cities in future years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aprediction 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLi, Weiwei1 aLi, Lingyu0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101037713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007100168300001600239520098500255592002801240650001901268650001301287650002001300650001101320650001801331650002301349650001701372650000901389653002001398653001301418653001401431653001301445653001101458653000901469773010401478856008701582852000901669655001201678IND60525125220221120040235.0190318s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zoolgart.2016.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawata, Ken10aWild Animal Training: A Glance at Circuses and Hediger's Viewpoint  ap. 261-279.  aHistorically, zoos have shared common features with circuses despite recent animosity toward them: Exhibition of wild animals in captivity.

Moreover, both institutions face the public's naivete about animal life, and accusation about alleged cruelty to animals, often focusing on animal training. Professor Heini Hediger explained animal training from a scientific viewpoint. We can learn from his wisdom, for instance, the theoretical basis on training.

Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data. Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test. All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.  aPublisher supplied data  aGM083345aCA134848cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000020 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3achi-square distribution 3acomputer software 3agenotype 3aheritability 3ameta-analysis 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprecision medicine1 aWu, Baolin0 tBioinformatics.g2019 July 01, v. 35, no. 13 p.2251-2257dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl56649x1460-20597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty9613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002600167245009000193300001600283520149500299592002801794653001101822653001601833653001701849653001201866653001601878653001401894653001601908653002001924653000801944653000901952700001701961700002801978700002302006700002102029700002302050773011902073856010102192852000902293655001202302IND60130876820221121072026.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013087682DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[876:SARODA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusiani, M.q(Marco),10aSeasonality and reoccurrence of depredation and wolf control in western North America  ap. 876-887.  aDue primarily to wolf (Canis lupus) predation on livestock (depredation), some livestock producers and other interest groups oppose wolf conservation, which is an important objective for large sectors of the public. Predicting depredation occurrence is difficult, yet necessary to prevent it. Better prediction of wolf depredation also would facilitate application of sound depredation management actions. In this paper we analyze temporal trends in wolf depredation occurrence and wolf control, which is employed as a depredation management action. We gathered data from wolf depredation investigations for Alberta, Canada, from 1982––1996 and for Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, USA, from 1987––2003. We showed that wolf attacks occurred with a seasonal pattern, reflecting the seasonality of livestock calving, grazing practices, and seasonal variation in energetic requirements of wolf packs. Seasonal wolf attacks were auto-correlated with lags of one year, indicating annual reoccurrence. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that limited wolf control was rapidly employed as a short-term response to depredation, and was not designed to decrease wolf depredation at a regional scale or in the long-term. We therefore discovered a reoccurring seasonal-annual pattern for wolf depredation and wolf control in western North America. Ranchers and managers could use our data for focusing investment of resources to prevent wolf depredation increases during high-depredation seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCanada 0aCanis lupus 0aconservation 0acontrol 0adepredation 0alivestock 0aseasonality 0atemporal trends 0aUSA 0awolf1 aMuhly, Tyler1 aGates, Charles Cormack,1 aCallaghan, Carolyn1 aSmith, Martin E.1 aTosoni, Elisabetta0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.876-887dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[876:SARODA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005700169300001600226520084700242592002801089650002501117651001101142653001101153653002501164653000901189653002201198653002001220773012401240856008301364852000901447655001201456IND60778237320221122034723.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077823732DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n40.2022.a192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Colin C.10aPalmer's Culture des Cactées – a rare cactus book  ap. 231-248.  aPalmer's Culture des Cactées was published in Paris in 1867 during the first cactus cornucopia in mid-nineteenth-century France.

As a growers' guide the book compares favourably with those published in 1845 and 1868 by Charles Lemaire, Palmer's contemporary and leading light in the French cactus scene at that time.

The reconstruction could explain 43.7% of temperature variance during the calibration period from 1951 to 2004. It displays similar patterns to several temperature reconstructions in the Loess Plateau. It corresponds well with the temperature regimes in Hokkaido, Japan, indicating that both regions have similar warm and cold intervals. The high correlation between the reconstruction and the CRU (Climatic Research Unit of University of East Anglia, UK) TS3 temperature datasets showed that the temperature reconstruction could be representative of large-scale climate change over northern China. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affected temperature variations of northern China and even Hokkaido to a certain extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aclimate change 3acold 3adata collection 3agrowth rings 3atemperature 3atrees 3avariance 3aChina 3aJapan1 aLiu, Yu1 aLi, Qiang1 aLinderholm, Hans0 tQuaternary international.g2013 Jan. 14, v. 283 p.30-35dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245014100166300001600307500001500323500002000338520131400358592002801672596006901700650002201769650002501791650001901816650001801835650002201853650003501875650001901910650002301929650001601952650001801968650002201986650001302008650001802021650001902039650000802058650001402066700002402080700002302104700002802127700006002155773011502215856007302330852000902403655001202412IND60691545620221120223159.0200430e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069154562DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.127792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaikpa, David Sewordor10aComparison of rye, triticale, durum wheat and bread wheat genotypes for Fusarium head blight resistance and deoxynivalenol contamination  ap. 251-262.  agolden set  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSmall‐grain winter cereal crops can be infected with Fusarium head blight (FHB) leading to mycotoxin contamination and reduction in grain weight and quality. Although a number of studies have investigated the genetic variation of genotypes within each small‐grain cereal, a systematic comparison of the winter crops rye, triticale, durum and bread wheat for their FHB resistance, Fusarium‐damaged kernels (FDK) and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination across species is still missing. We have therefore evaluated twelve genotypes each of four crops widely varying in their FHB resistance under artificial infection with one DON‐producing F. culmorum isolate at constant spore concentrations and additionally at crop‐specific concentrations in two environments. Rye and triticale were the most resistant crops to FHB followed by bread and durum wheat at constant and crop‐specific spore concentrations. On average, rye accumulated the lowest amount of DON (10.08 mg/kg) in the grains, followed by triticale (15.18 mg/kg) and bread wheat (16.59 mg/kg), while durum wheat had the highest amount (30.68 mg/kg). Genotypic variances within crops were significant (p ≤ .001) in most instances. These results underline the differing importance of breeding for FHB resistance in the different crops.  aPublisher supplied data  a91650671cGerman Academic Exchange Service (DAAD, Bonn, Germany) 3aFusarium culmorum 3aFusarium head blight 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticosecale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease resistance 3adurum wheat 3afungal spores 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrain quality 3aplant breeding 3arye 3atriticale1 aLieberherr, Bärbel1 aMaurer, Hans Peter1 aLongin, C.

The study aimed to establish a rapid, specific detection approach for B. velezensis. Many unique gene sequences of B. velezensis were selected through whole genome sequence alignment of B. velezensis strains and were used to design a series of forward and reverse primers, which were then screened by PCR and qPCR using different Bacillus samples as templates. The colonization ability of B. velezensis ZF2 in different soils and different soil environmental conditions was measured by qPCR and a 10-fold dilution plating assay. A specific primer pair targeting the sequence of the D3N19_RS13500 gene of B. velezensis ZF2 was screened and could successfully distinguish B. velezensis from B. amyloliquefaciens. A rapid specific real-time qPCR detection system for B. velezensis was established. B. velezensis ZF2 had a very strong colonization ability in desert soil, and the optimal soil pH was 7–8. Moreover, the colonization ability of strain ZF2 was significantly enhanced when organic matter from different nitrogen sources was added to the substrate. This study will provide assistance for rapid specificity detection and biocontrol application of B. velezensis strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus velezensis 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acolonizing ability 3adesert soils 3agenes 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aorganic matter 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence alignment 3asoil pH1 aXie, Xuewen 1 aShi, Yanxia 1 aChai, Ali 1 aLi, Baoju 1 aLi, Lei 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 June 14, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100612163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245011300206300001600319506007600335520117100411592002801582506003701610650003001647650002001677650002301697650001501720650001001735650001701745650001101762650001001773650001101783650002101794650002301815650002901838700001401867700001101881700001901892700001901911773011601930856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60579585520221207131336.0170823e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057958552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-017-0437-82doi7 aPMC55676982pmcid7 a288785062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Shi-Lin10aAnalysis of tandem repeat units of the promoter of capsanthin/capsorubin synthase (Ccs) gene in pepper fruit  ap. 685-691.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCapsanthin/capsorubin synthase (Ccs) gene is a key gene that regulates the synthesis of capsanthin and the development of red coloration in pepper fruits. There are three tandem repeat units in the promoter region of Ccs, but the potential effects of the number of repetitive units on the transcriptional regulation of Ccs has been unclear. In the present study, expression vectors carrying different numbers of repeat units of the Ccs promoter were constructed, and the transient expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was used to detect differences in expression levels associated with the promoter fragments. These repeat fragments and the plant expression vector PBI121 containing the 35s CaMV promoter were ligated to form recombinant vectors that were transfected into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. A fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to analyze the expression associated with the various repeat units. It was concluded that the constructs containing at least one repeat were associated with GUS expression, though they did not differ from one another. This repeating unit likely plays a role in transcription and regulation of Ccs expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aCapsicum annuum 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acapsanthin 3acolor 3afluorescence 3afruits 3agenes 3apepper 3apromoter regions 3aspectrophotometers 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLi, Zheng1 aLi, Li1 aShah, S.

Floristic composition and diversity at Keruing (Dipterocarpus spp.) habitat in Tangkahan, Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 4448-4456. Dipterocarpus spp., or locally known as Keruing, is a wood-producing tree and has high economic value. Keruing also produces derivative products in oil and oleoresin, which are widely used as raw materials for medicines and perfumes. Keruing natural population has been severely declining caused by habitat alteration and also over exploitation. Therefore, information on the composition and diversity of the floristic community at their habitat is important as an initial step in designing conservation actions. This study aims to determine the floristic composition and diversity at the keruing habitat in the Tangkahan area, Gunung Leuser National Park (Gunung Leuser NP). A line transect has been used to establish a purposive sampling in particular forest areas where the population of the keruing is known to grow naturally. Four line transects, each with five nested plots, totaling 110 plots, were established to gather data at four growth stages. The results found 47 species at the seedling stage, 43 species at the sapling stage, 48 species at the pole stage and 65 species at the tree stage. There were three species of keruing in the research location, namely Dipterocarpus haseltii, Dipterocarpus costulatus and Dipterocarpus elongatus Korth with low IVI values ??at each stage. D. haseltii was only found at the seedling, pole and tree stage with IVI values ??of 0.32, 0.30, and 6.90, respectively. D. costulatus was only found at the tree level with an IVI value of 3.43, while D. elongatus found at the sapling and tree stage with an IVI of 0.30 and 3.42, respectively. The diversity index in the research location was in the medium category at the seedling, sapling, and pole levels with a value of 2.96, 2.86, and 2.92, respectively and was classified as high at the tree level with a value of 3.18. The evenness index (E') in all growth stages is high or evenly distributed with the value of E' > 0.75. The species diversity in research location classified into medium-high category although in each stage showing dynamic on species domination. Disturbed habitat due to illegal logging and land conversion caused a problem on keruing regeneration. Conservation efforts, including active monitoring keruing occurrence, ex-situ conservation, and artificial regeneration, are needed to avoid keruing from extinction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDipterocarpus 3aartificial regeneration 3abotanical composition 3aeconomic valuation 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3anational parks 3aoils 3aoleoresins 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aIndonesia 0adiversity 0ahabitat 0akeruing 0aspecies composition1 aRACHMAT, HENTI HENDALASTUTI 1 aELFIATI, DENI 1 aHIDAYAT, ASEP 1 aHADI, ADHI NURUL 1 aZAITUNAH, ANITA 1 aNAINGGOLAN, DARIN 1 aGINTING, IDA MALLIA 0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Oct., v. 22, no. 10dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2210383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04233naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245008600159300001800245520286700263592002803130650001603158650001603174650001503190650002003205650002203225650001403247650001403261650001803275650000903293650001503302650002303317651001103340653001803351653001303369653003003382700001903412700001803431700001603449700002103465700002103486700001603507773015303523856007803676852000903754655001203763IND60539494020221122061149.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053949402DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-76522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, M.C.10aShort communication: Prediction of intake in dairy cows under tropical conditions  ap. 3845-3854.  aA meta-analysis was conducted to develop a model for predicting dry matter intake (DMI) in dairy cows under the tropical conditions of Brazil and to assess its adequacy compared with 5 currently available DMI prediction models: Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC); National Research Council (NRC); Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS; version 6); and 2 other Brazilian models. The data set was created using 457 observations (n=1,655 cows) from 100 studies, and it was randomly divided into 2 subsets for statistical analysis. The first subset was used to develop a DMI prediction equation (60 studies; 309 treatment means) and the second subset was used to assess the adequacy of DMI predictive models (40 studies; 148 treatment means). The DMI prediction model proposed in the current study was developed using a nonlinear mixed model analysis after reparameterizing the NRC equation but including study as a random effect in the model. Body weight (mean=540±57.6kg), 4% fat-corrected milk (mean=21.3±7.7kg/d), and days in milk (mean=110±62d) were used as independent variables in the model. The adequacy of the DMI prediction models was evaluated based on coefficient of determination, mean square prediction error (MSPE), root MSPE (RMSPE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The observed DMI obtained from the data set used to evaluate the prediction models averaged 17.6±3.2kg/d. The following model was proposed: DMI (kg/d)=[0.4762 (±0.0358) × 4% fat-corrected milk + 0.07219 (±0.00605) × body weight0.75] × (1 – e−0.03202 (±0.00615) × [days in milk + 24.9576 (±5.909)]). This model explained 93.0% of the variation in DMI, predicting it with the lowest mean bias (0.11kg/d) and RMSPE (4.9% of the observed DMI) and the highest precision [correlation coefficient estimate (ρ)=0.97] and accuracy [bias correction factor (Cb)=0.99]. The NRC model prediction equation explained 92.0% of the variation in DMI and had the second lowest mean bias (0.42kg/d) and RMSPE (5.8% of the observed DMI), as well as the second highest precision (ρ=0.94) and accuracy (Cb=0.98). The CNCPS and AFRC DMI prediction models explained 93.0 and 85.0% of the variation in DMI but underpredicted DMI by 1.8 and 1.4kg/d, respectively. These 2 models (CNCPS and AFRC) resulted, respectively, in RMSPE of 11.3 and 10.7% of the observed DMI, with moderate to high precision (ρ=0.81 and 0.82) and accuracy (Cb=0.84 and 0.89). The remaining 2 models resulted in the poorest results, underpredicting DMI by 2.3 and 1.9kg/d, with RMSPE of 22.8 and 14.9% of the observed DMI and moderate to low precision (ρ=0.49 and 0.76) and accuracy (Cb=0.81 and 0.86). The new model derived from the current meta-analytical approach provided the best accuracy and precision for predicting DMI in lactating dairy cows under Brazilian conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acorrelation 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3adry matter intake 3aequations 3alactation 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3aprediction 3astatistical models 3aBrazil 0ameta-analysis 0amodeling 0aprediction of feed intake1 aOliveira, A.S.1 aAraújo, C.V.1 aBrito, A.F.1 aTeixeira, R.M.A.1 aMoares, E.H.B.K.1 aMoura, D.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.3845-3854dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-76523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001400279520208900293592002802382650001902410650001302429650002502442650001202467650002202479650001202501650001102513650002202524650001102546650001602557650002502573650001102598651001102609653001502620653001402635653002002649653001202669700002102681700002502702700002802727700002602755773012202781856008202903852000902985655001202994IND60778237620221122034607.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077823762DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n40.2022.a32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazo-León, A.

The objectives of the work were to identify its floral visitors, to determine which are the most effective pollinators and to evaluate the importance of floral visitors in seed production. To determine the richness and frequency of the animal visitors, five study visits were made from May to June 2017, during which the animals that interacted with the flowers were recorded and collected for a period of thirty minutes for each hour between 10am and 16pm, after which the pollen grains were removed from the body of the collected specimens. For pollination efficiency, the pollen deposited by a specific pollinator in a single visit on the stigma and by self-pollination was counted and seed production from flowers where pollinator visits were avoided and another group with no restrictions were compared. A total of 2,261 floral visitors were recorded, belonging to four orders, eleven families, and twenty-seven species. Bees were the most abundant floral visitors with 98% of the records; the species with the highest number of visits was Apis mellifera with 90%, followed by Diadasia australis with 5%. A higher number of pollen grains per insect were recorded in D. australis than in A. mellifera, D. australis deposited more pollen per visit than A. mellifera and by self-pollination. Flowers that received pollinators produced significantly more seeds per fruit than flowers where visitors were prevented. O. joconostle flowers are used by many animals, however, the majority are bees, particularly two species: A. mellifera and D. australis, the former having a higher frequency of visitation. However, D. australis carries and deposits more pollen. Joconostle seems to have a mixed autogamy/ xenogamy crossing system, as self-pollination was recorded, although it negatively affected seed production. Thus, cross-pollination is important for the conservation of this species, increasing its chances of reproductive success by seed and preserving genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aDiadasia 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aanimals 3across pollination 3aflowers 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3apollen 3apollinators 3areproductive success 3astigma 3aMexico 0aanthophila 0aCactaceae 0aseed production 0anopales1 aMuñoz-Urias, A.1 aCampos-Porras, M.

We reviewed the scientific literature published from 1995 to June 2004 to determine the fix intervals used and fix success rates obtained in studies using GPS telemetry. We also programmed GPS telemetry collars with 6 different fix intervals and placed them at fixed locations of varying topography in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona from August 2003––May 2004. Fix interval affected fix success rates both in our field study (99, 98, 96, 94, 93, 92%% fix success rate for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 6, and 13-hour fix intervals, respectively) and in our analysis of data obtained from scientific literature (r²==0.531, P≤≤0.001), with shorter fix intervals being associated with higher fix success rates. Topography affected the fix success rate (F₂, ₇₇==12.017, P≤≤0.001), location error (F₂, ₇₇==6.76, P==0.002), and proportion of 3-dimensional (3-D) fixes (F₂,₇₇==10.184, P≤≤0.001), resulting in lower fix success rates and larger location errors in areas with more rugged topography. The influence of topography and fix interval on location error and fix success rates may bias GPS location data, resulting in misclassification of habitat use and under-sampling certain areas used by animals. Location error and missing data can increase type II error and may result in incorrect inferences in some studies. These biases need to be assessed and steps should be taken to minimize their influence on results of studies of habitat selection and other aspects of animal ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArizona 0afix rate 0aGlobal Positioning System 0aGPS telemetry 0alocation error 0asuccess1 aKrausman, Paul R.1 aJansen, Brian D.1 aMorgart, John R.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.926-934dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[926:IOTAGF]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158500002000299520182300319592002802142650001802170650002402188650001502212650002502227650001702252650001502269650001502284650001902299650001802318650001802336650002102354650001102375650002102386650002402407650001102431650001502442650001102457650001002468650002802478650002302506650003302529650001802562650001802580700002002598700001902618700002302637700002402660700002302684773014202707856007402849852000902923655001202932IND60594342820221119181210.0180511e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434282DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.136042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞahin, Selin10aEffect of drying method on oleuropein, total phenolic content, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity of olive (Olea europaea) leaf  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this research was to study the effect of microwave drying (MD) on the major phenolic compound oleuropein, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity of the olive leaves. The results were compared to those obtained after using freeze drying (FD), vacuum drying (VD), oven drying (OD), and ambient air‐drying (AAD). Response surface methodology, using a central composite face‐centerd design, was used to optimize the effects of microwave irradiation power (300–500 W), solid mass (1.5–2.5 g), and drying time (4–6 min) on oleuropein and other olive leaves antioxidant compounds. The second‐order models were found highly adequate with very low root mean squared deviation (RMSD) and high coeffecient of determination (R²) values. The results of MD under optimum conditions (2.085 g sample at 459.257 W for 6 min of drying period) has demonstrated to be the best drying method followed by FD, VD, OD, and AAD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Olive leaves are agricultural waste which contains significant amounts of valuable compounds such as oleuropein and phenolic compounds. Nowadays, application of these compounds has attracted considerable interest as food additives and/or nutraceuticals in both food and pharmaceutical industries. Several methods have been applied for the extraction of phenolic compounds from olive leaves and by‐products. However, to obtain higher extraction yield, it is important to reduce the water content of the samples before extraction. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using microwave drying as a promising technique compared to other methods (e.g., freeze‐, vacuum‐, oven‐, and ambient air‐drying) for drying of olive leaves with minimum changes in total phenolic, flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and oleuropein contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aagricultural wastes 3aair drying 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abyproducts 3aflavonoids 3afood additives 3afood industry 3afreeze drying 3afunctional foods 3aleaves 3amicrowave drying 3amicrowave radiation 3amodels 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3aovens 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphenolic compounds 3aresponse surface methodology 3avacuum drying 3awater content1 aElhussein, Elaf1 aBilgin, Mehmet1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aBarba, Francisco J.1 aRoohinejad, Shahin0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2018 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.e13604-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.136043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245021000203300001600413506007600429520172100505592002802226506003702254650002402291650002002315650001302335650001502348650001302363650003102376650002602407650001902433650002202452650001302474650001302487650001502500650002102515650002902536650001802565650001302583700001802596700001702614700001702631700001802648700001802666773011602684856008102800852000902881655001202890IND60579585720221207131324.0170823e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057958572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-017-0447-62doi7 aPMC55677082pmcid7 a288784992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Lijun10aComparative proteomic analysis of autotetraploid and diploid Paulownia tomentosa reveals proteins associated with superior photosynthetic characteristics and stress adaptability in autotetraploid Paulownia  ap. 605-617.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo enlarge the germplasm resource of Paulownia plants, we used colchicine to induce autotetraploid Paulownia tomentosa, as reported previously. Compared with its diploid progenitor, autotetraploid P. tomentosa exhibits better photosynthetic characteristics and higher stress resistance. However, the underlying mechanism for its predominant characteristics has not been determined at the proteome level. In this study, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to compare proteomic changes between autotetraploid and diploid P. tomentosa. A total of 1427 proteins were identified in our study, of which 130 proteins were differentially expressed between autotetraploid and diploid P. tomentosa. Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed that photosynthesis-related proteins and stress-responsive proteins were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed proteins, suggesting they may be responsible for the photosynthetic characteristics and stress adaptability of autotetraploid P. tomentosa. The correlation analysis between transcriptome and proteome data revealed that only 15 (11.5%) of the differentially expressed proteins had corresponding differentially expressed unigenes between diploid and autotetraploid P. tomentosa. These results indicated that there was a limited correlation between the differentially expressed proteins and the previously reported differentially expressed unigenes. This work provides new clues to better understand the superior traits in autotetraploid P. tomentosa and lays a theoretical foundation for developing Paulownia breeding strategies in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPaulownia tomentosa 3aautotetraploidy 3abreeding 3acolchicine 3adiploidy 3agene expression regulation 3aliquid chromatography 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3astress tolerance 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes1 aFan, Guoqiang1 aDeng, Minjie1 aZhao, Zhenli1 aDong, Yanpeng1 aLi, Yongsheng0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2017 July, v. 23, no. 3 p.605-617dSpringer Indiax0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-017-0447-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013500165300001400300520087800314592002801192650001801220650002601238650001201264650001001276650001201286650001501298651001201313653002201325653002801347653002401375653002501399653002001424653001701444700002201461700002401483700003001507700002101537700002001558773010001578856008201678852000901760655001201769IND60525126020221120025832.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2015.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemic, Darija10aEcological morphology of the sugar beet weevil Croatian populations: Evaluating the role of environmental conditions on body shape  ap. 25-32.  aDifferent rearing environments produce dissimilar stress level in insects, which can be reflected on the ability of an individual to overcome these pressures and spread further. Sugar beet weevil, Bothynoderes punctivnetris Germar. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the most harmful pests of sugar beet, infesting agricultural fields in different parts of Croatia. It is highly invasive being able to inhabit diverse environments across the country. The aim of this study was to assess the association between different environmental and rearing conditions and the morphological variation observed in the sugar beet weevil body shape. The present results showed significantly different eco-morphs related to different environmental conditions, thus suggesting that the observed ecomorphological changes could be associated to the ability of this pest to spread further.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aenvironmental factors 3ainsects 3apests 3arearing 3asugar beet 3aCroatia 0aSugar beet weevil 0aGeometric morphometrics 0aClimatic conditions 0aPartial least square 0aShape variation 0aPest insects1 aBenítez, Hugo A.1 aPüschel, Thomas A.1 aGašparić, Helena Virić1 aŠatvar, Mihaela1 aBažok, Renata,0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2016 Jan., v. 260 p.25-32dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2015.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012200201300001800323500001900341500002000360520226700380592002802647596005102675596005102726596005902777596005902836596005902895596006002954650001503014650001803029650001703047650001403064650001003078650003003088650001403118650002303132650001103155650002403166650001303190650002103203650003003224650001303254650001303267700002503280700002403305700001903329700002603348773012303374856007303497852000903570655001203579IND60691546020221120201143.0200430e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069154602DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.137712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzovsky, Andrey I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6815-396810aDoes size really matter in biogeography? Patterns and drivers of global distribution of marine micro‐ and meiofauna  ap. 1180-1192.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: This study aims to evaluate the role of various factors in structuring biogeographical distribution of small‐sized organisms. More specifically, we analysed the distribution of three groups of marine benthic organisms differing in body size, both unicellular and metazoans, to assess the relevance of geographical and environmental factors on their taxonomic composition. LOCATION: Global. TAXON: Heterotrophic flagellates, Ciliophora, Harpacticoida (Copepoda). METHODS: The set of predictors included species richness (a proxy for sampling effort), geographical distance, isolation by geographical or hydrological barriers and three environmental variables (sea surface temperature, its annual variation and salinity). Multiple regression on the distance matrices and null modelling were used to quantify the relative effects of these variables in taxonomic similarity among 21 regions of the Ocean. RESULTS: Each group showed a unique biogeographical pattern. The smallest‐sized organisms, the flagellates, had high regional but low global diversity and low endemicity and demonstrated worldwide, environmentally driven distribution without any dispersal limitation (only the effects of climatic variables, but neither distance nor isolation effects, were significant). Thus, flagellates basically meet the ‘ubiquity model’ of global distribution. The ciliates showed a moderate level of endemicity, and their distribution depended on both spatial distance and the climatic variables, in accord with the ‘moderate endemicity model’. In contrast, harpacticoids demonstrated high endemicity level, and their distribution was mostly geographically driven, indicating the considerable role of dispersal limitation—the pattern typical of other multicellular taxa with ‘classical biogeography’. Species richness significantly influenced the interregional similarity of each group and explained 26%–65% of the total variance, indicating the strong impact of undersampling on faunistic similarity estimations. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that body size is the ‘master trait’ that shapes global biogeographical patterns towards higher predictability and increasing role of dispersal limitation for larger organisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a18‐05‐60228cRussian Scientific Foundation  a19‐14‐00102cRussian Scientific Foundation  a18‐04‐00206cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  a17‐04‐00337cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  a19‐05‐00128cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  a18‐504‐51028cRussian Foundation for Basic Research 3aCiliophora 3aHarpacticoida 3abiogeography 3abody size 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrology 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asalinity 3aspecies richness 3asurface water temperature 3ataxonomy 3avariance1 aChertoprud, Elena S.1 aGarlitska, Lesya A.1 aMazei, Yuri A.1 aTikhonenkov, Denis V.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2020 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.1180-1192dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.137713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245006900166520109500235592002801330650001901358650001201377650001101389650002001400650003001420650001201450650001901462650001701481650001201498650003301510650001201543650002801555651001101583700001601594700001801610700001901628773012901647856007401776852000901850655001201859IND60652659420221120183845.0190713e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065265942DNAL7 a10.3390/su101034002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndries, Alin Marius,10aFinancial Infrastructure and Access to Finance for European SMEs  aIn this article we assess credit rationing across European countries by analyzing the impact of banking competition on the access to finance of firms. The importance of the financial sector in promoting the sustainable economy is recognized by the European Union, that has taken the lead in efforts to build a financial system that supports sustainable growth. However, it should be acknowledged that in highly competitive business environments, it is not easy to challenge the existing paradigms, since companies need to be profitable in addition to improving their environmental performance. Using data from European firms Survey on the Access to Finance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), our results, using Probit regression, support the Market Power Hypothesis, outlining that more concentrated banking markets are characterized by higher levels of credit rationing. Also, our results reveal that small firms are more credit rationed compared to large firms. The analysis shows that financial constraints are stronger in the countries more affected by the financial crisis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abanking 3acredit 3aeconomic crises 3aenvironmental performance 3afunding 3ainfrastructure 3amarket power 3amarkets 3asmall and medium enterprises 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aEurope1 aMarcu, Nicu1 aOprea, Florin1 aTofan, Mihaela0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101034003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151100002200172245011200194300001800306500001900324520197300343592002802316650002202344650003302366650001402399650001902413650002302432650002002455650003702475650001102512650001302523650001502536650001102551650001702562650001402579650002202593700001802615700002002633700001902653700002202672700002602694773012102720856008502841852000902926655001202935IND60672693020221122115545.0191017e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269302DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty9692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGianì, Fiorenza1 aSchwartz, Russell10aComputational modeling reveals MAP3K8 as mediator of resistance to vemurafenib in thyroid cancer stem cells  ap. 2267-2275.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVal600Glu (V600E) mutation is the most common BRAF mutation detected in thyroid cancer. Hence, recent research efforts have been performed trying to explore several inhibitors of the V600E mutation-containing BRAF kinase as potential therapeutic options in thyroid cancer refractory to standard interventions. Among them, vemurafenib is a selective BRAF inhibitor approved by Food and Drug Administration for clinical practice. Unfortunately, vemurafenib often displays limited efficacy in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas probably because of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. In this view, cancer stem cells (CSCs) may represent a possible mechanism of resistance to vemurafenib, due to their self-renewal and chemo resistance properties. We present a computational framework to suggest new potential targets to overcome drug resistance. It has been validated with an in vitro model based upon a spheroid-forming method able to isolate thyroid CSCs that may mimic resistance to vemurafenib. Indeed, vemurafenib did not inhibit cell proliferation of BRAF V600E thyroid CSCs, but rather stimulated cell proliferation along with a paradoxical over-activation of ERK and AKT pathways. The computational model identified a fundamental role of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAP3K8), a serine/threonine kinase expressed in thyroid CSCs, in mediating this drug resistance. To confirm model prediction, we set a suitable in vitro experiment revealing that the treatment with MAP3K8 inhibitor restored the effect of vemurafenib in terms of both DNA fragmentation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (apoptosis) in thyroid CSCs. Moreover, MAP3K8 expression levels may be a useful marker to predict the response to vemurafenib. The model is available in GitHub repository visiting the following URL: https://github.com/francescopappalardo/MAP3K8-Thyroid-Spheres-V-3.0.

Different analysts interpreting the same spatial unit will not always agree on the land cover class label that should be assigned. Two approaches for accommodating interpreter variability when estimating the area are simple averaging (SA) and latent class modeling (LCM). This study compares agreement between area estimates obtained from SA and LCM using reference data obtained by seven trained, professional interpreters who independently interpreted an annual time series of land cover reference class labels for 300 sampled Landsat pixels. We also compare the variability of the LCM and SA area estimates over different numbers of interpreters and different subsets of interpreters within each interpreter group size, and examine area estimates of three land cover classes (forest, developed, and wetland) and three change types (forest gain, forest loss, and developed gain). Differences between the area estimates obtained from SA and LCM are most pronounced for the estimates of wetland and the three change types. The percent area estimates of these rare classes were usually greater for LCM compared to SA, with the differences between LCM and SA increasing as the number of interpreters providing the reference data increased. The LCM area estimates generally had larger standard deviations and greater ranges over different subsets of interpreters, indicating greater sensitivity to the selection of the individual interpreters who carried out the reference class labeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aforests 3agroup size 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis 3awetlands1 aStehman, Stephen  V.1 aFoody, Giles M.,1 aPengra, Bruce  W.0 tLand.g2021 Jan. 04, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100100353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245012700188300001600315520213100331592002802462653002202490653002302512653002502535653002502560653002902585653001802614653002602632700002602658773011902684856010102803852000902904655001202913IND60130877620221121050258.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013087762DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[956:PDAPDO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBender, Louis C.10aPrecipitation, density, and population dynamics of desert bighorn sheep on San Andres National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico  ap. 956-964.  aUnderstanding the determinants of population size and performance for desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) is critical to develop effective recovery and management strategies. In arid environments, plant communities and consequently herbivore populations are strongly dependent upon precipitation, which is highly variable seasonally and annually. We conducted a retrospective exploratory analysis of desert bighorn sheep population dynamics on San Andres National Wildlife Refuge (SANWR), New Mexico, 1941––1976, by modeling sheep population size as a function of previous population sizes and precipitation. Population size and trend of desert bighorn were best and well described (R² == 0.89) by a model that included only total annual precipitation as a covariate. Models incorporating density-dependence, delayed density-dependence, and combinations of density and precipitation were less informative than the model containing precipitation alone (ΔΔAICc==8.5––22.5). Lamb:female ratios were positively related to precipitation (current year: F₁,₃₄==7.09, P==0.012; previous year: F₁,₃₃==3.37, P==0.075) but were unrelated to population size (current year: F₁,₃₄==0.04, P==0.843; previous year: F₁,₃₃==0.14, P==0.715). Instantaneous population rate of increase (r) was related to population size (F₁,₃₃==5.55; P==0.025). Precipitation limited populations of desert bighorn sheep on SANWR primarily in a density-independent manner by affecting production or survival of lambs, likely through influences on forage quantity and quality. Habitat evaluations and recovery plans for desert bighorn sheep need to consider fundamental influences on desert bighorn populations such as precipitation and food, rather than focus solely on proximate issues such as security cover, predation, and disease.

The building size effect on bird community assemblages in tropical urban ecosystem. Biodiversitas 23: 2775-2782. The construction of buildings is one of the factors that cause landscape changes in urban areas. Landscape changes can result in the fragmentation of animal habitats that live in urban areas. Characteristics of urban structures, such as spatial configuration and distribution of building types, are some of the factors that influence the distribution pattern and abundance of bird species in urban areas. This research aimed to describe the effect of building type on the diversity of bird species in Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, or Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY). Bird data were recorded using the point count method, while building type data and vegetation height were obtained by subtracting Digital Surface Model (DSM) data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data in the built-up area. The data was recorded from three levels of urbanization, namely urban, suburban and rural. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to visualize the response of birds to the type of building. After that, the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the effect of the type of building on the diversity of bird species. The results showed that shrub cover affected species richness and abundance of birds. The building types with a height below 18 meters had a negative effect on the abundance and diversity of birds in suburban areas. The abundance of birds in urban areas was positively affected by the type of building with a height of between 18 and 30 meters. The existence of buildings in urban areas can reduce bird feed sources. Making spatial plans that provide more variety of plant cover and diversity of building heights are expected to increase bird diversity in urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirds 3acorrespondence analysis 3adigital elevation models 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aIndonesia 0aurban environment 0abird diversity 0abuilding size 0aurbanization 0aurban ecology1 aNurvianto, Sandy 0 tBiodiversitas.g2022 May, v. 23, no. 5dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2305603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245007700188300001600265520171600281592002801997653002302025653002302048653003202071653001702103653001302120653000902133653001902142653001302161653002002174653001702194700002502211700002502236700002302261773011902284856010102403852000902504655001202513IND60130877920221121050207.0151127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013087792DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[981:AIOWMI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManley, Scott W.10aAgronomic implications of waterfowl management in Mississippi ricefields  ap. 981-992.  aRicefields are important foraging habitat for waterfowl and other waterbirds in several North American wintering areas, including the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV). Rice growers are likely to adopt management practices that provide habitat for waterfowl if agronomic benefits also occur. Therefore, we conducted a replicated field experiment during autumn through spring 1995––1997 to study effects of postharvest field treatment and winter-water management on agronomic variables including biomass of residual rice straw, cool-season grasses and forbs (i.e., winter weeds), and viability of red rice (oryza sativa var.). The treatment combination of postharvest disking and flooding until early March reduced straw 68%%, from 9,938 kg/ha after harvest to 3,209 kg/ha in spring. Treatment combinations that included flooding until early March were most effective in suppressing winter weeds and decreased their biomass in spring by 83%% when compared to the average of other treatment combinations. Effects of treatment combinations on spring viability of red rice differed between winters, but no significant effects were found within winters. Autumn disking followed by flooding until early March reduced rice straw and suppressed winter weeds the most, but with additional costs. To obtain the most agronomic benefits, we recommend that rice growers forgo autumn disking and flood fields until early March, which will provide moderate straw reduction, good weed suppression, and predicted savings of $$22.24––62.93/ha (U.S.) ($$9.00––25.47/ac). Maintenance of floods on ricefields until early March also benefits waterfowl and other waterbirds by providing foraging habitat throughout winter.  aPublisher supplied data 0aagronomic benefits 0ahabitat management 0aMississippi Alluvial Valley 0aOryza sativa 0ared rice 0arice 0astraw disposal 0awetlands 0awinter flooding 0awinter weeds1 aKaminski, Richard M.1 aReinecke, Kenneth J.1 aGerard, Patrick D.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.981-992dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[981:AIOWMI]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014200163500001900305520177200324592002802096650000802124650001802132650002002150650000902170650002402179650001202203650001402215650002102229650001702250650002402267650001802291650002502309650001702334650002502351651001002376653001902386653002802405653002502433700001502458700001602473700001602489700001802505700001702523700001502540700001602555700001702571700001802588773011002606856008502716852000902801655001202810IND60713442320221119111748.0210212e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071344232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qian10aAssociation between traffic-related air pollution and hospital readmissions for rheumatoid arthritis in Hefei, China: A time-series study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAir pollution is an important risk factor for autoimmune diseases, but its association with the recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear so far. This study aimed to investigate the short-term association between traffic-related air pollutants and hospital readmissions for RA in Hefei, China. Data on daily hospital readmissions for RA and traffic-related air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO), from 2014 to 2018 were retrieved. A time-series approach using generalized linear regression model was employed. The analysis was further stratified by sex, age and season. A total of 1153 readmissions for RA were reported during the study period. A significant association between high-concentration PM₂.₅ (90th percentile) and RA readmissions was observed on lag1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.19) and lasted until lag3 (RR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.01–1.12). From lag2 to lag5, high-concentration NO₂ (90th percentile) was associated with increased risk of RA readmissions, with the highest RR observed at lag 4 (1.11, 95%CI: 1.05–1.17). Stratified analyses indicated that females and the elderly appeared to be more vulnerable to high-concentration PM₂.₅ and NO₂ exposure. High-concentration PM₂.₅ and NO₂ in cold seasons were consistently significantly associated with increased risk of RA readmissions. Exposure to high-concentration PM₂.₅ and NO₂ was associated with increased risk of RA readmissions. Protective measures against the exposure to high-concentration PM₂.₅ and NO₂ should be taken to reduce the recurrence risk in RA patients, especially in females, the elderly and during cold seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon monoxide 3acold 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3ahospitals 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3arelative risk 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arisk factors 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aAir pollutants 0aFine particulate matter 0aHospital readmission1 aXu, Zhiwei1 aDan, Yi-Lin1 aCheng, Jian1 aZhao, Chan-Na1 aMao, Yan-Mei1 aXiang, Kun1 aHu, Yu-Qian1 aHe, Yi-Sheng1 aPan, Hai-Feng0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115628-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03926naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003200129040001800161100002700179245017000206520198000376592002802356596000902384650001802393650004302411650002602454650001802480650002502498650001902523650001602542650002102558650002002579650001002599650002002609650002002629650001902649650002602668650001202694650001602706650001002722650001802732650001402750650001602764650002402780650001202804650002002816650001202836650001602848650000902864653001402873653001402887653001802901653001102919653001202930700002302942700002802965700001402993700002303007700002303030773012303053856007903176852000903255655001203264IND60672693320221122115526.0191017e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269332DNAL7 a10.3945/cdn.117.0019822chorus7 a10.3945/cdn.117.0019822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReznikov, Elizabeth A.10aDietary Bovine Lactoferrin Reduces Staphylococcus aureus in the Tissues and Modulates the Immune Response in Piglets Systemically Infected with Staphylococcus aureus  aBovine lactoferrin (bLf) reduces Staphylococcus aureus infection in premature infants and promotes the growth of Bifidobacterium infantis, a predominant infant gut species. We hypothesized bLf in combination with B. infantis would reduce the severity of systemic S. aureus infection. To determine the effects of oral administration of bLf and B. infantis on the course of systemic S. aureus infection. Colostrum-deprived piglets consumed formulas containing 4g/l whey (CON) or bLf (LF). Half were gavaged with B. infantis (10⁹ CFU/d) resulting in two additional groups (BI or COMB). On d7, piglets were intravenously injected with S. aureus. Blood samples were collected pre-infection and every 12h post-infection for immune analyses. Tissue samples were collected on d12 for analysis of bacterial abundance and gene expression. Pre-infection, LF piglets had lower serum IL-10, higher % lymphocytes and lower % neutrophils than BI or COMB. After infection, dietary bLf increased piglet weight gain, reduced staphylococcal counts in kidney and tended to lower staphylococcal counts in lung and heart. Dietary bLf also decreased kidney IL-10 and increased lung IFNγ mRNA. B. infantis increased splenic IFNγ expression. Renal toll-like receptor 2 was upregulated in BI piglets, but not in COMB piglets. Post-infection, BI piglets had increased serum IL-10 and decreased memory T cell populations. LF and COMB piglets had fewer circulating monocytes and B-cells than CON or BI piglets. Dietary bLf and B. infantis produced independent and tissue-specific effects. Piglets fed bLf alone or in combination with B. infantis mounted a more effective immune response and exhibited lower bacterial abundance, whereas B. infantis administration was associated with greater tissue bacterial abundance. This study provides biological underpinnings to the clinical benefits of bLf observed in preterm infants, but does not support B. infantis administration during S. aureus infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA 3aB-lymphocytes 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 2 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3adigestive system 3agene expression 3aheart 3aimmune response 3ainfant diseases 3ainterleukin-10 3aintravenous injection 3akidneys 3alactoferrin 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3aoral administration 3apiglets 3apremature birth 3atissues 3aweight gain 3awhey 0ainfection 0aprobiotic 0aimmune system 0asepsis 0aneonate1 aComstock, Sarah S.1 aHoeflinger, Jennifer L.1 aWang, Mei1 aMiller, Michael J.1 aDonovan, Sharon M.0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 2, no. 4dOxford University PresswJournal:27055x2475-29917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/cdn.117.0019823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001500308520132500323592002801648650001201676650001401688650001201702650001701714651001901731651001001750651001701760651001801777700001701795773009201812856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60085991020221122171256.0141101e20130114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008599102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jian-feng10aReconstructed droughts for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau since AD 1411 and its linkages to the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans  ap. 98-106.  aBased on the tree rings of Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii), this paper presents a Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruction (r = 0.578, p < 0.01) since AD 1411 for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Regional extreme dry years (<2SD) were found in 1451, 1455, 1480, 1488, 1490, 1591, 1649, 1770, 1776, 1824, 1831, 1879, 1922, 1927 and 1992, while extreme wet years (≥2SD) were not observed. Persistent decadal dry intervals were observed in the 1450s, 1480s, 1510s, 1580s–90s, 1680s–1720s, 1820s–40s, 1920s–30s and after 1990s, and decadal wet intervals in the 1410s, 1500s, 1540s–50s, 1610s–70s, 1750s–60s, 1790s–1800s, 1880s–1910s, 1960s–80s. Regional droughts evident in the reconstruction appear to be relatively consistent with the drought history of the entire arid northeastern TP to the north indicated by previous studies. Spectral peaks of 2.1–5.9 years may be indicative of ENSO and IOD activity, as also suggested by negative correlations with SSTs in the eastern equatorial and southeastern Pacific Ocean and the northern Indian Ocean. Significant multi-decadal spectral peaks of 31.1–36.6 years and 41–53.8 years were identified and indicated that the decadal-scale variability may be linked to SST variations in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aJuniperus 3adrought 3agrowth rings 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aChina 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean1 aLiu, Yu-zhen0 tQuaternary international.g2013 Jan. 14, v. 283 p.98-106dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03970naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008600175300001600261520237000277592002802647650001302675650001802688650001902706650002002725650001102745650001802756650001202774650001902786650002202805650001802827650002002845650002302865650001502888653000802903653000702911653000902918653000802927653000802935653000802943653000902951653000802960653000802968653000902976653001802985653001903003653001803022653002103040653002803061653000803089700001803097700001903115700002203134700002003156773008603176856008503262852000903347655001203356IND60542466220221118185324.0190403e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054246622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2014.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShruthi, Rajesh B.V.10aQuantifying temporal changes in gully erosion areas with object oriented analysis  ap. 262-277.  aMapping gully systems and quantifying their changes over time are essential for implementing soil conservation measures. The aim of this study is to analyze the changes in the gully systems in the context of land management. Image analysis of remotely sensed data in combination with field verification has proven to be a good and practical approach for mapping gully features over large areas, given the variability in gully size, shape and occurrence. Recent work has shown object-based image analysis also termed as object oriented analysis (OOA) to be superior to pixel-based methods for the identification and characterization of gullies. This study presents an improved procedure to map gully features, one that has been extended to assess and quantify erosion area dynamics. In addition to the convention of using suitable topographic and spectral thresholds in the method, the use of contrast and edge filter information and process knowledge of erosion by overland flow was incorporated in the rule-set to help recognize potential gullies in Ikonos-2 and GeoEye-1 data. Changes in the area enclosed by the gully system boundary estimated for three different sub-watersheds (SW1, SW2 and SW3), observed over a period of eight years ranged from moderate (11% in SW2 and 21% in SW1) to a very high increase (91% in SW3). However, the changes seen in gully system density were much higher than the changes in the area enclosed by the gully system boundary (81%, 104% and 109% in the respective SWs). The complex gully systems were better identified semi-automatically than was possible by manual digitization; in particular the finer edges of the gully systems, which in turn led to better quantification of changes in the gully systems. The study also determined that the rule-set developed for gully feature extraction is more sensitive to the spatial resolution of the imagery used than the quality or resolution of the digital terrain model and its derivatives. Determining suitable segmentation parameters, selecting appropriate object features for the classification, the thresholds used retain the trial & error aspects in this analysis. This limits its application to a regional scale. The rule-set developed is generic and transferable to other region/imagery with adaptation. The rule-set will be made available on our website (www.itc.nl/OOA-group).  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3agully erosion 3aimage analysis 3aland management 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aravines 3aremote sensing 3asoil conservation 3asubwatersheds 3asystem boundary 3atemporal variation 3atopography 0aESP 0aFD 0aGLCM 0aGSB 0aHRI 0aOOA 0aPAGO 0aSCA 0aSPI 0aSTcI 0aGully erosion 0aGully dynamics 0aGully density 0aChange detection 0aHigh resolution imagery 0aOOA1 aKerle, Norman1 aJetten, Victor1 aAbdellah, Laouina1 aMachmach, Issam0 tCatena.g2015 May, v. 128 p.262-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009500164500001400259520164800273592002801921650002001949650001101969650001601980650001701996651001902013651001102032651001302043700001802056700002002074773011802094856007602212852000902288655001202297IND60724494520221123001758.0210122e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072449452DNAL7 a10.3390/land100100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWnęk, Agnieszka 10aNational Level Land-Use Changes in Functional Urban Areas in Poland, Slovakia, and Czechia  aNAL-light  aLand-use and cover change (LUCC) impacts global environmental changes. Therefore, it is crucial to obtain cross-national level LUCC data that represents past and actual LUCC. As urban areas exhibit the most significant dynamics of the changes, accompanied by such processes as urban sprawl, it seems desirable to take into account LUCC information from such areas to acquire national level information. The paper analyses land-use changes (LUCs) in urban areas in Czechia, Poland, and Slovakia. The analysis is based on functional urban area (FUA) data from the European Urban Atlas project for 2006 and 2012. The area of urbanised land grew at the expense of agricultural areas, semi-natural areas, and wetlands over the investigated period in all three countries. The authors determined LUC direction models in urban areas based on the identified land-use change. The proposed LUC direction models for the investigated period and area should offer national level LUC data for such purposes as modelling of future changes or can be the point of reference for planning analyses. The paper proposes the following models: mean model, median model, weighted mean model where the weight is the urbanised to vegetated area ratio, and weighted mean model where the weight is the share of urbanised areas. According to the proposed LUC models, areas considered as urbanised grow in FUAs on average in six years by 5.5900‰ in Czechia, 7.5936‰ in Poland, and 4.0769‰ in Slovakia. Additionally, the change models facilitated determination of a LUC dynamics ratio in each country. It reached the highest values in Poland and the lowest in Slovakia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3amodels 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aCzech Republic 3aPoland 3aSlovakia1 aKudas, Dawid 1 aStych, Premysl 0 tLand.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100100393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017400167300001600341520055100357592002800908650001400936650001100950650001200961650001300973650002300986651001201009653001901021653001801040653002201058653001601080653001701096700001901113700002501132773012401157856008201281852000901363655001201372IND60778238220221122143848.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077823822DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n40.2022.a92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokni, Ridha El10aFirst record of the Southern African endemic Ruschia uncinata (L.)

It is therefore crucial to understand how environmental pollutants affect animal microbiomes, especially for those chemicals that are designed to target microbes. Here, we study the effects of two biocidal nanoparticles (NPs) (Ag and CuO) on the soil bacterial community and the resident gut microbiome of the earthworm Eisenia fetida over a 28-day period using metabarcoding techniques. Exposures to NPs were conducted following OECD test guidelines and effects on earthworm reproduction and juvenile biomass were additionally recorded in order to compare effects on the host to effects on microbiomes. By employing a full concentration series, we were able to link pollutants to microbiome effects in high resolution. Multivariate analysis, differential abundance analysis and species sensitivity distribution analysis showed that Ag-NPs are more toxic to soil bacteria than CuO-NPs. In contrast to the strong effects of CuO-NPs and Ag-NPs on the soil bacterial community, the earthworm gut microbiome is largely resilient to exposure to biocidal NPs. Despite this buffering effect, CuO-NPs did negatively affect the relative abundance of some earthworm symbionts, including ‘Candidatus Lumbricincola’. Changes in the soil bacterial community and the earthworm microbiome occur at total copper concentrations often found or modelled to occur in agricultural fields, demonstrating that soil bacterial communities and individual taxa in the earthworm microbiome may be at risk from environmental copper exposure including in nanomaterial form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aEisenia fetida 3abiomass 3aearthworms 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajuveniles 3amicrobiome 3amultivariate analysis 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil bacteria 3atoxicity 0aNanoparticles 0aMetals1 aGoodall, Tim1 aKille, Peter1 aSpurgeon, David J.1 aSvendsen, Claus0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Dec., v. 267 p.115633-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001200271520180200283592002802085650003602113650001602149650001902165650001702184650002502201650001702226650001802243650001802261650001002279650001002289650001602299650001402315650002002329650004302349650001302392650002402405653000802429653003602437653001302473653001002486653001302496700002202509700001602531700002502547700002102572700001902593700001802612700001702630700001402647700001702661700001902678700002402697700002002721773011302741856008302854852000902937655001202946IND60783702520221122025024.0220801e20221220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarosova, Rea10aCytokine expression by CD163+ monocytes in healthy and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae-infected pigs  ap. 1-9.  aDistinct monocyte subpopulations have been previously described in healthy pigs and pigs experimentally infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). The CD163+ subpopulation of bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) and lung monocytes was found to play an important role in the inflammatory process. The inflammation is accompanied by elevation of inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of CD163+ monocytes and macrophages to cytokine production during APP-induced lung inflammation. Cytokine production was assessed by flow cytometry (FC) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in CD163+ monocytes and by qPCR, immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN). Despite the systemic inflammatory response after APP infection, BM and PB CD163+ monocytes did not express elevated levels of a wide range of cytokines compared to control pigs. In contrast, significant amounts of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α were produced in lung lesions and IL-1β in the TBLN. At the protein level, TNF-α was expressed by both CD163+ monocytes and macrophages in lung lesions, whereas IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 expression was found only in CD163+ monocytes; no CD163+ macrophages were found to produce these cytokines. Furthermore, the quantification of CD163+ monocytes expressing the two cytokines IL-1β and IL-8 that were most elevated was performed. In lung lesions, 36.5% IL-1β positive CD163+ monocytes but only 18.3% IL-8 positive CD163+ monocytes were found. In conclusion, PB and BM CD163+ monocytes do not appear to contribute to the elevated cytokine levels in plasma. On the other hand, CD163+ monocytes contribute to inflammatory cytokine expression, especially IL-1β at the site of inflammation during the inflammatory process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3abone marrow 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alungs 3alymph 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine 0aPig 0aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 0aMonocyte 0aCD163 0aCytokine1 aOndrackova, Petra1 aLeva, Lenka1 aNedbalcova, Katerina1 aVicenova, Monika1 aMašek, Josef,1 aVolf, Jiří,1 aGebauer, Jan1 aDo, Tomas1 aGuran, Roman1 aSladek, Zbysek1 aDomínguez, Javier,1 aFaldyna, Martin0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Dec. 20, v. 152 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014000170520142500310592002801735650002701763650002501790650001701815650002701832650001701859650001601876650000701892650001701899650002001916650001401936650001901950700001701969700001801986700001602004700002102020700001502041700001402056773012702070856008702197852000902284655001202293IND60781020620221122073924.0220623e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078102062DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100610912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Zhijin 10aAchieving “Non-Foaming” Rhamnolipid Production and Productivity Rebounds of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under Weakly Acidic Fermentation  aThe rhamnolipid production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been impeded by its severe foaming; overcoming the bottleneck of foaming has become the most urgent requirement for rhamnolipid production in recent decades. In this study, we performed rhamnolipid fermentation under weakly acidic conditions to address this bottleneck. The results showed that the foaming behavior of rhamnolipid fermentation broths was pH-dependent with the foaming ability decreasing from 162.8% to 28.6% from pH 8 to 4. The “non-foaming” rhamnolipid fermentation can be realized at pH 5.5, but the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids was significantly inhibited. Further, rhamnolipid yield rebounded from 8.1 g/L to 15.4 g/L after ultraviolet and ethyl methanesulfonate compound mutagenesis. The mechanism study showed that the species changes of rhamnolipid homologs did not affect the foaming behavior of the fermentation but had a slight effect on the bioactivity of rhamnolipids. At pH 8.0 to 5.0, increased surface tension, decreased viscosity and zeta potential, and aggregation of rhamnolipid molecules contributed to the “non-foaming” rhamnolipid fermentation. This study provides a promising avenue for the “non-foaming” rhamnolipid fermentation and elucidates the mechanisms involved, facilitating the understanding of pH-associated foaming behavior and developing a more efficient strategy for achieving rhamnolipid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3afermentation 3amutagenesis 3apH 3arhamnolipids 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 3azeta potential1 aHe, Qiuhong 1 aLiu, Jinfeng 1 aZhou, Jing 1 aChe, Chengchuan 1 aSi, Meiru 1 aYang, Ge 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 May 25, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100610913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04115naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245012600210506011700336506007600453520227800529592002802807506003702835650001602872650001202888650001802900650002402918650001602942650001402958650001102972650001402983650000902997650001403006650001703020650001303037650001203050650002503062650001503087651001203102653001203114653004303126653002103169653002803190653002303218700005903241700002103300700006303321773010803384856008403492852000903576655001203585IND60778848320221207103819.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlabi, Tunrayo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5142-699010aEstimation of soybean grain yield from multispectral high-resolution UAV data with machine learning models in West Africa  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a leguminous and oil crop with rapidly growing importance and demand in Africa following the increasing demand for oil and livestock and poultry feed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, soybean productivity is low in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, especially in West Africa, where productivity is below one ton per ha. Hence, concerted soybean varietal development and testing efforts have been underway by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), collaborating with the various African and US-based soybean breeding programs. Integrating new varietal evaluation approaches based on advanced phenotyping techniques into IITA's soybean breeding program is crucial for designing efficient crop genetic improvement techniques. Hence, this work aims to investigate machine learning (ML) models and Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aid rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow for soybean yield estimation. We acquired multispectral images through a Sequoia® camera aboard a senseFly eBee X UAV from five variety trials during the 2020 growing season in Nigeria. UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features were generated by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and integrated to predict crop grain yield using five machine learning (ML) regression models, including Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The main findings are the textural information generated using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) slightly outperformed predictors based mainly on vegetation indices (VI) and provided a promising alternative to the conventional use of VI in crop yield estimation. All the five ML models performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for all the soybean trials investigated, though the Cubist and RF model stood out, with R² reaching 0.89. The study provides a framework to perform crop breeding trial assessments more effectively and consistently at high spatial scales that African crop breeding programs did not commonly apply. The workflow can also be successfully modified and applied for high throughput phenotyping of breeding platforms in other crops.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3acameras 3acanopy height 3agenetic improvement 3agrain yield 3alivestock 3amodels 3aoil crops 3aoils 3aphenotype 3apoultry feed 3asoybeans 3atexture 3atropical agriculture 3avegetation 3aNigeria 0aSoybean 0aGray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) 0aYield prediction 0aMachine learning models 0aVegetation indices1 aAbebe, Abush T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9245-360X1 aChigeza, Godfree1 aFowobaje, Kayode R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3995-160X0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.100782-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245017200169520243400341592002802775650001502803650001202818650001502830650001302845650001502858651000902873653002402882653001802906653002002924653003302944653002002977653004602997700006103043700002203104700002203126773010803148856008403256852000903340655001203349IND60778848420221118040155.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbrahimy, Hamid10aEffectiveness of the integration of data balancing techniques and tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms for spatially-explicit land cover accuracy prediction  aClassification of remote sensing images has become a common practice in providing land use/land cover (LULC) maps. Among the main elements of a successful LC mapping task, accuracy assessment significantly influences the quality of decisions taken by the end users and prevents potential misinterpretations. The use of conventional accuracy assessment approaches often overlooks the spatial variation of LC accuracy. In this manner, per-pixel land cover accuracy (PLCA) mapping which provides spatially-explicit accuracy information of classified remote sensing images, emerged as a viable alternative to the traditional accuracy assessment approaches. This study comprehensively compared three tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms including random forest (RF), rotation forest (RoF), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) for PLCA mapping. Moreover, considering the efficiency of the LC mapping practices, there are normally more instances linked with correctly classified pixels than incorrectly classified pixels in a given LC map. This condition leads to a serious challenge for PLCA mapping known as the class imbalance problem. Accordingly, this study also examined the feasibility of coupling three data balancing (DB) techniques (random over-sampling (ROS), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic sampling approach for unbalanced learning (ADASYN)) with the selected PLCA mapping algorithms for addressing the class imbalance problem. The experiments were employed on five different Sentinel-2 images with 20 km × 20 km dimensions acquired at different times and parts of Iran. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), geometric mean (GM), and overall accuracy (OA) were used to assess performance of the employed PLCA mapping methods. Among the PLCA mapping methods, RF-SMOTE was ranked first (with an average, AUROC = 0.84, AUPRC = of 0.91, GM = 0.81, and OA = 0.82), and was followed by RF-ADASYN and RoF-SMOTE. The results showed that integration of the SMOTE technique with the RF algorithm was the most successful practice for improving the performance of PLCA mapping and significantly outperformed all the algorithms without integration of DB techniques. As the PLCA maps provide the LULC's accuracy locally, they can be of significant use in refining the LULC mapping practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aforests 3aland cover 3aland use 3aprediction 3aIran 0aAccuracy assessment 0aRandom forest 0aRotation forest 0aStochastic gradient boosting 0aClass imbalance 0aSynthetic minority oversampling technique1 aMirbagheri, Babak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4161-15401 aMatkan, Ali Akbar1 aAzadbakht, Mohsen0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.100785-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011600167520110500283592002801388650001601416650002601432650001801458650001001476650001201486650003001498650001101528650001601539650002101555650001501576650001601591651001001607653001301617653001601630653001101646653001001657653001901667700001601686700001701702700001501719700001601734700001601750773011901766856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60783702720221122024619.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1047292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zixi10aFirst fossil record of Castanopsis (Fagaceae) from the middle Miocene Fotan Group of Fujian, southeastern China  aFagaceae have a long fossil history that can be dated back to the Late Cretaceous.

Castanopsis (Fagaceae) species are the dominant trees of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests and some tropical forests. They are used for timber and have medicinal and edible uses. Here, we describe two species, Castanopsis zhoui sp. nov. and C. cf. chinensis, based on fossil leaves with cuticle features recovered from the middle Miocene of Fujian Province, Southeast China. Our fossils enrich the Neogene fossil record of this genus in regions that contain the greatest diversity of its extant species in China and southern and southeastern Asia. Castanopsis species grow today in tropical to subtropical evergreen forests with a mean annual temperature ranging from 13 °C to 27 °C. The occurrence of Castanopsis zhoui sp. nov. and C. cf. chinensis confirms previous paleoclimate estimates of Zhangpu flora using the leaf physiognomy method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanopsis 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aMiocene epoch 3aflora 3afossils 3ageographical distribution 3aleaves 3apaleobotany 3apaleoclimatology 3apalynology 3atemperature 3aChina 0aFagaceae 0aCastanopsis 0aFujian 0aChina 0aMiddle Miocene1 aWu, Xieting1 aSun, Bainian1 aYin, Suxin1 aQuan, Cheng1 aShi, Gongle0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 Oct., v. 305 p.104729-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1047293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006000206300001600266500002900282520038400311592002800695650001500723650001100738650001400749650001300763650001500776650001000791650002400801650002400825650000900849653001700858653001400875653001000889653002100899653002200920700005700942773011600999856008301115852000901198655001201207IND60707474320221117032146.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070747432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2020.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgerer, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3304-072510aConfronting the Modern Gordian Knot of Urban Beekeeping  ap. 956-959.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aWith insect population declines, cities are important habitats for wild pollinators.

Whether there is a general function for asRNA is unknown, but its widespread occurrence and frequent regulation by stress suggest an important role. The best-characterized plant gene exhibiting a complex antisense transcript pattern is the Arabidopsis floral regulator FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Changes occur in the accumulation, splicing, and polyadenylation of this antisense transcript, termed COOLAIR, in different environments and genotypes. These changes are associated with altered chromatin regulation and differential FLC expression, provoking mechanistic comparisons with many well-studied loci in yeast and mammals. Detailed analysis of these specific examples may shed light on the complex interplay between asRNA and chromatin modifications in different genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantisense RNA 3achromatin 3aflowering 3agenes 3agenotype 3aloci 3amammals 3ayeasts1 aWu, Zhe1 aDean, Caroline0 tTrends in genetics.g2012 Sept., v. 28, no. 9 p.445-453dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001300197245008800210300001800298506007600316520161700392592002802009506003702037650000802074650003002082650001402112650001102126650001402137650001702151650001602168650001902184650001502203650002102218650001802239650001602257650000902273650001902282650001402301650001902315650003202334700001802366700001102384700002002395700001902415700001802434700001802452700001902470773008802489856009002577852000902667655001202676IND60090346020221207085226.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009034602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0372doi7 aPMC38077982pmcid7 a216652672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hong10aDelivery of calf thymus DNA to tumor by folate receptor targeted cationic liposomes  ap. 6614-6620.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCalf thymus DNA (ctDNA) has been shown to stimulate macrophages to produce cytokines both in vitro and in vivo when complexed with cationic liposomes. In addition, direct cytotoxicity of ctDNA has been found in tissue culture and in mice. In this study, ctDNA and folate receptor targeted cationic liposome complexes (ctDNA-F-CLs) were prepared and evaluated in FR (+) tumors. In addition, the underlying mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of ctDNA-F-CLs was investigated. Selective uptake of ctDNA-F-CLs was observed in FR (+) KB and L1210JF cells using flow cytometry. In RAW264.7 cells and DBA/2 mice, ctDNA-F-CLs and ctDNA-N-CLs significantly induced TNF-α and IL-6 production compared to free ctDNA. However, no significant difference in cytokine production was observed between ctDNA-N-CLs and ctDNA-F-CLs. In tumor bearing DBA/2 mice, ctDNA-F-CLs significantly increased INF-γ and IL-6 production compared to ctDNA-N-CLs. Furthermore in L1210JF cells, ctDNA-F-CLs had significantly increased cytotoxicity compared to ctDNA-N-CLs. Tumor cell apoptosis was also found in co-culture of RAW264.7 cells and ctDNA-F-CLs treated L1210JF cells. In L1210JF tumor bearing mice, ctDNA-F-CLs were found to significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the median survival time (MeST). In contrast, ctDNA-N-CLs and free ctDNA showed similar activities for tumor inhibition and animal survival. Moreover, the anti-cancer effect of ctDNA-F-CL was further enhanced by combination with anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. These results suggest that ctDNA-F-CLs are a promising agent for treatment of FR-positive tumors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acalves 3acoculture 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3aflow cytometry 3afolic acid 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3atissue culture 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aPiao, Longzhu1 aYu, Bo1 aYung, Bryant C.1 aZhang, Wenpeng1 aWang, Peng G.1 aLee, James L.1 aLee, Robert J.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Sept., v. 32, no. 27 p.6614-6620dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245005900159300001800218520104300236592002801279650001301307650001101320650001001331650001601341650001401357650002201371651001001393651001501403700001701418773011901435856008101554852000901635655001201644IND60580072220221120154006.0170908e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058007222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-6031-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Lin10aBenthic harpacticoid copepods of Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao  ap. 1127-1133.  aThe species richness of benthic harpacticoid copepod fauna in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, on the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula, has not been comprehensively studied. We present a preliminary inventory of species for this region based on material found in nine sediment samples collected from 2011 to 2012. Our list includes 15 species belonging to 15 genera in 9 families, the most speciose family was the Miraciidae Dana, 1846 (seven species); all other families were represented by single species only. Sediment characteristics and depth are determined to be important environmental determinants of harpacticoid distribution in this region. We briefly detail the known distributions of species and provide a key to facilitate their identification. Both harpacticoid species richness and the species/genus ratio in Jiaozhou Bay are lower than in Bohai Gulf and Gwangyang Bay. The poor knowledge of the distribution of benthic harpacticoids, in addition to low sampling effort in Jiaozhou Bay, likely contribute to low species richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3acoasts 3afauna 3ainventories 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aLi, Xinzheng0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.1127-1133dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-6031-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012700167520180900294592002802103650002202131650002402153650001102177650002302188650001102211650001802222650001902240650001902259650001802278650001802296650000902314650001102323650001702334650001602351650001502367653003202382653001402414653001502428653001002443653002502453700001502478700001702493700001502510700001802525700001602543773011702559856008602676852000902762655001202771IND60778572520221120133921.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Feng-Li10aAqueous-phase hydrogenation of α-pinene catalyzed by Ni-B alloys loaded on a Janus amphiphilic carbon@silica nanomaterial  aA Janus amphiphilic carbon@silicon double-framework nanomaterial having an inner cavity, a hydrophobic N-doped carbon inner layer, and a hydrophilic silica outerlayer was prepared. Ni-B alloy nanoparticles were loaded on the amphiphilic carbon@silicon nanomaterial and used for catalyzing α-pinene hydrogenation in aqueous media. The hollow structure of the nanomaterial yielded a large specific surface area, which was beneficial for mass transfer and substrate enrichment, the doping of N atoms in the inner carbon skeleton allowed the attachment of additional metal nanoparticles, and the hydrophilic silica outer shell improved the stability and dispersion of the catalyst in the aqueous system. Crucially, in a water/oil two-phase reaction system, the amphiphilic nanocatalyst acted as a solid foaming agent, thus promoting the dissolution of H₂ and substrate contact. Further, the synergy between Ni and B significantly improved the catalytic activity, and a kinetic study revealed the low activation energy for α-pinene hydrogenation over the prepared catalyst. DFT calculations indicate the transition states with low energy barriers. Further, the catalytic activity of our non-noble-metal nanocatalyst was comparable to that of noble metal Ru and Pd catalysts. Under mild conditions (80 °C, 1.0 MPa H₂, 3 h), 99.0% α-pinene was converted to cis-pinane with 98.5% selectivity, and the developed amphiphilic Ni-B nanocatalyst also showed excellent recyclability as a result of the high dispersion and stability of the Ni-B nanoparticles on the carbon@silicon nanomaterial. The study provides a new green and efficient way for the deep processing and utilization of turpentine resources, and provides a guidance for the expansion of water-phase non-noble metal catalytic reaction types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3ananocatalysts 3aoils 3asilica 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3aturpentine 0aAqueous-phase hydrogenation 0aα-pinene 0acis-pinane 0aAlloy 0aAmphiphilic catalyst1 aShi, Yi-Lu1 aWu, Fang-Zhu1 aYuan, Bing1 aXie, Cong-Xia1 aYu, Shi-Tao0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 185 p.115140-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013900168520097000307592002801277650002601305650002601331650001501357650001501372650002001387650001201407650001301419650001101432650002101443650002701464650002201491653001301513653001201526653002601538653002501564653002201589700001501611700001601626700001701642700001401659700001301673700001501686700001301701773011701714856008601831852000901917655001201926IND60778572620221120134051.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1151442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xianfeng10aPreparation and characterization of sustainable osthole@guar gum composite film and antifungal mechanism against Ustilaginoidea virens  aThe purpose of this study is to develop a new safe and sustainable technology to reduce the excessive dependence on chemical pesticides in crop protection fields.

Few studies have been conducted on this species, and even fewer have explored its ophthalmological characteristics. Vision is critical to wild canids; thus, this study aimed to provide a morphoquantitative description of the bulbar conjunctiva of the maned wolf using cytological and histological analyses. Ten healthy maned wolves from a conservational centre, including 4 females and 6 males aged 1–12 years (6.5 ± 2.8), were included in the study. The samples for cytological analysis were collected from the inferior conjunctival sac using a cytobrush, and conjunctival tissue was collected for histological analysis from the temporal canthus zone. The cytological samples were stained using the Papanicolaou method, and the histological sections were stained using haematoxylin and eosin, Periodic acid–Schiff, picrosirius red and Masson's trichrome stains. The cytological samples were studied for stain quality, and the different cell types were counted. Histological examination was used to determine tissue types in the conjunctiva and their proportions. Analyses revealed a stratified squamous epithelium with some goblet cells and eventual pigmentation in the basal layer. Loose connective tissue with the presence of some mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells was also observed. The epithelium of the maned wolf's bulbar conjunctiva resembles that of dogs and other carnivore species; furthermore, its physiological and pathological responses were similar to those of other carnivore species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/23081‐7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a1267979cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a1644172cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aChrysocyon brachyurus 3acarnivores 3acerrado 3aconjunctiva 3aeosin 3ahistology 3alacrimal apparatus 3apigmentation 3avision1 aEstrela, Giselli Capareli1 aSoares, Roberta Teixeira Gomes1 aPaulino, Daniel, JrcJr1 aJorge, Adriana Torrecilhas1 aRodrigues, Marcela Aldrovani1 ade Castro Sasahara, Taís Harumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4871-56251 ados Santos Honsho, Cristiane0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2021 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.439-447dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.126473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006000164300001800224520104300242592002801285650002201313650001101335650001301346650001401359650001901373650001501392650001601407650002101423700002101444773012201465856008201587852000901669655001201678IND60627402920221120140830.0220310e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062740292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2433-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilshire, B.10aCreep and creep fracture of commercial aluminium alloys  ap. 3992-4000.  aUsing standard power law equations, creep rate and creep life measurements at 373–463 K are analysed for a series of aluminium alloys, namely, 2419, 2124, 8090 and 7010. The seemingly complex behaviour patterns are easily rationalized through a modified power law expression, which incorporates the activation energy for lattice diffusion in the alloy matrices (145 kJ mol⁻¹) and the value of the ultimate tensile stress at the creep temperature. By considering the changes in microstructure and creep curve shape as the test duration and temperature increase, all results are then interpreted straightforwardly in terms of the processes shown to govern strain accumulation and damage evolution. Moreover, the data rationalization procedures are also included in new relationships which superimpose the property sets onto sigmoidal ‘master curves’, allowing accurate prediction of the 100,000 h creep-rupture strengths of 2124 by extrapolation of creep lives determined from tests having a maximum duration of only around 1000 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aequations 3amicrostructure 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atensile strength1 aScharning, P.

Increasing application rates of SS and SSBC (2, 5, and 10 %) decreased PAH availability and, correspondingly, PAH accumulation (22–39 and 48–62 %, respectively) into tomato. SSBC was more effective in this regard. The available concentrations of PAHs (Σ16PAH) in the SSBC treatments were significantly reduced (from 30.0–47.3 %) as compared to the control treatment. The availability of high-molecular-weight PAHs (containing four to six benzene rings) was greatly affected, while low-molecular-weight PAHs (containing two to three benzene rings) was less affected by SSBC amendments. The addition of SSBC showed the least effect on bioaccumulation of naphthalene (two-ring PAH; 24.5–32.6 %), while the highest effect was observed for benzo(b)fluoranthene (five-ring PAH; 3.1–86.8 %) and benzo(g,h,i)perylene (six-ring PAH; 51.8–84.2 %). In contrast, increasing application rates of SS successively increased PTE (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) availability and accumulation (15–139 %) into tomato while SSBC successively decreased PTE availability and accumulation (17–91 %). Changes in accumulation varied with PTE and the extent to which PTE concentrations in soil was elevated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aapplication rate 3aarsenic 3abenzene 3abioaccumulation 3abiochar 3acadmium 3acopper 3afruits 3alead 3anaphthalene 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asewage sludge 3atomatoes 3atoxic substances 3aurban soils 3azinc1 aLi, Gang1 aK̲h̲ān, Sardār,1 aShamshad, Isha1 aReid, Brian J.1 aQamar, Zahir1 aChao, Cai0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Aug., v. 22, no. 16 p.12114-12123dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4432-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04071naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009800205300001100303520237000314592002802684596005402712596008202766650001902848650001502867650001802882650001502900650002102915650002002936650002002956650002002976650003102996650002203027650001203049650001303061650001403074650001903088650002203107650001003129650002903139650002003168650001803188700001803206700001903224700001403243700001803257700001703275700001603292773012903308856008303437852000903520655001203529IND60770639720221122001517.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077063972DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-021-00672-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmiñana, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0495-709910aUnveiling how vitrification affects the porcine blastocyst: clues from a transcriptomic study  ap. 46.  aBACKGROUND: Currently, there is a high demand for efficient pig embryo cryopreservation procedures in the porcine industry as well as for genetic diversity preservation and research purposes. To date, vitrification (VIT) is the most efficient method for pig embryo cryopreservation. Despite a high number of embryos survives in vitro after vitrification/warming procedures, the in vivo embryo survival rates after embryo transfer are variable among laboratories. So far, most studies have focused on cryoprotective agents and devices, while the VIT effects on porcine embryonic gene expression remained unclear. The few studies performed were based on vitrified/warmed embryos that were cultured in vitro (IVC) to allow them to re–expand. Thus, the specific alterations of VIT, IVC, and the cumulative effect of both remained unknown. To unveil the VIT-specific embryonic alterations, gene expression in VIT versus (vs.) IVC embryos was analyzed. Additionally, changes derived from both VIT and IVC vs. control embryos (CO) were analyzed to confirm the VIT embryonic alterations. Three groups of in vivo embryos at the blastocyst stage were analyzed by RNA–sequencing: (1) VIT embryos (vitrified/warmed and cultured in vitro), (2) IVC embryos and (3) CO embryos. RESULTS: RNA–sequencing revealed three clearly different mRNA profiles for VIT, IVC and CO embryos. Comparative analysis of mRNA profiles between VIT and IVC identified 321, differentially expressed genes (DEG) (FDR < 0.006). In VIT vs. CO and IVC vs. CO, 1901 and 1519 DEG were found, respectively, with an overlap of 1045 genes. VIT-specific functional alterations were associated to response to osmotic stress, response to hormones, and developmental growth. While alterations in response to hypoxia and mitophagy were related to the sum of VIT and IVC effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed new insights into the VIT procedure-specific alterations of embryonic gene expression by first comparing differences in VIT vs. IVC embryos and second by an integrative transcriptome analysis including in vivo control embryos. The identified VIT alterations might reflect the transcriptional signature of the embryo cryodamage but also the embryo healing process overcoming the VIT impacts. Selected validated genes were pointed as potential biomarkers that may help to improve vitrification.  aPublisher supplied data  aIMAGE-677353-2.chorizon 2020 framework programme  aSLAAM-COST-STSM-BM1308-36887.ceuropean cooperation in science and technology 3aanimal science 3abiomarkers 3abiotechnology 3ablastocyst 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aembryo transfer 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3ahypoxia 3aindustry 3amitophagy 3aosmotic stress 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avitrification1 aDubuisson, F.1 aBauersachs, S.1 aRoyer, E.1 aMermillod, P.1 aBlesbois, E.1 aGuignot, F.0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2022 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-021-00672-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014100166300002000307520128100327592002801608650002301636650001701659650002301676650001401699650002301713650001001736650001201746650001601758650002501774650001001799650001601809650001401825650001801839650000901857650001101866651001001877700001501887700001701902700001601919700001501935773014901950856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60440175720221119150251.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044017572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4470-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhongjie10aIsolation and characterization of a new reported cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya bijugata coproducing odorous geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol  ap. 12133-12140.  aThe earthy-musty compounds geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) produced by cyanobacteria are considered as the main biological causes of off-flavor events, especially in aquatic ecosystems. More than 50 filamentous cyanobacteria species have been documented as geosmin or MIB producers; however, little is known about the species coproducing these two metabolites. In this study, an epiphytic sample was collected from a river in Hubei, China. Three isolated strains (A2, B2, and B4) producing earthy odors were successfully isolated and identified as the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya bijugata Anagnostidis et Komárek 1988 based on morphology and 16S rDNA sequences. Gas chromatography analysis confirmed that the isolated L. bijugata strains were geosmin and MIB coproducers, with accumulation ranging from 13.6 to 22.4 and 12.3 to 57.5 μg L⁻¹, respectively. The partial fragments of geosmin and MIB synthesis genes in the L. bijugata strains were cloned and sequenced. Further sequences and phylogenetic analysis indicated the high conservation and a common origin of these genes in cyanobacteria. This study is the first to report and characterize the coproduction of geosmin and MIB by L. bijugata, representing a new source for potential risk of off-flavor events.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-methylisoborneol 3aLeptolyngbya 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aepiphytes 3agas chromatography 3agenes 3ageosmin 3ametabolites 3anucleotide sequences 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3arisk 3arivers 3aChina1 aXiao, Peng1 aSong, Gaofei1 aLi, Yeguang1 aLi, Renhui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Aug., v. 22, no. 16 p.12133-12140dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4470-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04278naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012000215300001600335500001900351520236000370592002802730596002602758596003602784596003102820650001202851650000902863650001602872650001602888650002102904650002302925650002002948650002702968650001602995650001703011650000903028650001903037650001703056650002603073700007303099700002603172700003303198700003103231700006403262700006903326700007203395700006703467773012303534856008203657852000903739655001203748IND60734193120221121050634.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073419312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-020-10146-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sousa, Sylvia Morais1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8030-138510aTropical Bacillus Strains Inoculation Enhances Maize Root Surface Area, Dry Weight, Nutrient Uptake and Grain Yield  ap. 867-877.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rising demand for agricultural commodities in developing countries has put increasing pressure on land resources for higher yields, with associated growth in the demand for phosphate fertilizers. However, there are a number of adverse environmental impacts associated with the use of inorganic P fertilizers that is pushing global fertilizer prices up. In this context, phosphate solubilizing microorganisms, such as Bacillus, are the most eco-friendly and inexpensive option for enhancing P availability for plants, once they are capable of transforming insoluble P into soluble (plant accessible) forms and are regarded as plant growth-promoting microorganisms. This work aimed to understand the effect of tropical Bacillus strains on maize root morphology and growth using a hydroponic system and to evaluate their performance under two phosphorus fertilization conditions in the field. Maize root was inoculated separately with six Bacillus strains and grown in nutrient solution. Several root traits, dry weight and nutrient content were measured in maize seedlings. Moreover, we measured bacterial IAA-like molecules in vitro production and evaluated inoculated maize performance under field conditions with no P added (P0) and triple superphosphate (TSP) soil fertilization. All the Bacillus strains increased shoot and total dry weight and strains B2084, B119 and B32 had the greatest performance, producing the highest biomass, shoot nutrient content and root surface area compared to other strains in hydroponics. All strains that produced IAA-like molecules demonstrated a positive effect on plant growth by stimulating root elongation. In the field experiments, strain B116 inoculation increased maize yield and P grain accumulation by around 36% and 58%, respectively, and B119 increased P grain in 21% in soils with no P added. Even in soils fertilized with TSP, maize yield increase and P grain accumulation was around 20% after inoculation with these two strains comparing to non-inoculated control. Our results indicated that maize plants inoculated with Bacillus strains capable of producing IAA-like molecules and solubilizing phosphate, presented enhanced root system, dry matter and nutrient accumulation in hydroponics and higher yield and grain P content with and without addition of phosphate fertilizer under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aMPR-00172-16cFapemig  aMPCPAgro No 465133/2014-4cCNPq  a01.13.05.001.02-0cEmbrapa 3abiomass 3acorn 3agrain yield 3ahydroponics 3anutrient content 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asurface area 3atriple superphosphate1 ade Oliveira, Christiane Abreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1874-24891 aAndrade, Daniele Luiz1 ade Carvalho, Chainheny Gomes1 aRibeiro, Vitória Palhares1 aPastina, Maria Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9112-34571 aMarriel, Ivanildo Evódio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1670-02851 ade Paula Lana, Ubiraci Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3964-89661 aGomes, Eliane Aparecida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8488-39360 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2021 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.867-877dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-020-10146-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245012700204300001600331506007600347520106300423592002801486506003701514650000801551650002501559650001401584650001301598650001201611650001101623650001201634650002201646650001701668700001801685700001901703700001401722700001401736700001901750700001401769700001601783700001401799700001701813700001901830700001901849700001601868700001601884700001801900700001801918700002301936700001301959700001301972700001401985773008301999856008402082852000902166655001202175IND60553966020221207144615.0161023e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055396602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.0222doi7 aPMC43630722pmcid7 a252635942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Rui10aBS69/ZMYND11 Reads and Connects Histone H3.3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation-Decorated Chromatin to Regulated Pre-mRNA Processing  ap. 298-310.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBS69 (also called ZMYND11) contains tandemly arranged PHD, BROMO, and PWWP domains, which are chromatin recognition modalities. Here, we show that BS69 selectively recognizes histone variant H3.3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3.3K36me3) via its chromatin-binding domains. We further identify BS69 association with RNA splicing regulators, including the U5 snRNP components of the spliceosome, such as EFTUD2. Remarkably, RNA sequencing shows that BS69 mainly regulates intron retention (IR), which is the least understood RNA alternative splicing event in mammalian cells. Biochemical and genetic experiments demonstrate that BS69 promotes IR by antagonizing EFTUD2 through physical interactions. We further show that regulation of IR by BS69 also depends on its binding to H3K36me3-decorated chromatin. Taken together, our study identifies an H3.3K36me3-specific reader and a regulator of IR and reveals that BS69 connects histone H3.3K36me3 to regulated RNA splicing, providing significant, important insights into chromatin regulation of pre-mRNA processing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aalternative splicing 3achromatin 3ahistones 3aintrons 3alysine 3amammals 3asequence analysis 3aspliceosomes1 aZheng, Lijuan1 aPark, Juw Won1 aLv, Ruitu1 aChen, Hao1 aJiao, Fangfang1 aXu, Wenqi1 aMu, Shirong1 aWen, Hong1 aQiu, Jinsong1 aWang, Zhentian1 aYang, Pengyuan1 aWu, Feizhen1 aHui, Jingyi1 aFu, Xiangdong1 aShi, Xiaobing1 aShi, Yujiang Geno1 aXing, Yi1 aLan, Fei1 aShi, Yang0 tMolecular cell.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 56 p.298-310dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245008200164300001400246520056100260592002800821650002200849650001400871650003000885650001700915650001800932700001400950700001600964700001900980773010400999856008401103852000901187655001201196IND4465033420221121011522.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446503342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2012.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEames, I.W.10aDescription and validation of a computer based refrigeration system simulator  ap. 53-63.  aThis paper describes and evaluates the validation of a novel software package which simulates the transient and steady-state operation of whole refrigeration systems of the type used for the storage and processing of food.

Ion intercalation during electrochemically driven charge and discharge processes is the fundamental process associated with MXene functionality, which we have characterized using in situ and operando X-ray reflectivity (XRR). Experiments performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory monitored the changes in the structure of a Ti₃C₂ MXene film on a platinum current collector as a function of static applied potential between 0.3 and −0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl in an aqueous 0.1 M Li₂SO₄ electrolyte. Negative potential sweeps lead to a contraction of 1.2 Å in the interlayer spacing and a loss of electron density between the layers, likely due to Li⁺ ion insertion and water removal. The change in lattice spacing includes a continuous variation vs potential as well as an additional discrete contraction that occurs near −0.35 V that has the characteristics of a first-order transition. The continuous change in the MXene interlayer spacing is associated with the capacitive charge, while the discrete change in structure correlated to the weak feature in the cyclic voltammogram at −0.35 V can be interpreted as either a pseudocapacitive charging process or a potential-dependent change in capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray reflectivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aphotons 3aplatinum 3awater purification 0aMXenes 0ainterlayer 0aintercalation 0ain situ 0asynchrotron1 aMathis, Tyler S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1814-02421 aGogotsi, Yury1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9423-40321 aFenter, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6672-97480 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 13, no. 36 p.43597-43605dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c109593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01452naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014000156300001800296520040600314592002800720650002100748650002300769650002000792650001200812650002000824700001900844700001600863700001600879700001400895773013400909856007401043852000901117655001201126IND60660175020221120100636.0190823e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066017502DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01465k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jiang10aSensitizer design for efficient triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion: annihilator-appended tris-cyclometalated Ir(iii) complexes  ap. 7828-7830.  aEnhanced triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion efficiency is achieved with two tris-cyclometalated iridium sensitizers covalently tethered with a pyrene annihilator.

M.10aHot-pressed phosphate glass–ceramic matrix composites containing calcium phosphate particles for nuclear waste encapsulation  ap. 4152-4156.  aSodium aluminium phosphate (NaAlP) glass–ceramic composites were produced as potential wasteforms for the immobilization of special categories of halide-containing radioactive waste. Sintering conditions for encapsulating a simulated waste (a calcinated mixture of calcium phosphate host and various oxides) in the cold-pressed NaAlP glass–ceramic were first determined and the results were compared with similar samples prepared by hot pressing. In both cases, the conditions aimed to provide a very high-density material, via as low production temperatures as possible, in conjunction with a high waste loading (75 wt.% simulated waste to 25 wt.% glass). It was found that by hot pressing and using a NaAlP glass–ceramic containing 2 mol% B₂O₃, significantly lower temperatures could be employed compared to the cold pressing and sintering route. The lowest temperature at which a sufficiently dense hot-pressed product was achieved (86% theoretical density), that exhibited mechanical properties similar to those of borosilicate glass (e.g. Young’s modulus 67 ± 2 GPa), was 550 °C. This processing temperature is considerably lower than values reported in the literature for similar systems. As such, hot pressing can be considered as a convenient technique for the fabrication of this type of composite for waste encapsulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum phosphate 3acalcium phosphates 3acold 3aencapsulation 3aglass 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoxides 3apressing 3aradioactive waste 3asodium 3atemperature1 aGrimes, R.

Behaviour (measured by the ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) and Social-Emotional Questionnaire (SEQ)) and physical complaints were evaluated in weeks 5 and 10. Eighty-eight paediatric ADHD patients (70 % male, mean age 10.1 years) were randomised to placebo (n = 30), PBE (n = 32) or MPH (n = 26). Teachers reported significant improvement of total and hyperactivity/impulsivity ADHD-RS scores by PBE and MPH after 10 weeks compared to placebo. MPH also improved inattention. SEQ ratings support ADHD-RS results. Adverse effects were reported five times more frequently for MPH than for PBE. PBE appears a good alternative for MPH in paediatric ADHD and especially in the primary school environment, a fortiori when considering its almost complete lack of adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus pinaster 3abark extracts 3aelementary schools 3amales 3amedicine 3aplacebos 3aquestionnaires 0aADHD 0aBehaviour 0aFrench Maritime Pine Bark Extract 0aMethylphenidate 0aAntioxidant 0aPolyphenols 0aADHD 0aANOVA 0aCNS 0aFFQ 0aGI 0aHI 0aHPLC 0aIA 0aIQ 0aLMM 0aMPH 0aPBE 0aPCQ 0aRS 0aSEQ 0aUSP 0aUZA 0aUZ Ghent 0aZNA1 aVerlaet, Annelies A.J.1 aBreynaert, Annelies1 aNaessens, Tania1 aFransen, Erik1 aVerhelst, Helene1 aVan West, Dirk1 aVan Ingelghem, Ingrid1 aJonckheere, An I.1 aBeysen, Diane1 aKenis, Sandra1 aMoens, Els1 avan Roest, Aalt P.J.1 aSavelkoul, Huub F.J.1 aDe Bruyne, Tess1 aPieters, Luc1 aCeulemans, Berten1 aHermans, Nina0 tJournal of functional foods.g2022 Oct., v. 97 p.105246-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2022.1052463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245017100161300001400332520090400346592002801250650002201278650001701300650001301317650001001330650001801340650001201358650001201370650001401382653001101396653001701407653001501424653001501439653001001454700003301464700002201497700002101519700002701540700002201567700002301589700002501612700001801637700002101655773010701676856007601783852000901859655001201868IND60770640120221117232707.0220319e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077064012DNAL7 a10.3897/fr.25.801342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranov, Viktor10a﻿The first adult mantis lacewing from Baltic amber, with an evaluation of the post-Cretaceous loss of morphological diversity of raptorial appendages in Mantispidae  ap. 11-24.  a﻿AbstractMantis lacewings (Neuroptera: Mantispidae) are prominent and charismatic predatory representatives of Insecta. Nevertheless, representatives of the group are surprisingly scarce in Paleogene deposits after a relative abundance of specimens known from Cretaceous. Here we present Mantispa? damzenogedanica sp. nov., representing the first adult of Mantispidae described from Baltic amber and the only Eocene adult mantispid hitherto preserved in amber. The new fossil species is also among the earliest representatives of Mantispinae, certainly the oldest adult of this group described from amber. Additionally, we discuss the changes through time in the ecological morphospace within Mantispidae based on the morphological diversity (≈disparity) of the raptorial legs. Possible explanations for the post-Cretaceous decline in the morphological diversity of mantis lacewings are posited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aEocene epoch 3aMantispa 3aamber 3abirds of prey 3adecline 3afossils 3alacewings 0afossil 0amantid flies 0amorphology 0aNeuroptera 0ashape1 aFuente, Ricardo Pérez-de la1 aEngel, Michael S.1 aHammel, Jörg U.1 aKiesmüller, Christine1 aHörnig, Marie K.1 aPazinato, Paula G.1 aStahlecker, Corleone1 aHaug, Carolin1 aHaug, Joachim T.0 tFossil record.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 25, no. 1 p.11-24dPensoft PublisherswJournal:28649x2193-00747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/fr.25.801343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245006100169300001600230506002800246520071000274592002800984506003701012650000901049650002801058650001401086650001401100653000901114653002401123653002301147653003701170700003001207700002701237773012601264856007801390852000901468655001201477IND60739556820221207122451.0101112s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955682DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN0611107L2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatković, Dragana S.10aDynamics of dry matter synthesis during corn development  ap. 107-114.  aResource is Open Access  aEffects of mineral nutrition and combinations of mineral and organic nutrients on the dynamics of vegetative mass development in corn have been examined in a long-term stationary trial.

The obtained results showed that the dynamics of dry matter accumulation changed in dependence of development stage and nutrition variant. Smallest gains in dry matter in all stages under study were obtained in the control variant. Highest gains were obtained in the variants which combined mineral nutrition and manuring. The smallest gain of dry matter, 7.22% of the dry matter accumulated at full maturity, was registered at the seven-leaf stage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3anutrition 3aphenology 0acorn 0aphenological stages 0anutrition variants 0adynamics of dry matter synthesis1 aStarčević, Ljubinko Ð.1 aMarinković, Branko J.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2006, v. 2006, no. 111 p.107-114dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0611107L3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002300075024001900098024003500117040001800152100002200170245006200192300001600254520132400270592002801594650003001622650002901652650002101681650001101702650002801713650002701741650002301768650001101791650000901802650002001811650001001831650002101841650002201862650001801884650002701902650002701929650002301956650001801979650001801997650002202015650001002037650001302047650002402060650002502084650001102109650002902120650001902149650007402168650003902242773010002281856008102381852000902462655001202471991561880160742620221118234155.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND44649898

A detailed literature search was conducted using the search term vitamin D; primary and secondary sources of original data and meta-analyses and systematic reviews were evaluated and summarized. A large body of scientific evidence demonstrates that long-term daily intakes of 600 to 800 IU of vitamin D are insufficient to achieve and sustain vitamin D adequacy (serum 25-hydroxyergocalciferol + 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentration >75 nmol/L). Maximization of the physiologic benefits of vitamin D to the musculoskeletal system, the central and peripheral nervous systems, the heart and central and peripheral cardiovascular systems, the respiratory system, the skin, the eyes, dentition, glucoregulation, immunoregulation, and disease resistance requires daily vitamin D intakes of at least 1500 IU. Because long-term daily intakes up to and including 10 000 IU of vitamin D do not produce signs or symptoms of vitamin D toxicity and are safe for the entire general population of otherwise healthy adults, even daily vitamin D intakes of 2000 IU allow for the often-cited and excessively conservative five-fold safety factor. In conclusion, long-term daily intakes of up to and including 10 000 IU of vitamin D maximize physiologic benefits and are safe.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3aAdequate Intakes 3aadults 3acardioprotective effect 3acentral nervous system 3adisease resistance 3adosage 3aeyes 3aglycemic effect 3aheart 3aimmunomodulators 3along term effects 3ameta-analysis 3amusculoskeletal system 3aneuroprotective effect 3arespiratory system 3asafety factor 3askin (animal) 3asystematic review 3ateeth 3atoxicity 3avitamin supplements 2aAdministration, Oral 2aHumans 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPatient Safety 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxdrug therapy0 tNutrition.g2012 Apr., v. 28, no. 4 p.344-356dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04686naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018000168506010400348506007600452520256100528592002803089506003703117650001303154650001203167650002003179650001203199650001503211650001603226650003003242650002103272650001303293650001303306650001403319650000903333650001103342650001903353650001903372650001803391650001903409650001803428650001903446650001503465651001303480651001703493653001303510653002303523653002403546653001703570653004703587653002603634653001303660700003703673700002003710700002203730700002703752700002103779700002403800773010503824856008603929852000904015655001204024IND60775231820221207125643.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077523182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeris, Josie10aSurface water-groundwater interactions and local land use control water quality impacts of extreme rainfall and flooding in a vulnerable semi-arid region of Sub-Saharan Africa  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile extreme rainfall events may provide rare opportunities for replenishment of surface water and groundwater resources in vulnerable (semi)arid areas, they are typically also associated with widespread flooding. The impacts on contaminant movement associated with spatio-temporally complex relationships between surface water and groundwater during such events in these regions are largely unknown. The catchment area (∼4350 km²) upstream of Gaborone Dam on the Notwane River in south-east Botswana and northern South Africa experienced extreme rainfall and major flooding in 2016/17, following a severe 5-year drought. In this generally data-sparce area, we collected a unique data set that combined traditional water quantity observations with stable water isotope, major ion, trace metal and geophysical data. These were analysed to gain insights into water quantity and quality dynamics following flooding, including contaminant movement using trace metals as pollution indicators. Results revealed that the extreme rainfall and flooding was responsible for replenishment of surface water and groundwater resources, but also contaminant mobilisation from the surface. This subsequently resulted in increased concentrations of contaminants during the recession. Overall, hydrogeological heterogeneity dictated spatially variable surface water - groundwater interactions, characterised by poor connectivity in low productivity aquifer areas as opposed to good connectivity in moderate to high productivity aquifers. This in turn affected water quality dynamics and contamination, locally superimposed by land use impacts, primarily from urban landfill and local agricultural practices. Groundwater-connected streams had consistently lower (responses in) contaminants. We also found that Gaborone Reservoir facilitated prolonged conditions for recharge but likely also enhanced contamination of groundwater through maintaining a high water table in urban areas located immediately downstream. Management implications of our findings include a requirement for careful consideration of land use and landfill planning in relation to bedrock geology and presence of surface water reservoirs, conjunctive surface water and groundwater management, but also the need for even higher (space–time) resolution of monitoring in these data sparce environments. This could contribute to enhancing the benefits that extreme rainfall events provide in terms of surface water and groundwater resources replenishment for future dry seasons and periods of drought.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3adata collection 3adrought 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahigh water table 3aisotopes 3aland use 3alandfills 3arain 3arivers 3asemiarid zones 3aspace and time 3asurface water 3atrace elements 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awatersheds 3aBotswana 3aSouth Africa 0aFlooding 0aSub-saharan Africa 0aLimpopo river basin 0aContaminants 0aSurface water – groundwater interactions 0aStable water isotopes 0aRecharge1 aComte, J.-C.q(Jean-Christophe),1 aFranchi, Fulvio1 aPetros, Alfred K.1 aTirivarombo, Sithabile1 aSelepeng, Ame T.1 aVillholth, Karen G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 June, v. 609 p.127834-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245012600163300001400289520188700303592002802190650002002218650001402238650001202252650001602264650001102280650001302291653001302304653001402317653002802331653002002359653002302379700002602402700002002428700002102448700002002469773010702489856007602596852000902672655001202681IND60770640220221117232640.0220319e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077064022DNAL7 a10.3897/fr.25.802112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, Catherine10a﻿Deciphering the morphological variation and its ontogenetic dynamics in the Late Devonian conodont Icriodus alternatus  ap. 25-41.  a﻿AbstractIdentification of relevant taxonomic and evolutionary units is a recurrent issue in the fossil record, and all the more for ancient fossils devoid of modern equivalents such as conodonts. Extensive morphological variation has often led to the description of numerous species, subspecies or morphotypes, which may correspond to end-member morphologies reached through ontogeny. The platform elements of the Late Devonian conodont species Icriodus alternatus were characterized by rows of denticles coming into occlusion between opposite elements; each element grew by the incremental addition of lamellae and by the addition of successive triads during ontogeny. During the late Frasnian and the early Famennian, the important morphological variation within this species led to the description of three subspecies. An extensive sample of early Famennian Icriodus alternatus was quantified using 2D biometric measurements and denticle counts on 2D pictures, showing that the subspecies mainly differed in their size range but not in their general morphology. A 3D morphometric analysis was further performed on a subsample to characterize the shape of the ontogenetically older part of the elements. During ontogeny, early valleys between denticles tended to be filled, and the asymmetry between the inner and outer side of the element increased. These ontogenetic trends are responsible for the morphologies formerly described as the subspecies Ic. alt. mawsonae and Ic. alt. helmsi. Slight discrepancies between temporal ranges of the subspecies may be achieved through variations in range of size reached by the elements as a response to environmental changes. Disparity along ontogeny seems to follow an “hourglass model” suggesting a shift from relatively loose developmental constraints to a pattern of growth modulated by functional constraints during occlusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDevonian period 3aasymmetry 3afossils 3amorphometry 3amorphs 3aontogeny 0aDevonian 0adisparity 0ageometric morphometrics 0ahourglass model 0aIcriodusalternatus1 aCharruault, Anne-Lise1 aGlück, Thomas,1 aCorradini, Carlo1 aRenaud, Sabrina0 tFossil record.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 25, no. 1 p.25-41dPensoft PublisherswJournal:28649x2193-00747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/fr.25.802113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011600162300001600278500002000294520220600314592002802520650001002548650002402558650001702582650001102599650002302610650001202633650001502645650001502660650001502675650001502690650001202705650001302717650001102730650001902741650001302760650002202773650002002795650002202815650001402837651001502851700002402866700002602890773013002916856007303046852000903119655001203128IND60587588220221120212019.0180102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058758822DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0981.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsland, Michael J.10aRestoring diversity after cattail expansion: disturbance, resilience, and seasonality in a tropical dry wetland  ap. 715-728.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs the human footprint expands, ecologists and resource managers are increasingly challenged to explain and manage abrupt ecosystem transformations (i.e., regime shifts). In this study, we investigated the role of a mechanical disturbance that has been used to restore and maintain local wetland diversity after a monotypic regime shift in northwestern Costa Rica [specifically, an abrupt landscape‐scale cattail (Typha) expansion]. The study was conducted in Palo Verde Marsh (Palo Verde National Park; a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance), a seasonally flooded freshwater wetland that has historically provided habitat for large populations of wading birds and waterfowl. A cattail (T. domingensis) expansion in the 1980s greatly altered the plant community and reduced avian habitat. Since then, Typha has been managed using a form of mechanical disturbance called fangueo (a Spanish word, pronounced “fahn‐gay‐yo” in English). We applied a Typha removal treatment at three levels (control, fangueo, and fangueo with fencing to exclude cattle grazing). Fangueo resulted in a large reduction in Typha dominance (i.e., decreased aboveground biomass, ramet density, and ramet height) and an increase in habitat heterogeneity. As in many ecosystems that have been defined by multiple and frequent disturbances, a large portion of the plant community regenerated after disturbance (via propagule banking) and fangueo resulted in a more diverse plant community that was strongly dictated by seasonal processes (i.e., distinct wet‐ and dry‐season assemblages). Importantly, the mechanical disturbance had no apparent short‐term impact on any of the soil properties we measured (including bulk density). Interestingly, low soil and foliar N:P values indicate that Palo Verde Marsh and other wetlands in the region may be nitrogen limited. Our results quantify how, in a cultural landscape where the historical disturbance regime has been altered and diversity has declined, a mechanical disturbance in combination with seasonal drought and flooding has been used to locally restrict a clonal monodominant plant expansion, create habitat heterogeneity, and maintain plant diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha 3aaboveground biomass 3abulk density 3acattle 3acultural landscape 3adrought 3adry season 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3anational parks 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3asoil properties 3aspecies diversity 3awaterfowl 3aCosta Rica1 aGonzález, Eugenio,1 aRichardson, Curtis J.0 tEcological applications.g2011 Apr., v. 21, no. 3 p.715-728dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0981.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013000166520210100296592002802397650001302425650001202438650001902450650001602469650002702485650002202512650001702534650002402551650001102575650002302586653002302609653001602632653002802648653002102676700001402697700001702711700001502728773010502743856008602848852000902934655001202943IND60775231920221117233751.0220809e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077523192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jian14aThe coastal aquifer recovery subject to storm surge: Effects of connected heterogeneity, physical barrier and surge frequency  aStorm surge, a worldwide phenomenon triggering the vertical saltwater infiltration, is likely to exacerbate coastal groundwater salinization due to geologic heterogeneity, anthropogenic engineering and climate change. This study analyzed the combined effects of connected heterogeneity, physical barrier and surge frequency on the coastal aquifer recovery. A series of modeling cases were investigated using HydroGeoSphere in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer. The heterogeneity setting is composed of different connectivity level of hydraulic conductivity field. The simulation results of single storm surge event demonstrate that the connected heterogeneity elevates the salinized extent and reduces the aquifer recovery time due to a number of preferential flow paths. In comparison to the equivalent homogeneous aquifer, heterogeneity alleviates the maximum salinized extent and vertical intrusion distance due to the accelerated mixing of salinized groundwater with fresh groundwater. Physical barrier, classified as subsurface dam and cutoff wall, leading to different groundwater discharge pattern is tailored to investigate the influences of the permanent subsurface engineering on the aquifer recovery. Our results show that the connectivity level controls the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier. Then, the repetitive storm surge events were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency. For the low-frequency surge event, the variation of salinized metric is the repetition of the unimodal curve in the single surge event. Nevertheless, for the high-frequency surge event, the residual salt mass cannot be flushed out over the simulation period, especially for the low-connectivity aquifer. Meanwhile, the high-frequency surge event broadens the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier. These findings have critical implications for coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial environmental risks of surge-induced vertical saltwater intrusion derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3apreferential flow 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 3astorms 3awater salinization 0aSeawater intrusion 0aStorm surge 0aConnected heterogeneity 0aPhysical barrier1 aYang, Yun1 aWu, Jianfeng1 aWu, Jichun0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 July, v. 610 p.127835-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1278353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245019600172300001400368520177800382592002802160650002202188650002602210650002202236650002202258653002202280653001602302653002802318653001502346653001802361700003202379700001902411700002202430700002802452700002002480773011202500856008402612852000902696655001202705IND60599180520221123043807.0180702e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059918052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.03.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Oskar,10aBioanalytical chromatographic method validation according to current regulations, with a special focus on the non-well defined parameters limit of quantification, robustness and matrix effect  ap. 10-27.  aMethod validation is a mandatory step in bioanalysis, to evaluate the ability of developed methods in providing reliable results for their routine application. Even if some organisations have developed guidelines to define the different parameters to be included in method validation (FDA, EMA); there are still some ambiguous concepts in validation criteria and methodology that need to be clarified. The methodology to calculate fundamental parameters such as the limit of quantification has been defined in several ways without reaching a harmonised definition, which can lead to very different values depending on the applied criterion. Other parameters such as robustness or ruggedness are usually omitted and when defined there is not an established approach to evaluate them. Especially significant is the case of the matrix effect evaluation which is one of the most critical points to be studied in LC-MS methods but has been traditionally overlooked. Due to the increasing importance of bioanalysis this scenario is no longer acceptable and harmonised criteria involving all the concerned parties should be arisen. The objective of this review is thus to discuss and highlight several essential aspects of method validation, focused in bioanalysis. The overall validation process including common validation parameters (selectivity, linearity range, precision, accuracy, stability…) will be reviewed. Furthermore, the most controversial parameters (limit of quantification, robustness and matrix effect) will be carefully studied and the definitions and methodology proposed by the different regulatory bodies will be compared. This review aims to clarify the methodology to be followed in bioanalytical method validation, facilitating this time consuming step.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic compounds 0aMethod validation 0aBioanalysis 0aLimit of quantification 0aRobustness 0aMatrix effect1 aBlanco, María Encarnación1 aIriarte, Gorka1 aBartolomé, Luis,1 aMaguregui, Miren Itxaso1 aAlonso, Rosa M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 1353 p.10-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.03.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008700166300001600253520108200269592002801351650002401379650001901403650001401422650001601436650002201452650003201474650002301506650002501529650002801554650001701582650000901599650001301608650001601621650001301637650002501650650001501675650001101690653003701701653002201738653001201760653001601772653001601788653001001804700001801814700002301832700001801855700001601873700001901889773010701908856008702015852000902102655001202111IND60526734420221118200848.0190409e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052673442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhuo10aRecent advances in yeast cell-surface display technologies for waste biorefineries  ap. 324-333.  aWaste biorefinery aims to maximize the output of value-added products from various artificial/agricultural wastes by using integrated bioprocesses. To make waste biorefinery economically feasible, it is thus necessary to develop a low-cost, environment-friendly technique to perform simultaneous biodegradation and bioconversion of waste materials. Cell-surface display engineering is a novel, cost-effective technique that can auto-immobilize proteins on the cell exterior of microorganisms, and has been applied for use with waste biofinery. Through tethering different enzymes (e.g., cellulase, lipase, and protease) or metal-binding peptides on cell surfaces, various yeast strains can effectively produce biofuels and biochemicals from sugar/protein-rich waste materials, catalyze waste oils into biodiesels, or retrieve heavy metals from wastewater. This review critically summarizes recent applications of yeast cell-surface display on various types of waste biorefineries, highlighting its potential and future challenges with regard to commercializing this technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiodegradation 3abiodiesel 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic feasibility 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aheavy metals 3aoils 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3avalue-added products 3awastewater 3ayeasts 0aCell-surface display engineering 0aWaste biorefinery 0aBiofuel 0aBiochemical 0aHeavy metal 0aYeast1 aHo, Shih-Hsin1 aHasunuma, Tomohisa1 aChang, Jo-Shu1 aRen, Nan-Qi1 aKondo, Akihiko0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Sept., v. 215 p.324-333dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01359naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010700156300001800263520034900281592002800630650002300658650001400681650001900695650002300714650001300737650002200750700001200772700001700784700001600801773013300817856007400950852000901024655001201033IND60660175420221120100725.0190823e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066017542DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01477d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzier, D.10aBulky toroidal and vesicular self-assembled nanostructures from fullerene end-capped rod-like polymers  ap. 4571-4574.  aIn this work, we present novel fullerene (C₆₀) end-capped rod-like polypeptide-polymers, obtained by one-pot thiol–ene chemistry.

Canopy photosynthetic discrimination (Δcanopy) is a key variable in isoflux-based IFP, but it ignores diffusional and respiratory fractionations, with unclear consequences for isoflux-based IFP. We used three versions of the Farquhar model (Δclassical, Δdiffusion, and Δsimple) to estimate Δcanopy based on in-situ measurements of CO2 isotope ratios and flux during a dry period (I; DOY 205–219, 2015) and a humid period (II; DOY 285–299, 2015) in a subtropical mixed conifer plantation. We found no significant differences in Δcanopy between Δclassical and Δdiffusion which ignored respiratory fractionations during photorespiration and dark respiration. The average differences between Δclassical and Δsimple, which ignored respiratory and diffusional fractionations across the leaf boundary layer and mesophyll, were 2.88 ± 2.34‰ and 2.16 ± 2.18‰ for the two periods. Similarly, there were no significant differences in FA with isoflux-based IFP using Δclassical and Δdiffusion to obtain Δcanopy; FA using Δsimple was 102 and 117% higher than that using Δclassical for the dry and humid periods. Moreover, using Δclassical and Δdiffusion captured the reduction in daytime respiration during the dry period; this may be associated with the Kok effect and seasonal drought. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in mesophyll and stomatal conductances of ±50% resulted in > 15% change in FA. Diffusional fractionations in mesophyll and stoma are critical limitations to isoflux-based IFP, while photorespiratory fractionation is an unignorable component of Δcanopy and isoflux-based IFP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3aconifers 3adrought 3afractionation 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3amodels 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aphotorespiration 3astomatal conductance 0aCarbon isotope 0aPhotosynthetic discrimination 0aIsotopic flux partitioning 0aIsotope ratio infrared spectroscopy 0aEddy covariance1 aWei, Jie1 aWen, Xuefa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2340-48951 aSun, Xiaomin1 aGuo, Qingjun0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 July 15, v. 272-273 p.143-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012900165300001200294520176600306592002802072596005902100596005902159596007502218650001302293650001102306650001902317650001502336650002102351650002002372650001402392650000902406650001902415650001102434650001702445650002902462651001002491700001902501700001402520700001502534700001702549700001402566700001502580773013302595856008302728852000902811655001202820IND60773996820221117224557.0220511e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077399682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10375-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shibao10aEvaluation of landslide susceptibility of the Ya’an–Linzhi section of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway based on deep learning  ap. 250.  aThe Qinghai–Tibet Plateau is an area with frequent landslide hazards due to its unique geology, topography, and climate conditions, posing severe threats to engineering construction and human settlements. The primary purpose of this paper is to map the landslide susceptibility of the Ya’an–Lin branch of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway using two deep learning (DL) algorithms, convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN). Initially, a geospatial database was generated based on 587 landslide hazards determined by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Stacking technology and field geological hazard surveys; thus, 18 landslide-influencing factors were selected. Subsequently, the landslides were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation data (30%) for model training and testing. Next, a Pearson correlation coefficient and information gain (IG) method were used to perform the correlation analysis and feature selection of the 18 influencing factors. Afterward, landslide susceptibility maps were generated for the two models. Finally, the performance of the model is validated using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and confusion matrix. The results show that the CNN model (AUC = 0.88) provided better performance in both the training and testing phases compared to the DNN model (AUC = 0.84). In addition, the high landslide susceptibility is primarily distributed in the Jinsha, Lancang and Nu River basins along the railway. The slope, altitude and rainfall are the main factors for the formation of the landslides. Furthermore, the two deep learning models can accurately map the landslide susceptibility, providing important information for landslide risk reduction and prevention.  aPublisher supplied data  a41941019cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41922054cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020YFC1512000cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aaltitude 3ahumans 3ainterferometry 3alandslides 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3arailroads 3arain 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3aspatial data 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aChina1 aZhuang, Jianqi1 aMu, Jiaqi1 aZheng, Jia1 aZhan, Jiewei1 aWang, Jie1 aFu, Yuting0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 May, v. 81, no. 9 p.250-250dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10375-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245015800177500002200335520145100357592002801808650004401836650001501880650000901895650002301904650001901927650001301946650002101959650001301980650000701993650001502000650001702015650001802032650002202050650001702072650001902089650001602108653001902124653002002143653001002163653001902173653002902192653002702221700005602248700001702304700001502321700002202336773005602358856008902414852000902503655001202512IND60585349920221121054848.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058534992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Pratishtha10aPhosphate solubilization and chromium (VI) remediation potential of Klebsiella sp. strain CPSB4 isolated from the chromium contaminated agricultural soil  aPre-press version  aIn this study, an effort was made to identify an efficient phosphate solubilizing bacterial strain from chromium contaminated agricultural soils. Based on the formation of a solubilized halo around the colonies on Pikovskaya's agar amended with chromium (VI), 10 strains were initially screened out. Out of 10, strain CPSB4, which showed significantly high solubilization zone at different chromium concentrations, was selected for further study. The strain CPSB4 showed significant plant growth promotion traits with chromium (VI) stress under in-vitro conditions in broth. The plant growth promotion activities of the strain decreased regularly, but were not completely lost with the increase in concentration of chromium up to 200 mg L−1. On subjected to FT-IR analysis, the presence of the functional group, indicating the organic acid aiding in phosphate solubilization was identified. At an optimal temperature of 30 °C and pH 7.0, the strain showed around 93% chromium (VI) reduction under in-vitro conditions in broth study. In soil condition, the maximum chromium (VI) reduction obtained was 95% under in-vitro conditions. The strain CPSB4 was identified as Klebsiella sp. on the basis of morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This study shows that the diverse role of the bacterial strain CPSB4 would be useful in the chromium contaminated soil as a good bioremediation and plant growth promoting agent as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aKlebsiella 3aagar 3aagricultural soils 3abioremediation 3achromium 3agrowth promotion 3amoieties 3apH 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil quality 3asolubilization 3atemperature 0aBioremediation 0aChromium stress 0aFT-IR 0aKlebsiella sp. 0aPhosphate solubilization 0aPlant growth promotion1 aKumar, Vipin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-34401 aUsmani, Zeba1 aRani, Rupa1 aChandra, Avantika0 tChemosphere.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245011900138300001300257506002800270520126600298592002801564506003701592650001701629650001101646650002601657650002601683650000901709650001601718650001101734650002501745650001601770650002101786653003201807653002601839653001701865700001801882700002901900700001901929773012601948852000902074655001202083IND60739557220221215143049.0210420e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aS.

This more often happens in the regions where the number of hydrometric and rain gauge stations is limited. In addition, assessing, developing and maintaining the use of water resources require accessible long-term and high-quality quality hydrological time-series. Thus, this necessitates correcting the statistical flaws and magnifies the importance of how to deal with the problems in the hydrological analyses. Statistical methods are, currently, used to infill data and statistical gaps. In this study, in order to introduce a multivariate method for estimating the missing data on rainfall and runoff, in a hydrologic homogeneous region in the Mazandaran province, self-organizing map methods were examined under two scenarios and some reliable estimates were obtained. In this regard, the correlation coefficients between the observational data and the model output were calculated for the precipitation data up to 0.92 and up to 0.95 for the runoff data. Therefore, to avoid the reduction of uncertainty caused by the inadequate data in water resource management, this method could be used.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aobservational studies 3arain 3arain gauges 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awater management 0aunsupervised neural network 0ainfilling time series 0amissing data1 aSharafati, A.1 aGolafshani, E.

However, this material faces issues, such as poor durability at high cut-off voltages (>4.4 V vs Li/Li⁺), which mainly originate from an unstable electrode–electrolyte interface. To reduce the side reactions at the interfacial zone and increase the structural stability of the NMC622 materials, nanoscale (<5 nm) coatings of TiOₓ (TO) and LiₓTiyOz (LTO) were deposited over NMC622 composite electrodes using atomic layer deposition. It was found that these coatings provided a protective surface and also reinforced the electrode structure. Under high-voltage range (3.0–4.6 V) cycling, the coatings enhance the NMC electrochemical behavior, enabling longer cycle life and higher capacity. Cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses of the coated NMC electrodes suggest that the enhanced electrochemical performance originates from reduced side reactions. In situ dilatometry analysis shows reversible volume change for NMC-LTO during the cycling. It revealed that the dilation behavior of the electrode, resulting in crack formation and consequent particle degradation, is significantly suppressed for the coated sample. The ability of the coatings to mitigate the electrode degradation mechanisms, illustrated in this report, provides insight into a method to enhance the performance of Ni-rich positive electrode materials under high-voltage ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3alithium batteries 3avoltammetry 0aLithium-ion battery 0aALD 0aelectrode coating 0atitanium oxide 0alithium titanate 0aNi-rich positive electrode1 aMiikkulainen, Ville1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9398-23191 aMäntymäki, Miia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0880-04271 aMousavihashemi, Seyedabolfazl1 aLahtinen, Jouko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1192-99451 aLide, Yao1 aJiang, Hua1 aMizohata, Kenichiro1 aKankaanpää, Timo1 aKallio, Tanja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6671-85820 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 07, v. 13, no. 36 p.42773-42790dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c111653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05286naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005100149245010100200500001900301520346900320592002803789650001903817650000803836650002503844650002703869650001003896650001603906650001303922650001203935650001803947650001603965650001203981650001003993650004504003650001304048650003304061650001404094650001104108650001304119650001304132650000904145650001804154650001404172650001404186650002204200650002404222650002504246650001404271651001004285653001404295653002804309700005004337700001504387700001704402700001704419700001604436773010404452856008304556852000904639655001204648IND60719245920221118011433.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071924592DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-20-0994-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7903-871910aFirst Report of Colletotrichum Leaf Spot of Macadamia Caused by Colletotrichum siamense in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacadamia (Macadamia integrifolia Maiden & Betche), growing in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, is a high-value tree nut (Akinsanmi and Drenth 2017). In May 2018, the leaves of macadamia trees showed symptoms of anthracnose, with an incidence 10 to 15%, in Chongzuo (22°32′ N; 107°38′ E) (Guangxi province) in China. The disease began to develop from the tip of the leaf or the margin of the leaf. Initially, the disease symptoms on leaves were water-soaked, black-gray spots with light yellow around, which enlarged and coalesced; the leaves appeared irregular, with tawny or black lesions, ending in necrosis and defoliation. Abundant small black spots (acervuli) developed on the leaf surface, colonizing mainly the lesion zones. Under high-humidity conditions, lots of mucilaginous masses of pink conidia were observed on the leaf surface. Symptomatic leaves were randomly sampled from different parts of the field and washed with tap water. Tissues from the margins of the lesions were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 20 s followed by 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed in sterile distilled water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 28°C in constant light. After incubation for 5 days, the colonies of all isolates were white. After 10 days, a few aerial mycelia became greyish-green on the reverse side of plates. Fourteen days after incubation, many mucilaginous masses of pink conidia developed, and monoconidial isolates were obtained by single sporing. The nonseptate conidia were hyaline, cylindrical, obtuse at both ends, 14.4 to 21.4 μm (average 16.8 µm) × 5.4 to 7.0 μm (average 6.3 µm) (n = 100). These morphological characteristics were similar to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). To confirm the pathogen’s identity, DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), β-tubulin (TUB), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and histone H3 (HIS3) genes were performed. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MT219898, MT227807, MT227808, MT227810, and MT227811, respectively. A BLAST of the ITS, TUB, ACT, GAPDH, and HIS3 sequences revealed 99 to 100% identity with those of Colletotrichum siamense (MG830368, MG830342, MH290847, MK863031, and MH370542). A phylogenetic tree generated using the maximum likelihood method in MEGA7.0 (Kumar et al. 2016) revealed that our isolate MICS0319 falls within the C. siamense clade. For the pathogenicity test, 10 healthy leaves of macadamia were slightly punctured by a sterile pin and inoculated with 5-mm-diameter mycelial plugs. The same number of leaves treated with PDA plugs served as controls. All plants were incubated at 28°C and 100% relative humidity. After 4 days, the leaves inoculated with mycelial discs showed water-soaked, tawny, necrotic lesions, whereas controls remained asymptomatic. The fungus was successfully reisolated from the symptomatic leaves, and the identity was confirmed by morphology and phylogeny as C. siamense on the basis of the methods described above, thus confirming Koch’s postulates. C. siamense has been reported on macadamia, chili, papaya, and avocado (De Silva et al. 2017; Prasannath et al. 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense attacking leaf of macadamia in China. This research provides a basis for further research on the control of field disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3aactin 3aanthracnose 3aavocados 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adefoliation 3aethanol 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahistones 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3anuts 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3arelative humidity 3asodium hypochlorite 3astatistical analysis 3atap water 3aChina 0amacadamia 0aColletotrichum siamense1 aXu, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8642-82211 aXie, C.

This classical banding technique, however, is not reliable in identifying complex chromosomal aberrations such as those associated with cancer. To overcome the limitations of the banding technique, Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) is introduced to provide much reliable information on chromosome abnormalities. SKY is a multicolor fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique to detect metaphase chromosomes with spectral microscope 3, 4. SKY has been proven to be a valuable tool for the cytogenetic analysis of a broad range of chromosome abnormalities associated with a large number of genetic diseases and malignancies 5, 6. SKY involves the use of multicolor fluorescently-labelled DNA probes prepared from the degenerate oligonucleotide primers by PCR. Thus, every chromosome has a unique spectral color after in-situ hybridization with probes, which are differentially labelled with a mixture of fluorescent dyes (Rhodamine, Texas Red, Cy5, FITC and Cy5.5). The probes used for SKY consist of up to 55 chromosome specific probes 7-10. The procedure for SKY involves several steps (Figure 1). SKY requires the availability of cells with high mitotic index from normal or diseased tissue or blood. The chromosomes of a single cell from either a freshly isolated primary cell or a cell line are spread on a glass slide. This chromosome spread is labeled with a different combination of fluorescent dyes specific for each chromosome. For probe detection and image acquisition,the spectral imaging system consists of sagnac interferometer and a CCD camera. This allows measurement of the visible light spectrum emitted from the sample and to acquire a spectral image from individual chromosomes. HiSKY, the software used to analyze the results of the captured images, provides an easy identification of chromosome anomalies. The end result is a metaphase and a karyotype classification image, in which each pair of chromosomes has a distinct color (Figure 2). This allows easy identification of chromosome identities and translocations. For more details, please visit Applied Spectral Imaging website (http://www.spectral-imaging.com/). SKY was recently used for an identification of chromosome segregation defects and chromosome abnormalities in humans and mice with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), a genetic disease characterized by dysfunction in primary cilia 11-13. Using this technique, we demonstrated the presence of abnormal chromosome segregation and chromosomal defects in ADPKD patients and mouse models 14. Further analyses using SKY not only allowed us to identify chromosomal number and identity, but also to accurately detect very complex chromosomal aberrations such as chromosome deletions and translocations (Figure 2).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aInternet 3aanimal models 3aautosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 3ablood 3acameras 3acell lines 3achromosome number 3achromosome segregation 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3acilia 3acolor 3acomputer software 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afluorescent dyes 3agenetic disorders 3aglass 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometers 3akaryotyping 3ametaphase 3amice 3amitosis 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhodamines1 aRodriguez, Ingrid1 aNauli, Surya M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Feb. 03, , no. 60 p.e3887-e3887dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/38873Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3887/spectral-karyotyping-to-study-chromosome-abnormalities-humans-mice  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245016300163300001600326520172800342592002802070650002502098650001602123650001202139650002102151650001802172650002102190650001702211650003302228650001602261650001602277650001302293650003702306700001502343700001902358700001802377700001402395700001302409700001302422700001602435700001802451700001902469700002502488773010202513856008602615852000902701655001202710IND60578296520221123033021.0170812e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b024462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Kan10aSelf-Assembled Structures of Giant Surfactants Exhibit a Remarkable Sensitivity on Chemical Compositions and Topologies for Tailoring Sub-10 nm Nanostructures  ap. 303-314.  aWe report a remarkable sensitivity of self-assembled structures of giant surfactants on their chemical compositions and molecular topology, which facilitate the engineering of various nanophase-separated structures with sub-10 nm feature sizes. Two classes of giant surfactants composed of various functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) heads tethered with one or two polystyrene (PS) tails were efficiently prepared from common precursors of vinyl-substituted POSS–PS conjugates via one-step “thiol–ene” postpolymerization functionalization. With identical molecular weights of the PS tails, the resulting giant surfactants exhibited distinct highly ordered phases, as evidenced by small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy observations. Moreover, comparison between the topological isomers revealed that the self-assembled structures are also highly sensitive to molecular topology. Introduction of two PS tails with half-length not only shifted the boundaries between different ordered phases but also altered the packing configurations of the functional POSS cages, leading to further reduced feature sizes of the self-assembled nanodomains. Interestingly, a lower order–disorder transition temperature was also observed in the fluorinated F₁₃POSS tethered with two PS₁₇ tails, compared to its topological isomer composed of F₁₃POSS tethered with one PS₃₅ tail, indicating that the topological effect also existed in phase transition behaviors. These results provide insights to rationally design and precisely tailor self-assembled structures by controlling both primary chemical compositions and molecular topology in POSS-based giant surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aengineering 3aisomers 3amolecular weight 3ananomaterials 3aphase transition 3apolystyrenes 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atopology 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Chang1 aHuang, Mingjun1 aHuang, Jiahao1 aZhou, Zhe1 aWu, Gan,1 aLiu, Hao1 aLin, Zhiwei1 aShi, An-Chang1 aZhang, Wen-Bin1 aCheng, Stephen Z.

However, a recent study showed a variable lactose fermentation phenotype for E. albertii suggesting that this microorganism could have been underestimated by previous studies using isolation methods based on lactose fermentation. In this study, we present a method for the isolation and identification of both lactose fermenting and non-fermenting-E. albertii cells in stool samples, said method combining culture and isolation on mEA agar, an indole test, as well as an E. albertii-specific PCR assay for formal species identification. The ability of the procedure to detect E. albertii strains was verified using 19 E. albertii strains and 132 non-E. albertii strains representing 88 species of different origins majoritary belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. All indole-positive white colonies grown on mEA agar were subjected to E. albertii-specific PCR amplification; all E. albertii strains tested were detected with this assay and none of the non-E. albertii strains tested was detected. To demonstrate the ability of the procedure to directly detect E. albertii in stool samples, E. albertii-inoculated stools were tested and for all inoculated samples, E. albertii colonies were easily detected and identified. The present study provides a method enable to recover both lactose-fermenting and -non-fermenting E. albertii strains from clinical samples. This method could help to provide a better portrait of the prevalence and pathogenicity of E. albertii in clinical samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia albertii 3abacteria 3afeces 3afermentation 3aisolation techniques 3alactose 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspecies identification 0aE. albertii-specific PCR 0aEscherichia albertii 0amEA medium 0aStools of diarrhoeal patients1 aBrodeur, Stéphanie1 aBérubé, Ève1 aBoudreau, Dominique K.1 aAbed, Jehane Y.1 aBoissinot, Maurice1 aBissonnette, Luc1 aBergeron, Michel G.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Nov., v. 154 p.134-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011800175300001600293520075000309592002801059650002201087650004401109650002201153650002001175650001401195650002201209650001701231650000901248650003301257650002201290653003601312653004001348653003901388700002201427700001601449700001901465700002201484700002501506773010801531856008601639852000901725655001201734IND60561087020221123034653.0190318e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056108702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZianor Azrina, Z.A.10aSpherical nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) from oil palm empty fruit bunch pulp via ultrasound assisted hydrolysis  ap. 115-120.  aNanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) was isolated from oil palm empty fruit bunch pulp (EFBP) using ultrasound assisted acid hydrolysis.

This is particularly evident in Cebu, a Philippine island that has a long history of deforestation and has lost nearly all of its forest cover. To begin filling this gap, data from 13 microsatellite loci developed for Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae), a common vine species in Philippine forests, were used to study patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity for the four largest of the remaining forest areas in Cebu. Evidence of relatively high levels of inbreeding was found in all four areas, despite no evidence of low genetic diversity. The four areas are genetically differentiated, suggesting low genetic connectivity. The presence of inbreeding and low genetic connectivity in a commonly encountered species such as T. loheri in Cebu suggests that the impact of habitat fragmentation is likely greater on rare plant species with more restricted distributions in Cebu. Conservation recommendations for the remaining forest areas in Cebu include the establishment of steppingstone corridors between nearby areas to improve the movement of pollinators and seed dispersers among them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3aTetrastigma 3adeforestation 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arare species 3avines 0amicrosatellites 0aSoutheast Asia 0asteppingstone corridors 0atropical forest 0avine1 aAlburo, Hemres1 aBarcelona, Julie F.1 aHale, Marie1 aPaguntalan, Lisa1 aSteeves, Tammy1 aPelser, Pieter B.0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 46, no. 4 p.951-961dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163701096986143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04861naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002600175245009800201300001400299520337600313592002803689650001803717650002503735650002803760650003003788650001103818650002103829650001403850650001503864650001103879650001103890650001903901650002203920650002803942650001403970650001003984700002403994700002004018773014904038856006804187856010404255990002304359852000904382655001204391IND60643359820221119085759.0190510e20120217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064335982DNAL7 a10.3791/38882doi7 aPMC34666282pmcid7 a223711432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidowitz, Rachel A.10aIn vitro mesothelial clearance assay that models the early steps of ovarian cancer metastasis  ap. e3888.  aOvarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States1. Despite a positive initial response to therapies, 70 to 90 percent of women with ovarian cancer develop new metastases, and the recurrence is often fatal2. It is, therefore, necessary to understand how secondary metastases arise in order to develop better treatments for intermediate and late stage ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer metastasis occurs when malignant cells detach from the primary tumor site and disseminate throughout the peritoneal cavity. The disseminated cells can form multicellular clusters, or spheroids, that will either remain unattached, or implant onto organs within the peritoneal cavity3 (Figure 1, Movie 1). All of the organs within the peritoneal cavity are lined with a single, continuous, layer of mesothelial cells4-6 (Figure 2). However, mesothelial cells are absent from underneath peritoneal tumor masses, as revealed by electron micrograph studies of excised human tumor tissue sections3,5-7 (Figure 2). This suggests that mesothelial cells are excluded from underneath the tumor mass by an unknown process. Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that primary ovarian cancer cells attach more efficiently to extracellular matrix than to mesothelial cells8, and more recent studies showed that primary peritoneal mesothelial cells actually provide a barrier to ovarian cancer cell adhesion and invasion (as compared to adhesion and invasion on substrates that were not covered with mesothelial cells)9,10. This would suggest that mesothelial cells act as a barrier against ovarian cancer metastasis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ovarian cancer cells breach this barrier, and exclude the mesothelium have, until recently, remained unknown. Here we describe the methodology for an in vitro assay that models the interaction between ovarian cancer cell spheroids and mesothelial cells in vivo (Figure 3, Movie 2). Our protocol was adapted from previously described methods for analyzing ovarian tumor cell interactions with mesothelial monolayers8-16, and was first described in a report showing that ovarian tumor cells utilize an integrin –dependent activation of myosin and traction force to promote the exclusion of the mesothelial cells from under a tumor spheroid17. This model takes advantage of time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to monitor the two cell populations in real time, providing spatial and temporal information on the interaction. The ovarian cancer cells express red fluorescent protein (RFP) while the mesothelial cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP). RFP-expressing ovarian cancer cell spheroids attach to the GFP-expressing mesothelial monolayer. The spheroids spread, invade, and force the mesothelial cells aside creating a hole in the monolayer. This hole is visualized as the negative space (black) in the GFP image. The area of the hole can then be measured to quantitatively analyze differences in clearance activity between control and experimental populations of ovarian cancer and/ or mesothelial cells. This assay requires only a small number of ovarian cancer cells (100 cells per spheroid X 20-30 spheroids per condition), so it is feasible to perform this assay using precious primary tumor cell samples. Furthermore, this assay can be easily adapted for high throughput screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3aextracellular matrix 3afluorescence microscopy 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aintegrins 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amyosin 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3ared fluorescent protein 3ascreening 3awomen1 aIwanicki, Marcin P.1 aBrugge, Joan S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Feb. 17, , no. 60 p.e3888-e3888dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/38883Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3888/in-vitro-mesothelial-clearance-assay-that-models-early-steps-ovarian  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011900174300001400293520109800307592002801405650001201433650001701445650001601462650002101478650000701499653000801506653000801514653000701522653000701529653000701536653000701543653000801550653002301558653004301581653002301624653001301647653003901660700001801699700002101717700002201738773010601760856008601866852000901952655001201961IND60561087220221123034836.0190318e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056108722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazaki, Yasunori10aInfluence of molecular weight and structure on diffusion rates and mechanisms of dextran polyelectrolyte complexes  ap. 42-48.  aThe release profiles of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD) at various molecular weights (20–500kDa) and the swelling behaviors of polyelectrolyte complex-forming tablets were investigated. Four types of tablets were prepared using different combinations of the following chemicals: carboxymethyl dextran (CMD), dextran sulfate (DS), 2-diethylaminoethyl dextran (EA), and 2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium dextran (CDC). Release tests were conducted via the rotating basket method at pH 6.8. Swelling behaviors were analyzed via the front movement method. For all FDs, release rates decreased with decreasing density of charged groups in the matrix, as follows: CMD-EA, CMD-CDC, DS-EA, and DS-CDC. Front movement profiles showed that the dried core disappeared within 3h, leaving the swollen matrix. Results revealed that the tablets rapidly formed hydrated matrices, with release of the incorporated FDs by diffusion and erosion. The tablets successfully released the macromolecules, and we determined that the release rates could be controlled with a combination of dextran derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3adextran 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescein 3amolecular weight 3apH 0aCDC 0aCMD 0aDS 0aEA 0aFD 0aJP 0aPEC 0aDextran derivative 0aPolyelectrolyte-complex forming tablet 0aControlled release 0aSwelling 0aFluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran1 aMieno, Midori1 aUchino, Tomonobu1 aKagawa, Yoshiyuki0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 162 p.42-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245020100159300001800360520113300378592002801511650003001539650001801569650001201587650001601599650003901615650002501654650001301679700001901692700001401711700001701725773009101742856007801833852000901911655001201920IND60082151320221118051003.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008215132DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2014001162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Qifeng10aEnhancement of enantioselectivity in chiral capillary electrophoresis using hydroxypropyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin as chiral selector under molecular crowding conditions induced by dextran or dextrin  ap. 2938-2945.  aMolecular crowding is a new approach to enhance the retention properties and selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymers. In this work, this concept was first applied to chiral CE to enhance its enantioselectivity. A model system, enantioseparation of salbutamol using hydroxypropyl‐beta‐cyclodextrin as chiral selector in the presence of dextran or dextrin as crowding‐inducing agents, was chosen to demonstrate its potency. Some parameters, especially the concentration of crowding‐inducing agents and cyclodextrins were investigated intensively. Moreover, based on fluorescence spectroscopy and affinity CE, it was found that the presence of crowding‐inducing agents could promote the association of enantiomers with cyclodextrins and intensify the interacting differences of two enantiomers with cyclodextrins. As a result, the essential concentration of cyclodextrins to make the enantiomers reach baseline separation was significantly decreased with the aid of molecular crowding. This study shows that molecular crowding is an effective strategy to enhance the enantioselectivity of cyclodextrin in chiral CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acyclodextrins 3adextran 3aenantiomers 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers1 aYang, Fengqing1 aChen, Hua1 aXia, Zhining0 tElectrophoresis.g2014 Oct., v. 35, no. 20 p.2938-2945dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2014001163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03792naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245029900170300001400469520239200483592002802875650002302903650002202926650001902948650002002967650001702987650003903004650002103043650001303064650001603077650003003093650001303123650001603136700002403152773011203176856008603288990002303374852000903397655001203406IND60093734520221120202617.0141103e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009373452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar Keshav,10aApplication of ‘multivariate curve resolution alternating least square (MCR–ALS)’ analysis to extract pure component synchronous fluorescence spectra at various wavelength offsets from total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (TSFS) data set of dilute aqueous solutions of fluorophores  ap. 78-86.  aIn the present study, the possibility of using the multivariate curve resolution alternating least square (MCR–ALS) analysis for the simultaneous extraction of the pure synchronous fluorescence spectra at various wavelength offsets (Δλ) for each fluorophore from the total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (TSFS) data set of the dilute aqueous mixtures of the three fluorophores, was explored. The present work was based on the assumption that unfolded TSFS data has a bilinear structure and therefore it can be subjected to MCR–ALS analysis. Three fluorophores, benzo[a]pyrene(BaP), perylene(PE), and pyrene(PY), were chosen. These three fluorophores show fluorescence at all the seven wavelength offsets (Δλ) used to create the TSFS data set. In addition, Raman scattering due to solvent molecules (i.e. water) also appear in the wavelength ranges where these fluorophores show fluorescence. These two factors make the simultaneous extraction of synchronous spectral profile at various Δλs from the TSFS data set relatively difficult. The appearance of the diagonal signals in the three‐dimensional landscapes of TSFS shows the presence of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal due to solvent molecules was found to influence the synchronous profile of a fluorophore to different extents at different Δλs. TSFS data set of dimension, sample×wavelength×Δλ, was unfolded along the first mode to obtain the unfolded TSFS data set. Pure synchronous spectral profiles at various Δλs were obtained for each fluorophore by performing the MCR–ALS analysis on the unfolded TSFS data. However Raman scattering signals could not be eliminated from the synchronous spectral profiles of the PE and PY. For the mitigation of Raman scattering from the calculated spectral profiles, TSFS data of solvent blank were subtracted from all the samples before performing the MCR–ALS analysis. The obtained spectral profiles of BaP, PE, and PY were found to match with their actual spectral profiles which verifies that unfolded TSFS data set has a bilinear structure. To test the strength of the present work, MCR–ALS analysis was also performed on the unfolded TSFS data set of 12 groundwater samples which were contaminated with the BaP‐ and PY‐spiked gasoline. The obtained results show that it is possible to monitor the presence of BaP and PY in groundwater samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3adata collection 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3agasoline 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3asolvents 3awavelengths1 aMishra, Ashok Kumar0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 July, v. 116 p.78-86dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.04.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007800181300001800259520076200277592002801039650001301067650001801080650002301098650001301121650001301134653002301147653002201170653002201192653002901214700002101243700006501264773011601329856008501445852000901530655001201539IND60614426520221120072319.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061442652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusumawardhani, Hadiastri10aSolvent Tolerance in Bacteria: Fulfilling the Promise of the Biotech Era?  ap. 1025-1039.  aThe challenge of sustainably producing highly valuable chemical compounds requires specialized microbial cell factories because many of these compounds can be toxic to microbial hosts.

The phylogenetic analysis of the detected types of BPV was also performed, followed by developing a point-of-need molecular assay for the rapid identification of identified BPV types. In this regard, a total of 308 cattle from private farms in Egypt were clinically examined, of which 13 animals presented cutaneous warts due to suspected BPV infection. The symptomatic animals were treated surgically, and biopsies from skin lesions were collected for BPV-1, -2, -4, -5, and -10 molecular identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of BPV-1 DNA was confirmed in 11 collected samples (84.6%), while BPV-2, -4, -5, and -10 were not detected. Sequencing of the PCR products suggested the Egyptian virus is closely related to BPV found in India. An isothermal nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with labeled primers specific for the BPV-1 L1 gene sequence, and based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), in combination with a lateral flow strip assay for the detection of RPA products, was developed and tested. The point-of-need molecular assay demonstrated a diagnostic utility comparable to PCR-based testing. Taken together, the present study provides interesting molecular data related to the occurrence of BPV-1 in Egypt and reveals the genetic relatedness of the Egyptian BPV-1 with BPV-1 found in buffalo in India. In addition, a simple, low-cost combined test was also validated for diagnosis of the infection. The present study suggests the necessity of future investigations about the circulating strains of the virus among the cattle in Egypt to assess their genetic relatedness and better understand the epidemiological pattern of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3agene amplification 3agenetic relationships 3ahead 3aneck 3anucleotide sequences 3apapilloma 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arecombinase polymerase amplification 3aviruses 3aEgypt 3aIndia1 aMauk, Michael  G.1 aElnaker, Yasser  F.1 aMosad, Samah  M.1 aTahoun, Amin 1 aEl-Sherif, Mohamed  W.1 aLokman, Maha  S.1 aKassab, Rami  B.1 aAbdelsadik, Ahmed 1 aSaleh, Ayman  A.1 aElmahallawy, Ehab  Kotb0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101019293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010900205520133900314592002801653650001401681650002201695650001401717650001301731650001601744650001701760650002101777650000701798650001301805650001101818650001401829650001001843653001201853653001101865653001601876653001301892653001801905653000901923653001101932653000801943653000701951700002001958700002001978700005801998700002002056773012102076856008202197852000902279655001202288IND60727466520221121061838.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072746652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1110792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemmens, Elien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3054-244410aMineral bio-accessibility and intrinsic saccharides in breakfast flakes manufactured from sprouted wheat  aThe objective was to produce breakfast flakes by extrusion using whole meal from sprouted wheat to increase mineral bio-accessibility and provide intrinsic sweetness without compromising their textural properties. Resting the ingredient mixture containing whole meal from (sprouted) wheat at 50 °C and pH 3.8 for 1 h prior to flake production allowed in situ endogenous phytase action. This resulted in end-products that had higher bio-accessibilities of Fe (29–38%) and of Zn (17–32%) than corresponding values for control flakes (8% and 8%, respectively). Further, the sweetness of breakfast flakes can be enhanced as sprouted grains are a source of intrinsic saccharides released by starch degrading enzymes. Substituting control wheat by sprouted wheat in the breakfast flake recipe led to darker flakes with increased density corrected hardness. The latter was due to lower bulk densities and higher starch crystallinity than observed for control flakes. Nevertheless, the flakes still had 70–80% of their initial hardness after soaking for 30 s in semi-skimmed milk. The here developed wheat flakes meet the growing consumer interest in healthy and tasty foods. Further, the presented technology lowers the need for extrinsic micronutrient fortification by making full use of the nutritional potential of wheat grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreakfast 3acrystal structure 3aextrusion 3ahardness 3aingredients 3alow fat milk 3anutrient content 3apH 3aphytases 3astarch 3asweetness 3awheat 0aPhytate 0aSugars 0aGermination 0aHardness 0aCereal flakes 0aFmax 0aICP-MS 0aNsr 0arp1 aDeleu, Lomme J.1 aDe Brier, Niels1 aSmolders, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3054-24441 aDelcour, Jan A.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111079-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1110793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245009600158500001400254520155100268592002801819650000801847650001301855650001001868650002301878650001701901650001501918650002101933650001401954650002801968650001001996650001902006700002302025700002302048700002302071700002102094773012102115856007502236852000902311655001202320IND60715208520221119075351.0201026e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071520852DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101019302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTvrdá, Eva 10aQuercetin and Naringenin Provide Functional and Antioxidant Protection to Stored Boar Semen  aNAL-light  aIn this study, we evaluated the impact of 5–50 μM quercetin (QUE) and naringenin (NAR) on extended boar spermatozoa in the BTS (Beltsville Thawing Solution) medium for 72 h. Spermatozoa motion, membrane, acrosome, and DNA integrity were investigated immediately after sample dilution (0 h) as well as after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of semen storage. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide production, as well as the extent of oxidative damage to the sperm proteins and lipids, were assessed to determine the potential of QUE and NAR to prevent a potential loss of sperm vitality due to oxidative stress development. Our results indicate that the most notable parameter influenced by QUE was the mitochondrial activity, which remained significantly higher throughout the experiment (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001; 10 μM), and which correlated with the most prominent maintenance of sperm motility (p < 0.01, 48 h; p < 0.05, 72 h). A significant membrane stabilization (p < 0.01, 24 h and 48 h; p < 0.0001, 72 h) and prevention of lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05, 24 h and 48 h; p < 0.01, 72 h) was primarily observed following administration of 10 and 25 μM NAR; respectively. Administration of 10 μM QUE led to a significant decrease of superoxide (p < 0.0001, 48 h and 72 h) while the most notable decline of ROS generation was recorded in the case of 10 and 25 μM NAR (p < 0.001). This study may provide new information on the specific mechanisms of action involved in the favorable effects of natural biomolecules on spermatozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacrosome 3aboars 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3anaringenin 3aoxidative stress 3aquercetin 3areactive oxygen species 3asemen 3asperm motility1 aDebacker, Mégane 1 aĎuračka, Michal 1 aBeniak, Valentín,1 aBučko, Ondřej 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101019303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245007500179300001800254520093100272592002801203650001401231650001301245650001401258650001201272653001701284653002201301653001801323653001701341700003101358700003601389700002001425773013601445856008901581852000901670655001201679IND60761355320221122041039.0211228e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076135532DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163701096986872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchilling, Edward E.10aRelationships of Oxylobus, an Alpine Genus of Eupatorieae (Asteraceae)  ap. 1121-1130.  aA molecular phylogenetic investigation was carried out to clarify aspects of the systematics of Oxylobus, a primarily Mexican alpine genus of Eupatorieae. Analysis of sequence data from two nuclear (nrDNA ITS, ETS) and three plastid markers (rbcL, ndhF, matK) confirmed the monophyly of Oxylobus and placed species of Ageratina as its sister group. A survey of 56 samples of Oxylobus using nrDNA ITS and ETS provided support for the currently accepted species, and showed the recently described O. coyulensis to be distinct and the sister group to the rest of the genus. The results also confirmed the placement of O. juarezensis in synonymy with O. subglabrus. The results of a broad survey of Ageratina for ITS data showed that it is likely not monophyletic as currently circumscribed. The phylogenetic results also highlighted the distinctiveness of Piqueria and Piqueriopsis as a distinct clade at the base of Eupatorieae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina 3aPiqueria 3amonophyly 3asurveys 0abiodiversity 0aMexican highlands 0aphylogenetics 0aPiqueriopsis1 aRedonda-Martínez, Rosario1 aMartínez Salas, Esteban Manuel1 aPanero, Jose L.0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 46, no. 4 p.1121-1130dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163701096986873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04345naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009200175300001500267520311700282592002803399650001503427650001603442650002003458650001603478650001703494650001603511650001903527650001503546650001303561650001403574650002103588650001203609650001903621650001003640650001403650650001603664650001003680700002003690773010403710856008803814852000903902655001203911IND60465789720221122044713.0151123e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046578972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00396.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAspöck, Ulrike,10aPhylogenetic relevance of the genital sclerites of Neuropterida (Insecta: Holometabola)  ap. 97-127.  aSegment 9 of male Raphidioptera, comprising tergite, sternite, gonocoxites, gonostyli and gonapophyses, is a benchmark for homologies in the male and female terminalia of the three Neuropterida orders Raphidioptera, Megaloptera and Neuroptera. The segments relating to genitalia are 9, 10 and 11 in males and 7, 8 and 9 in females. Results from holomorphological and recent molecular cladistic analyses of Neuropterida agree in supporting the sister‐group relationships between: (1) the Raphidioptera and the clade Megaloptera + Neuroptera, and (2) the suborder Nevrorthiformia and all other Neuroptera. The main discrepancy between the results of these studies is the nonmonophyly of the suborder Hemerobiiformia in the molecular analysis. The monophyly of the Megaloptera (which has been repeatedly questioned) is further corroborated by a hitherto overlooked ground pattern autapomorphy: the presence of eversible sacs within the complex of the fused gonocoxites 11 in Corydalidae and Sialidae. The recently discovered paired complex of gonocoxites 10 (parameres) in Nipponeurorthus (Nevrorthidae) indicates that the curious apex of sternite 9 of Nevrorthus and Austroneurorthus is the amalgamation of the sclerites of gonocoxites 10 with sternite 9, interpreted as synapomorphic. In the molecular study, the Nevrorthidae, Sisyridae and Osmylidae branch off in consecutive splitting events, a result that is supported by the analysis of male genital sclerites reported here. Extraordinary parallel apomorphies (e.g. excessive enlargement and modification of gonocoxites 10 ending in a thread‐like ‘penisfilum’) in derived representatives of Coniopterygidae, Berothidae, Rhachiberothidae and Mantispidae corroborate the dilarid clade of the morphological analysis and leads us to hypothesize a sister‐group relationship of the Coniopterygidae with the dilarid clade. A re‐interpretation of the tignum of Chrysopidae as gonocoxites 11 means that the structure previously called the gonarcus represents the fused gonocoxites 9. In Hemerobiidae, the corresponding sclerite is consequently also homologized as fused gonocoxites 9. The enlargement of the lateral wings of the gonocoxites in both families is interpreted as a synapomorphy. Excessive enlargement of gonostyli 11 in the Polystoechotid clade and Myrmeleontiformia supports a sister‐group relationship of these two clades. The occurrence of certain serial homologues of female genitalia structures (gonocoxites and gonapophyses), such as the digitiform processus together with the flat appendices in segment 8 of certain Myrmeleontidae, or the wart‐like processus together with the flat circular sclerites in segment 7 of certain Berothidae, as well as the presence of gonocoxites 8 as pseudosternites in certain Nemopteridae and Coniopterygidae, are probably character reversals. The digitiform processus of tergite 9 (pseudogonocoxites) in Rhachiberothidae and Austroberothella (Berothidae) are either independently developed acquisitions with a function in oviposition, or are homologous sclerites, possibly of epipleurite origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBerothidae 3aChrysopidae 3aConiopterygidae 3aCorydalidae 3aHemerobiidae 3aMantispidae 3aMyrmeleontidae 3aNevrorthus 3aSialidae 3aSisyridae 3afemale genitalia 3afemales 3amale genitalia 3amales 3amonophyly 3aoviposition 3awings1 aAspöck, Horst,0 tSystematic entomology.g2008 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.97-127dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00396.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007300171300001700244520095700261592002801218650001801246650001901264650001701283650001001300650002601310650001901336650001201355650001901367650002901386653001801415653000801433653001201441653001801453653001401471653001901485700001801504700002201522700002101544773011501565856008501680852000901765655001201774IND60614426820221120230402.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061442682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehler, Juliane10aCRISPR-Based Technologies for Metabolic Engineering in Cyanobacteria  ap. 996-1010.  aIn metabolic engineering, the production of industrially relevant chemicals, via rational engineering of microorganisms, is an intensive area of research. One particular group of microorganisms that is fast becoming recognized for their commercial potential is cyanobacteria. Through the process of photosynthesis, cyanobacteria can use CO2 as a building block to synthesize carbon-based chemicals. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dependent approaches have rapidly gained popularity for engineering cyanobacteria. Such approaches permit markerless genome editing, simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes, and transcriptional regulation of genes. The drastically shortened timescale for mutant selection and segregation is especially advantageous for cyanobacterial work. In this review, we highlight studies that have implemented CRISPR-based tools for the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3agene editing 3agenes 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 0abiotechnology 0aCas 0aCRISPRi 0agreen economy 0amultiplex 0aphotosynthesis1 aVijay, Dhanya1 aHess, Wolfgang R.1 aAkhtar, M.

We investigated the influence of the timing of ice melt, water temperature, and photoperiod on the breeding phenology of the Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens (Schreber, 1782)) in southern Alberta, Canada, using automated recording units. We also examined the influence of wind speed, relative humidity, water temperature, and time of day on calling activity. The initiation of calling varied by 13 days at our three sites, suggesting that calling was influenced more by water temperature and timing of ice melt than photoperiod. Calling was first observed 8–11 days after ice melt at water temperatures of 7.5–8 °C at our sites. No calling was detected at water temperature <5 °C. We recorded nocturnal and diurnal calling at all sites; >50% of calling was diurnal, even on days with warm overnight temperatures. Calling activity was influenced by time of day, water temperature, wind, and relative humidity. Our results suggest that date of initiation of calling varies considerably among breeding ponds and that the time of day of peak calling varies with both site and water temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates pipiens 3aamphibians 3aautomation 3abreeding 3abreeding behavior 3aenvironmental factors 3aice 3amelting 3aphenology 3aponds 3arelative humidity 3atemperate zones 3awater temperature 3awind speed 3aAlberta 0aauditory surveys 0aautomated recording units 0aARUs 0abreeding 0acalling 0aLithobates pipiens 0aNorthern Leopard Frog 0aphenology 0aRana pipiens 0atemperature1 aRandall, L.A.1 aBarclay, R.M.R.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 2 p.163-169dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-02393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05845naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245008000205500001900285520426000304592002804564596005904592650000804651650002904659650000904688650000904697650001204706650001904718650001204737650001804749650000904767650001104776650001504787650001004802650000904812650001104821650001304832650001404845650001404859650001504873650002504888650000904913650001604922650001604938650002504954651001104979653001404990653001405004700002005018700001705038700001605055773010405071856008305175852000905258655001205267IND60719246520221118011545.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071924652DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-20-1116-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalem, N.

Fruit rot caused by Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) is a damaging postharvest disease (Van Hove et al. 2011). In June and July of 2018 and 2019, dark brown spots were observed on the epidermis of banana fruit in the Jordan Valley. Occasionally, spots coalesced. Spots were brown to dark brown with lacunae at the center and typically surrounded by light brown halos. Larger spots had cracks, which exposed the pulp. Whitish fungal colonies were frequently observed on the spots. Initially, virtually no pulp damage was observed. Cut surfaces of crowns and pedicels sometimes were also blackened and often covered with whitish mycelia. As the disease progressed, spots were covered by whitish colonies over the whole fruit, and the pulp showed extensive decay. The disease affected ∼80% of fruits during the harvest and first 3 weeks postharvest. Pieces of skin (0.5 × 0.5 cm) from symptomatic bananas were disinfected by dipping into 5% NaOCl for 1 min followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water three times. Pieces were placed on PDA and incubated at 25°C for 5 days. The hyphal agar plugs were subcultured on new PDA plates. Isolates were cultured on synthetic low-nutrient agar with a ∼1 × 2-cm strip of sterile filter paper on the surface (Nirenberg 1976). Cultures were incubated for 10 to 14 days at 20°C in darkness. When sporulation was observed, agar blocks were mounted on a microscopic slide with a drop of lactophenol cotton blue and examined at 400×. Colonies grew rapidly with abundant pink to violet aerial hyphae. Sporodochia formed on the agar, and the aerial conidiophores branched sparsely, often alternately or oppositely, terminating with up to three verticillate phialides. Macroconidia were abundant, falcate to straight, three- to five-septate, with a distinct foot cell, 25 to 71 × 3.3 to 5.4 μm. Microconidia produced on polyphialides and aggregating in heads, were unicellular, ovoidal, ellipsoidal, or allantoid, 4.1 to 18 × 1.7 to 4.3 μm. Chlamydospores were not observed. Based on morphological characteristics, it was tentatively identified as F. verticillioides (Al-Hatmi et al. 2016; Guarro 2013). The ITS region, TEF1, and RPB2 for five isolates were amplified by PCR using the primers and protocols of White et al. (1990), O’Donnell et al. (1998), and Liu et al. (1999), respectively. PCR products of the ITS and TEF1 were purified and ligated into pGEM T-Easy Vector (Promega), and two clones for each PCR product were bidirectionally sequenced (Macrogen). PCR products of RPB2 were isolated directly from the gel using a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) and sent for direct sequencing from both directions (QuintaraBio). All sequences were deposited in GenBank (MN335231 to MN335240). BLASTn analyses of the nucleotide sequences were 100% identical to F. verticillioides sequences. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method (MEGA X) with the combined TEF1 and RPB2 sequences. The isolates clustered with F. verticillioides strains. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled to confirm F. verticillioides. Inoculation tests were carried out in duplicate on healthy green bananas (cv. Grand Naine) that were lightly wounded by piercing the skin with a bundle of 20 sterile sewing needles and placing hyphal agar plugs (5 × 5 mm) from a 5-day-old culture of isolate JO-B499 on wounded (W) and nonwounded (NW) areas. Uninoculated PDA plugs on W and NW fruit were a negative control. Inoculated fruit was incubated at 25°C for 2 weeks in plastic boxes. JO-B499 induced light to dark brown spots on W and NW parts. Spots on W parts were larger and developed faster than on NW parts. Some larger brown spots, especially on W parts, had whitish mycelial colonies surrounded by yellow halos. These spots extended after 2 weeks, yielding symptoms similar to those in the field. This is the first report of F. verticillioides causing fruit rot of banana in Jordan. It is a major pathogen of maize and a producer of fumonisin mycotoxins (Blacutt et al. 2018). Our results open an avenue to future studies on the spread and impact of this fungus, which may pose a threat to banana and other plants in Jordan.  aPublisher supplied data  aAgr. 1/9/2014cScientific Research Support Fund Jordan 3aDNA 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aMusa 3aagar 3abananas 3achlamydospores 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acorn 3afruits 3afumonisins 3afungi 3agels 3ahyphae 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplant rots 3apostharvest diseases 3apulp 3asporodochia 3asporulation 3astatistical analysis 3aJordan 0aMusa spp. 0afruit rot1 aAlMomany, A.

In this study, Ca²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Ag⁺ ranging 0.001–0.004 mol/g were used to improve the properties of Co-PAAS blend films based on the rationale of their potential electrostatic interaction with these biopolymers. As expected, Zeta-potential film-forming solutions was decreased to some extent with the addition of metal ions. SEM images presented that the surface of the composites became coarser and internal structure became more stratified as metal ion contents increased. Tensile strength was increased by the addition of these ions with a varied optimal concentration: Ca²⁺ (0.003 mol/g), Fe³⁺ (0.002 mol/g) and Ag⁺ (0.001 mol/g). Water vapor permeability (WVP), solubility and light transmission value of films while causing film thickness no obvious change. In addition, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicated that the metal ions improved the thermal stability of the composite film. Therefore, Ca²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Ag⁺ with an appropriate addition amount can be used as a potential alternative to reinforce collagenous composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3acollagen 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3airon 3alight transmission 3ametal ions 3apermeability 3apolyacrylic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asolubility 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awater vapor 3azeta potential 0aMetal ions 0aCollagen 0aBiodegradable film 0aSodium polyacrylate (PAAS) 0aElectrostatic interaction1 aWang, Wenhang1 aWang, Yabin1 aGuo, Yang1 aDuan, Songmei1 aZhao, Kaixuan1 aLi, Shuzhi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Nov., v. 119 p.15-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245009900208300002000307520103500327592002801362650001501390650002101405650002201426650002001448650001301468650001301481650001301494650002001507700005901527773013201586856008401718852000901802655001201811IND60671559420221119180738.0191003e20190906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067155942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b031622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulo, Joao A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4291-413X10amTMT: An Alternative, Nonisobaric, Tandem Mass Tag Allowing for Precursor-Based Quantification  ap. 12167-12172.  aStable isotope labeling of peptides is the basis for numerous mass-spectrometry-based quantification strategies. Isobaric tagging and metabolic labeling, namely, tandem mass tagging (TMT) and SILAC, are among the most widely used techniques for relative protein quantification. Here we report an alternative, precursor-based quantification method using nonisobaric TMT variants: TMTzero (TMT0) and superheavy TMT (shTMT). We term this strategy mass difference tandem mass tagging (mTMT). These TMT variants differ by 11 mass units; however, peptides labeled with these reagents coelute, analogous to SILAC-labeled peptide pairs. As a proof-of-concept, we profiled the proteomes of two cell lines that are frequently used in neuroscience studies, SH-SY5Y and SVGp12, using mTMT and standard SILAC-labeling approaches. We show similar quantified proteins and peptides for each method, with highly correlated fold-changes between workflows. We conclude that mTMT is a suitable alternative for precursor-based protein quantification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3aneurophysiology 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3astable isotopes1 aGygi, Steven P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7626-00340 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 06, v. 91, no. 19 p.12167-12172dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b031623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245013500182300001800317520067500335592002801010650001501038650001201053650001501065650001301080650001601093650001901109651001101128653001501139653001301154653001501167653002001182700002601202700004601228700002901274700003701303773013601340856008901476961000901565852000901574655001201583IND60761355520221122040954.0211228e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076135552DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163701096987132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Rogério Neves10aRe-Evaluation of Praxelis (Asteraceae, Eupatorieae) in Brazil and Description of Praxelis scaturicola, an Unusual Riverine Species  ap. 1131-1140.  aPraxelis scaturicola, a new Cerrado biome species, is described and illustrated.

All species in this subfamily are fully mycoheterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by parasitizing fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Here, we examine relationships and host specificity in one of the most widespread species in this subfamily, Monotropa uniflora. We use several lines of evidence to investigate whether there is support for recognizing a segregate, M. brittonii, as distinct. Based on molecular and morphological analysis of Monotropa collected throughout its range in the United States, we find two distinct lineages, one of which corresponds morphologically and geographically to Small's M. brittonii. We identified several morphological characters that differ between the two species. We also observed a high degree of fungal host specificity in M. brittonii, which appears to parasitize almost exclusively Lactifluus subgenus Lactariopsis section Albati. Additionally, M. brittonii was primarily collected from Florida scrub, which are xeric, shrub-dominated habitats that differ substantially from the mesic forests where M. uniflora typically occurs. Based on these molecular, morphological, and ecological differences, we support recognition of M. brittonii as distinct from M. uniflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonotropa 3aconvergent evolution 3afungi 3ahost specificity 3aphotosynthesis 3asymbiosis 3aFlorida 0amycoheterotrophy 0aspecies delimitation1 aBroe, Michael B.1 aFreudenstein, John V.0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 46, no. 4 p.1067-1079dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163701096987223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012200164300002000286520141300306592002801719650001101747650001301758650002101771650001801792650001801810650001001828650001601838650003101854650001501885650000701900650001401907700001401921700001401935700001701949700005101966700005302017773013202070856008402202852000902286655001202295IND60671559520221119180929.0191003e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067155952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b031722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Peng10aColorimetric Sensor Array Based on Wulff-Type Boronate Functionalized AgNPs at Various pH for Bacteria Identification  ap. 12134-12137.  aThe efficient identification of bacteria is of considerable significance in clinical diagnosis. Herein, a novel colorimetric sensor array was developed for the detection and identification of bacteria based on the specific affinity and electrostatic interaction between Wulff-type 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA)-mercaptoethylamine (MA) cofunctionalized AgNPs (MPBA-MA@AgNPs) and bacteria at various pH. In the neutral and alkaline conditions, AgNPs tended to be dispersed due to the specific affinity between cis-diol residues contained in carbohydrate-rich compositions on the bacterial cell surface and MPBA. Bacterial cells have different carbohydrate compositions on their surface. The differential binding affinity of MPBA on the surface of AgNPs to cis-diol residues of various carbohydrates resulted in a different color change of AgNPs, which could be tuned by pH. On the contrary, AgNPs tended to be aggregated due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged MA and negatively charged bacteria under acidic conditions. Therefore, using various pH buffer solutions as the sensing elements and MPBA-MA@AgNPs as the indicator, bacteria could be differentiated from each other by their own color response patterns. Moreover, the complex bacteria mixtures could be well discriminated. The method is simple, efficient, and visual and has a potential application in pathogen diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3abacteria 3abinding capacity 3aboronic acids 3acarbohydrates 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ananosilver 3apH 3apathogens1 aDing, Zhi1 aLi, Xizhe1 aDong, Yanhua1 aFu, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6356-18711 aWu, Yayan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5127-25970 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 02, v. 91, no. 19 p.12134-12137dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b031723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015200169300001800321520140900339592002801748650002201776650001601798650002301814650000901837650003901846650002101885650001901906650002101925650001301946650000701959650002101966650002401987650001702011650003302028650001702061650003702078650001902115700002502134700002202159700001502181700001802196700002002214700001902234700002402253700001602277700002402293773010402317856008602421852000902507655001202516IND60578297220221122233054.0170812e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b028152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Mengmeng10aPartitioning of Small Molecules in Hydrogen-Bonding Complex Coacervates of Poly(acrylic acid) and Poly(ethylene glycol) or Pluronic Block Copolymer  ap. 3818-3830.  aComplex coacervation of polymers can be a route to the compartmentalization of aqueous solutions. Presented here is a study of the hydrogen-bonded complex coacervation of poly(acrylic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) or Pluronic block copolymers and the ability of these coacervates to encapsulate various ionic and nonionic dyes as well as a pharmaceutical compound within them. The formation of complex coacervate driven by hydrogen bonding is studied as a function of both pH and salt content with turbidimetry and isothermal calorimetry. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows the presence of micelles within Pluronic containing coacervate materials formed with a Pluronic block copolymer concentration higher than its critical micelle concentration. Although dyes generally partition to the coacervate phase, in the absence of salt, dyes that are able to hydrogen bond with the coacervate components are better incorporated into the coacervate. It is observed that the addition of salt to the polymer solutions increases the hydrophobicity of the environment within the coacervate, increasing the ability to sequester dye molecules for which there is no hydrogen bonding with the coacervate components. These materials are characterized with UV–vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurements, isothermal calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and fluorescence spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acalorimetry 3acomposite polymers 3adyes 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3asalt content 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3aturbidimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential1 aEghtesadi, Seyed Ali1 aDawadi, Mahesh B.1 aWang, Chao1 aHuang, Shuyue1 aSeymore, Amy E.1 aVogt, Bryan D.1 aModarelli, David A.1 aLiu, Tianbo1 aZacharia, Nicole S.0 tMacromolecules.g2017 May 23, v. 50, no. 10 p.3818-3830dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b028153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009000173300001600263520125500279592002801534650001501562650000801577650003501585650002101620650001201641650001401653650001001667650002501677650001401702650001001716650001401726773010501740856008801845852000901933655001201942IND60465790020221122022309.0151123e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046579002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00410.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZWICK, ANDREAS10aMolecular phylogeny of Anthelidae and other bombycoid taxa (Lepidoptera: Bombycoidea)  ap. 190-209.  aBased on DNA sequences of the fusion protein carbamoylphosphate synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydroorotase (CAD; 680 bp) and elongation factor‐1α (Ef‐1α; 1240 bp); the first molecular phylogeny of the moth family Anthelidae and its placement within the Bombycoidea sensu Brock (1971) (= bombycoid complex sensu Minet, 1994) is proposed. The results strongly support the monophyly of the family Anthelidae and its subfamilies Munychryiinae and Anthelinae, but demonstrate the vast polyphyly of its main genus Anthela Walker, 1855. The proposed phylogeny suggests that grass feeding, as apparent from some pest records, probably is an ancestral trait within the subfamily Anthelinae. Evolutionary relationships of the family Anthelidae and of most parts of the Bombycoidea remain obscure. However, the results contradict many of the widely accepted phylogenetic hypotheses within the Bombycoidea proposed by Minet (1994: Entomologica scandinavica, 25, 63–88). The Brahmaeidae are paraphyletic relative to the Lemoniidae (syn.nov.), and the current concept of Bombycidae is polyphyletic, with the bombycid subfamily Apatelodinae being part of a monophylum comprising Brahmaeidae / Lemoniidae, Eupterotidae and Apatelodidae (stat.rev.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombycidae 3aDNA 3aaspartate carbamoyltransferase 3afamily relations 3agrasses 3amonophyly 3amoths 3anucleotide sequences 3aparaphyly 3apests 3apolyphyly0 tSystematic entomology.g2008 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.190-209dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00410.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015500156300001800311500001500329520141600344592002801760650002201788650002001810650000901830650002601839653002401865700002101889700002201910700002101932700001201953773008001965856007302045852000902118655001202127IND60082151920221118051053.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008215192DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.122852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtovic, Pete10aLet's Call A Truce…For Now: The Silent Bared‐Teeth Face Expression in Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) During Baseline and Post‐Conflict Conditions  ap. 1118-1127.  a2019-12-06  aThe distinction between signals that are friendly and those that are non‐aggressive but motivationally neutral (signals of benign intent, SBIs) has not often been well elucidated in the literature. Although both signals occur in similar contexts, friendly signals should be exchanged more often between animals with good relationships whereas SBIs should be more commonly exchanged between animals with poor or unpredictable relationships. The importance of this distinction is particularly salient in the post‐conflict context, because the two different types of signals may have disparate distributions and functions. This study examines the nature of the silent bared‐teeth face (SBTF) in captive mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) both during baseline interactions and following aggressive conflicts. We report that the SBTF is most commonly exchanged between mandrills with high rates of agonism. In addition, the SBTF is the most common post‐conflict signal exchanged, and the mandrills exchanging this signal after fighting also have poor relationships. We conclude that, although one must be careful in generalizing from studies of captive populations, the mandrill SBTF observed in this study is most accurately classified as a signal of benign intent, but not a truly friendly signal and discuss problems with interpreting post‐conflict data without distinguishing between these types of signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3afighting behavior 3acaptive animals 3aface 3aobservational studies 0afighting (behavior)1 aPartan, Sarah R.1 aBryant, Judith B.1 aHutchinson, Eric1 aZeh, D.0 tEthology.g2014 Nov., v. 120, no. 11 p.1118-1127dP.

Due to their toxicity, worldwide distribution, and lack of information in spermatozoa physiology during pre-fertilization processes, the present study seeks to analyze the toxic effects and possible alterations caused by the presence of these compounds in boar sperm during the in vitro capacitation. The spermatozoa capacitation was performed in supplemented TALP-Hepes media and mean lethal concentration values of 460.55 μM for PFOS, and 1930.60 μM for PFHxS were obtained. Results by chlortetracycline staining showed that intracellular Ca²⁺ patterns bound to membrane proteins were scarcely affected by PFOS. The spontaneous acrosome reaction determined by FITC-PNA was significantly reduced by PFOS and slightly increased by PFHxS. Both toxic compounds significantly alter the normal capacitation process from 30 min of exposure. An increase in ROS production was observed by flow cytometry and considerable DNA fragmentation by the comet assay. The immunocytochemistry showed a decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation in proteins of the equatorial and acrosomal zone of the spermatozoa head. In conclusion, PFOS and PFHxS have toxic effects on the sperm, causing mortality and altering vital parameters for proper sperm capacitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome reaction 3aboars 3acalcium 3achlortetracycline 3acomet assay 3aflow cytometry 3ahead 3aimmunocytochemistry 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asperm capacitation 3aspermatozoa 3asulfonates 3atoxicity 3atyrosine1 aPérez-Cerezales, Serafín 1 aOrtiz Sánchez, Paola Berenice,1 aMondragon-Payne, Oscar 1 aSánchez-Sánchez, Raúl 1 aJiménez-Morales, Irma 1 aFierro, Reyna 1 aGonzález-Márquez, Humberto 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101019343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245013500175300001400310520218000324592002802504650001502532650001402547650002002561650001402581650001402595773010302609856008802712852000902800655001202809IND60465790420221122021958.0151123e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046579042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00398.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPACKER, LAURENCE10aPhylogeny and classification of the Xeromelissinae (Hymenoptera: Apoidea, Colletidae) with special emphasis on the genus Chilicola  ap. 72-96.  aA phylogenetic analysis and classification are provided for the bee subfamily Xeromelissinae based on 248 morphological characters, many of which are novel and illustrated. A total of 47 ingroup species was included in the analysis, representing at least two divergent members from each described genus or subgenus and seven taxa which did not readily fall within previously described subgenera. Three most parsimonious trees were found (length, 1508; consistency index, 40; retention index, 70). The result shows that Xeromelissa renders Chilimelissa paraphyletic, and the 20 known Chilimelissa species are reassigned to Xeromelissa, giving the following new combinations: X. luisa (Toro & Moldenke) (this is the type species of Chilimelissa), X. mucar (Toro & Moldenke), X. xanthorhina (Toro), X. brevimalaris (Toro), X. rosie (Toro and Packer), X. laureli (Toro and Packer), X. chusmiza (Toro), X. longipalpa (Toro), X. pedroi (Toro & Moldenke), X. australis (Toro & Moldenke), X. chillan (Toro & Moldenke), X. farellones (Toro & Moldenke), X. machi (Toro), X. minuta (Toro & Moldenke), X. nortina (Toro & Moldenke), X. sielfeldi (Toro & Moldenke), X. obscura (Toro & Moldenke), X. irwini (Toro & Moldenke), X. nolanai (Toro & Moldenke) and X. rozeni (Toro & Moldenke). Group support was estimated using symmetric resampling and group supported/contradicted (GC) ratios, which compare the frequency of each most parsimoniously resolved clade with the alternative arrangement that was most commonly found in resampling. Relationships among subgenera for Chilicola are weakly supported. By contrast, when three previously synonymized subgenera (Stenoediscelis, Heteroediscelis and Oediscelisca) are resurrected, there is good support for all subgenera (GC ≥ 99), except two: a paraphyletic Oediscelis and a polyphyletic Anoediscelis. Both of these subgenera became monophyletic following successive approximations character weighting. Four distinctive new subgenera are described: Unicarinicola Packer subgen.n., Obesicola Packer subgen.n., Capitatiscopa Packer subgen.n. and Toroediscelis Packer subgen.n., and a revised key to the subgenera of Chilicola is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletidae 3amonophyly 3anew combination 3aparaphyly 3apolyphyly0 tSystematic entomology.g2008 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.72-96dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00398.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245013700177300001600314520109400330592002801424650001501452650001501467650001701482650001001499650001701509653002101526653001801547653001901565653001701584700002101601773013401622856008901756852000901845655001201854IND60761355720221122040905.0211228e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076135572DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X163701096987312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYashiro, Katsuhiro10aDiversification of Stem Morphological and Anatomical Characteristics in Eleocharis and Related Genera (Cyperaceae, Monocotyledoneae)  ap. 935-950.  aThe genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae, monocotyledons) is characterized by bladeless leaves, which are leaves having only leaf-sheaths. To study the evolutionary process through which Eleocharis species lost their leaf blades, we analyzed the outer morphological and anatomical characters of the representative Eleocharis species, plus species from nine phylogenetically related genera. From the analysis, we recognized eight characters and we optimized their character states on a recent molecular phylogenetic tree. As a result, we recognized five characteristics shared by Eleocharis species as follows: (1) the most apical internode is more than seven times longer than the next apical internode; (2) bladeless leaves having only leaf sheaths; (3) transversely septate aerenchyma in culms; (4) densely and peripherally located, slender, and square timber-shaped fiber bundles in culms; and (5) palisade chlorenchyma in culms. In these characteristics, (2) and (4) are synapomorphies of Eleocharis. These two apomorphic characteristics seemed to be adaptations for inhabiting running waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis 3aaerenchyma 3achlorenchyma 3aculms 3asynapomorphy 0abladeless leaves 0afiber bundles 0amonocotyledons 0astem anatomy1 aEndō, Yasuhiko,0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 46, no. 4 p.935-950dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X163701096987313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011900167300001400286520130000300592002801600650002601628650001801654650001301672650001001685650002701695650002001722650001301742650001401755650001001769650001401779653001901793653002601812653002601838653002101864700002201885700002301907700002401930700002601954773011301980856007702093852000902170655001202179IND60644523020221121063412.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064452302DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-02772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReitsma, Leonard R.10aExtra-pair paternity in a long-distance migratory songbird beyond neighbors’ borders and across male age classes  ap. 49-54.  aRoughly 90% of socially monogamous bird species exhibit some degree of extra-pair paternity (EPP), although the extent and the underlying mechanisms vary among species. We analyzed spatial and demographic patterns of EPP over a 6 year period (2005–2010) as part of a long-term population study of Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis (L., 1766)). We identified 12 microsatellite loci used to assess paternity for 185 nestlings from 61 nests. Extra-pair young (EPY) accounted for 41.6% of all nestlings and 57.4% of nests contained at least one EPY. Fewer than half of EPY were sired by males who shared territorial boundaries, and some males sired young in nests 1 km from their territory. The age of social males did not differ from males who cuckolded them. The majority (83%) of EPY were sired by males in older age classes (2+ years old), while <17% were sired by 1 year olds. Of the young sired by older males, 58.5% were sired by males 3–7 years old. Males that sired more EPY sired fewer within-pair young (WPY); those without EPY sired more WPY suggesting a possible fitness trade-off between these two strategies. Our findings suggest multiple age-based strategies within a single breeding population, as well as potential strategy shifts to maximize lifetime fitness as they age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardellina canadensis 3aage structure 3abreeding 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory birds 3amonogamy 3anestlings 3anests 3apaternity 0aCanada Warbler 0aCardellina canadensis 0awithin-pair paternity 0alifetime fitness1 aJukosky, James A.1 aKimiatek, Alexi J.1 aGoodnow, Marrisa L.1 aHallworth, Michael T.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 1 p.49-54dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-02773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013200160300001400292520144400306592002801750650002101778650003001799650002201829650001301851650000901864650001501873650001201888650001401900650002101914650000901935650002401944650002501968650001301993651001802006653002402024653001702048653003202065653003102097653001602128653002202144653001702166700001802183773011302201856007702314852000902391655001202400IND60644523120221121042235.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064452312DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-02812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScopel, L.C.10aPredation and food–weather interactions drive colony collapse in a managed metapopulation of Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea)  ap. 13-22.  aSeabirds are considered bioindicators of bottom-up ecosystem processes, owing to seabirds’ dependence on marine prey. However, ground-nesting seabirds are susceptible to predation, which can limit their use as bioindicators. Machias Seal Island (MSI) supported the largest colony of Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea Pontoppidan, 1763) in the Gulf of Maine metapopulation, but prolonged breeding failure led ∼90% of terns to abandon the colony in 2006. We analyzed 12 years of food, weather, and predation data using logistic regression models to determine which had the strongest influence on breeding success. Food–weather interactions were important; under low rainfall, more euphausiids (northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars, 1857)) in the diet increased breeding success, but euphausiids had a negative effect as rainfall became moderate or high. Predation by Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus Pontoppidan, 1763) increased following the cessation of lethal predator control; we identified a predation threshold of 25%, beyond which terns could not breed successfully. The collapse of MSI’s tern colony can be attributed entirely to gull predation. The breeding success of terns at MSI cannot be used as a bottom-up ecosystem bioindicator without accounting for predation. Managers of ground-nesting seabirds should consider predation and food as equally valid potential causes of population or reproductive declines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus argentatus 3aMeganyctiphanes norvegica 3aSterna paradisaea 3abreeding 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aislands 3apredation 3apredator control 3arain 3aregression analysis 3areproductive success 3aseabirds 3aGulf of Maine 0apredator management 0abioindicator 0abottom-up ecosystem control 0atop-down ecosystem control 0aArctic Tern 0aSterna paradisaea 0aconservation1 aDiamond, A.W.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 1 p.13-22dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-02813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010700165300001600272520145200288592002801740650001501768650001501783650002001798650002001818650001401838650001901852650001701871650002101888653001601909653000901925653002201934653001701956653003301973700001802006700001502024700001602039700001802055700001802073700005702091700001902148773008602167856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60767719520221120184226.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinrui10aPorous organic-inorganic hybrids with nonlinear optical properties from fullerenols-metal complexation  ap. 555-562.  aFullerene C₆₀ (refers to C₆₀ hereafter) has good nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, but its poor water solubility greatly limits its application. Chemical modification is an effective way to improve the solubility of C₆₀, which unfortunately greatly reduces its NLO properties, especially true for multi-adducts of C₆₀ such as fullerenols where more than one carbon-carbon double bonds have been destroyed. Here, a strategy is provided to effectively improve the NLO properties of fullerenols via metal coordination, which greatly increases electron delocalization of the hybrid through metal-ligand charge transfer. Thanks to the hard template method, porous organic-inorganic hybrids are synthesized by mixing fullerenols with Ni²⁺ in water in the presence of polystyrene (PS) microspheres, which are further embedded in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to get a composite film. Reverse saturated absorption and optical limiting properties are clearly observed for the composite film. The nonlinear absorption coefficient (β) and the optical limiting threshold are determined to be 1.8E5 cm⋅GW⁻¹ and 0.0308 J cm⁻², respectively, which is superior to fullerenols, pristine C₆₀ and many other NLO materials. Moreover, the preparation of fullerenols-based hybrid materials can be well extended to other divalent metal ions such as Co²⁺, making current strategy highly valuable in the field of nonlinear optics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acomposite films 3adivalent metals 3afullerene 3amicroparticles 3apolystyrenes 3awater solubility 0aFullerenols 0aNi2+ 0aOrganic-inorganic 0aCoordination 0aNonlinear optical properties1 aChen, Mengjun1 aHou, Shida1 aZhao, Luyao1 aZhang, Tianyi1 aJiang, Anning1 aLi, Hongguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5773-50031 aHao, Jingcheng0 tCarbon.g2022 May, v. 191 p.555-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100002700166245008400193300001600277520179300293592002802086650001502114650002402129650000902153650002202162650001802184650001702202650000902219650000902228650001102237650002202248650001902270650002402289650002802313650001302341650001502354650001802369650002802387650001302415650002302428650001002451650006602461650003402527650004602561650006202607650006302669650003602732650003002768650005302798650004202851650005902893700002402952700002102976700002402997700002903021773010303050856008303153852000903236655001203245IND4473391320221121051802.0141111e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447339132DNAL7 a221690742pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomanowska, Elżbieta,10aPhosphorylation of PSII proteins in maize thylakoids in the presence of Pb ions  ap. 345-352.  aLead is potentially toxic to all organisms including plants. Many physiological studies suggest that plants have developed various mechanisms to contend with heavy metals, however the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We studied maize plants in which lead was introduced into detached leaves through the transpiration stream. The photochemical efficiency of PSII, measured as an Fv/Fm ratio, in the maize leaves treated with Pb was only 10% lower than in control leaves. The PSII activity was not affected by Pb ions in mesophyll thylakoids, whereas in bundle sheath it was reduced. Protein phosphorylation in mesophyll and bundle sheath thylakoids was analyzed using mass spectrometry and protein blotting before and after lead treatment. Both methods clearly demonstrated increase in phosphorylation of the PSII proteins upon treatment with Pb²⁺, however, the extent of D1, D2 and CP43 phosphorylation in the mesophyll chloroplasts was clearly higher than in bundle sheath cells. We found that in the presence of Pb ions there was no detectable dephosphorylation of the strongly phosphorylated D1 and PsbH proteins of PSII complex in darkness or under far red light. These results suggest that Pb²⁺ stimulates phosphorylation of PSII core proteins, which can affect stability of the PSII complexes and the rate of D1 protein degradation. Increased phosphorylation of the PSII core proteins induced by Pb ions may be a crucial protection mechanism stabilizing optimal composition of the PSII complexes under metal stress conditions. Our results show that acclimation to Pb ions was achieved in both types of maize chloroplasts in the same way. However, these processes are obviously more complex because of different metabolic status in mesophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3abundle sheath cells 3acorn 3adephosphorylation 3afar-red light 3aheavy metals 3aions 3alead 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3aphotosystem II 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteins 3athylakoids 3atranspiration 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aDarkness 2aLeadxpharmacology 2aLight 2aMesophyll Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aProteolysisxdrug effects 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aThylakoidsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects.1 aWasilewska, Wioleta1 aFristedt, Rikard1 aVener, Alexander V.1 aZienkiewicz, Maksymilian0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 169, no. 4 p.345-352dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007300171300001800244520130700262592002801569650002801597650002201625650002701647650001701674650002501691650002501716700001801741700003301759700002301792773010401815856008601919852000902005655001202014IND60578297520180713000000.0170812e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBironeau, Adrien10aExistence of a Critical Layer Thickness in PS/PMMA Nanolayered Films  ap. 4064-4073.  aAn experimental study was carried out to investigate the existence of a critical layer thickness in nanolayer coextrusion, under which no continuous layer is observed. Polymer films containing thousands of layers of alternating polymers with individual layer thicknesses below 100 nm have been prepared by coextrusion through a series of layer multiplying elements. Different films composed of alternating layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) were fabricated with the aim to reach individual layer thicknesses as small as possible, varying the number of layers, the mass composition of both components, and the final total thickness of the film. Films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and a statistical analysis was used to determine the distribution in layer thicknesses and the continuity of layers. For the PS/PMMA nanolayered systems, results point out the existence of a critical layer thickness around 10 nm, below which the layers break up. This critical layer thickness is reached regardless of the processing route, suggesting it might be dependent only on material characteristics but not on process parameters. We propose this breakup phenomenon is due to small interfacial perturbations that are amplified by (van der Waals) disjoining forces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3afilms (materials) 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolystyrenes 3astatistical analysis 3avan der Waals forces1 aSalez, Thomas1 aMiquelard-Garnier, Guillaume1 aSollogoub, Cyrille0 tMacromolecules.g2017 May 23, v. 50, no. 10 p.4064-4073dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b001763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011700210300001400327520130100341592002801642650001101670650001801681650002201699650001101721650001301732650001401745650001601759653004201775653003201817653002801849653002201877653001901899700002101918700006101939700005902000700006002059700002102119700006602140700002602206700006202232773010202294856008502396852000902481655001202490IND60767719620221122165543.0220404e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeong, Jong Geun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9189-607310aPolybenzimidazole-derived carbon molecular sieve hollow fiber membranes with tailored oxygen selective transport  ap. 71-83.  aPolymer membrane carbonization is a promising strategy to obtain carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane materials with tailorable cavity size distributions for high gas selectivities beyond that attained from traditional polymer membrane materials. Despite their already demonstrated exceptional separation performance characteristics for several gas separation applications (e.g. CO₂/CH₄ and H₂/CO₂), further development of CMS membranes having high O₂/N₂ perm-selectivity for energy-efficient high-purity O₂ production has proven challenging. Herein, we explore CMS hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) derived from highly rigid and tightly-packed polybenzimidazole (PBI) materials. Nearly defect-free PBI-derived CMS HFMs were fabricated and evaluated for O₂/N₂ separation performance for the first time. The micro-structural and O₂ selective gas separation characteristics of PBI-CMS HFMs pyrolyzed at different pyrolysis conditions were intensively studied. With rigorous carbonization protocol optimization, we obtained highly O₂ permselective PBI-CMS HFMs having O₂/N₂ selectivities approaching 14, enabling high purity O₂ production. The PBI-CMS HFM O₂/N₂ separation performance dependence on operating conditions (e.g. temperature and feed pressure) are reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aenergy efficiency 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aCarbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane 0aHollow fiber membrane (HFM) 0aPolybenzimidazole (PBI) 0aOxygen enrichment 0aGas separation1 aLewis, Jeremy C.1 aMatteson, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1581-98201 aCraddock, Erica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4780-68671 aMartinez, Ulises1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8239-02811 aThakkar, Harshul1 aBenavidez, Angelica D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7808-453X1 aBerchtold, Kathryn A.1 aSingh, Rajinder P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4634-42900 tCarbon.g2022 June 15, v. 192 p.71-83dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245012700167500001400294520150400308592002801812650001301840650002301853650001401876650001501890650001601905650001001921650003101931650001201962650001401974650001701988650001702005700002502022700002602047700002402073773012102097856007502218852000902293655001202302IND60715209120221119075043.0201026e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071520912DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101019362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiżański, Wojciech 10aComparison of Clinical Effectiveness of Deslorelin Acetate and Osaterone Acetate in Dogs with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia  aNAL-light  aThis article presents the results of a randomized clinical trial, designed to compare the efficacy and therapeutic profiles of Ypozaneᵀᴹ (osaterone acetate—OA) or Suprelorinᵀᴹ (deslorelin acetate—DA) in male dogs with clinical signs of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Forty-five intact male dogs were used in the study. The Group I (negative control) included 10 healthy dogs, the Group II (positive control) included 10 dogs with confirmed BPH and no treatment, whereas Group III and IV consisted of dogs with BPH and treated either with DA (15 dogs) or OA (10 dogs). The clinical response, testosterone and estradiol levels, hematology, biochemistry, and adverse effects incidence were evaluated. Both OA and DA proved to be effective for BPH treatment in dogs, as they allowed for the clinical remission in all treated dogs. The complete alleviation of BPH symptoms was noticed sooner with the use of OA (in 80% of dogs from day 7) compared to DA (in 40% of dogs within the first 21 days). The recurrence of clinical signs related to BPH was observed from week 24 in dogs treated with OA, whereas no relapse was noticed in dogs treated with DA at the end of the 36 weeks of the observation period. In 5 dogs (33%) treated with DA, a flare-up effect (increase in the clinical signs associated with BPH) was noticed on day 7. Despite individual differences in the clinical action, both medications were effective and safe options for the treatment of symptoms related to BPH in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3adeslorelin acetate 3aestradiol 3ahematology 3ahyperplasia 3amales 3arandomized clinical trials 3arelapse 3aremission 3atestosterone 3atherapeutics1 aOchota, Małgorzata 1 aFontaine, Christelle 1 aPasikowska, Joanna 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101019363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04380naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005100149245010200200300001300302500001900315520279000334592002803124650000803152650003203160650002603192650001403218650002603232650000903258650001103267650002503278650001203303650000903315650001803324650001203342650001003354650001103364650001103375650001703386650001303403650001803416650001403434650002203448650001303470650001003483651001003493653002503503700001503528700001103543700001703554700001503571700001603586773010803602856008303710852000903793655001203802IND60719247020221118011210.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071924702DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1232-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1806-121810aFirst Report of Fusarium proliferatum Causing Crown and Stem Rot of Echeveria desmetiana in China  ap. 3260.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEcheveria desmetiana De Smet is an indoor ornamental succulent plant that belongs to the Crassulaceae. Cultivation of succulent plants is popular in China and has considerable market value. In June 2017, flowering E. desmetiana in a nursery located in Beijing developed symptoms of yellowing and leaf wilt followed by collapse of the leaf and stem within a few days. Some of the infected leaf bases were covered by white mycelium. This disease occurred in about 20% of E. desmetiana after the plants were transplanted for sale. Small pieces with a diameter of about 0.5 cm of wilted tissue were surface sterilized using 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl₂, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 25°C. A fungus was consistently isolated that had white mycelial growth and a pink or purplish tint on PDA. Sparse macroconidia produced on carnation leaf-piece agar were sickle and almost straight, 25.3 to 40.6 μm long, 2.1 to 4.1 μm wide, and three to five septate. Microconidia were elliptical or reniform, 5.0 to 9.7 μm long and 1.5 to 3.1 μm wide without septa. Genomic DNA was extracted from two isolates after subculturing single spores. RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) was amplified using universal primers RBP2-5F/RBP2-7CR, and elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) was amplified using universal primers EF1/EF2 (Ida et al. 2016; Liu et al. 1999). Amplified products (1,147 and 714 bp) were purified and sequenced (GenBank accession nos. MT551187 and MT551186) for RPB2 and EF-1α, respectively. A BLASTn search revealed 100% sequence identity with Fusarium proliferatum available in GenBank (accession nos. MN245721.1 and MK952799.1). The morphology and DNA were consistent with F. proliferatum (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Pathogenicity tests were conducted twice with six replications per treatment. A conidial suspension (5 × 10⁷ conidia/ml) was prepared by washing a culture on sterilized sorghum after growing for 15 days. Then the roots of E. desmetiana were wounded with a sterile needle and inoculated with 0.2 ml of the conidial suspension or sterile water for the negative control. Plants were incubated at 25 ± 2°C and a 16-h photoperiod. After 7 days, the bottom leaves became yellow, and 20 days later, typical wilted symptoms were observed on all the inoculated plants, but no symptoms were observed on the control plants. F. proliferatum was reisolated from three leaves of the diseased plants that had wilted and rotted 45 days after inoculation, completing Koch’s postulates. F. proliferatum is reported as a widespread soilborne pathogen that causes wilt on several crops including maize, wheat, and garlic (Stępień et al. 2011). To our knowledge, this is the first report of wilt and blight caused by F. proliferatum on E. desmetiana in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aEcheveria 3aFusarium proliferatum 3aagar 3ablight 3acacti and succulents 3aconidia 3acorn 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afungi 3agarlic 3aleaves 3amarket value 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3astem rot 3awheat 3aChina 0aEcheveria desmetiana1 aGao, W.

It acts as an anion‐selective channel that drives osmotic fluid transport across many epithelia. In the gut, CFTR is crucial for maintaining fluid and acid‐base homeostasis, and its activity is tightly controlled by multiple neuro‐endocrine factors. However, microbial toxins can disrupt this intricate control mechanism and trigger protracted activation of CFTR. This results in the massive faecal water loss, metabolic acidosis and dehydration that characterize secretory diarrhoeas, a major cause of malnutrition and death of children under 5 years of age. Compounds that inhibit CFTR could improve emergency treatment of diarrhoeal disease. Drawing on recent structural and functional insight, we discuss how existing CFTR inhibitors function at the molecular and cellular level. We compare their mechanisms of action to those of inhibitors of related ABC transporters, revealing some unexpected features of drug action on CFTR. Although challenges remain, especially relating to the practical effectiveness of currently available CFTR inhibitors, we discuss how recent technological advances might help develop therapies to better address this important global health need.  aPublisher supplied data  a218411/Z/19/ZcWellcome Trust 3aABC transporters 3aacidosis 3acystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 3adeath 3adigestive system 3adrugs 3ahomeostasis 3amalnutrition1 aArdelean, Maria C.1 aBijvelds, Marcel J.

Nest and brood survival, causes and timing of nest failures, as well as nest site characteristics and site selection were studied for three breeding seasons (2016-2018) on a natural marsh island in southwestern Louisiana, USA. Of 110 nesting attempts, 58.2% hatched at least one egg. During incubation, overall daily survival rate was 0.979 (± 0.003 SE), corresponding to 56.4% success from egg laying to hatching. For broods, daily survival rate was 0.993 (± 0.002 SE), or 72.9% success from hatching to fledging. Overwash was identified as the primary cause of known nest and brood loss, accounting for 48.9% and 27.8% of all nest and brood failures, respectively. Overall productivity for breeding pairs within the study area was 1.06 chicks/pair for all years. Data suggests that overwash from extreme high tides and wind can significantly contribute to lower reproductive success of breeding pairs but the lack of mammalian predators on the island may contribute to increased nest success, especially in years that do not experience high water levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEgretta rufescens 3aeggs 3amammals 3amarshes 3anest success 3anesting sites 3anests 3asurvival rate 3awater birds 3awind 3aLouisiana 0adaily survival rate 0anesting 0aoverwash 0aReddish Egret 0areproductive success 0awading bird1 aSelman, Will1 aGreen, M.

Thus, 136 substances were selected, including 119 pharmaceuticals and 17 hormonal steroids. An innovative sample preparation procedure based on the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method was developed. The analysis was then performed using liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This analytical procedure was validated by evaluating the specificity, quadratic curve fitting, recovery, reproducibility and limits of detection and quantification. The method allows the analysis of the majority of the target compounds with limits of detection ranging from 1ng/g to 2500ng/g, depending on the nature of the substance. The protocol was then successfully applied to various types of sludge (limed, digested, dried, liquid and composted) collected in several sewage works in France. Among the target compounds, 34 were quantified at levels up to 6000ng/g. Among the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals were the antiemetic domperidone (mean concentration 769ng/g) and the antiepileptic lamotrigine (mean concentration 31ng/g) whose presence had, to our knowledge, never been shown in sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3ahormones 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asteroids 3aFrance1 aVulliet, Emmanuelle0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 May 17, v. 1290 p.46-61dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012100163300001300284520119800297592002801495650001301523650001501536650001301551650001001564650001301574650001601587650001301603653002501616653001201641653002501653653004201678700001301720700001501733700001701748700001701765700001701782700005301799773008701852856008501939852000902024655001202033IND60767719820221120193822.0220404e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Bo10aAchieving multiband compatible and mechanical tuning absorber using edge topological defect-induced graphene plasmon  ap. 1-13.  aGraphene has been shown to be a high-performance microwave-absorbing material with broadband potential. However, simultaneous realization of multiband compatible strong absorption is still a challenge. In this study, graphene rich in edge topological defects is successfully synthesized, and the effect of defect density on electromagnetic parameters has been investigated. Electrons (π electrons, π+σ electrons) located at edge defects alter the loss paths and plasma absorption frequencies of the graphene aerogels. These improvements in electrical properties give the graphene aerogel a more coordinated impedance matching and attenuation capability, allowing it to achieve strong absorption in multiband (S, X, Ku band) simultaneously. In addition, a mechanically tunable multimode absorber can be further realized by incorporating porous polyimide foam. The strong absorption (>99.9%) of a wide range of variable bands (S, C, X, and Ku bands) can be flexibly adjusted by stress cycling of piezo resistive foam. In addition, self-cleaning, high temperature resistance, and simple processability are expected to deliver solutions for the communication and Internet of Things engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aabsorption 3aaerogels 3afoams 3agraphene 3atemperature 3atopology 0aMicrowave absorption 0aPlasmon 0aMultiband absorption 0aIntegration of structure and function1 aXia, Lun1 aMa, Suping1 aYin, Zhanhao1 aLiu, Xiaoyan1 aLi, Guanghao1 aHuang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9343-207X0 tCarbon.g2022 June 15, v. 192 p.1-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011600179300001600295520139200311592002801703650001201731650001701743650003701760650002601797650001401823650002001837650001401857650001101871650002001882650002401902650001001926650001201936653002801948653001101976653002401987700002602011700002702037700002902064700002902093700003502122773013202157856008702289852000902376655001202385IND60610074820221122001849.0200117e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061007482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Caio F.R.10aCharacterization of a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor from Enterolobium timbouva with activity against Candida species  ap. 645-653.  aScientific advances have not been sufficient to accompany the growing resistance to antimicrobial medicines. High mortality rates due to opportunistic infections have threated human health. The development of new drugs, such as those obtained from plant sources, is a world priority. Herein, we report the purification of a trypsin inhibitor from Enterolobium timbouva seeds (EtTI) with regard to its homology, physico-chemical and inhibitory properties. Furthermore, we evaluated its activity against Candida strains, opportunistic pathogens regularly found in hospital infections. EtTI belongs to the Kunitz family and inhibits two trypsin molecules simultaneously; a feature shared among double-headed Kunitz inhibitors. A high inhibitory activity against trypsin was determined (Ki = 0.5 nM), and refractory to digestion by pepsin. EtTI was candidicidal against C. albicans, C. buinensis and C. tropicalis, triggering disturbances on integrity of the plasma membrane and morphological alterations, presumably mediated via apoptosis. The presence of two reactive sites is an unusual feature detected in EtTI. Numerous diseases and pathologies involve changes in peptidase activities, encouraging studies with multifunctional inhibitors. Accordingly, the further exploration of EtTI could provide new insights into the Kunitz inhibitors and their applications in disease control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aEnterolobium 3aKunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 3aantifungal properties 3aapoptosis 3aenzyme activity 3anew drugs 3apepsin 3aplasma membrane 3asecondary infection 3aseeds 3atrypsin 0aReactive oxygen species 0aYeasts 0aHospital infections1 aOliveira, Carolina T.1 aTaveira, Gabriel Bonan1 ade Oliveira Mello, Erica1 aGomes, Valdirene Moreira1 aMacedo, Maria Lígia Rodrigues0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Nov., v. 119 p.645-653dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04999naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245007400163500001900237520323000256592002803486596005903514650001403573650001303587650001303600650001103613650001003624650001303634650001603647650001203663650001803675650001603693650001003709650001603719650001303735650001103748650001103759650001103770650001303781650001303794650002103807650001803828650001403846650001403860650002003874650002003894650003003914650001903944651001003963653001803973653002303991700001804014700005504032700001604087700001704103700001604120700001704136773010404153856008304257852000904340655001204349IND60719247220221118011406.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071924722DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1334-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qinen10aPowdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe sedi on Crassula capitella in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCrassula capitella Thunb. is a succulent used ornamentally in gardens and landscapes. In August 2019, severe powdery mildew infection was observed on C. capitella in a plant nursery, 1,000 m² in area, in Xining (36°42′44.39″N, 101°44′50.50″E, altitude 2,330 m), China. Approximately 35% of the leaves on a plant were symptomatic, and 80% of the plants were affected. The disease seriously reduced the ornamental value. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Plant Pathology at Qinghai University under accession number QHU2019150. The pathogen formed superficial mycelia on leaves and stems, producing conspicuous white colonies followed by necrosis of the leaf tissues and defoliation. Mycelia were amphigenous, white, effuse or in patches, persistent, with lobed appressoria. The pathogen produced conidia singly on two- to three-celled conidiophores occurring on the ectophytic hyphae. Conidia were subcylindrical, measured 22 to 41 × 10 to 16 (n = 50) µm, and were produced singly on the tip of conidiophores. Conidiophores were erect and up to 110 µm long, foot cells straight, cylindrical, and 22 to 53 × 8 to 10 (n = 50) µm, followed by one to three shorter cells. Chasmothecia were not found. The fungus was identified as Erysiphe sedi based on morphology (Braun and Cook 2012). To confirm identification, the ITS region was amplified. The ITS5/P3 and PM5/ITS4 primers were used to amplify the ITS region by nested PCR, and the cloned fragments were sequenced (Takamatsu and Kano 2001). The aligned ITS region sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT178769). A BLAST search analysis of the two sequences revealed 99.84% identity with E. sedi infecting Sedum aizoon in Russia (LC010045). A phylogenetic tree was constructed in MEGA6 with 15 ITS sequences using the neighbor-joining method with the Kimura two-parameter substitution model. The sequence retrieved from powdery mildew on C. capitella in China clustered together with the sequences obtained from E. sedi on Sedum spp. with nearly 100% concordance, placing it in the Erysiphe aquilegiae complex as defined by Takamatsu et al. (2015) and recently critically discussed by Shin et al. (2019). This complex comprises numerous Erysiphe spp. insufficiently resolved, especially when based only on ITS data. However, for the time being we follow Götz et al. (2019) and recognize E. sedi as a species of its own and identify the Chinese collection on C. capitella as E. sedi because of the morphological agreement and concordant ITS data. Pathogenicity tests were completed by gently pressing infected leaves onto five healthy leaves of C. capitella. Inoculated and noninoculated plants were maintained separately in different rooms of a greenhouse at 22 to 25°C. Inoculated plants developed signs and symptoms after 12 days, whereas control plants remained symptomless. The morphology of the fungus on inoculated leaves was identical to that originally observed on diseased plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. sedi on C. capitella in China and worldwide, although E. sedi is reported to infect many crassulaceous or Crassulaceae hosts (Cho et al. 2012; Götz et al. 2019).  aPublisher supplied data  a31600513cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCapitella 3aCrassula 3aErysiphe 3aRussia 3aSedum 3aaltitude 3aappressoria 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3adefoliation 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3aherbaria 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3amodels 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3aornamental value 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplant nurseries 3aplant pathology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3aChina 0aErysiphe sedi 0aCrassula capitella1 aLi, Qiangfeng1 aBai, Luchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0641-71841 aMan, Liting1 aZhao, Wenjie1 aLuo, Xupeng1 aBao, Shancun0 tPlant disease.g2020 Dec., v. 104, no. 12 p.3250-dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1334-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007100169300001600240520074400256592002801000650002601028650001901054650001901073700001801092700002101110773011601131856008601247990002301333852000901356655001201365IND60093735920221120191033.0141103e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009373592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerman, Mark10aSome invariance properties of the minimum noise fraction transform  ap. 189-199.  aThe Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform is widely used in the remote sensing and image processing communities, because it is usually better than the Principal Components (PC) transform at compressing and ordering multispectral and hyperspectral images in terms of image “quality”. The MNF transform is also invariant to invertible (i.e. non-singular) linear transformations of multispectral/hyperspectral data, a property not shared by the PC transform. This general invariance property of the MNF transform is proved. Three examples of the general invariance property are provided and discussed: (i) invariance to scaling, (ii) invariance to certain types of background correction, and (iii) invariance to different types of noise.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing1 aPhatak, Aloke1 aTraylen, Anthony0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 117 p.189-199dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2012.02.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04019naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245017800171300001500349520183400364592002802198650002102226650001602247650001902263650001302282650001802295650001602313650002202329650001502351650001802366650001802384650001102402650002102413650001002434650001002444650002402454650001302478650002302491650001202514650002202526653001702548653003202565653003002597653003502627653002502662653001202687653000802699653001002707653001202717653001202729653000902741653000802750653000902758653001002767653000802777653001102785653001002796653000802806653000802814653000902822653001002831653000902841653000802850653001202858653000902870653000802879653000702887653001102894653000902905653001002914653000802924700006102932773010202993856008503095852000903180655001203189IND60786161920221118064916.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078616192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2022.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhandari, Chetna10aPine nut oil supplementation alleviates the obesogenic effects in high-fat diet induced obese rats: A comparative study between epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue  ap. 85-100.  aPine nut oil (PNO) is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is obtained from species such as Pinus siberica, Pinus gerardinia, Pinus koraiensis, and so on. A few studies have shown its protective effect against obesity by regulating lipid metabolism and suppressing appetite. However, its effect on the release of adipokines and obesity-associated signaling pathways is yet to be investigated. We hypothesized that PNO might exert its antiobesogenic effects by modulating adiponectin/leptin-mediated cell signaling pathways. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the mechanism of action of 10% PNO substitution on the high-fat diet–induced obesity in male Wistar rats. PNO incorporation in the diet significantly decreased the body weight, body mass index, Lee index, liver weight, blood glucose levels, and adipose tissue size. It also reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) and triglycerides and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum significantly. It was observed that incorporation of PNO led to a significant increase in ADIPOR1/R2 expression in visceral epididymal adipose tissue (vEAT). It also lowered serum leptin (P < .05) and increased adiponectin levels. Furthermore, PNO supplementation increased P-AMPK/AMPK and P-AKT/AKT ratio and decreased the expression of FOXO-1 in both visceral epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (vEAT and vRPAT). Therefore, the present study showed that incorporation of PNO in the diet might prevent obesity and improve the metabolic inflammatory state in obesity by controlling the release of adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines. Comparative analysis between vEAT and vRPAT also revealed that vEAT is metabolically more active in combating obesity than vRPAT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus koraiensis 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aappetite 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acomparative study 3aepididymis 3ahigh fat diet 3ainterleukin-6 3aleptin 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amales 3amechanism of action 3anut oils 3anutrition research 3aobesity 3aprotective effect 0aPine nut oil 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aepididymal adipose tissue 0aretroperitoneal adipose tissue 0awhite adipose tissue 0aobesity 0aACC 0aANOVA 0aADIPOR1 0aADIPOR2 0aAMPK 0aBMI 0acDNA 0aELISA 0aFFA 0aFOXO-1 0aHDL-C 0aHFD 0aHRP 0aIL-6 0aLDL-C 0aOb-R 0aPNO 0aPPAR-γ 0aPUFA 0aSEM 0aTG 0aTNF-α 0avEAT 0avRPAT 0aWAT1 aAgnihotr, Navneet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6063-34730 tNutrition research.g2022 Oct., v. 106 p.85-100dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2022.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245004800164300001600212520090000228592002801128650000801156650001001164650001401174650001001188650002001198650001101218650001701229650001101246650001501257653002101272653001401293653001201307653001601319653001201335653001201347653001401359773011501373856007701488852000901565655001201574IND60644523620221121063347.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064452362DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-03062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregory, T.

This has often been attributed to the metabolic constraints of powered flight, which requires small cells for efficient gas exchange. Small cells, in turn, are achieved in part by limiting nucleus size and thus DNA content. However, metabolism is not the only organismal trait that correlates with genome size in birds; relationships have also been reported with body size (positive) and relative brain size (inverse). In this study, a recent data set on cell numbers in the brains of birds was combined with available data on genome sizes to demonstrate a relationship between genome size and density of cells per gram of brain tissue. This suggests that small genomes are relevant not only in the evolution of avian flight but may also be associated with the extraordinary behavioural complexity shown by birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abirds 3abody size 3abrain 3adata collection 3aflight 3agas exchange 3agenome 3ametabolism 0abrain complexity 0acell size 0aC value 0aDNA content 0aneurons 0aparrots 0asongbirds0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2018, v. 96, no. 4 p.379-382dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-03063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007800162300001400240520171200254592002801966650001801994650001502012650001302027650001002040650002002050650001402070650002102084650002302105650002502128650002102153650002902174650001402203650001202217650002502229650001802254650002402272650002402296650000902320650001602329650001302345651001002358653001802368653001402386653002502400653002802425653002102453653001902474653002602493700001702519700001502536700006202551700002102613700005902634700002002693700002302713700001602736700001702752700005602769700002202825773013802847856008302985852000903068655001203077IND60614427620221120044544.0190318e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061442762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Qian10aRe-assessing nitrous oxide emissions from croplands across Mainland China  ap. 70-78.  aReliable quantification of nitrous oxide emission is a key to assessing efficiency of use and environmental impacts of N fertilizers in crop production. In this study, N2O emission and yield were quantified with a database of 853 field measurements in 104 reported studies and a regression model was fitted to the associated environmental attributes and management practices from China’s croplands. The fitted emission model explained 48% of the variance in N2O emissions as a function of fertilizer rate, crop type, temperature, soil clay content, and the interaction between N rate and fertilizer type. With all other variables fixed, N2O emissions were lower with rice than with legumes and then other upland crops, lower with organic fertilizers than with mineral fertilizers. We used the subset of the dataset for rice - covering a full range of different typical water regimes, and estimated emissions from China’s rice cultivation to be 31.1 Gg N2O-N per year. The fitted yield model explained 35% of the variance in crop yield as a function of fertilizer rate, temperature, crop type, and soil clay content. Finally, the empirical models for N2O emission and crop yield were coupled to explore the optimum N rates (N rate with minimum N2O emission per unit yield) for combinations of crop and fertilizer types. Consequently, the optimum N application rate ranged between 100 kg N ha−1 and 190 kg N ha−1 respectively with organic and mineral fertilizers, and different crop types. This study therefore improved on existing empirical methods to estimate N2O emissions from China’s croplands and suggests how N rate may be optimized for different crops, fertilizers and site conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3acrop yield 3acropland 3acrops 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aempirical models 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental impact 3afertilizer rates 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahighlands 3alegumes 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aorganic fertilizers 3aregression analysis 3arice 3atemperature 3avariance 3aChina 0aNitrous oxide 0aCroplands 0aNitrogen fertilizers 0aGreenhouse gas emission 0aRegression model 0aData synthesis 0aChina’s agriculture1 aLedo, Alicia1 aCheng, Kun1 aAlbanito, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2655-59821 aLebender, Ulrike1 aSapkota, Tek B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5311-05861 aBrentrup, Frank1 aStirling, Clare M.1 aSmith, Pete1 aSun, Jianfei1 aPan, Genxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9755-05321 aHillier, Jonathan0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 268 p.70-78dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245012900215300001600344520099900360592002801359650002201387650001201409650001101421650001501432650002501447650001301472650001401485650001501499650001101514653001801525653003201543653000801575653001001583653001101593700002401604700002001628700001701648773012001665856008701785852000901872655001201881IND60526731620221122224953.0190409e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052673162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIman Shayan, Sahand1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8017-065610aHydraulic retention time effects on wastewater nutrient removal and bioproduct production via rotating algal biofilm reactor  ap. 527-533.  aRotating algal biofilm reactor (RABR) technology was successfully employed in an effective strategy to couple the removal of wastewater nutrients with accumulation of valuable bioproducts by grown algae. A secondary stage municipal wastewater was fed to the developed system and the effects of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) parameter on both nutrient removal and bioproduct production were evaluated under fed-batch operation mode. Two sets of bench scale RABRs were designed and operated with HRTs of 2 and 6days in order to provide competitive environment for algal growth. The HRT significantly affected nitrogen and phosphorus uptakes along with lipid and starch accumulations by microalgae in harvested biofilms. Domination of nitrogen removal in 2-day HRT with higher lipid accumulation (20% on dried weight basis) and phosphorus removal in 6-day HRT with higher starch production (27% on dried weight basis) was observed by comparing the performances of the RABRs in duplicate runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiofilm 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3astarch 0aAlgal biofilm 0aWastewater nutrient removal 0aHRT 0aLipid 0aStarch1 aAgblevor, Foster A.1 aBertin, Lorenzo1 aSims, R.

The authors distinguish six hydro-epidemiological groups of diseases: 1) water is the medium of pathogen accumulation; 2) water is the medium for transmission of the infection pathogen without its biological accumula-tion; 3) the development cycle of the causative agent is directly related to water and aquatic organisms; 4) diseases transmitted by insects having water-related development cycle; 5) diseases transmitted by aquatic and near-water vertebrates; 6) diseases of reservoir inhabitants. At the same time, it is shown that the aquatic filter-feeding bivalves (mollusks) accumulate in them-selves various pathogenic microorganisms, which are the causative agents of infectious diseases of both man and animals. Thus, mollusks can serve as a test object for hydro-epidemiological study in assessing the risk of infectious diseases dissemi-nation in water area and near-water complex as well as in using them directly for food.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apathogens 3arisk 0agastropods 0abivalves 0aaquatic ecosystem 0abacteria 0aviruses 0ainfectious diseases 0apathogen transmission1 aToropova, N.

When exposed to gemfibrozil concentrations of 50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000 ng L−1, Daphnia magna showed increased lipid reserves by 14–21% (significant at 500 ng L−1), increased length by 9–13% (significant at 50 ng L−1), increased mass by 6–13% (significant at 50 ng L−1) and increased neonate production by 57–74% (significant at 50 ng L−1). Gemfibrozil-exposed Daphnia held under conditions where food availability was low, grew and reproduced as well as those in the control. Taken together, these results suggest that gemfibrozil exposure within environmentally relevant concentration ranges is not toxic to Daphnia magna but has the potential to be beneficial to the species under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aaquatic environment 3aenergy 3afood availability 3agemfibrozil 3alipids 3amunicipal wastewater 3aneonates 3areproduction 3atoxicity 0aDaphnia magna 0aGemfibrozil 0aPharmaceutical 0aGrowth 0aReproduction 0aLipid1 aLari, Ebrahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3623-877X1 aWoodman, Samuel G.1 aLuong, Kim H.1 aWong, Charles S.1 aPyle, Greg G.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Feb., v. 192 p.75-80dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012500204300001600329500001900345520142500364592002801789650001301817650002401830650001201854650001601866650000901882650001401891650002401905650002201929650002501951650001101976650002001987650001702007650002602024650002102050650001902071650001402090650001702104650001402121650001202135650001302147650001602160650001902176650001902195650001102214650002102225700002102246773012302267856008202390852000902472655001202481IND60734190820221120150914.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073419082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-020-10126-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Cengiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8938-346310aNitric Oxide is Required for Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Salt Tolerance by Lowering Oxidative Stress in Maize (Zea mays)  ap. 617-627.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough some investigations show that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) participates in plant stress tolerance, the role of nitric oxide (NO) in ALA-induced improvement in tolerance to salt stress in plants necessitates to be understood. So, a NO scavenger, 0.1 mM 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO); was applied jointly with ALA. Of four ALA concentrations tested in a preliminary experiment, 20 mg L⁻¹ was chosen to apply as seed treatment or foliage spray to saline-stressed maize seedlings. Salinity (100 mM NaCl) significantly led to reduction in plant biomass, PSII maximum efficiency (Fᵥ/Fₘ), total chlorophyll, leaf potassium (K⁺) and calcium (Ca²⁺) as well as leaf water potential in both cultivars, but it led to enhanced contents of proline, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL) and leaf sodium (Na⁺) as well as internal NO and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). ALA treatments improved plant growth, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and leaf Ca²⁺ and K⁺, but it led to further increases in leaf NO and NOS activity as well as ALA levels. ALA-induced salt tolerance was completely abolished by cPTIO application by eliminating the internal NO generation. This evidently showed that ALA triggered the synthesis of NO through activation of NOS, which in turn improved salt tolerance of the maize plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaminolevulinic acid 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3acultivars 3aelectrolyte leakage 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosystem II 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed treatment 3asodium 3astress tolerance1 aAshraf, Muhammad0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2021 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.617-627dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-020-10126-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162300001800255520114000273592002801413650001401441650001101455650001101466650001301477650001901490650003301509650001601542650002201558700001901580700001801599773012201617856008201739852000901821655001201830IND60627400420221120211114.0220527e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062740042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2371-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, Y.10aMicrostructure and Vickers hardness of Co/Cu multilayers fabricated by electrodeposition  ap. 3931-3937.  aIn order to investigate thermal stability of Co/Cu multilayers fabricated by electrodeposition, Vickers hardness tests and microstructure observations were conducted on both as-deposited and annealed Co/Cu multilayers having a layer thickness of 100 nm. The multilayers were annealed at temperatures ranging from 473 to 1,273 K for 1 h. It is confirmed that even after the annealing at 1,023 K, the multilayer maintained the high hardness (Hv231) which was comparative to that of the as-deposited Co/Cu multilayer. When the annealing temperature was higher than 1,073 K, the hardness decreased rapidly with increasing temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation revealed that the multilayered structures were still maintained without any layer damages after the annealing at the temperatures less than 873 K. At the cross sections of the Co/Cu multilayers annealed at T > 923 K, several copper layers were fragmented. The layered structure finally disappeared by the annealing at 1,273 K. The rapid decrease in the hardness at T > 1,073 K is simply understood from the annihilation of the Co/Cu interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acobalt 3acopper 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aSakakibara, H.1 aHashimoto, S.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 June, v. 43, no. 11 p.3931-3937dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-007-2371-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010400213520116000317592002801477650002701505650001501532650001101547650001501558650001101573650002201584650001901606650001801625650002401643650001701667650001901684651001001703653002201713653003601735653001001771653002501781700006201806700006701868773011801935856008602053852000902139655001202148IND60680710720221118135726.0201104e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068071072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhassan, Hamdiyah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5524-948210aHouseholds' source separation behaviour and solid waste disposal options in Ghana's Millennium City  aPoor solid waste management has increasingly taken a hegemonic position in urban policy discourse in Ghana. Often, the discourse centers on free market principles and inflexible waste management laws that promote privatization and deregulation. Recently however, source separation is dominating discussions on policy alternatives. This study investigates determinants of households' source separation behaviour and solid waste disposal options among residents of Ghana's ‘Millennium City’- Accra using logit and multinomial logit regression models respectively. The logit regression estimates show that households' source separation behaviour is determined by gender, income, monetary incentives, attitude, compound house dummy, type of service provider and other household location variables. The multinomial logit estimates reveal that gender, age, age square, income, household size, employment, housing type, and attitude predicted household disposal options. We argue that to win the ‘garbage war’, source separation should be promoted by the Accra Metropolitan Assembly as this may enhance positive attitudes towards proper waste management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aemployment 3agender 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarket economy 3aprivatization 3aregression analysis 3asolid wastes 3awaste disposal 3aGhana 0aSource separation 0aMultinomial logistic regression 0aGhana 0aSolid waste disposal1 aKwakwa, Paul Adjei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6516-217X1 aOwusu-Sekyere, Ebenezer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1804-59310 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 259 p.110055-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245009100175300001400266500001500280520123900295592002801534650001201562650004301574650002601617650001301643650002501656650001001681650001801691650001001709650005201719650002301771650001901794650001501813650001201828650001001840650001501850650000801865650001401873653001101887653002601898653002201924653002201946653001701968653002501985700001802010700001802028700001602046700005802062700001902120700001802139700005802157773012802215856009002343852000902433655001202442IND60635847320221121204226.0190425e20190616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063584732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hyunkyung10aLocalization and persistence of hepatitis A virus in artificially contaminated oysters  ap. 58-63.  a2019-12-06  aBivalve molluscan shellfish, such as oysters, clams, and cockles, are well-recognized as vectors that concentrate foodborne pathogens by filter feeding. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and persistence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in experimentally contaminated oysters that were either fed or not fed with algae. Oysters were experimentally contaminated with HAV and maintained in depuration conditions. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in situ hybridization (ISH) were performed on oyster samples collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-inoculation. When HAV-contaminated oysters were depurated for 7 days, HAV was detected in 91.1–97.8% of the digestive glands and gills. While the high viral load in the digestive glands in oysters did not change significantly regardless of algae-feeding, the viral load of the gills gradually decreased in both groups during the depuration. HAV antigen and RNA were detected in the digestive diverticula and connective tissues by both IHC and ISH. HAV was detected in the stomach, intestine, and gills by only ISH. The distribution of HAV in various oyster tissues may explain the persistence of contamination in oysters during the depuration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoysters 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ain situ hybridization 3aantigens 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aalgae 3aHepatovirus A 3aclams 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aconnective tissues 3afood pathogens 3aintestines 3astomach 3agills 3aviral load 3aRNA 3ashellfish 0aOyster 0aIn situ hybridization 0aCrassostrea gigas 0aHepatitis A virus 0aLocalization 0aImmunohistochemistry1 aJung, Soontag1 aShin, Hansaem1 aHa, Sang-Do1 aPark, Tae Jung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-09571 aPark, Jong Pil1 aSeo, Dong Joo1 aChoi, Changsun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7730-85380 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 June 16, v. 299 p.58-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008700164300001600251520157100267592002801838650002301866650002001889650001501909650001501924650002901939650001701968650001901985650000902004650002002013650002002033650002302053653002002076653003402096653003202130653002902162700001502191700001802206700002402224773012202248856008402370852000902454655001202463IND60589586820221121220618.0180223e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058958682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.02.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuzhi10aEcological risk assessment of polymetallic sites using weight of evidence approach  ap. 255-262.  aEcological risk assessment (ERA) of polymetallic contamination in soils has caused extensive solicitude. However, objective and feasible methods suitable for soil ERA are limited. Therefore, in this study, a multidisciplinary and quantitative weight of evidence approach (WOE) specific to soil ecosystems was developed based on the previous WOE for aquatic ecosystems. The framework consisted of four lines of evidence (LOEs): DTPA-extractable heavy metal in soils, bioaccumulation in earthworms, integration of biomarker responses and expected community effect (multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction, msPAF). These four LOEs were initially evaluated by each hazard quotient (HQ) of them based on the ratio to the reference (RTR) of each parameter. Then, Environmental risk index (EnvRI) integrated by HQs with different weights was calculated. At last, three sites, one for reference (N1) and two for contaminated soils (N2 and N3) were chosen to apply the modified WOE approach. Results showed that heavily contaminated site, N3 had higher HQ classification for each LOE and its EnvRI was classified as Major levels, while the EnvRI of N2 was assigned into Moderate. What's more, HQ of biomarker response (HQbiomarker) integrated by RTRs of biomarkers increased gradiently with the increase of heavy metal levels in soils though irregular changes were observed for most of those biomarkers. Overall, our results indicated that the quantitative WOE framework specific to soil ERA had the advantage of obtaining a comprehensive and objective risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3aearthworms 3aenvironmental assessment 3aheavy metals 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil ecosystems 3aweight-of-evidence 0aHazard quotient 0aIntegrated biomarker response 0aMultidisciplinary framework 0aEnvironmental risk index1 aWang, Meie1 aChen, Weiping1 aUwizeyimana, Herman0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 June 15, v. 154 p.255-262dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245007300192300001600265520127800281592002801559650002201587650002601609650001301635650000901648650001401657650001001671650001201681650001401693650001101707650000901718650001201727651001401739653003101753653001201784653002201796653002301818653002301841653001901864653001401883700002201897700002701919773014001946856010302086852000902189655001202198IND60127416120221119023553.0151124e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012741612DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2003)074[0243:EOETOT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvagelj, Walter S.10aEffect of egg type on the estimation of nest predation in passerines  ap. 243-249.  aWe compared predation rates of artificial nests baited with different egg types with the predation rates on nests of the Brown-and-yellow Marshbird (Pseudoleistes virescens), a Neotropical passerine common in the same area, in Argentina. We used deserted natural nests as experimental nests, baited with either Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix) or Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) eggs. Each experimental nest was baited with one natural and one paraffin-filled egg. Experimental nests baited with quail eggs suffered lower predation and egg losses than those baited with cowbird eggs. The main cause of egg loss and nest mortality in “cowbird nests” was pecking behavior of cowbirds. However, when we removed the effect of cowbirds, differences still held. In this area, the Shiny Cowbird is common and is the main cause of reduced breeding success of several host species. “Quail nests” had higher nest and egg survival than active Brown-and-yellow Marshbird nests. In contrast, “cowbird nests” and active Brown-and-yellow Marshbird nests had similar nest and egg survival. Experimental nests baited with natural passerine eggs such as those of Shiny Cowbirds seem to approximate the natural nest and egg predation risk for passerines in our study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aMolothrus bonariensis 3abreeding 3aeggs 3amortality 3anests 3apecking 3apredation 3aquails 3arisk 3atropics 3aArgentina 0aBrown-and-yellow Marshbird 0acowbird 0aegg survival time 0aexperimental nests 0anest survival time 0apredation risk 0apredators1 aMermoz, Myriam E.1 aFernández, Gustavo J.0 tJournal of field ornithology.g2003 July, v. 74, no. 3 p.243-249dNortheastern Bird-Banding AssociationwJournal:19351x0273-85707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570(2003)074[0243:EOETOT]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005800167300001800225520135200243592002801595650001301623650001101636650002501647650002001672650001601692650001901708650001101727650003701738700002201775700002301797773012201820856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60627400720221120223557.0220527e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062740072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2372-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattori, Tomoya10aWear-induced microstructure in Ni/Cu nano-multilayers  ap. 3923-3930.  aSliding wear tests were carried out in order to investigate wear resistance and resultant microstructure of Ni/Cu multilayers. The Ni/Cu multilayers having the component layer thickness h ranging from 5 to 100 nm were fabricated on copper substrates using the elecrodeposition technique. It was found that the wear depths in the multilayers were less than one-fifth of that of a conventional nickel coating at a high load condition. The wear resistance of the multilayer was almost independent of the component layer thickness, except the multilayer of h = 100 nm whose resistance was lower than those of the others. The observation of cross section revealed that the grains were generated locally near the worn surface in the Ni/Cu multilayers. Surface cracks were grown in such grained areas. The multilayer having a large grained area showed relatively low wear resistance. From the TEM observation, there were many equiaxed grains without the laminated structure. It is conceivable that the equiaxed grains without the laminated structure were formed due to dynamic recrystallization occurring after the laminated structure was annihilated by severe deformation. Assuming that the annihilation period is required for the wear of the Ni/Cu multilayer, the high wear resistance can be obtained regardless of the strengths of the multilayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acrystallization 3adeformation 3amicrostructure 3anickel 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKaneko, Yoshihisa1 aHashimoto, Satoshi0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 June, v. 43, no. 11 p.3923-3930dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-007-2372-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003100154245013500185506002800320520235000348592002802698506003702726650001002763650001102773650001102784650001902795650001002814650001402824650001302838650001102851650001402862650001602876650002202892653002602914653002102940653001902961653003102980700001903011700002603030700002103056773011303077856008903190852000903279655001203288IND60739553720221207123255.0201029s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955372DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2020.54.4.36162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVictorino, Gonçalo Filipe10aYield components detection and image-based indicators for non-invasive grapevine yield prediction at different phenological phases  aResource is Open Access  aForecasting vineyard yield with accuracy is one of the most important trends of research in viticulture today. Conventional methods for yield forecasting are manual, require a lot of labour and resources and are often destructive. Recently, image-analysis approaches have been explored to address this issue. Many of these approaches encompass cameras deployed on ground platforms that collect images in proximal range, on-the-go. As the platform moves, yield components and other image-based indicators are detected and counted to perform yield estimations. However, in most situations, when image acquisition is done in non-disturbed canopies, a high fraction of yield components is occluded. The present work’s goal is twofold. Firstly, to evaluate yield components’ visibility in natural conditions throughout the grapevine’s phenological stages. Secondly, to explore single bunch images taken in lab conditions to obtain the best visible bunch attributes to use as yield indicators. In three vineyard plots of red (Syrah) and white varieties (Arinto and Encruzado), several canopy 1 m segments were imaged using the robotic platform Vinbot. Images were collected from winter bud stage until harvest and yield components were counted in the images as well as in the field. At pea-sized berries, veraison and full maturation stages, a bunch sample was collected and brought to lab conditions for detailed assessments at a bunch scale. At early stages, all varieties showed good visibility of spurs and shoots, however, the number of shoots was only highly and significantly correlated with the yield for the variety Syrah. Inflorescence and bunch occlusion reached high percentages, above 50 %. In lab conditions, among the several bunch attributes studied, bunch volume and bunch projected area showed the highest correlation coefficients with yield. In field conditions, using non-defoliated vines, the bunch projected area of visible bunches presented high and significant correlation coefficients with yield, regardless of the fruit’s occlusion. Our results show that counting yield components with image analysis in non-defoliated vines may be insufficient for accurate yield estimation. On the other hand, using bunch projected area as a predictor can be the best option to achieve that goal, even with high levels of occlusion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis 3acanopy 3afruits 3aimage analysis 3alabor 3aphenology 3aripening 3arobots 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3ayield forecasting 0aPrecision viticulture 0ayield estimation 0aimage analysis 0ayield components occlusion1 aBraga, Ricardo1 aSantos-Victor, José,1 aLopes, Carlos M.0 tOENO One.g2020, v. 54, no. 4dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2020.54.4.36163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010400159300001600263500002000279520237900299592002802678650002102706650001002727650001302737650001102750650001202761650001302773650001102786650002302797650001302820650001502833650001402848650002402862650001902886650002402905650002202929650001202951650001202963651001502975700002302990700002003013773013003033856007303163852000903236655001203245IND60587586020221117034816.0180102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058758602DNAL7 a10.1890/10-0032.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Kara S.10aFinding solutions for bird restoration and livestock management: comparing grazing exclusion levels  ap. 547-554.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRiparian habitats in the western United States support high avian abundance and diversity and are important areas for livestock grazing, although grazing contributes to the degradation of riparian vegetation. Complete removal of livestock is generally the most beneficial for bird communities, but alternative management approaches allowing for seasonal livestock grazing may also increase avian habitat quality. Determining management approaches that integrate conservation priorities and human use has the potential to improve conditions for birds across many grazed landscapes. We anticipated that both the full and seasonal exclusion of cattle from riparian areas would result in the recovery of avian populations. To test this, we experimentally compared the effects of total cattle exclusion vs. seasonal usage on bird populations in the riparian areas of two creeks in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA. Avian species richness and average abundance were measured over six years, from 2001 to 2006. In general, native avian abundance and richness increased in both full‐ and seasonal‐exclosure areas, with increases compared to the pretreatment year for all years except 2005. Habitats that had complete cattle exclusion recovered more significantly, with 29% lower avian abundance in seasonally grazed habitats. There was no significant difference in avian richness between the two grazing treatments, although richness did increase over time. In addition to increases in native species, abundance of nonnative birds and brood parasites also increased significantly, with a greater avian abundance in the full‐exclusion areas. A direct comparison with the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), to further investigate annual avian population trends, explained the native species decline in 2005. This comparison revealed that observed trends were the effect of experimental treatment rather than a reflection of regional trends. Although the overall trends indicate that the full exclusion of livestock from riparian areas results in more abundant bird populations, seasonal exclusion is also a successful method for avian recovery. Land managers should consider both options in riparian areas, selecting full cattle removal for avian management only and seasonal cattle removal for situations where incorporating conservation and land use practices is advantageous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3abirds 3abreeding 3acattle 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aparasites 3apopulation dynamics 3ariparian areas 3ariparian vegetation 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3asurveys 3aCalifornia1 aGray, Elizabeth M.1 aEvans, James R.0 tEcological applications.g2011 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.547-554dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-0032.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245010300188300001600291520099300307592002801300650002201328650001101350650001001361650001201371650001201383650001201395650001001407650002301417650001201440651001101452653001301463653002201476653003401498653002001532653002401552700002201576700002001598700002301618700002101641773014001662856010301802852000901905655001201914IND60127416220221119023006.0151124e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012741622DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2003)074[0250:EOIRTW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHupp, Jerry W.10aEffects of implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas on the behavior of Canada Geese  ap. 250-256.  aWe examined whether surgically-implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas affected behavior of Lesser Canada Geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska. We implanted either a 26-g VHF radio transmitter or a larger VHF radio that was the same mass (35 g) and shape as a satellite transmitter in the coelom of adult females captured during molt in 2000. A control group of females was marked with leg bands. We simultaneously observed behavior of radio-marked and control females from 4–62 d following capture. We observed no differences in the proportion of time birds in different treatments allocated among grazing, resting, comfort, walking, and alert behavior. Females in different treatments spent a similar proportion of time in the water. Implantation of radio transmitters did not affect the frequency of agonistic interactions. We conclude that coelomic radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas had minimal effects on the behavior of Canada Geese.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta canadensis 3aadults 3abirds 3afemales 3agrazing 3amolting 3aradio 3aradio transmitters 3awalking 3aAlaska 0abehavior 0aBranta canadensis 0acoelomic-implant transmitters 0aradio telemetry 0atransmitter effects1 aRuhl, Gretchen A.1 aPearce, John M.1 aMulcahy, Daniel M.1 aTomeo, Martha A.0 tJournal of field ornithology.g2003 July, v. 74, no. 3 p.250-256dNortheastern Bird-Banding AssociationwJournal:19351x0273-85707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570(2003)074[0250:EOIRTW]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014400165520158700309592002801896650001501924650001301939650002201952650002101974650002201995650002702017650002102044650001402065650002502079650001102104650001502115650001302130650001102143650002102154650002702175650002102202650001502223653002402238653002302262653001802285653001902303653003902322700002002361700002402381700001702405700001902422773011802441856008602559852000902645655001202654IND60680710920221118140021.0201104e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068071092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Dany10aMBR treatment of leachates originating from waste management facilities: A reference study of the design parameters for efficient treatment  aThe main objective of the study was to define the interaction between the solid retention time (SRT) and the contaminant loading rate on a membrane bioreactor's efficacy in removing contaminants frequently detected (chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH₄⁺, total phosphorus and metals) above the discharge criteria in waste-originating leachates. The rates and coefficient calculated from this study's experimental data can be used for the design of membrane bioreactor treating wastewaters, even beyond the scope of this experiment. Over a period of 152 days, SRTs of 28 and 47 days and HRTs of 13, 25, 36 and 52 h were studied using a real leachate with a constant composition. Results showed that membrane bioreactors can efficiently treat >1850 mg COD L⁻¹ d⁻¹ of highly to moderately biodegradable COD, with the SRT having no significant impact on the removal of recalcitrant COD. Overall ammonium removal rates of >740 mg NH₄–N L⁻¹ d⁻¹ can be achieved as long as a residual alkalinity of 200 mg CaCO₃ L-1 and an adequate dissolved oxygen concentration (6–7 mg L⁻¹) are both maintained. Overall phosphorus removal rates are independent of the phosphorus loading rate. However, the highest overall phosphorus removal rate (39 ± 2 mg P per g of total suspended solids) was obtained at the lowest SRT (28 days) due to an increased extracellular polymeric substance production. Finally, membrane bioreactor's metal removal capacity is mostly dependent on the metals' affinity to both the leachate's recalcitrant COD as well as sludge concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradability 3acalcium carbonate 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3aleachates 3amembrane bioreactors 3ametals 3aphosphorus 3apolymers 3asludge 3atotal phosphorus 3atotal suspended solids 3awaste management 3awastewater 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aLeachate treatment 0aNitrification 0aProcess design 0aExtracellular polymeric substances1 aDrogui, Patrick1 aTyagi, Rajeshwar D.1 aLandry, Dany1 aRahni, Mohamed0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 259 p.110057-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245014000202300002000342520151000362592002801872650001201900650000801912650001501920650001201935650001301947650001301960650001201973650001601985650003102001650001602032653002302048653002002071653002302091653001402114653002702128653001502155653001402170700006002184700001802244700005902262700005902321700006002380700005802440773014202498856007802640852000902718655001202727IND60750504620221123001621.0210915e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075050462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c100542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZulkefli, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7013-996210aEnhanced Selectivity in Volatile Organic Compound Gas Sensors Based on ReS₂-FETs under Light-Assisted and Gate-Bias Tunable Operation  ap. 43030-43038.  aUsing a single-device two-dimensional (2D) rhenium disulfide (ReS₂) field-effect transistor (FET) with enhanced gas species selectivity by light illumination, we reported a selective and sensitive detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) gases. 2D materials have the advantage of a high surface-area-to-volume ratio for high sensitivity to molecules attached to the surface and tunable carrier concentration through field-effect control from the back-gate of the channel, while keeping the top surface open to the air for chemical sensing. In addition to these advantages, ReS₂ has a direct band gap also in multilayer cases, which sets it apart from other transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We take advantage of the effective response of ReS₂ to light illumination to improve the selectivity and gas-sensing efficiency of a ReS₂-FET device. We found that light illumination modulates the drain current response in a ReS₂-FET to adsorbed molecules, and the sensing activity differs depending on the gas species used, such as acetone, ethanol, and methanol. Furthermore, wavelength and carrier density rely on certain variations in light-modulated sensing behaviors for each chemical. The device will distinguish the gas concentration in a mixture of VOCs using the differences induced by light illumination, enhancing the selectivity of the sensor device. Our results shed new light on the sensing technologies for realizing a large-scale sensor network in the Internet-of-Things era.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aair 3adisulfides 3aethanol 3alighting 3amethanol 3arhenium 3atransistors 3avolatile organic compounds 3awavelengths 0alight illumination 0adirect band gap 0ainternet-of-things 0aback-gate 0asingle-device ReS2-FET 0agas sensor 0aVOC gases1 aMukherjee, Bablu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5625-59481 aSahara, Ryoji1 aHayakawa, Ryoma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1442-82301 aIwasaki, Takuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1103-24331 aWakayama, Yutaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-88841 aNakaharai, Shu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-39420 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 13, no. 36 p.43030-43038dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c100543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010100166300001600267520114000283592002801423650001801451650001301469650001101482650001401493650001801507650001101525650001001536650001401546700002201560773009401582856004801676852000901724655001201733IND50074406820221117185129.0140402e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007440682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-013-9683-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkelhorn, John10aViewing distance affects how the presence of inedible models influence the benefit of masquerade  ap. 441-455.  aMasquerading prey closely resemble inedible objects found in the same locality. These animals gain protection from their predators by causing their predators to misclassify them as the inedible ‘models’ that they appear to resemble. We recently demonstrated that predators are more likely to misclassify masquerading prey as their models when masqueraders are viewed in isolation from their models than when they are viewed simultaneously with examples of their models. Using domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) as predators and the twig-mimicking caterpillars of the Early Thorn Moth (Selenia dentaria) as prey, we tested whether this effect was influenced by the relative orientations of models and masqueraders; and the distance from which models and masqueraders could be viewed simultaneously. We found no effect of orientation, but that the cost to masqueraders of being viewed simultaneously with an example of the model declined as the distance between the model and masquerader increased. These results are interpreted in terms of animal cognition, and their implications for the evolutionary ecology of masquerade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3achickens 3achicks 3acognition 3ainsect larvae 3amodels 3amoths 3apredators1 aRuxton, Graeme D.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2014 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.441-455dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-013-9683-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100006200157245011600219300001400335520146500349592002801814650001301842650002001855650001001875650001101885650001601896653003001912653002801942653002701970653002301997653002302020653001502043700002902058773011102087856009102198852000902289655001202298IND60792455020221120172855.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079245502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2022.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVásconez, Juan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6372-740510aWorkload and production assessment in the avocado harvesting process using human-robot collaborative strategies  ap. 56-77.  aHuman-robot collaboration strategies for agricultural applications are still a challenging research topic that is in its early stages of development. The analysis of the production and physical workload measures during the harvesting process can be useful to obtain relevant information to improve production and farm management. In this work, it is presented the assessment of the avocado harvesting process under different scenarios. For this purpose, two simulation environments were created and compared based on the obtained information from a Chilean farm. The first scenario uses only a human-based workforce to perform all the avocado harvesting-related tasks, whilst the second scenario is based on a human-robot cooperative strategy proposed to improve the harvesting procedure. A total of 41 different tests for each simulated scenario was performed, and then a comparison of them in terms of production and expected human physical workload was obtained. The results showed that the use of a cooperative strategy during harvesting tasks can increase the production measured from the cargo zone from 15% to 80%, as well as the total harvested production from 23% to 85%, whilst the human workload only increases from 1% to 16%. These results enclose the possibility of using production and workload measures as metrics for a human–machine interaction cooperative approach design, in benefit of the harvesting process management and decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavocados 3afarm management 3afarms 3ahumans 3alabor force 0aHuman-robot collaboration 0aHuman physical workload 0aStandard ISO 8996:2004 0aProcess production 0aProcess management 0aHarvesting1 aAuat Cheein, Fernando A.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2022 Nov., v. 223 p.56-77dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2022.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014000175300001400315520207700329592002802406650001802434650002602452650002102478650001102499650001402510650000902524650001102533650001002544650001202554650001002566650002002576650002102596650002202617650001102639650004302650650002202693650002302715650001002738650001302748653000702761653000802768653000802776653000702784653000902791653002602800653002102826653002002847653002102867653001802888700003402906700002002940700005802960773012803018856009003146852000903236655001203245IND60635847720221121204219.0190425e20190616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063584772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdaz, Gilberto10aPersistence of Bacteroidales and other fecal indicator bacteria on inanimated materials, melon and tomato at various storage conditions  ap. 33-38.  aIn order to determine the microbial safety of produce, conventional fecal indicator bacteria (CFIB) such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus are quantified as a standard practice. Bacteroidales are also fecal indicators mostly used for water samples; however, their use and persistence in foods has been rarely studied. In this study, persistence of both CFIB and genetic markers of host-specific Bacteroidales was determined in artificially contaminated materials and vegetables with different textured surfaces under different storage conditions. Sterile feces were contaminated with E. coli, E. faecalis, Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (human origin), and Bacteroidales from porcine and bovine origin. Feces were applied to filters of mixed cellulose esters and tomatoes (smooth surface) and flat cork coupons and melons (rough surface) and stored at 10 °C/95% relative humidity (RH) and 25 °C/65%RH for up to 25 days. Bacteroidales markers were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), whereas CFIB were plated onto selective agars. CFIB detection on filters and cork surfaces declined over time. E. coli decreased 2.9 log CFU and 1.2 log CFU per filter and cork, respectively, at 10 °C/95%RH and 5.8 log CFU and 1.8 log CFU per filter and cork, respectively, at 25 °C/65%RH. E. faecalis decreased 1.9 log CFU on filters and 1.3 log CFU on cork at 10 °C/95%RH and 2.6 log CFU/filter and cork under both storage conditions. Although E. coli levels in tomatoes slightly increased during storage, the levels decreased by the end of the assays. However, CFIB levels in melons stored at 10 °C/95%RH increased after 20 days; when stored at 25 °C/65%RH, these levels increased after five days.Bacteroidales levels (universal and host-specific markers) in inanimated material and produce did not show significant differences (P ≤ 0.01) over time. Stability and persistence of Bacteroidales genetic markers make them superior to CFIB as markers and are alternatives for determining the risk of exposure to feces-contaminated produce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidales 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3acattle 3acellulose 3acork 3aesters 3afeces 3afilters 3afoods 3agenetic markers 3ahost specificity 3aindicator species 3amelons 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arelative humidity 3astorage conditions 3aswine 3atomatoes 0aSS 0aMST 0aGEC 0aRH 0aCFIB 0aProduce contamination 0aEscherichia coli 0aRisk assessment 0aFecal indicators 0aBacteroidales1 aMerino-Mascorro, José Ángel1 aGarcía, Santos1 aHeredia, Norma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3876-77630 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 June 16, v. 299 p.33-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04207naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013000206300001400336520237300350592002802723596005302751596007202804650001602876650001002892650001602902650001602918650001702934650001002951650001502961650004302976650001603019650001203035650001303047650001603060650001803076650001903094650002503113650002203138650002003160650001703180650001103197650001403208650001203222650001103234651001203245700006003257700002003317700001603337700002303353700005603376773010503432856008303537852000903620655001203629IND60770638120221117234010.0220319e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077063812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-021-00823-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeres, Katalin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5818-489110aPhotoprotection and high-light acclimation in semi-arid grassland lichens – a cooperation between algal and fungal partners  ap. 33-48.  aIn lichens, each symbiotic partner cooperates for the survival of the symbiotic association. The protection of the susceptible photosynthetic apparatus is essential for both participants. The mycobiont and photobiont contribute to the protection against the damaging effect of excess light by various mechanisms. The present study investigated the effect of seasonality and microhabitat exposure on photoprotection and photoacclimation in the photo- and the mycobiont of six lichen species with different thallus morphology in inland dune system in the Kiskunság region (Hungary) with shaded, more humid and exposed, drier dune sides. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, spectrophotometry, chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetic technique were used, and micrometeorological data were collected. The four years data series revealed that the north-east-facing side was characterized by higher relative humidity and lower light intensities compared to the south-west-facing drier and more exposed sides. The south-west facing side was exposed to direct illumination 3–4 hours longer in winter and 1–2 hours shorter in summer than the north-east facing side of the dune, influencing the metabolism of sun and shade populations of various species. Because rapid desiccation caused short active periods of lichens during bright and drier seasons and on exposed microhabitats, the rapid, non-regulated non-photochemical quenching mechanisms in the photobiont had a significant role in protecting the photosynthetic system in the hydrated state. In dehydrated conditions, thalli were mainly defended by the solar screening metabolites produced by the mycobiont and curling during desiccation (also caused by the mycobiont). Furthermore, the efficacy of light use (higher chlorophyll and carotenoid concentration) increased because of short hydrated periods. Still, a lower level of received irradiation was appropriate for photosynthesis in dry seasons and on sun exposed habitats. In humid seasons and microhabitats, more extended active periods lead to increased photosynthesis and production of solar radiation protectant fungal metabolites, allowing a lower level of photoprotection in the form of regulated non-photochemical quenching by the photobiont. Interspecific differences were more pronounced than the intraspecific ones among seasons and microhabitat types.  aPublisher supplied data  aOTKA-T101713cHungarian Scientific Research Fund  aNKFI K 124341cNemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afungi 3agrasslands 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airradiation 3alichens 3alighting 3ametabolites 3amicrohabitats 3aphotosynthesis 3aradiation resistance 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 3asummer 3asymbiosis 3athallus 3awinter 3aHungary1 aCsintalan, Zsolt1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7744-33931 aLaufer, Zsanett1 aEngel, Rita1 aSzabó, Krisztina,1 aFarkas, Edit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5245-10790 tSymbiosis.g2022 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.33-48dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl39183x0334-51147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-021-00823-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245010000207300001600307520105000323592002801373650001801401650001501419650001201434650001401446650001101460650002301471650001501494650001501509650001901524650001701543650001401560650001501574650001801589653002101607653001201628653002601640653001501666653001901681700001701700700001701717700001701734700001501751700001701766700001701783700001901800700001701819700001801836700002001854773010601874856008701980852000902067655001202076IND60526732320221118200906.0190409e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052673232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Hye-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5838-321410aEfficient harvesting of wet blue-green microalgal biomass by two-aminoclay [AC]-mixture systems  ap. 313-318.  aBlue-green microalgal blooms have been caused concerns about environmental problems and human-health dangers. For removal of such cyanobacteria, many mechanical and chemical treatments have been trialled. Among various technologies, the flocculation-based harvesting (precipitation) method can be an alternative if the problem of the low yield of recovered biomass at low concentrations of cyanobacteria is solved. In the present study, it was utilized mixtures of magnesium aminoclay [MgAC] and cerium aminoclay [CeAC] with different particle sizes to harvest cyanobacteria feedstocks with ∼100% efficiency within 1h by ten-fold lower loading of ACs compared with single treatments of [MgAC] or [CeAC]. This success was owed to the compact networks of the different-sized-ACs mixture for efficient bridging between microalgal cells. In order to determine the usage potential of biomass harvested with AC, the mass was heat treated under the reduction condition. This system is expected to be profitably utilizable in adsorbents and catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aadsorbents 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acerium 3achemical treatment 3afeedstocks 3aharvesting 3aheat treatment 3ahuman health 3amagnesium 3amicroalgae 3aparticle size 0aAminoclays (ACs) 0aMixture 0aBlue-green microalgae 0aHarvesting 0aHeat treatment1 aLee, Hyun Uk1 aKim, Eui Jin1 aSeo, Soonjoo1 aKim, Bohwa1 aLee, Go-Woon1 aOh, You-Kwan1 aKim, Jun Yeong1 aHuh, Yun Suk1 aSong, Hyun A.1 aLee, Young-Chul0 tBioresource technology.g2016 July, v. 211 p.313-318dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245009500179300001500274506002800289520150000317592002801817506003701845650001001882650002501892650002601917650001001943650001501953653002601968653002901994653002302023700001402046700001502060700002702075700002702102773012702129856008902256852000902345655001202354IND60739554320221207134454.0180531e199706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073955432DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1997.31.2.10842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez, Inmaculada10aApplication of the multidimensional analysis to the differentiation of Spanish white wines  ap. 99-107.  aResource is Open Access  aThe modern enology technology allows the elaboration of high quality wines that preserve the differentiating characteristics according to the vine, production area, fermentative yeasts or to the different technology used for the elaboration of wine. The study of 45 spanish white wines with « Denomination of Origin », 5 of those belong to Alto Turia, 6 to the Clariano, 14 to the Valentino, 10 to the Valdepeñas and 10 to the Rueda, allows to establish importants differences among them according to their chemical composition. This differentiation has been possible by means of the application of the Discriminant Analysis to 35 parameters related with the chemical composition of theses wines. In the first place these compounds have been grouped, according to their chemical affinity, in three groups: general component, alcohols and esters. Discriminant Analysis has been applied to each one of these groups, being observed that the esters allow to be carried out the classification of these wines in their corresponding groups, because only it confuses some wine of Clariano with those of Valentino. To carry out a correct classification of 45 wines studied in their corresponding « Denomination of Origin », it is necessary to appeal to carry out a Discriminant Analysis with the 35 compounds together, being, in this case, the compounds that contribute to this differentiation pratically the same ones that those which contribued to differentiate each group of variables separately.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLuffa 3achemical composition 3adiscriminant analysis 3avines 3awinemaking 0adiscriminant analysis 0amutidimensional analysis 0aSpanish white wine1 aCasp, Ana1 aZunica, L.1 aAleixandre, José Luis1 aGarcía, María José,0 tOENO One.g1997 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.99-107dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.1997.31.2.10843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009200169300001300261500001100274520113900285592002801424650001901452650001601471650001201487650002201499650001501521650001401536650001401550700006001564773010401624856008301728852000901811655001201820IND60770638220221117234151.0220319e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077063822DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-021-00826-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatra, Dipanwita10aNod–factors are dispensable for nodulation: A twist in bradyrhizobia-legume symbiosis  ap. 1-15.  aReview  aBiological nitrogen fixation through a symbiosis between the legume and free-living Bradyrhizobium is a crucial step to fulfill the nitrogenous demand of the host plant. Bradyrhizobium establishes successful symbiosis with the legumes by virtue of having a set of genes that code for nod-factors (NFs). The NFs are very much species-specific and thus, the symbionts have their own choice of host. Recently it has been reported that even in absence of NF Bradyrhizobia can establish successful nodulation in their cognate hosts. But nod-independent (NI) nodulation is only limited in some species of Bradyrhizobium. This review emphasized on types of Bradyrhizobium species, types of nodule formation, regulation of nodulation, comparative mechanism of both nod-dependent (ND) and independent nitrogen fixation in legume plants, relationship with type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and NI nitrogen fixation by Bradyrhizobium, the role of NF receptor homolog and NF in symbiosis. Thus, this review predicts the shift of one group of symbionts to another unique type, where pathogen-associated machinery like T3SS plays a role in symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3ahost plants 3alegumes 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis1 aMandal, Sukhendu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7752-09820 tSymbiosis.g2022 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.1-15dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl39183x0334-51147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-021-00826-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245004900172300001600221520139800237592002801635650002301663650001401686650002601700650001201726650002401738650001501762650000901777650001401786650001501800650001301815650001501828650002001843650001001863653001901873653001901892653001601911653003301927653003701960653001001997700001602007700001702023700001502040700001802055773007702073856008902150852000902239655001202248IND60585348020221121033526.0171109e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058534802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez, S.10aState of the art of produced water treatment  ap. 186-208.  aProduced water (PW) is the wastewater generated when water from underground reservoirs is brought to the surface during oil or gas extraction. PW is generated in large amounts and has a complex composition, containing various toxic organic and inorganic compounds. PW is currently treated in conventional trains that include phase separators, decanters, cyclones and coarse filters in order to comply with existing regulation for discharge. These treatment trains do not achieve more restrictive limitations related to the reuse of the effluent (reinjection into extraction wells) or other beneficial uses (e.g., irrigation). Therefore, and to prevent environmental pollution, further polishing processes need to be carried out. Characterization of the PW to determine major constituents is the first step to select the optimum treatment for PW, coupled with environmental factors, economic considerations, and local regulatory framework. This review tries to provide an overview of different treatments that are being applied to polish this type of effluents. These technologies include membranes, physical, biological, thermal or chemical treatments, where special emphasis has been made on advanced oxidation processes due to the advantages offered by these processes. Commercial treatments, based on the combination, modification and improvement of simpler treatments, were also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical treatment 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental factors 3afilters 3ainorganic compounds 3airrigation 3aoils 3aoxidation 3aseparators 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater treatment 3awells 0aProduced water 0aOil and grease 0aOil and gas 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aIndustrial wastewater treatments 0aReuse1 aMicó, M.M.1 aArnaldos, M.1 aMedina, F.1 aContreras, S.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Feb., v. 192 p.186-208dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007800168300001600246520094100262592002801203650000801231650001701239650001501256650001101271650001201282650001501294650002801309650002301337650001801360650001101378700002201389700002001411700002101431700002201452700002001474773008401494856008401578852000901662655001201671IND60553964320221118164038.0161023e20140904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055396432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaejen, Carlo10aTranscriptome Maps of mRNP Biogenesis Factors Define Pre-mRNA Recognition  ap. 745-757.  aBiogenesis of eukaryotic messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) involves the synthesis, splicing, and 3′ processing of pre-mRNA, and the assembly of mature mRNPs for nuclear export. We mapped 23 mRNP biogenesis factors onto the yeast transcriptome, providing 104–106 high-confidence RNA interaction sites per factor. The data reveal how mRNP biogenesis factors recognize pre-mRNA elements in vivo. They define conserved interactions between splicing factors and pre-mRNA introns, including the recognition of intron-exon junctions and the branchpoint. They also identify a unified arrangement of 3′ processing factors at pre-mRNA polyadenylation (pA) sites in yeast and human, which results from an A-U sequence bias at pA sites. Global data analysis indicates that 3′ processing factors have roles in splicing and RNA surveillance, and that they couple mRNP biogenesis events to restrict nuclear export to mature mRNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA splicing 3abiogenesis 3ahumans 3aintrons 3amonitoring 3aphysiological transport 3aribonucleoproteins 3atranscriptome 3ayeasts1 aTorkler, Phillipp1 aGressel, Saskia1 aEssig, Katharina1 aSöding, Johannes1 aCramer, Patrick0 tMolecular cell.g2014 Sept. 04, v. 55 p.745-757dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168300001800275520280500293592002803098650002703126650002003153650001203173650002603185650001903211650001403230650002303244650001503267650002203282650002903304650001503333700002903348773011803377856008503495852000903580655001203589IND60132854720221122115802.0150513e20150503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013285472DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10348892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Parul13aAn approach to validate soil moisture derived from passive microwave sensors using SAR as an interface  ap. 2353-2374.  aValidation of soil moisture derived from space-borne passive microwave sensors remains a challenging task owing to the large variability in soil moisture within the coarse-resolution cell offered by passive sensors. In this article, nine spatial/temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets from Radar Satellite-1 (Radarsat-1) and Environmental Satellite-1 (Envisat-1) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) were used as an interface to upscale the field-level soil moisture to soil moisture at a 25 km × 25 km grid, the scale at which the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the EOS (Earth Observing System) (AMSR-E) level-3 soil moisture product is available, leading to a total of 68 such grids where there is a pair of SAR-derived and corresponding AMSR-E-derived values. Out of the these 68 grid cells, each of size 25 km × 25 km, pair data from nine dates, data corresponding to 51 grid cell pairs (from six dates) were used for the development of the approach and data corresponding to 17 grid cell pairs (from three dates) were used for validating the approach. It is observed that while the spatial variation in SAR- and AMSR-E-derived soil moisture is broadly similar, there exists a bias in the difference between AMSR-E- and SAR-derived soil moisture. The root mean square (RMS) difference between AMSR-E soil moisture and SAR-derived soil moisture at 25 km over the model development sample of 51 grid cells, each of 25 km × 25 km, was observed to be 4.2 (%g cm –³). The study shows that the bias is significantly affected by the AMSR-E vegetation/roughness parameter, g , which is an indicator of the prevailing vegetation/surface roughness conditions. This dependence of the bias on g was exploited to arrive at modified soil moisture estimates at 25 km. The RMS difference between the modified AMSR-E soil moisture at 25 km and the SAR-derived soil moisture was observed to be 2.13 (%g cm –³) over a validation sample of 17 grid cells each of size 25 km × 25 km, comprising extreme, dry and wet, and soil moisture conditions. This demonstrative study provides the feasibility of calibrating and improving the soil moisture product from coarse-resolution space-borne passive sensors with the help of soil moisture derived using SAR. The approach is demonstrated for validating passive radiometer-derived soil moisture over bare/crop-covered conditions through an experiment involving 68 25 km × 25 km grid cells spread over nine temporal/spatial Radarsat and Envisat-1 satellite SAR data sets and synchronous ground soil moisture measurements over farmers’ fields, covering a large range of soil/crop conditions prevailing during the nine months of SAR data acquisition. Hence the results reported in this manuscript are encouraging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth Observing System 3adata collection 3afarmers 3amicrowave radiometers 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asurface roughness 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avegetation1 aSrivastava, Hari Shanker0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 May 3, v. 36, no. 9 p.2353-2374dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10348893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245016800206300001800374520162600392536015702018592002802175596010602203650000802309650000802317650002202325650002002347650001802367650001902385650001502404650001402419650001802433650004302451650002602494650001202520653001802532653002002550653001802570700001902588700001902607700005602626773014302682856008202825852000902907655001202916IND60754063620221117011254.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075406362DNAL7 a10.1177/104063872110395492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarang, Anushri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6321-780012aA panel of real-time PCR assays for the detection of Bourbon virus, Heartland virus, West Nile virus, and Trypanosoma cruzi in major disease–transmitting vectors  ap. 1115-1122.  aVector-borne pathogens, such as Bourbon virus (BRBV), Heartland virus (HRTV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Trypanosoma cruzi (TCZ) are a great threat to public health and animal health. We developed a panel of TaqMan real-time PCR assays for pathogen surveillance. PCR targets were selected based on nucleic acid sequences deposited in GenBank. Primers and probes were either designed de novo or selected from publications. The coverages and specificities of the primers and probes were extensively evaluated by performing BLAST searches. Synthetic DNA or RNA fragments (gBlocks) were used as PCR templates in initial assay development and PCR positive controls in subsequent assay validation. For operational efficiency, the same thermocycling profile was used in BRBV, HRTV, and WNV reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, and a similar thermocycling profile without the initial reverse-transcription step was used in TCZ qPCR. The assays were optimized by titrating primer and probe concentrations. The analytical sensitivities were 100, 100, 10, and 10 copies of gBlock per reaction for BRBV (Cq = 36.0 ± 0.7), HRTV (Cq = 36.6 ± 0.9), WNV (Cq = 35.5 ± 0.4), and TCZ (Cq = 38.8 ± 0.3), respectively. PCR sensitivities for vector genomic DNA or RNA spiked with gBlock reached 100, 100, 10, and 10 copies per reaction for BRBV, HRTV, WNV, and TCZ, respectively. PCR specificity evaluated against a panel of non-target pathogens showed no significant cross-reactivity. Our BRBV, HRTV, WNV, and TCZ PCR panel could support epidemiologic studies and pathogen surveillance.  aFunding Our research project “Emerging Vector-Borne Diseases Assay Development” was funded by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.  aPublisher supplied data  cmissouri department of health and senior servicesdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100015509 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aWest Nile virus 3aanimal health 3across reaction 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3aviruses 0aBourbon virus 0aHeartland virus 0areal-time PCR1 aZhang, Michael1 aZhang, Shuping1 aShen, Zhenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0356-27330 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2021 Nov., v. 33, no. 6 p.1115-1122dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/104063872110395493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245008400170300001400254520089200268592002801160650001601188650001401204650001501218650001401233650001101247650002301258650002201281650001001303651001501313653001601328653001501344653001501359653001801374653002001392700001901412700001801431700001701449773015001466856007801616852000901694655001201703IND60522849120221119044129.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052284912DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1992-1-2032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRandriaminahy, Michel10aLipophilic Phenolic Constituents from Helichrysum Species Endemic to Madagascar  ap. 10-16.  aEight species of the genus Helichrysum, all of them endemic to Madagascar, were analyzed for lipophilic phenolic constituents deposited on the surfaces of leaves and stems. A total of 35 compounds was isolated and identified by spectroscopic means. Chalcones (10) comprised the largest group of compounds encountered, followed by flavonols (8), flavanones (7), flavones (4), benzophenones (3) and phloroglucinol derivatives (3). Many of the flavonoids were characterized by unsubstituted B-rings and/or C- or O-bound prenyl or neryl substituents. The Helichrysum species analyzed in this study are very similar to African species of this genus with regard to their lipophilic phenolic constituents. The phenolic com pounds studied thus appear to be conservative chemical characters of Helichrysum that were retained more or less unchanged during the origin of endemic taxa in Madagascar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelichrysum 3achalcones 3aflavanones 3aflavonols 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aspectral analysis 3astems 3aMadagascar 0aHelichrysum 0aAsteraceae 0aFlavonoids 0aBenzophenones 0aPhloroglucinols1 aProksch, Peter1 aWitte, Ludger1 aWray, Victor0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 47, no. 1-2 p.10-16dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1992-1-2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012300173300001600296520112300312592002801435650001701463650002501480650001101505650000901516650001201525650001101537650002401548650001001572650001301582651001201595653000801607653002301615653002801638653001501666653002501681700002101706773008401727856008601811852000901897655001201906IND60561210920221118221231.0170607e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056121092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStathopoulos, P.10aRetrofitting micro gas turbines for wet operation. A way to increase operational flexibility in distributed CHP plants  ap. 438-446.  aIt is generally accepted that only flexible CHP plants could be a viable option in an electrical system with high penetration of variable renewables. Variable power-to-heat-ratios and decoupled power and heat generation will be basic requirements. Currently, the most common way to fulfill these specifications is the use of heat storage devices, whereas wet operation of gas turbines is an alternative way to achieve both goals. The current work is an analysis of a micro gas turbine adapted to operate with steam injection. A thermodynamic model is developed and a typical apartments building in Berlin, Germany is chosen as a case study. The study presumes the existence of a micro gas turbine and analyzes the results of its adaptation for wet operation. The environmental and economic performance of the new system is compared to that of its commercial counterpart. It is shown that the retrofitted turbine has longer annual operation time and higher electrical energy generation. The retrofit also proves to be an attractive investment for the German CHP market with internal rates of return reaching almost 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy 3aheat 3amarkets 3amodels 3aresidential housing 3asteam 3aturbines 3aGermany 0aCHP 0aMicro gas turbines 0aOperational flexibility 0aWet cycles 0aSensitivity analysis1 aPaschereit, C.O.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.438-446dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018500166300001800351520113400369592002801503650002001531650001501551650001501566650001901581650001901600650001501619700001601634700001901650773011801669856008501787852000901872655001201881IND60132854820221122083849.0150513e20150503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013285482DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10348932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrieco, G.10aApplication of state-of-the-art SAR X-band geophysical model functions (GMFs) for sea surface wind (SSW) speed retrieval to a data set of the Italian satellite mission COSMO-SkyMed  ap. 2296-2312.  aThe concurrent presence of three satellite X-band SAR systems makes it interesting to test the interoperability of retrieval approaches meant for one system on the others. To approach this problem a description of the state of the art of the SAR X-band geophysical model functions (GMFs) for sea surface wind (SSW) speed retrieval is carried out. A sensitivity study of wind speed retrieval with respect to the wind direction when using the XMOD2 GMFs developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) is presented. An application of these two GMFs to a series of data sets of stripmap images with vertical polarization VV acquired by the Italian satellite mission COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) is discussed, and the results of the SSW speed retrieval are compared to both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) blended sea winds and in situ buoy data from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). The retrieval exercises show that the two GMFs have similar performance. The sensitivity study shows that an error of ±10° may introduce an error greater that 10% in the retrieval of SSW speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3awind direction 3awind speed1 aNirchio, F.1 aMigliaccio, M.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 May 3, v. 36, no. 9 p.2296-2312dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10348933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011700170500002200287520160300309592002801912650002201940650001701962650001901979650002401998650002602022650000702048650003202055650001702087650001602104650003402120650003802154650001202192653002102204653001002225653002502235653001902260700001602279700001602295700001702311700001602328700001502344773009602359856008602455852000902541655001202550IND60563810220221121011202.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056381022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Jiandong10aMesoporous phenylalanine ammonia lyase microspheres with improved stability through calcium carbonate templating  aPre-press version  aCross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) have recently emerged as a promising method for enzyme immobilization due to its simplicity and low cost. However, a lack of good size and morphological control over the as-prepared CLEAs has limited their practical applications in some cases. Here, monodisperse spherical CLEAs of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL microspheres) were prepared based on CaCO3 microtemplates. The preparation procedure involves filling porous CaCO3 microtemplates with the protein by salt precipitation, glutaraldehyde crosslinking, and dissolution of the microtemplates. The formulation of CaCO3 templates with controlled size was studied in detail. Characterization of the prepared PAL microspheres was investigated. The results showed that the PAL microspheres with high immobilization efficiency (79%) exhibited excellent stability, including increased tolerance to proteolysis, low pH, and denaturants, and excellent mechanical properties. For example, free PAL almost lost all activity after they were incubated in the presence of trypsin for 2min, whereas PAL microspheres still retained 95% of their initial activity. Moreover, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms revealed that the resultant PAL microspheres possessed good monodispersity and mesoporous structure instead of the amorphous clusters of conventional CLEAs with few pores. Compared with conventional CLEAs, the monodisperse PAL microspheres with mesoporous make them more potentially useful for biomedical and biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acrosslinking 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amechanical properties 3apH 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aporous media 3aproteolysis 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atrypsin 0aPAL microspheres 0aCLEAs 0aCaCO3 microtemplates 0aImmobilization1 aZhao, Yamin1 aTan, Zhilei1 aZhong, Cheng1 aHan, Peipei1 aJia, Shiru0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245019600169300001800365520217400383592002802557650001102585650001002596650001402606650001002620650001502630650001002645650001102655650001302666650001402679650002002693650000902713650002202722650001202744650001602756653001502772653002402787653002002811653001602831700002502847700001702872700002002889773011202909856008303021852000903104655001203113IND60581639220221116175725.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058163922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Anne Marie10aSystematic review and evidence based recommendations on texture modified foods and thickened liquids for adults (above 17 years) with oropharyngeal dysphagia – An updated clinical guideline  ap. 1980-1991.  aOropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) has significant consequences for both the person with dysphagia and the society. An often-used treatment for OD is the recommendation of the texture of food and liquids. This recommendation seems to be based more on best practice than on evidence from a systematic review of existing scientific evidence. The aim of this paper was to report the result of an up-date of an original national guideline focussing on whether thickened liquids (review question 1) and modified foods (review question 2) are beneficial for adults above 17 years with OD in relation to three critical outcomes (aspiration, pneumonia and death) and seven important outcomes (dehydration, weight loss, mealtime performance, patient preferences, intervention adherence and quality of life).Three steps were used. First: An updated systematic literature search. Second: An assessment of the quality of the evidence for each review question by means of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Third: Development of clinical recommendations based on the evidence, assessment of the risk benefit ratio, and perceived patient preferences.The body of evidence consisted of two RCTs for review question 1 both using nectar thickened liquids or honey-thickened liquids. No evidence was found for two important outcomes, mealtime performance and quality of life. With regard to risk of pneumonia, death, aspiration, dehydration, weight loss and intervention adherence no significant differences were found. The outcome addressing patient preferences, found a non-significant increased dissatisfaction with nectar thickened liquids (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.95–1.30) and a significant increased dissatisfaction with honey thickened liquids compared to thin liquids/chin down (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.01–1.37). No evidence was identified for review question 2.Based on the quality of the evidence, assessment of the risk benefit ratio, and perceived patient preferences a weak recommendation against the use of texture modified liquids and good clinical practice pointing for the use of texture modified foods in patients with OD were made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adeath 3adysphagia 3afoods 3aguidelines 3ahoney 3anectar 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aquality of life 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atexture 3aweight loss 0aAspiration 0aPatient preferences 0aQuality of life 0aDehydration1 aKjaersgaard, Annette1 aHansen, Tina1 aPoulsen, Ingrid0 tClinical nutrition.g2018 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.1980-1991dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001600292520151700308592002801825650001501853650001201868650001301880650001601893650002001909650001901929650001601948650002101964650001401985650001601999650001002015650001802025650001502043650001302058653002702071653001302098653001902111653001702130653002202147700003302169700002202202700002102224700002402245700002202269700002502291700001802316773011302334856008602447852000902533655001202542IND60611551320221122154800.0201209e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061155132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVocciante, Marco10aAdsorption of ammonium on clinoptilolite in presence of competing cations: Investigation on groundwater remediation  ap. 480-487.  aVarious civilian, agricultural and industrial activities cause the presence of nitrogen compounds in surface and groundwater, where they are further converted into ammonia and its salts. The progressive increase in ammonium concentration in the environment represents a serious concern since it is one of the main causes of eutrophication and its transformation may lead to carcinogens. On the other hand, wastewater has recently been considered as a potential source of nitrogenous nutrients for plants, once adequate recovery processes have been provided. Among the latter, the adsorption processes must be considered reliable and clean due to the mild operating conditions. An experimental study on the removal of ammonium by adsorption on a zeolite cation exchanger (clinoptilolite mineral) was undertaken, considering the water from an Italian groundwater treatment facility with a treatment capability of 150,000 L/h. The activity was focused on the polishing step before surface discharge (from 20 mg/L to 5 mg/L, according to restrictions due to neighboring water bodies of naturalistic relevance). The experimental study was part of a wider activity for the evaluation of the performances of a 1000 L/h cation-exchange pilot plant operated at the same industrial site. Thus, the peculiar features of the reported study are ammonium removal until the level of traces, use of a conditioned zeolite, and co-presence of high concentrations of other dissolved cationic species competing for exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aammonium 3acarcinogens 3acation exchange 3aeutrophication 3agroundwater 3aindustrial sites 3anutrients 3aremediation 3asalts 3asurface water 3awastewater 3azeolites 0aCompetitive adsorption 0aAmmonium 0aClinoptilolite 0aIon exchange 0aWater remediation1 aDe Folly D'Auris, Alessandra1 aFinocchi, Antonio1 aTagliabue, Marco1 aBellettato, Michela1 aFerrucci, Aurelio1 aReverberi, Andrea P.1 aFerro, Sergio0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 198 p.480-487dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245018900176300001600365520139300381592002801774650001101802650001701813650003801830650001001868650001901878650001501897650001101912650001101923650002101934650001601955650001701971650001901988700001802007700002102025700002302046700001902069700002502088700002002113773010002133856008502233990002302318852000902341655001202350IND60099939520221119211507.0141105e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009993952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarker, Satya Ranjan10aEvaluation of the influence of ionization states and spacers in the thermotropic phase behaviour of amino acid-based cationic lipids and the transfection efficiency of their assemblies  ap. 364-373.  aThe influence of both the ionization states and the hydrocarbon chain spacer of a series of amino acid-based cationic lipids was evaluated in terms of gene delivery efficiency and cytotoxicity to the COS-7 cell line and compared with that of Lipofectamine™ 2000. We synthesized a series of amino acid-based cationic lipids with different ionization states (i.e., –NH₂, –NH₃ ⁺Cl⁻ or –NH₃ ⁺TFA⁻) in the lysine head group and different hydrocarbon chain spacers (i.e., 0, 3, 5 or 7 carbon atoms) between the hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic moieties. In the 3-carbon series, the cationic assemblies formed a micellar structure in the presence of –NH₃ ⁺Cl⁻ and a vesicular structure both in the presence of –NH₂ and –NH₃ ⁺TFA⁻. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data revealed a significantly lower (8.1°C) gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature for cationic assemblies bearing –NH₃ ⁺TFA⁻ when compared to their –NH₂ counterparts. Furthermore, the zeta potential of cationic assemblies having –NH₃ ⁺TFA⁻ in the hydrophilic head group was maximum followed by –NH₃ ⁺Cl⁻ and –NH₂ irrespective of their hydrocarbon chain spacer length. The gene delivery efficiency in relation to the ionization states of the hydrophilic head group was as follows: –NH₃ ⁺TFA⁻>–NH₃ ⁺Cl⁻>–NH₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acytotoxicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3alipids 3alysine 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3atransfection 3azeta potential1 aArai, Satoshi1 aMurate, Motohide1 aTakahashi, Hiroshi1 aTakata, Masaki1 aKobayashi, Toshihide1 aTakeoka, Shinji0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 422, no. 1-2 p.364-373dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010100166300001600267520194600283592002802229650001502257650001702272650001902289650001202308650001102320650001502331650002502346653002402371653002402395653003302419653002102452653002702473653002602500700001602526700001702542700001802559700001402577700001502591773009802606856008602704852000902790655001202799IND60598445120221117094941.0180629e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSturm, J.10aState estimation of lithium-ion cells using a physicochemical model based extended Kalman filter  ap. 103-123.  aTwo time-varying linear state-space representations of the generally accepted physicochemical model (PCM) of a lithium-ion cell are used to estimate local and global states during different charging scenarios. In terms of computational speed and suitability towards recursive state observer models, the solid-phase diffusion in the PCM of an exemplaric MCMB/LiCoO2 lithium-ion cell is derived with the aid of two different numerical reduction methods in the form of a Polynomial Profile and an Eigenfunction Method. As a benchmark, the PCM using the original Duhamel Superposition Integral approximation serves for the comparison of accuracy and computational speed. A modified spatial discretization via the finite volume method improves handling of boundary conditions and guarantees accurate simulation results of the PCM even at a low level of spatial discretization. The Polynomial Profile allows for a significant speed-up in computational time whilst showing a poor prediction accuracy during dynamic load profiles. The Eigenfunction Method shows a comparable accuracy as the benchmark for all load profiles whilst resulting in an even higher computational effort. The two derived observer models incorporate the state-space representation of the reduced PCM applying both the Polynomial and Eigenfunction approach combined with an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm based on a novel initialization algorithm and conservation of lithium mass. The estimation results of both models show robust and quick reduction of the residual errors for both local and global states when considering the applied current and the resulting cell voltage of the benchmark model, as the underlying measurement signal. The carried out state estimation for a 4C constant charge current showed a regression of the cell voltage error to 1 mV within 30 s with an initial SOC error of 42.4% under a standard deviation of 10 mV and including process noise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adynamic load 3aelectric power 3alithium 3amodels 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 0aReduced-order model 0aLithium-ion battery 0aPseudo two-dimensional model 0aState estimation 0aExtended Kalman filter 0aPhysicochemical model1 aEnnifar, H.1 aErhard, S.V.1 aRheinfeld, A.1 aKosch, S.1 aJossen, A.0 tApplied energy.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 223 p.103-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010900170500001900279520113100298592002801429650001701457650001501474650001701489650001801506650001301524650001401537650001401551650001101565650001301576650001101589650001101600650001301611650001101624700003101635700002701666700003101693700001701724700003501741700002001776700003101796773012501827856007801952852000902030655001202039IND60738709920221122051605.0210524e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073870992DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100507282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLama-Muñoz, Antonio 10aInhibitory Effect of Olive Phenolic Compounds Isolated from Olive Oil By-Product on Melanosis of Shrimps  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMelanosis is an unsolved problem of the crustacean industry and the cause of great loss of value. This study investigates the effect of two potent, natural antioxidants isolated from olive waste (hydroxytyrosol, HT and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, DHPG) and three novel HT-derivatives containing selenium and sulfur (dihydroxytyrosyl diselenide, N-hydroxytyrosyl selenourea, and N-hydroxytyrosyl thiourea) on the prevention of melanosis in Atlantic ditch shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) during refrigerated storage. These results clearly demonstrate the positive inhibitory effect of DHPG and dihydroxytyrosyl diselenide on delaying melanosis in vivo, although this effect was not dose dependent. The effect was associated with a concomitant-inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity in vitro. To our knowledge, so far no studies on the prevention of melanosis have been conducted on this small specie of shrimp which is available in large quantities at any time of the year at low cost. Studies with these promising compounds could then be extended to other more economically important species with a greater guarantee of success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalaemonetes 3abyproducts 3acold storage 3adose response 3aindustry 3amelanosis 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aselenium 3ashrimp 3asulfur 3athiourea 3awastes1 aGómez-Carretero, Antonio 1 aRubio-Senent, Fátima 1 aBermúdez-Oria, Alejandra 1 aMaya, Inés 1 aFernández-Bolaños, José G.,1 aVioque, Blanca 1 aFernández-Bolaños, Juan 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100507283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245009900203300001200302520166600314592002801980596009902008650001302107650002102120650001602141650002502157650002102182650001102203650001902214651001002233700002602243700001802269700001602287700001402303700001502317773013502332856008202467852000902549655001202558IND60677470320221118013426.0200121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067747032DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-019-8688-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoutahir, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9610-871810aObserved and projected changes on aquifer recharge in a Mediterranean semi-arid area, SE Spain  ap. 671.  aGroundwater is the major water source in arid and semi-arid regions and its availability under future climatic scenarios is uncertain. In this context, the knowledge of the likely changes in aquifer recharge is very important for sustainable management of groundwater resources in these environments. This work assesses the effect of future potential changes in the climate variables on aquifer recharge in a Mediterranean semi-arid aquifer (Sierra de Las Aguilas (SAG), SE Spain). We used monthly piezometric data to validate the aquifer recharge simulated by HYDROBAL ecohydrological model over the period 2001–2016. This model was then used to simulate the aquifer recharge over the historical period 1971–2000 and over two projected periods (2039–2068 and 2069–2098) using 18 downscaled climate projections. The results show that the percentage of aquifer recharge to precipitation (PAR) decreased significantly over the historical period (− 0.3% year⁻¹, p < 0.05). This decreasing tendency is expected to continue in the same direction with similar reduction rate (− 0.4% year⁻¹, p < 0.001) under the moderate RCP4.5 climate scenario and with a higher rate (− 0.6% year⁻¹, p < 0.001) under the high RCP8.5 scenario. These changes, due principally to the reduction of precipitations, will inverse the recuperation trend observed in the water level. Actually, the current water pumping from the SAG aquifer represents 10% of precipitation below the observed PAR (15.1%). However, in the future, the PAR is expected to decrease below the 10% threshold under the two RCP scenarios for the medium- and long-term periods.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2015-69773-C2-1-PcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España 3aaquifers 3aclimatic factors 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3asemiarid zones 3aSpain1 aFernández-Mejuto, M.1 aAndreu, J.

Determined were pasting, paste, and dynamic rheology attributes. The overall conclusion was that the various HC interacted to different degrees with native NMS granules (controlling their swelling and disintegration, which had an effect on subsequent processes, such as starch polymer leaching and associations between starch polymer molecules and between starch polymer and HC molecules) and that their tendency to interact with granule surfaces may also have promoted associations between swollen granules and granule fragments. Products of cross-linking of NMS to different degrees behaved differently than native NMS in the presence of different HC. Different specific mechanisms are suggested for each starch-additive combination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn starch 3acrosslinking 3agranules 3ahydrocolloids 3aleaching 3apasting properties 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3arheology 3asodium nitrate 3asodium sulfate 3astarch 0aCross-linked starch 0aHydrocolloids 0aNormal maize starch 0aPaste properties 0aPasting properties 0aAlg 0aBD 0a%BD 0aCMC 0aG′ 0aG″ 0aGG 0aHC 0aHPMC 0am 0aNMS 0aNSP 0aPEG 0aROD 0aRVA 0aS 0aSB 0a%SB 0atan δ 0aWMS 0aXan (water) 0aXan (1.0% NaCl) 0aη* 0aκC 0aιC 0aλC1 aFeng, Tao1 aBeMiller, James N.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Nov., v. 96 p.231-245dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007400163300001800237520109700255592002801352650002301380650001101403650002601414650002401440650002801464650000901492650001201501650001201513650002001525650001101545650001301556650001601569700001801585700001301603700002001616700005701636773013501693856008001828852000901908655001201917IND60606058420180920000000.0180724e20180125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060605842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b100512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAi, Haoqiang10aTwo-Dimensional Metal–Organic Half-metallic Antiferromagnet: CoFePz  ap. 1846-1851.  aHalf-metals are always accompanied by ferromagnetism with undesired stray magnetic field which may be harmful in highly integrated circuits. By contrast, half-metallic antiferromagnets (HMAFMs) can achieve fully spin-polarized current without stray magnetic field, enabling spintronic filed sensing and magnetic memories. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the tantalizing HMAFM can be realized in a two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) containing Co ions and octa-amino-substituted iron-porphyrazines (CoFePz). The strong p–d exchange interaction between ions and ligands leads to an antiferromagnetic ground state with metallic features in one spin direction and semiconducting features in the opposite spin direction. Monte Carlo simulations based on the Ising model on an edge-centered square lattice indicate that the Néel temperature of the CoFePz (247 K) is much higher than the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Considering the huge number of MOFs, it is expected that the present findings can shed light on a new way to develop organic HMAFMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aelectronic circuits 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aions 3aligands 3aliquids 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3anitrogen 3atemperature1 aLiu, Xiaobiao1 aYang, Bo1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aZhao, Mingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7583-96820 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 25, v. 122, no. 3 p.1846-1851dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b100513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245015900163300001400322520089700336592002801233650001701261650001701278650001101295650001301306650003201319651001301351653001101364653001301375653003201388653002601420773015101446856007901597852000901676655001201685IND60565910620221119224531.0170327e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056591062DNAL7 a10.1515/trser-2017-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabai, Daniel10aDisambiguating Praxis from Practice in Natural Resource Management: A Practical Space for Enhancing Experiential Learning in the Eastern Coast of Tanzania  ap. 85-95.  aIt is evident that practice and praxis have significantly contributed to knowledge generation in the Tanzanian coastal belt, especially where Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) programmes have been adopted and practiced such as Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Mtwara, Lindi, and the Coastal region (KICAMP, 2001; NICEMS, 2003). In spite of such learning evidences, users of generated natural resource data in the coastal area tend to employ practice and praxis interchangeably, conflating the two concepts together; leading to a situation where one may hardly ascribe generated knowledge appropriately to contexts that favour occurrence of each of the two constructs. The paper adopts ethnographic approach in a defined coastal case study to examine contexts and situations that signals “conflationˮ and it employs examples that may help readers of the article to disambiguate praxis from practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3acase studies 3acoasts 3alearning 3anatural resource management 3aTanzania 0aPraxis 0aPractice 0aNatural resource management 0aExperiential Learning0 tTransylvanian review of systematical and ecological research.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 19, no. 1 p.85-95dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23179x2344-32197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/trser-2017-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012900165300001300294520153000307592002801837650001701865650001501882650002501897650001401922650002201936650001201958650001101970650002301981650001402004650002002018650002102038650001702059650001202076650002702088650001302115651001002128653002802138653002502166653001902191653003402210653001902244653002602263700001402289700001202303700001602315773009502331856008602426852000902512655001202521IND60598445420221117094619.0180629e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ge10aPolicy simulation for promoting residential PV considering anecdotal information exchanges based on social network modelling  ap. 1-10.  aSurveys and empirical researches have revealed that the households’ perceptions of benefits play a more important role than the benefits themselves in the decision process of adopting residential photovoltaic (PV). However, it has been overlooked in previous models about the green technology diffusion. This work developed an innovation diffusion model based on a social network, which was integrated with an anecdotal information exchange process. The contributions were to model the households’ evaluation, which changes with social influence, and analyze the impact of such dynamics on the adoption of residential PV. A case study was conducted for villages in Beijing. Different scenarios about policies have been considered concerning both the economic benefits and the information diffusion on social network. The results show that: (1) Providing insurance against the damage of PV to adopters for free can improve the adoption rate from 24% up to 62% (full insurance), and the new adopter acquisition cost is only 36% of that of providing additional subsidy; (2) The enhancement of communications (e.g. Bulletin Board System (BBS) and Social Networking Services (SNS)) creates an obstacle to the residential PV adoption when the majority of households have insufficient knowledge about the PV system; and (3) Information campaigns and information screening are both effective and necessary in mitigating the negative effect from the enhancement of communications at the initial stage of the residential PV market.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahouseholds 3ainformation exchange 3ainsurance 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 3ascreening 3asocial networks 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asurveys 3asustainable technology 3avillages 3aChina 0aResidential PV adoption 0aInnovation diffusion 0aFree insurance 0aEnhancement of communications 0aSocial network 0aAgent-based modelling1 aZhang, Qi1 aLi, Yan1 aLi, Hailong0 tApplied energy.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 223 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245014300170300001800313500001500331520100800346592002801354650001901382650001601401650002601417650001701443650001801460650001601478650001801494650004401512650001601556650001201572650001801584650001301602650002501615650001601640653001601656653001601672700001701688700002001705700001601725700002001741700001801761773009201779856008601871852000901957655001201966IND4458814620221120073141.0141111e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445881462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFracassetti, D.10aQuantification of glutathione, catechin and caffeic acid in grape juice and wine by a novel ultra-performance liquid chromatography method  ap. 1136-1142.  a2019-12-06  aThis research aimed at the development and validation of an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method for the quantification of glutathione (GSH) in grape juice and in white wine after derivatisation with para-benzoquinone. The phenolic compounds catechin and caffeic acid that occur in white wine and have antioxidant effects, are also quantified in the same analysis. Catechin is the basic monomeric unit of grape and wine tannins and caffeic acid, when esterified with tartaric acid, plays a relevant role in Grape Reaction Product (GRP) formation. The analytical method proposed showed good linearity, repeatability and intermediate repeatability, as well as high recovery (>85%). It was applied for the quantification of GSH, catechin and caffeic acid in South African juices (12) and white wines (43). This novel method will have a large impact on the time and costs of the analyses for the wine industry through enabling rapid routine quantification of GSH, catechin and caffeic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3aglutathione 3aquantitative analysis 3acaffeic acid 3atartaric acid 3awine grapes 3acost analysis 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3agrape juice 3atannins 3awine industry 3acatechin 3aantioxidant activity 3awhite wines 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aLawrence, N.1 aTredoux, A.G.J.1 aTirelli, A.1 aNieuwoudt, H.H.1 aDu Toit, W.J.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 128, no. 4 p.1136-1142dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245006100163300001800224520152500242592002801767650002201795650001701817650001001834650001801844650001601862650001901878650001701897650001001914650002101924650001501945650002501960650001701985650002002002650001902022650002602041650001702067650001502084651000902099700001802108700001802126700001802144773013002162856007302292852000902365655001202374IND60515269220221122225821.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051526922DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.74892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdul, Qudeer Ahmed10aHealth benefit of fucosterol from marine algae: a review  ap. 1856-1866.  aSeaweeds belong to a group of marine plants known as algae, which are consumed as sea vegetables in several Asian countries. Recent studies have focused on the biological and pharmacological activities of seaweeds and their highly bioactive secondary metabolites because of their potential in the development of new pharmaceutical agents. Although several varieties of bioactive novel compounds such as phlorotannins, diterpenes and polysaccharides from seaweeds have already been well scrutinized, fucosterol as a phytosterol still needs to reinvent itself. Fucosterol (24‐ethylidene cholesterol) is a sterol that can be isolated from algae, seaweed and diatoms. Fucosterol exhibits various biological therapeutics, including anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antihyperlipidemic, antifungal, antihistaminic, anticholinergic, antiadipogenic, antiphotodamaging, anti‐osteoporotic, blood cholesterol reducing, blood vessel thrombosis preventive and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. In this review, we address some potential approaches for arbitrating novel fucosterol biologics in the medical field, focusing on the selection of personalized drug candidates and highlighting the challenges and opportunities regarding medical breakthroughs. We also highlight recent advances made in the design of this novel compound, as the significant health benefits from using these optimized applications apply to the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3ablood vessels 3acholesterol 3acholinesterase 3aditerpenoids 3adrugs 3afunctional foods 3amacroalgae 3amedicinal properties 3aphytosterols 3apolysaccharides 3asea vegetables 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 3athrombosis 3aAsia1 aChoi, Ran Joo1 aJung, Hyun Ah1 aChoi, Jae Sue0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Apr., v. 96, no. 6 p.1856-1866dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.74893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012100167300001400288520127800302592002801580650001501608650002001623650002401643650001901667650001601686650001101702650002101713650001501734650002001749650002301769650001601792650001901808653002701827653002601854653001801880653002301898653002001921700002101941700001701962773009601979856008602075852000902161655001202170IND60598445520221117094539.0180629e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirmiz, R.10aPerformance enhancement of solar absorption cooling systems using thermal energy storage with phase change materials  ap. 11-29.  aThermal energy storage has been shown to improve the efficiency of solar absorption cooling systems by capturing excess insolation during peak to meet cooling demand in low insolation periods. While water is the most commonly used thermal storage medium in solar cooling applications, the small operating temperature range of solar cooling systems limits its energy density. In contrast, Phase Change Materials maintain a high energy density under limited temperature ranges, and are ideally suited for such applications. Methods to select and size appropriate thermal storage technologies in solar cooling applications vary between studies with no standard methodology being utilized across the literature. Moreover, there is limited quantification of the influence of thermal storage on system performance to motivate the additional capital investment in these systems. This study provides an analytical framework to quantify the benefit of the thermal energy storage. Predictions from the analytical model are compared to the results from a validated transient system simulation. The paper gives an engineering approach for predicting the expected benefit from both water and phase change materials based thermal storage for applications with limited temperature ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acooling systems 3aeconomic investment 3aenergy density 3aengineering 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aprediction 3asolar radiation 3astorage technology 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aThermal energy storage 0aPhase change material 0aSolar cooling 0aAbsorption cooling 0aSystem modeling1 aLightstone, M.F.1 aCotton, J.S.0 tApplied energy.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 223 p.11-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245021600169500001900385520241200404592002802816650001802844650001602862650001702878650001902895650003102914650001902945650002002964650001002984700001802994700002803012700003603040700002903076773012103105856007903226852000903305655001203314IND60738710120221120212001.0210524e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073871012DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100503582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAragoneses, Javier 10aAssessment of the Tissue Response to Modification of the Surface of Dental Implants with Carboxyethylphosphonic Acid and Basic Fibroblastic Growth Factor Immobilization (Fgf-2): An Experimental Study on Minipigs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implant surface treatment with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and fibroblast growth factor 2 on the bone–implant interface during the osseointegration period in vivo using an animal model. The present research was carried out in six minipigs, in whose left tibia implants were inserted as follows: eight implants with a standard surface treatment, for the control group, and eight implants with a surface treatment of carboxyethylphosphonic acid and immobilization of FGF-2, for the test group. At 4 weeks after the insertion of the implants, the animals were sacrificed for the histomorphometric analysis of the samples. The means of the results for the implant–bone contact variable (BIC) were 46.39 ± 17.49% for the test group and 34.00 ± 9.92% for the control group; the difference was not statistically significant. For the corrected implant–bone contact variable (BICc), the mean value of the test group was 60.48 ± 18.11%, and that for the control group, 43.08 ± 10.77%; the difference was statistically significant (p-value = 0.035). The new bone formation (BV/TV) showed average results of 27.28 ± 3.88% for the test group and 26.63 ± 7.90% for the control group, meaning that the differences were not statistically significant (p-value = 0.839). Regarding the bone density at the interthread level (BAI/TA), the mean value of the test group was 32.27 ± 6.70%, and that of the control group was 32.91 ± 7.76%, with a p-value of 0.863, while for the peri-implant density (BAP/TA), the mean value of the test group was 44.96 ± 7.55%, and that for the control group was 44.80 ± 8.68%, without a significant difference between the groups. The current research only found a significant difference for the bone–implant contact at the cortical level; therefore, it could be considered that FGF-2 acts on the mineralization of bone tissue. The application of carboxyethylphosphonic acid on the surface of implants can be considered a promising alternative as a biomimetic coating for the immobilization of FGF-2. Despite no differences in the new bone formation around the implants or in the interthread or peri-implant bone density being detected, the biofunctionalization of the implant surface with FGF-2 accelerates the mineralization of the bone–implant interface at the cortical level, thereby reducing the osseointegration period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomimetics 3abone density 3abone formation 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3amineralization 3aminiature swine 3atibia1 aSuárez, Ana,1 aLópez-Valverde, Nansi 1 aMartínez Martínez, Francisco,1 aAragoneses, Juan  Manuel0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100503583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013600171520139500307592002801702650003001730650001501760650001601775650002101791650001201812650001301824650001401837650001201851653001801863653000901881653004201890653002101932653000901953653000901962653001001971653000901981700001901990700001502009700001402024700002002038700001702058773009802075856008702173852000902260655001202269IND60757209020221119090828.0220118e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075720902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1986212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuong, Hung Q.10aDifferential antibody responses in sows and finishing pigs naturally infected with African swine fever virus under field conditions  aAntibody profile of pigs naturally infected with a virulent African swine fever virus (ASFV) strain under field conditions was studied. Twenty-three serum samples were collected from pigs surviving a natural ASFV infection: 17 samples from finishing pigs (∼7 months old) and 6 samples from sows (between 12 and 36 months old). Additionally, 24 serum samples were collected from ASFV-naïve pigs to serve as negative controls. All sera from ASFV-surviving pigs tested positive while all sera from control pigs tested negative by two different commercial ELISA kits. Antibody reactivity of each serum sample was simultaneously measured against six selected ASFV antigens including p12, p32, p54, pp62, C-type lectin and CD2v. All ASFV-surviving pigs had antibody against p32, p54 and pp62 while 91.3% surviving pigs had antibody against p12. Only small portions of ASFV-surviving pigs exhibited antibodies against C-type lectin (34.8%) and CD2v (26.1%). While antibodies against p12, p32, p54 and pp62 were similarly detected in both finishing pigs and sows, antibodies against C-type lectin and CD2v were mainly detected in sows but not in finishing pigs. These results suggest a differential humoral immune response to ASFV infection in sows and finishing pigs. Further studies are needed to better understand the nature of immune responses to ASFV infection in different pig populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3ahumoral immunity 3alectins 3aresearch 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aSwine viruses 0aASFV 0aLuciferase-immunoprecipitation system 0aAntibody profile 0aASFV 0aLIPS 0aELISA 0aNluc1 aLai, Huong TL.1 aDo, Luc D.1 aHa, Bo X.1 aNguyen, Giap V.1 aVu, Hiep LX.0 tVirus research.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 307 p.198621-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1986213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002400197245010400221300001400325506007600339520109400415592002801509506003701537650002401574650002601598650002801624650001601652650001401668650001601682650002501698650002901723650001801752650001101770653001801781653002501799653001401824653001401838653001401852700003001866700002101896700002501917773007501942856009002017852000902107655001202116IND60563810820221207111108.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056381082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0132doi7 aPMC54445432pmcid7 a282315082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahadik, Bhushan P.10aRegulating dynamic signaling between hematopoietic stem cells and niche cells via a hydrogel matrix  ap. 54-64.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside in unique bone marrow niches and are influenced by signals from surrounding cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM-bound or diffusible biomolecules. Here we describe the use of a three-dimensional hydrogel to alter the balance of HSC-generated autocrine feedback and paracrine signals generated by co-cultured niche-associated cells. We report shifts in HSC proliferation rate and fate specification in the presence of lineage positive (Lin+) niche cells. Hydrogels promoting autocrine feedback enhanced expansion of early hematopoietic progenitors while paracrine signals from Lin+ cells increased myeloid differentiation. We report thresholds where autocrine vs. paracrine cues alter HSC fate transitions, and were able to selectively abrogate the effects of matrix diffusivity and niche cell co-culture via the use of inhibitory cocktails of autocrine or paracrine signals. Together, these results suggest diffusive biotransport in three-dimensional biomaterials are a critical design element for the development of a synthetic stem cell niche.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautocrine signaling 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocompatible materials 3abone marrow 3acoculture 3adiffusivity 3aextracellular matrix 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahydrocolloids 3aniches 0aHematopoietic 0aHydrogel diffusivity 0aAutocrine 0aParacrine 0aSignaling1 aBharadwaj, Narayanan A.K.1 aEwoldt, Randy H.1 aHarley, Brendan A.C.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 May, v. 125 p.54-64dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013500165500001900300520184100319592002802160650002302188650001602211650001102227650001902238650003002257650001502287650001802302650002102320650001002341651001102351651002202362651002502384651001002409651002802419700002002447773012002467856007902587852000902666655001202675IND60738710220221120202503.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073871022DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100504482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Omar,10aAll That Glitters Is Not Gold: The Other Insects That Fall into the Asian Yellow-Legged Hornet Vespa velutina ‘Specific’ Traps  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe introduction of invasive species is considered one of the major threats to the biodiversity conservation worldwide. In recent years, an Asian invasive species of wasp has set off alarms in Europe and elsewhere in the world, Vespa velutina. The Asian wasp was accidentally introduced in France around 2004 and shortly thereafter it was able to colonise practically all of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula. The ecological and economic implications of V. velutina invasion and its high colonisation ability have triggered widespread trapping campaigns, usually supported by beekeepers and local governments, with the aim of diminishing its population and its negative impacts. Among the most used control methods are the capture traps, which use a sugary attractant to catch the invasive wasps. However, the species-specific selectivity and efficiency of these traps has been little studied. In this paper, we have analysed the specific identity of the unintentionally trapped insect species from northern Spain (covering one-year period), as well as we have assessed the provided ecosystem services by them. A total of 74 non-target taxa of insects were caught by the V. velutina studied traps, most of them correspond to the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, the dipterans being the most abundant group. Surprisingly, the most abundant trapped species was the invasive fly, Drosophila suzukii that represented the 36.07% of the total catches. Furthermore, we reported the first record of ectoparasitic mites of the genus Varroa on V. velutina, constituting a newly recorded symbiotic association. Hopefully, the provided information helps to develop new protocols and management tools to control this invasive species in the Iberian Peninsula and other temperate areas of western Europe and the Mediterranean basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aLepidoptera 3aVarroa 3aVespa velutina 3abiodiversity conservation 3aecosystems 3aectoparasites 3ainvasive species 3awasps 3aFrance 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 3aWestern European region1 aArias, Andrés,0 tBiology.g2021 May 20, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100504483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245011700215300001800332506007600350520153800426592002801964506003701992650003102029650003502060650001902095650001302114650001702127650002002144650000902164650002102173650001402194650001302208650002502221650001802246650001902264650001602283650002202299653002002321653002002341653001802361653002302379700002102402700002302423700002302446700001902469700001902488700002002507700002402527773009902551856008602650852000902736655001202745IND60581639820221207051826.0190319e20161104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058163982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.09.0132doi7 aPMC50809812pmcid7 a276700722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolechek, Susan A.10aRetinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 as a molecular adjuvant for enhancement of mucosal immunity during DNA vaccination  ap. 5629-5635.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn order for vaccines to induce efficacious immune responses against mucosally transmitted pathogens, such as HIV-1, activated lymphocytes must efficiently migrate to and enter targeted mucosal sites. We have previously shown that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can be used as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance mucosal CD8+ T cell responses during vaccination and improve protection against mucosal viral challenge. However, the ATRA formulation is incompatible with most recombinant vaccines, and the teratogenic potential of ATRA at high doses limits its usage in many clinical settings. We hypothesized that increasing in vivo production of retinoic acid (RA) during vaccination with a DNA vector expressing retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in RA biosynthesis, could similarly provide enhanced programming of mucosal homing to T cell responses while avoiding teratogenic effects. Administration of a RALDH2- expressing plasmid during immunization with a HIVgag DNA vaccine resulted in increased systemic and mucosal CD8+ T cell numbers with an increase in both effector and central memory T cells. Moreover, mice that received RALDH2 plasmid during DNA vaccination were more resistant to intravaginal challenge with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same HIVgag antigen (VACVgag). Thus, RALDH2 can be used as an alternative adjuvant to ATRA during DNA vaccination leading to an increase in both systemic and mucosal T cell immunity and better protection from viral infection at mucosal sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aVaccinia virus 3aantigens 3abiosynthesis 3aimmune response 3amice 3amucosal immunity 3apathogens 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3aretinoic acid 3ateratogenicity 3avaccination 3avaccine adjuvants 0aRALDH2 adjuvant 0aHIV DNA vaccine 0aRetinoic acid 0aMucosal protection1 aMcAfee, Megan S.1 aNieves, Lizbeth M.1 aGuzman, Vanessa P.1 aManhas, Kavita1 aFouts, Timothy1 aBagley, Kenneth1 aBlattman, Joseph N.0 tVaccine.g2016 Nov. 04, v. 34, no. 46 p.5629-5635dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245005400155300001600209500001900225520056400244592002800808650001800836650001800854650001800872650001600890650001200906650001600918650001400934650001300948653001500961653001900976653001800995653001301013700002101026700001701047700002001064700002001084773013601104856007401240852000901314655001201323IND60691739020221118104852.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173902DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.9172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudo, Yuko10aPeculiar Archaea Found in Japanese Paddy Soils†  ap. 917-920.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aArchaeal 16S rDNA clones retrieved from paddy soil DNA were sequenced.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the tissue-level spatial distribution of metal(loids) in corn seeds (Zea mays, L.) from contaminated corn fields near the Xikuangshan (XKS) antimony mine in Hunan, China, and compared them with corn (Zea mays everta L., popcorn) grown in a farm in Amherst, MA that practices sustainable farming as a control. How toxic and essential metals translocate through the roots and shoots during early stages of germination was also investigated. The cleaned corn seed samples were mounted in resin blocks and longitudinally dissected into thin sections. The laser ablation parameters were optimized, and the instrument was calibrated using tomato leaf standard reference material (NIST SRM 1573a) in a pellet form. Tissue level distributions of metal(loid)s As, Cd, Hg, Sb and Zn in corn seeds collected were determined using (LA-ICP-MS). Seeds from the control farm were germinated and their roots and shoots were analyzed to determine tissue level concentrations and their spatial distributions. It was found that seeds from the XKS mine region in China had higher overall concentration of all elements analyzed due to metal(loids) absorbed from contaminated mine soils. Metal(loids) concentrations were highest in the embryo (∼360 mg/kg) and pericarp (∼0.48 mg/kg) compared with the endosperm of corn seeds. Essential element Zn was found in the embryo and emerging coleoptile and radicle. Finally, in both roots and shoots, element concentrations were highest proximally to the tip cap compared to distal concentrations and later translocated to distal tissue regions. This study offers unique insights of metal(loid) bioaccumulation and translocation in corn and thus is better able to track metal(loids) contaminants trafficking in our food systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3apericarp 3aroots 3asustainable agriculture 3ashoots 3atomatoes 3acoleoptiles 3afarms 3acadmium 3aleaves 3aZea mays 3agermination 3abioaccumulation 3aarsenic 3atoxicity 3apopcorn 3amercury 3azinc 3amined soils 3aendosperm 3acrops 3aChina 0aCorn seed 0aGermination 0aMetal(loids) 0aLA-ICP-MS 0aTissue level elemental distributions1 aAmarasiriwardena, Dulasiri1 aAlexander, David1 aWu, Fengchang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Sept., v. 252 p.657-665dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.05.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010600166520131800272592002801590650002101618650003001639650001901669650001001688650001301698650001701711650001001728650001701738650001401755650001301769650001501782650001101797650001401808650001201822653001601834653003001850653002901880653001201909653002701921700001501948700001401963773009801977856008702075852000902162655001202171IND60757209220221119090747.0220103e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075720922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1986302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Long10aGenomic and biological characteristics of an alphabaculovirus isolated from Trabala vishnou gigantina  aThe oak lappet moth, Trabala vishnou gigantina is a forest insect pest that damages broad-leaf trees severely. Trabala vishnou gigantina nucleopolyhedrovirus (TrviNPV) has been isolated from a naturally infected T. vishnou gigantina larva and investigated for its biology and the potential to be a biological control agent against its insect host. TrviNPV was characterized by electron microscope of occlusion bodies (OBs), genomic sequencing and field control efficacy. TrviNPV OBs exhibited an irregular polyhedral shape varying in size from 0.99 to 3.99 μm with multiple nucleocapsids per virion. The genome of this virus was 165 657 bp in length with 40.33% GC content and encoded 146 putative ORFs including the 38 baculovirus core genes. TrviNPV is a group II alphabaculovirus that encodes F protein and lacks the gp64 gene specific to group I alphabaculoviruses. Phylogeny and Kimura-2 parameter analysis revealed TrviNPV to be a novel species and closest to ArdiNPV, EupsNPV and OrleNPV. Bioassays and field trials in a shrubland revealed that TrviNPV was virulent and effective to control T. vishnou gigantina in arid semi-desert region. This work firstly reported the whole genome of TrviNPV as well as its biological characters for a possibility to develop this virus as bio-pesticide in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlphabaculovirus 3abiological control agents 3aforest insects 3agenes 3agenomics 3ainsect pests 3amoths 3anucleocapsid 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3ashrublands 3avirion 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aBaculovirus 0aTrabala vishnou gigantina 0aComplete genome sequence 0aTrviNPV 0aField control efficacy1 aYou, Huan,1 aWang, Dun0 tVirus research.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 308 p.198630-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1986303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001600191245005300207300001400260500001900274506007600293520130100369592002801670506003701698650002401735650002701759650004901786650002601835650002001861650002101881650001101902650001301913650001501926650003101941650001601972650001201988653000902000653001602009653001702025653001102042653002002053700002302073700001902096700002202115773008802137856008502225852000902310655001202319IND60560720020221207071044.0200607e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056072002DNAL7 a286164972pmid7 aPMC54541722pmcid7 a10.1016/j.onehlt.2016.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidagdo, W.10aMERS-coronavirus: From discovery to intervention  ap. 11-16.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) still causes outbreaks despite public awareness and implementation of health care measures, such as rapid viral diagnosis and patient quarantine. Here we describe the current epidemiological picture of MERS-CoV, focusing on humans and animals affected by this virus and propose specific intervention strategies that would be appropriate to control MERS-CoV. One-third of MERS-CoV patients develop severe lower respiratory tract infection and succumb to a fatal outcome; these patients would require effective therapeutic antiviral therapy. Because of the lack of such intervention strategies, supportive care is the best that can be offered at the moment. Limiting viral spread from symptomatic human cases to health care workers and family members, on the other hand, could be achieved through prophylactic administration of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. To ultimately prevent spread of the virus into the human population, however, vaccination of dromedary camels – currently the only confirmed animal host for MERS-CoV – may be the best option to achieve a sustained drop in human MERS cases in time. In the end, a One Health approach combining all these different efforts is needed to tackle this zoonotic outbreak.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aCoronavirus infections 3aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aOne Health initiative 3ahealth services 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3apatients 3aquarantine 3arespiratory tract diseases 3avaccination 3aviruses 0aMERS 0aCoronavirus 0aIntervention 0aReview 0aDromedary camel1 aOkba, Nisreen M.A.1 aStalin Raj, V.1 aHaagmans, Bart L.0 tOne health.g2017 June, v. 3 p.11-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23485x2352-77147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2016.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245010700172500001900279520102600298592002801324650001501352650002301367650001301390650002501403650001701428700002101445700002001466773012101486856007901607852000901686655001201695IND60738710420221120222550.0210524e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073871042DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100503592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiferri, Maria  Chiara10aExtracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Tools: From Pre-Clinical to Clinical Applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are ubiquitous masters of intercellular communication, being detectable in tissues, circulation, and body fluids. Their complex cargo reflects the (patho)physiologic status of the cells from which they originate. Due to these properties, the potential of EVs, and in particular exosomes, to serve as biomarkers or therapeutics has grown exponentially over the past decade. On one side, numerous studies have demonstrated that EV-associated nucleic acids and proteins are implicated in cancer progression, as well as neurodegenerative, infectious, and autoimmune disorders. On the other, the therapeutic use of EVs secreted by various cell types, and in particular stem/progenitor cells, present significant advantages in comparison to the corresponding parental cells, such as the less complex production and storage conditions. In this review, we examine some of the major pre-clinical studies dealing with EVs and exosomes, that led to the development of numerous completed clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acell communication 3aexosomes 3aneoplasm progression 3atherapeutics1 aQuarto, Rodolfo 1 aTasso, Roberta 0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100503593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007200162300001600234500001900250520082100269592002801090650001801118650002801136650001801164650001801182650002301200650001601223650001801239650000901257650001101266650002901277653001901306653001701325653003701342653005401379700002101433700002401454773013601478856007401614852000901688655001201697IND60691739220221118104857.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173922DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.9242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Yoshinobu10aOccurrence of Free N-Glycans in Pea (Pisum sativum, L) Seedlings†  ap. 924-926.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFree N-glycans have been found in pea seedlings.

These structures of pyridylaminated free N-glycans were analyzed by exomannosidase digestions and ion- spray tandem mass spectrometry. The structural analyses showed that the several oligomannose-type sugar chains having one GlcNAc residue at the reducing-end side occur in the seedlings, suggesting the endo-β-N-acetylgIucosaminidase PS [Y. Kimura et al., Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 60, 228–232 (1996)] should be involved in the release of oligomannose-type N-glycans from the storage glycoproteins [Y. Kimura et al., Biosci. Biotech.

Here, we present a long-term (1936–2005) yearling Hereford steer dataset collected at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NPGRL) near Mandan, ND, USA. Data were analyzed using weighted AICc model averaging to examine the effects of spring (April–June) and summer (July–September) temperature and precipitation, as well as prior growing season (prior April–September) and prior fall/winter (prior October–March) precipitation on cattle production (kg/ha) under light (37.4±5.3SD Animal Unit Days [AUD]/ha across all study years) and heavy (91.6±22.2SD AUD/ha) stocking rates. Because Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) invaded the grassland at NPGRL in the early 1980s, we modeled cattle production separately for pre- (1936–1983) and post-invasion (1986–2005) years to determine if the plant community shift influenced sensitivity to seasonal weather patterns. Cattle production under heavy stocking was more sensitive to seasonal weather variability than under light stocking during both pre- and post-invasion years. Interestingly, the magnitude and robustness of coefficients changed between the pre- and post-invasion years, with seasonal weather patterns explaining more cattle production variation during the post-invasion years. Though cattle sensitivity to seasonal weather patterns differed between light and heavy stocking for both pre- and post-invasion years, invasion status did change cattle response to weather. For example, cattle production in P. pratensis invaded pastures was more heavily influenced by cool, wet springs and wet prior grazing seasons than was production in un-invaded pastures. For cattle stocked heavily in native pastures, wet winters more strongly increased cattle production than in invaded pastures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aHereford 3aPoa pratensis 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aautumn 3abeef cattle 3acattle production 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata analysis 3adata collection 3aecological invasion 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3amodels 3apastures 3aplant communities 3arangelands 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asteers 3astocking rate 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweight gain 3awet environmental conditions 3awinter 3ayearlings 3aGreat Plains region 3aNorth Dakota 0aClimate variability 0aDecision support tools 0aGrazing management 0aModel averaging 0aNorthern mixed-grass prairie 0aSemiarid rangeland 0aLong-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR)1 aDerner, Justin D.1 aSanderson, Matt A.1 aHendrickson, John R.1 aKronberg, Scott L.1 aPetersen, Mark K.1 aVermeire, Lance T.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 183 p.110-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0303Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Reeves%20et%20al.%202013%20AGEE.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006500204300001600269520113600285592002801421653001601449653000801465653001101473653001401484653001001498653001001508653000801518653000801526653000701534773012101541856008201662852000901744655001201753IND60560720120221122054412.0170401e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056072012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ngib.2016.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xunpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9653-739510aDevelopment of Europe's gas hubs: Implications for East Asia  ap. 357-366.  aGas trading hubs have been initially developed in the US in 1980s, UK in 1990s, more recently in European in the 2000s and mulled in East Asia now. Due to its freshness and diversification in nationality, governance and culture, the European hub experience can offer valuable lessons for East Asia. This paper seeks to advance understanding of gas hub development in Europe and provide lessons for East Asia. The European experience highlights that market liberalization and transition of gas pricing mechanism are necessary in creating the competitive markets that are needed for functional gas hubs. Political will and regulations further safeguard the competition environment needed for hub development. Natural factors, such as significant domestic production and culture could have a significant impact on the hub development and transition of pricing mechanism. In East Asia, the path to gas trading hubs might be more difficult than in Europe but a growing market creates an opportunity to start new terms with new contracts. Nevertheless, East Asian needs to work hard to development its indigenous gas or LNG trading hubs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNatural gas 0aHub 0aEurope 0aEast Asia 0aChina 0aJapan 0aQ41 0aQ48 0aL10 tNatural Gas Industry B.g2016 Oct., v. 3 p.357-366dElsevier B.V.aSichuan Petroleum Administrationx2352-85407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ngib.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245010400163300001800267520170500285592002801990650001602018650002302034650001202057650000902069650001802078650001002096700002102106700002202127773010302149856008102252852000902333655001202342IND4473311320221120090228.0120423e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447331132DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/arr1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillis, Pamela M.10aEncounter rates with conspecific males influence female mate choice in a naturally hybridizing fish  ap. 1234-1240.  aMate choice can vary in response to internal or external conditions that alter the costs and benefits of being choosy. The relationship between mate choice and hybridization, however, is not well understood. An important influence on mate choice is the rate at which potential mates are encountered: low rates increase sampling costs, favoring reduced choosiness. We investigated the influence of conspecific encounter rate on female choice in a naturally hybridizing species of swordtail, Xiphophorus birchmanni. We exposed females to conspecific males, followed by either no delay or a long (24 h) delay before their next male encounter. In this second encounter, females were offered the choice of a heterospecific (X. malinche) male only or a choice between a conspecific and heterospecific male. When not given a choice between 2 males, females spent more time with the heterospecific following a long delay between male encounters than after no delay, suggesting a decrease in choosiness. When offered a choice between males, however, females preferentially associated with the conspecific, regardless of the time between male encounters. These results suggest that females are sensitive to conspecific encounter rate but may employ a sample-based (vs. standard-based) comparison tactic, which could make hybridization less likely. We also found that, contrary to our expectations, females with only the heterospecific male to choose from visited him more frequently following a long delay between male encounters than following no delay, possibly indicating an increase in sampling effort. Our study highlights the potential importance of context-dependent mate choice in animal hybridization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXiphophorus 3aanimal preferences 3afemales 3afish 3ahybridization 3amales1 aRyan, Michael J.1 aRosenthal, Gil G.0 tBehavioral ecology.g2011 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.1234-1240dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr1193Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001600292520167000308592002801978650001502006650001202021650001002033650001302043650003002056650001102086651001002097700002502107700002002132700001902152700002302171700002102194773010702215856008202322852000902404655001202413IND60088639120180622000000.0141102e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008863912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, Clara10aIdentification of Malassezia species isolated from patients with extensive forms of pityriasis versicolor in Siena, Italy  ap. 231-234.  aBACKGROUND: Pityriasis versicolor (PV) is an infection caused by various species of Malassezia yeast. There is no agreement in the literature concerning the species of Malassezia and the demographic, clinical, and mycological data. AIMS: To prospectively identify Malassezia species isolated from lesions of patients with extensive, long standing and recurrent forms of PV and to estimate the relationship between Malassezia species and the demographic and clinical data of the patients. METHODS: All patients with PV were enrolled over a four-year period. Malassezia species were isolated in cultures and identified by morphological features and physiological tests. In the last 2 years a PCR-based technique was used to confirm the species’ identification. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients (43 males and 31 females, mean age 39.5 years) were enrolled. Only one species was isolated in 45 patients, and more than one species were identified in the remaining 28 patients (38%). M. globosa was the most frequently isolated (60.3%) species. There was a significant association between the isolation of 2 or more species and the presence of at least one predisposing factor. In the last 29 cases, which were subjected to PCR, there were no differences in the identification of isolated species as compared to traditional methods. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of more than one species in a single lesion is not infrequent in PV and is related to the presence of one predisposing factor. The isolated species isolated were not influenced by demographic and clinical features. The traditional and more recent (PCR) procedures gave the same results in the isolated species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalassezia 3afemales 3amales 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ayeasts 3aItaly1 aMancianti, Francesca1 aNardoni, Simona1 aAriti, Gaetano1 aCaposciutti, Paola1 aFimiani, Michele0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2013 , v. 30, no. 4 p.231-234dElsevier Espanax1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04647naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001700186245014500203300001100348506007600359520242300435592002802858506003702886650001302923650001302936650002102949650001302970650001802983650001003001650001503011650001103026650001503037650002303052650001003075650002103085650002303106650000903129650001803138650001203156650001503168650002103183650001603204650002803220650001303248650001103261650002003272650001103292650002403303650001503327650000903342650001503351650002303366650001503389650002103404650002403425650001803449650001603467650001303483650001703496651001803513651001803531700002103549700002303570700002003593700001703613773015903630856007903789852000903868655001203877IND50067592620221207123912.0160319e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006759262DNAL7 aPMC36938662pmcid7 a238001332pmid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-10-792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepp, Andrew14aThe relationship between cell phone use, physical and sedentary activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness in a sample of U.S. college students  ap. 79.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Today’s cell phones increase opportunities for activities traditionally defined as sedentary behaviors (e.g., surfing the internet, playing video games). People who participate in large amounts of sedentary behaviors, relative to those who do not, tend to be less physically active, less physically fit, and at greater risk for health problems. However, cell phone use does not have to be a sedentary behavior as these devices are portable. It can occur while standing or during mild-to-moderate intensity physical activity. Thus, the relationship between cell phone use, physical and sedentary activity, and physical fitness is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate these relationships among a sample of healthy college students. METHODS: Participants were first interviewed about their physical activity behavior and cell phone use. Then body composition was assessed and the validated self-efficacy survey for exercise behaviors completed. This was followed by a progressive exercise test on a treadmill to exhaustion. Peak oxygen consumption (VO₂ peak) during exercise was used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Hierarchical regression was used to assess the relationship between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness after controlling for sex, self-efficacy, and percent body fat. Interview data was transcribed, coded, and Chi-square analysis was used to compare the responses of low and high frequency cell phone users. RESULTS: Cell phone use was significantly (p = 0.047) and negatively (β = −0.25) related to cardio respiratory fitness independent of sex, self-efficacy, and percent fat which were also significant predictors (p < 0.05). Interview data offered several possible explanations for this relationship. First, high frequency users were more likely than low frequency users to report forgoing opportunities for physical activity in order to use their cell phones for sedentary behaviors. Second, low frequency users were more likely to report being connected to active peer groups through their cell phones and to cite this as a motivation for physical activity. Third, high levels of cell phone use indicated a broader pattern of sedentary behaviors apart from cell phone use, such as watching television. CONCLUSION: Cell phone use, like traditional sedentary behaviors, may disrupt physical activity and reduce cardiorespiratory fitness.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3abody fat 3acollege students 3aexercise 3aexercise test 3agames 3ainterviews 3alipids 3amotivation 3aoxygen consumption 3apeers 3aphysical fitness 3aportable equipment 3arisk 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3atelevision 2aBody Composition 2aCell Phone. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMotivation 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPeer Group 2aPhysical Fitness 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aSelf Efficacy 2aSex Factors 2aStudents 2aUniversities 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aBarkley, Jacob E1 aSanders, Gabriel J1 aRebold, Michael1 aGates, Peter0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.79-79dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-10-793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324520196900340592002802309650002602337650001402363650001402377650001302391650001002404650001202414650001102426650001402437650001302451650001102464650001302475650000902488650001502497650001402512650001002526650002002536650002002556650002302576650001602599650001202615650001802627653001402645653000802659653002102667653001602688653001902704653003202723700002302755700001802778700002302796700001902819700002202838773011302860856008602973852000903059655001203068IND60611552320221122190536.0201209e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061155232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrahl, Stephanie10aTowards more sustainable meat alternatives: How technical parameters affect the sensory properties of extrusion products derived from soy and algae  ap. 962-971.  aHigh moisture extrusion cooking is a well-established method to develop soy-based meat alternatives. Algae are increasingly researched into as an alternative protein source, particularly the micro-algae spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is known for its high protein content. However, little is known how spirulina behaves during the extrusion process. This study investigates the sensory properties of spirulina (10%, 30% or 50%) and soy-based meat alternatives (16 samples) produced according to a Design of Experiment (DoE) with different levels of moisture (57%, 67% or 77%), screw speed (600 rpm, 900 rpm or 1200 rpm), temperature (140 °C, 160 °C or 180 °C) and two production days (independent replicates). Conventional profiling by a trained sensory panel (n = 12) based on a product-specific vocabulary was carried out and the samples were also subjected to instrumental texture profile analysis (TPA) and razor shear measurement (MORS). The data revealed that high spirulina content caused a black color, an intense flavor with earthy notes and an algae odor that is rather musty. Additionally, the higher the share of spirulina, the lower were the elasticity, fibrousness and firmness of extruded samples. High moisture content resulted in products evoking a juicy and soft mouthfeel plus a moist appearance. Instrumentally measured texture parameters matched with the sensory profile regarding texture: high moisture induces a decrease in shear force, shear energy, hardness, cohesion, springiness and chewiness. Particularly firmness perceived by the panel correlates with both MORS and TPA measurements while sensory elasticity correlates with springiness. When keeping moisture low, but screw speed and temperature high during extrusion, it is possible to partly substitute soy with spirulina in order to produce firm and fibrous products with a decent algae flavor that will contribute to shape a more sustainable future for food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aSpirulina 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acolor 3acooking 3aenergy 3aextrusion 3afirmness 3aflavor 3ahardness 3ameat 3amicroalgae 3amouthfeel 3aodors 3aprotein content 3aprotein sources 3asensory evaluation 3atemperature 3atexture 3awater content 0aSpirulina 0aSoy 0aSensory analysis 0aShear force 0aSustainability 0aAlternative protein sources1 aPalanisamy, Megala1 aStrack, Micha1 aMeier-Dinkel, Lisa1 aToepfl, Stefan1 aMörlein, Daniel,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 198 p.962-971dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008800171300001600259520098800275592002801263650002101291650002001312650001101332650002401343650001401367650002201381650002601403650001701429650001701446650001501463650002201478650002301500650001201523700002201535700002501557700002401582773011301606856008501719852000901804655001201813IND60599891420221122090812.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059989142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotton, Timothy14aThe case for transmissible antivirals to control population-wide infectious disease  ap. 400-405.  aInfectious disease control faces significant challenges including: how to therapeutically target the highest-risk populations, circumvent behavioral barriers, and overcome pathogen persistence and resistance mechanisms. We review a recently proposed solution to overcome these challenges: antivirals that transmit by ‘piggybacking’ on viral replication. These proposed antivirals, termed ‘therapeutic interfering particles’ (TIPs), are engineered molecular parasites of viruses that are designed to steal replication resources from the wild type virus. Depriving viruses of crucial replication machinery, TIPs would reduce viral loads. As obligate parasites, TIPs would transmit via the same risk factors and transmission routes as wild type viruses, automatically reaching high-risk populations, and thereby substantially limiting viral transmission even in resource-poor settings. Design issues and ethical/safety considerations of this proposed intervention are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantiviral agents 3adisease control 3aethics 3ainfectious diseases 3aparasites 3apathogen survival 3aresistance mechanisms 3arisk factors 3atherapeutics 3aviral load 3avirus replication 3avirus transmission 3aviruses1 aSardanyés, Josep1 aWeinberger, Ariel D.1 aWeinberger, Leor S.0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2014 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.400-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010200173300001600275520229400291592002802585650001302613650001902626650002902645650002302674650001702697650001002714650002102724650001202745650001902757650001902776650001902795650001702814650001602831700002202847700001902869700002602888773010002914856008503014990002303099852000903122655001203131IND60099940420150408000000.0141105e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009994042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvam, Parthiban10aReverse aqueous microemulsions in hydrofluoroalkane propellants and their aerosol characteristics  ap. 428-435.  aIn this work we describe the structure and environment of reverse aqueous microemulsions formed in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA134a) propellant in the presence of a non-ionic ethoxylated copolymer, and the aerosol characteristics of the corresponding pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulations. The activity of selected polypropylene oxide–polyethylene oxide–polypropylene oxide (POₘEOₙPOₘ) amphiphiles at the HFA134a–water interface was studied using in situ high-pressure tensiometry, and those results were used as a guide in the selection of the most appropriate candidate surfactant for the formation of microemulsions in the compressed HFA134a. The environment and structure of the aggregates formed with the selected surfactant candidate, PO₂₂EO₁₄PO₂₂, was probed via UV–vis spectroscopy (molecular probe), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS), respectively. High water loading capacity in the core of the nanoaggregates was achieved in the presence of ethanol. At a water-to-surfactant molar ratio of 21 and 10% ethanol, cylindrical aggregates with a radius of 18Å, and length of 254Å were confirmed with SANS. Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI) results reveal that the concentration of the excipients (Cₑₓₚ, including surfactant, water and ethanol) has a strong effect on the aerosol characteristics of the formulations, including the respirable fraction, and the mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), and that the trend in MMAD can be predicted as a function of the Cₑₓₚ following similar correlations to those proposed to common non-volatile excipients, indicating that the nanodroplets of water dispersed in the propellant behave similarly to molecularly solubilized compounds. Cytotoxicity studies of PO₂₂EO₁₄PO₂₂ were performed in A549 cells, an alveolar type II epithelial cell line, and indicate that, within the concentration range of interest, the surfactant in question decreases cell viability only lightly. The relevance of this work stems from the fact that aqueous-based HFA-pMDIs are expected to be versatile formulations, with the ability to carry a range of medically relevant hydrophilic compounds within the nanocontainers, including high potency drugs, drug combinations and biomacromolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acell viability 3acombination drug therapy 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aepithelial cells 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3apolypropylenes 3asolubilization 3aspectroscopy 3asurfactants1 aBharatwaj, Balaji1 aPorcar, Lionel1 ada Rocha, Sandro R.P.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 422, no. 1-2 p.428-435dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010800168500001900276520168500295592002801980650001102008650001402019650001402033650002302047650001302070650001402083650001602097650002402113700002802137700002002165700002002185700002402205700002002229700002202249700002102271700002102292700002402313700002202337700001802359700002002377700002502397700002102422700002402443773012102467856007902588852000902667655001202676IND60738710820221120222515.0210524e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073871082DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100503632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasolato, Silvano 10aLow P66shc with High SerpinB3 Levels Favors Necroptosis and Better Survival in Hepatocellular Carcinoma  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCell proliferation and escape from apoptosis are important pathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the tumors with the highest mortality rate worldwide. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of the pro-apoptotic p66shc and the anti-apoptotic SerpinB3 in HCCs in relation to clinical outcome, cell fate and tumor growth. p66shc and SerpinB3 were evaluated in 67 HCC specimens and the results were correlated with overall survival. Proliferation and cell death markers were analyzed in hepatoma cells overexpressing SerpinB3, under different stress conditions. p66shc⁻/⁻ mice and xenograft models were also used to assess the effects of p66shc and SerpinB3 on tumor growth. In patients with HCC, the best survival was observed in the subgroup with p66shc levels below median values and SerpinB3 levels above median values. Mice p66shc⁻/⁻ showed high levels of SerpinB3, while in HepG2 cells overexpressing SerpinB3, p66shc expression was trivial. HepG2 overexpressing SerpinB3 cells were more prone to die after oxidizing treatments, such as diamide or high concentration H₂O₂. These cells injected in nude mice developed tumors five times smaller than those from control HepG2 cells. Tumors originating from HepG2 overexpressing SerpinB3 cells showed decreased activated Caspase-8, with concomitant increase of RIP3K and decreased levels of cleaved RIP3K, typical features of necroptosis. In conclusion, in patients affected by HCC, the pattern characterized by p66shc downregulation and elevated SerpinB3 levels was associated with markedly better survival. This pattern favored necroptosis in experimental high-stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-8 3acell proliferation 3ahepatoma 3amortality 3anecroptosis 3axenotransplantation1 aRuvoletto, Mariagrazia 1 aNardo, Giorgia 1 aRasola, Andrea 1 aSciacovelli, Marco 1 aZanus, Giacomo 1 aTurato, Cristian 1 aQuarta, Santina 1 aTerrin, Liliana 1 aFadini, Gian  Paolo1 aCeolotto, Giulio 1 aGuido, Maria 1 aCillo, Umberto 1 aIndraccolo, Stefano 1 aBernardi, Paolo 1 aPontisso, Patrizia 0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100503633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245011300213300001400326520129700340592002801637653002901665653002801694653002301722653003401745653002401779700002101803700002001824773009801844856008401942852000902026655001202035IND60530844020221120025822.0161026e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053084402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.synbio.2016.01.0062doi7 aPMC56405942pmcid7 a290629272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnrean, Pornkamol10aSystematic development of biomass overproducing Scheffersomyces stipitis for high-cell-density fermentations  ap. 47-55.  aThe development of economically feasible bio-based process requires efficient cell factories capable of producing the desired product at high titer under high-cell-density fermentation. Herein we present a combinatorial approach based on systems metabolic engineering and metabolic evolution for the development of efficient biomass-producing strain. Systems metabolic engineering guided by flux balance analysis (FBA) was first employed to rationally design mutant strains of Scheffersomyces stipitis with high biomass yield. By experimentally implementing these mutations, the biomass yield was improved by 30% in GPD1, 25% in TKL1, 30% in CIT1, and 44% in ZWF1 overexpressed mutants compared to wild-type. These designed mutants were further fine-tuned through metabolic evolution resulting in the maximal biomass yield of 0.49 g-cdw/g-glucose, which matches well with predicted yield phenotype. The constructed mutants are beneficial for biotechnology applications dealing with high cell titer cultivations. This work demonstrates a solid confirmation of systems metabolic engineering in combination with metabolic evolution approach for efficient strain development, which could assist in rapid optimization of cell factory for an economically viable and sustainable bio-based process.  aPublisher supplied data 0aScheffersomyces stipites 0aEfficient strain design 0aBiomass production 0aSystems metabolic engineering 0aMetabolic evolution1 aJeennor, Sukanya1 aLaoteng, Kobkul0 tSynthetic and Systems Biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 1 p.47-55dElsevier B.V.x2405-805X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2016.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010500174300001600279520161300295592002801908650002501936650002301961650002301984650002502007650003002032650001202062650002502074650001402099650002302113650001602136650001202152653002802164653003002192653002802222653003502250653001602285653001602301700001602317700001802333700002302351773011302374856008602487852000902573655001202582IND60611552520221117181829.0201209e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061155252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBocken, Nancy M.P.10aPay-per-use business models as a driver for sustainable consumption: Evidence from the case of HOMIE  ap. 498-510.  aPay-per-use business models where consumers pay for the unit of service (e.g. a wash) without gaining product ownership are often linked to increased environmental performance. Consumers would become more conscious about consumption patterns and companies would take responsibility for product life cycle issues. Such benefits can only be achieved when the business model is intentionally designed to deliver those impacts. Few studies focus on the environmental impacts of pay-per-use business models based on direct measurement of impacts. This paper investigates the following question: What positive environmental impact in terms of improving consumption patterns can be observed in a pay-per-use business model? Through an in-depth case of the start-up HOMIE, we investigate how its pay-per-use business model contributes to sustainable consumption. We use two samples of 56 and 21 customers in a longitudinal study to assess whether their consumption patterns of using a washing machine significantly changed after implementing a pay-per-use business model. It was found that pay-per-use business models have the potential to stimulate sustainable consumption. When customers started paying after the first free month, the total number of washes and washing temperature decreased significantly. Temperature reductions were mostly realized by customers who used to wash at higher temperatures. Future research could focus on mapping ideal sequences of experiments to achieve the greatest levels of sustainability impacts, and investigating other sustainable business models, such as renting and sharing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aconsumers (people) 3aeconometric models 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aleasing 3alongitudinal studies 3aownership 3aproduct life cycle 3atemperature 3awashing 0aCircular business model 0aBusiness model innovation 0aSustainable consumption 0aBusiness model experimentation 0aPay per use 0aSufficiency1 aMugge, Ruth1 aBom, Colin A.1 aLemstra, Hidde-Jan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 198 p.498-510dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011500158300001800273520109000291592002801381650002301409650002601432650002301458650001201481650001101493650001901504650002201523650001401545650001001559650002301569650001701592650002401609650003201633650002201665650002501687650001101712650001201723650001201735700002601747700001901773700002801792700002101820700001801841773013001859856007301989852000902062655001202071IND60515269920221122225725.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051526992DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.72982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, Marion10aForage legumes rich in condensed tannins may increase n‐3 fatty acid levels and sensory quality of lamb meat  ap. 1923-1933.  aBACKGROUND: Tannins intensively interact with rumen microbes, which is expected to have consequences for meat quality. RESULTS: Silages prepared from birdsfoot trefoil (BT), sainfoin (SF), alfalfa (AF) or red clover (RC) were fed alone to 48 lambs. The SF contained five times more condensed tannins than BT, the other tanniferous plant. Growth and carcass performance, but not general meat quality, was reduced with BT and SF compared to AF and RC. Lambs fed SF had half the skatole levels in the perirenal fat than AF‐fed lambs. The longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle of the SF‐fed lambs, compared to RC and BT, had a lower intensity for ‘livery’ and ‘sheepy’ flavors but a stronger ‘grassy’ flavor. The intramuscular fat of BT‐ and SF‐fed lambs contained less saturated and more polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially 20:4n‐6, 20:3n‐6, 20:5n‐3 and 22:5n‐3, with SF being more efficient than BT. CONCLUSION: The SF was most promising to increase beneficial fatty acids and to reduce skatole content in lamb meat. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3aTrifolium pratense 3aalfalfa 3aflavor 3aforage legumes 3aintramuscular fat 3alamb meat 3alambs 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aproanthocyanidins 3arumen microorganisms 3asilage 3askatole 3atannins1 aDohme‐Meier, Frigga1 aSilacci, Paolo1 aAmpuero Kragten, Silvia1 aKreuzer, Michael1 aBee, Giuseppe0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Apr., v. 96, no. 6 p.1923-1933dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.72983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010400166300001600270520076700286592002801053650001101081650001701092650002301109650001601132650001901148650004101167650001201208650001101220650001001231650002501241650001301266651002101279653001801300653001101318653001201329653002301341653002001364653001901384700002001403700002101423700002001444773011001464856008501574852000901659655001201668IND60565911520221119230154.0170327e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056591152DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2016.12169012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Ayla10aCompositions of essential oils of Salvia adenophylla, Salvia pilifera, and Salvia viscosa in Turkey  ap. 233-239.  aIn the Anatolia folk medicine, Salvia species are used by many people in various villages and towns for the therapeutic value of their essential oils.

Tissue grafting and biomaterial-based approaches fail to provide environments that are conducive to regeneration; instead they lead to nonspecific cell adhesion and scar tissue formation, which collectively impair functionality. Cell based therapies may potentially recover native tendon function, if tenocyte trans-differentiation can be evaded and stem cell differentiation towards tenogenic lineage is attained. To this end, recreating an artificial in vivo tendon niche by engineering functional in vitro microenvironments is a research priority. Clinically relevant cell based therapies for tendon repair and regeneration could be created using tools that harness biophysical beacons (surface topography, mechanical loading), biochemical cues (oxygen tension), and biological signals (growth factors).  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3acell differentiation 3aengineering 3agrowth factors 3aoxygen 3aphenotype 3astem cells 3atissue transplantation 3atopography 0aTendon cell based therapies 0atenogenic phenotype maintenance 0atenogenic differentiation 0ain vitro tools1 aGaspar, Diana1 aPandit, Abhay1 aZeugolis, Dimitrios I.0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2014 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.474-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170300001600311520122100327592002801548650003001576650001401606650002201620650001301642650003101655650001101686650001801697650001301715650001801728650001801746650001801764700002001782700002201802700001801824700001901842773010001861856008501961990002302046852000902069655001202078IND60099940720221119213324.0141105e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009994072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Kyu-Don10aAnti-tumor activity of all-trans retinoic acid-incorporated glycol chitosan nanoparticles against HuCC-T1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells  ap. 454-461.  aThe aim of this study is to investigate antitumor activity of all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-incorporated glycol chitosan (GC) nanoparticles.

Invasion test using Matrigel® also showed that invasion of tumor cells was significantly inhibited at higher than 20μg/ml of RA concentration. Wound healing assay also showed that RA-incorporated GC nanoparticles were inhibited migration of tumor cells as similar to RA itself. Our results suggested that RA-incorporated GC nanoparticles is a promising vehicles for RA delivery to HuCC-T1 cholangiocarcinoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3aaqueous solutions 3achitosan 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3anecrosis 3aparticle size 3aretinoic acid 3atissue repair1 aJeong, Young-Il1 aChung, Chung-Wook1 aKim, Do Hyung1 aKang, Dae Hwan0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 422, no. 1-2 p.454-461dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245008500207300001800292520075100310592002801061650001501089650001501104650001001119650003001129650002801159650001501187650002401202650001101226700002301237700006201260700006001322700006201382773013501444856008001579852000901659655001201668IND60606059520221118062912.0180724e20180222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060605952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b101972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamska, Lyudmyla1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8098-624910aFirst-Principles Investigation of Borophene as a Monolayer Transparent Conductor  ap. 4037-4045.  aTwo-dimensional boron is promising as a tunable monolayer metal for nano-optoelectronics. We study the optoelectronic properties of two likely allotropes of two-dimensional boron, β₁₂ and δ₆, using first-principles density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. We find that both systems are anisotropic metals, with strong energy- and thickness-dependent optical transparency and a weak (<1%) absorbance in the visible range. Additionally, using state-of-the-art methods for the description of the electron–phonon and electron–electron interactions, we show that the electrical conductivity is limited by electron–phonon interactions. Our results indicate that both structures are suitable as a transparent electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aanisotropy 3aboron 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3amathematical theory 3ametals1 aSadasivam, Sridhar1 aFoley, Jonathan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8814-44441 aDarancet, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5846-16731 aSharifzadeh, Sahar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4215-46680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 22, v. 122, no. 7 p.4037-4045dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b101973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245014600204300002000350520138000370592002801750650001501778650002101793650002101814650002201835650001401857650001301871650001701884700006201901700002001963700001701983700002202000700002302022700002202045700001802067700001802085700006302103773013802166856008002304852000902384655001202393IND60606718220221121082930.0180727e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060671822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b037572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Arao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2167-460810aUltrafast Charge Transfer and Relaxation Dynamics in Polymer-Encapsulating Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: Polythiophene and Coronene Polymer  ap. 16940-16949.  aWe investigate the photophysical properties of polymer-encapsulating single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using absorption spectroscopy, photoconductivity spectroscopy, and femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. In a polythiophene (PT)-encapsulating SWNT film, one or two PT layers are encapsulated within SWNTs, depending on the tube diameter. For single encapsulated PT layers, the photoconductivity action spectrum shows a large photocurrent signal corresponding to absorption bands associated with PT exciton and continuum states, indicating charge transfer between the PT and the small-diameter SWNT. Pump–probe measurements show that electron transfer to the SWNT occurs in 0.53 ps and electrons then recombine with holes remaining in the PT in 11 ps. In a coronene-polymer-encapsulating SWNT film, weak absorption bands at 1.7 and 3.4 eV are observed in addition to the SWNT spectrum. Band calculations allow these to be assigned to optical transitions between the electronic states originating from the coronene polymer, hybridized with those of the SWNT. The pump–probe measurements reveal fast electron relaxation (0.38 ps) from the conduction band of the coronene polymer to the lowest conduction band originating from the SWNT and subsequent recombination (1.5 ps) of these electrons with holes in the top valence band originating from the coronene polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy1 aYamanaka, Ken-ichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0253-17401 aMiyaura, Kenshi1 aLim, Hong En1 aMatsuda, Kazunari1 aThendie, Boanerges1 aMiyata, Yasumitsu1 aKochi, Taketo1 aOkada, Susumu1 aShinohara, Hisanori1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9400-76220 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 122, no. 29 p.16940-16949dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b037573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245010700169500001900276520177200295592002802067650002202095650002102117650002102138650002002159650001602179650001302195650001102208650001402219650001102233650001902244650001802263650001302281650002302294650002502317650001002342700002402352700002902376700002502405700002402430700002002454700002202474700002102496700002102517700001802538700001902556700002502575700002102600700002602621700002202647700002602669700002102695700002102716700002302737700002202760700002302782700002702805773012002832856007802952961001203030852000903042655001203051IND60729443020221119040818.0210228e20210127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072944302DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Ana  Rita F.10aCan Foliar Pulverization with CaCl2 and Ca(NO3)2 Trigger Ca Enrichment in Solanum tuberosum L. Tubers?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to assess the efficiency of Ca enrichment in tubers of three genotypes of Solanum tuberosum L., through foliar spraying with CaCl₂ and Ca(NO₃)₂ solutions. In this context, soil heterogeneity of three potato-growing fields, as well as the implications of Ca accumulation among tissues and some quality parameters were assessed. Three potato varieties (Agria, Picasso and Rossi) were grown in three production fields and during the life cycle, four pulverizations with calcium chloride (3 and 6 kg ha⁻¹) or calcium nitrate (0.5, 2 and 4 kg ha⁻¹) were applied. For screening the potential phytotoxicity, using Agria as a test system, the potential synthesis of photoassimilates was determined, and it was found that after the 3rd Ca application, leaf gas exchanges were moderately (net photosynthesis), to strongly (stomatal conductance) affected, although without impact on Ca accumulation in tubers. At harvest, the average Ca biofortification index varied between 5–40%, 40–35% and 4.3–13% in Agria, Picasso and Rossi, respectively. Moreover, the equatorial region of the tubers in general showed that Ca accumulation prevailed in the epidermis and, in some cases, in inner areas of the potato tubers. Biofortified tubers with Ca also showed some significant changes in total soluble solids and colorimetric parameters. It is concluded that Ca enrichment of potato tubers through foliar spraying complemented the xylem mass flow of Ca from roots, through phloem redistribution. Both fertilizers showed similar efficiency, but Rossi revealed a lower index of Ca accumulation, eventually due to different metabolic characteristics. Although affected by Ca enrichment, potato tubers maintained a high quality for industrial processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abiofortification 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium nitrate 3acolorimetry 3agrinding 3aleaves 3amass flow 3aphloem 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3apotatoes 3asoil heterogeneity 3astomatal conductance 3axylem1 aLidon, Fernando  C.1 aPessoa, Cláudia  Campos1 aMarques, Ana  Coelho1 aLuís, Inês  Carmo1 aCaleiro, João 1 aSimões, Manuela,1 aKullberg, José 1 aLegoinha, Paulo 1 aBrito, Maria 1 aGuerra, Mauro 1 aLeitão, Roberta  G.1 aGalhano, Carlos 1 aScotti-Campos, Paula 1 aSemedo, José  N.1 aSilva, Maria Manuela,1 aPais, Isabel  P.1 aSilva, Maria  J.1 aRodrigues, Ana  P.1 aPessoa, Maria  F.1 aRamalho, José  C.1 aReboredo, Fernando  H.0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 27, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202453Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007400157300001600231520103300247592002801280650001201308650001301320650001401333650001301347651002301360651001101383653001301394653001201407653001301419653001701432653001301449653001201462653001601474653001001490653001701500700002301517773016801540856007401708852000901782655001201791IND60544179120221120145402.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054417912DNAL7 a10.7550/rmb.325132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasca, Rebeca10aBiodiversidad de Medusozoa (Cubozoa, Scyphozoa e Hydrozoa) en México  ap. 154-163.  aIn order to update and summarize the information about the diversity of the medusozoans occurring in Mexican waters, records were reviewed at the family level to assess the current status of the knowledge of the diversity of this group in Mexico. A synthesized revision of different biological and ecological aspects of the group is also presented. In addition, new records are included of: Crossota millsae, Halitrephes maasi, Atorella octogonos, Tiburonia granrojo, Stygiomedusa gigantea, Periphyllopsis braweri, Resomia persica, Bargmannia lata, Desmophyes haematogaster and Lensia quadriculata, found in the Gulf of California. The results of this analysis yielded a total of 289 species of Medusozoa known in Mexico, of which 3 species are of Cubozoa, 20 of Scyphozoa, and 266 of Hydrozoa. Overall, the number of species recorded in Mexican waters represents about 7.3% of the medusozoans known worldwide, thus suggesting that the diversity of the group deserves further efforts, particularly in scarcely surveyed habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCubozoa 3aHydrozoa 3aScyphozoa 3ahabitats 3aGulf of California 3aMexico 0aCnidaria 0amedusas 0apólipos 0aSiphonophora 0aCnidaria 0amedusae 0ajellyfishes 0apolyp 0aSiphonophora1 aLoman-Ramos, Lucio0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2014 Jan., v. 85 p.154-163dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de MéxicowJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.7550/rmb.325133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014300172300001800315520192000333592002802253650002402281650002502305650001002330650001902340650002102359650001202380650004602392650002002438650001902458650001902477650001502496650002602511650002902537650001602566650001002582700002002592700006702612773012902679856008502808852000902893655001202902IND60770363520221119184157.0220315e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077036352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c053402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrey, Benjamin S.10aEmbossed Paper Platform for Whole Blood Collection, Room Temperature Storage, and Direct Analysis by Pinhole Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4417-4425.  aDry-state microsampling techniques are convenient and advantageous for sample collection in resource-limited settings, including healthcare systems designed for the underserved population. In this work, a microsampling platform based on an embossed hydrophobic paper substrate is introduced together with three-dimensional (3D) printed cartridges that offer opportunities for rapid (<30 min) drying of the collected samples while also preserving sample integrity when the embossed paper chip is shipped at room temperature. More importantly, a new pinhole paper spray ionization method was developed that facilitates direct mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the dried blood samples without prior sample preparation. We compared the direct pinhole paper spray MS method with a liquid chromatographic (LC) MS approach that relied upon electrospray ionization (ESI) after analytes present in the blood sample were extracted through liquid–liquid extraction. Limits of detection as low as 0.12 and 0.49 ng/mL were calculated for cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, respectively, when using the direct pinhole paper spray MS method. Analytical merits such as precision and accuracy, recovery, carryover effects, and analyte stability were all quantified for this new paper spray method and compared to the traditional LC-ESI-MS. Although LC-ESI-MS was observed to be 10× more sensitive, the linear dynamic range for both methods was determined to be the same, in the range of 1–500 ng/mL for both cocaine and benzoylecgonine analytes. When fully developed, the current microsampling strategy could offer an easy-to-use kit that can enable a more effective MS analysis of 20 μL dried blood samples delivered by mail. Both sensitivity (10×) and sample stability are found to be more superior for blood prepared in the embossed hydrophobic paper compared to samples prepared in the planar hydrophilic paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achemical species 3acocaine 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahealth services 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3ametabolites 3apaper1 aHeiss, Derik R.1 aBadu-Tawiah, Abraham K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8642-34310 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 94, no. 10 p.4417-4425dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c053403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013800164300002000302520105500322592002801377650001501405650001301420650001101433650003001444650000901474650001201483650001301495650001101508650001101519650003101530650001601561650001901577700002101596700001801617700002501635700002601660700006501686773013801751856008001889852000901969655001201978IND60606718320221121112247.0180727e20180627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060671832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b037872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Shikha10aStructure and Electronic Properties of Transition-Metal/Mg Bimetallic Clusters at Realistic Temperatures and Oxygen Partial Pressures  ap. 16788-16794.  aComposition, atomic structure, and electronic properties of TMₓMgyOz clusters [transition metal (TM) = Cr, Ni, Fe, and Co, x + y ≤ 3] under realistic temperature T and oxygen partial pressure pO₂ conditions are explored using the ab initio atomistic thermodynamics approach. The low-energy isomers of the different clusters are identified using a massively parallel cascade genetic algorithm on the hybrid density-functional theory level. On analyzing a large set of data, we find that the fundamental gap Eg of the thermodynamically stable clusters is strongly affected by the presence of Mg-coordinated O₂ moieties. By contrast, the nature of the TM does not play a significant role in determining Eg. Using Eg of a cluster as a descriptor of its redox properties, our finding is against the conventional belief that the TM plays a key role in determining the electronic and therefore chemical properties of the clusters. High reactivity may be correlated more strongly with the oxygen content in the cluster than with any specific TM type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achromium 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3airon 3aisomers 3amoieties 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aSarker, Debalaya1 aBasera, Pooja1 aLevchenko, Sergey V.1 aGhiringhelli, Luca M.1 aBhattacharya, Saswata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4145-48990 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 June 27, v. 122, no. 29 p.16788-16794dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b037873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165300001400306520093000320592002801250650001101278650001301289650002401302650000901326650001601335650001101351650001701362650001601379650001101395650002301406650001201429650002101441650001501462650002201477650001701499650001201516651001201528700002101540700002301561700002401584773013001608856008101738852000901819655001201828IND60642368620221122122942.0190507e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236862DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117190101322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopova, L.

M. pruinosa originates from America. The imagoes of this insect species were observed during the surveys on fruit trees, fig trees, grape, and ornamental plants in private gardens; they were fixed with yellow sticky traps. Morphological description, features of the insect development, host plants, distribution ability, and importance are given for M. рruinosa as a potentially harmful insect in southern Ukraine. Taking into consideration that M. pruinosa continues to occupy rapidly a new territory and new host plants, it is necessary to perform phytosanitary monitoring of different crop cultures in southern Ukraine and to take action to restrict its development and to reduce its harmfulness using biological and chemical agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aMetcalfa 3aecological invasion 3afigs 3afruit trees 3agrapes 3ahome gardens 3ahost plants 3aimagos 3ainsect development 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3aornamental plants 3asticky traps 3asurveys 3aUkraine1 aBondareva, L.

In this work, we engineered a miRNA-21-responsive G-quadruplex-embedded self-quenching probe (GE-SQP) that can regulate single probe-based multiplex amplifications. The free GE-SQP is tightly locked in a quenching state with no active G-quadruplexes. Introduction of target miRNA to hybridize with GE-SQP would induce a multiplex isothermal amplification to significantly build a lot of one-bulb-contained road lamp probe (OC-RLP) and two-bulb-contained road lamp probe (TC-RLP) using G-quadruplex as the lamp bulb. When lightened by thioflavin T (ThT), beams of fluorescence were emitted to show the presented miRNA-21. Specially, the whole amplification is only a one probe-involved one-step reaction without any wasted species. The mix-to-detection and all-in amplification behavior allows the sensing system a maximally maintained operation simplicity and high assay performance. In such a way, the detection range of miRNA-21 is from 1 fM to 1 nM with a limit of detection of 0.86 fM. The practicability was demonstrated by determining miRNA-21 from serum samples with acceptable results. We expect that this method can open a new avenue for exploring advanced biosensors with improved analytical performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abulbs 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3amicroRNA 3aoligonucleotides1 aSun, Jiayin1 aZhang, Jing1 aShen, Chenlin1 aZhang, Xinlei1 aXu, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0187-26230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 02, v. 94, no. 10 p.4437-4445dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c054023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010500172300001400277520184900291592002802140650001702168650001702185650001602202650001102218650000902229650001202238650001202250653001602262653002002278653001602298653002302314700001602337700001802353773008202371856008602453852000902539655001202548IND60561208120221118221356.0170607e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056120812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Min Young10aEffective energy management by combining gas turbine cycles and forward osmosis desalination process  ap. 51-61.  aIn the recent years, attempts to improve the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycles have been made. In order to enhance the energy management of the gas turbine cycle, a new integration concept has been proposed; integration of gas turbine cycle and forward osmosis desalination process. The combination of the gas turbine cycle and the forward osmosis (FO) desalination process basically implies the coupling of the waste heat from the gas turbine cycle to the draw solute recovery system in the FO process which is the most energy consuming part of the whole FO process. By doing this, a strong system that is capable of producing water and electricity with very little waste heat can be achieved. The feasibility of this newly proposed system was analyzed using UNISIM program and the OLI property package. For the analysis, the thermolytic draw solutes which has been suggested by other research groups have been selected and studied. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the integration system in order to understand and identify the key parameters of the integrated system. And the integrated system was further evaluated by comparing the gain output ratio (GOR) values with the conventional desalination technologies such as multi stage flash (MSF) and multi effect distillation (MED). The suggested integrated system was calculated to have a GOR of 14.8, while the MSF and MED when integrated to the gas turbine cycle showed GOR value of 12. It should also be noted that the energy utilization of the suggested integrated system is significantly higher by 27.1% and 63.8% than those of the MSF–gas turbine and MED–gas turbine systems, respectively. The noticeable enhancement in both the GOR and waste heat utilization of the suggested system resulted in 3.5 times higher water production rate than the MSF integrated system.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3adistillation 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aheat 3aosmosis 3asolutes 0aGas turbine 0aForward osmosis 0aIntegration 0aEnergy utilization1 aShin, Serin1 aKim, Eung Soo0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.51-61dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245005500164300001600219500001100235520122400246592002801470650001301498650001501511650001501526650002101541650001501562650002201577650001701599650001901616650002201635650001101657650002201668650001201690773012901702856007901831852000901910655001201919IND60588280320221120023250.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058828032DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.125282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jianghong10aNew insights into a hot environment for early life  ap. 203-210.  aREVIEW  aInvestigating the physical‐chemical setting of early life is a challenging task. In this contribution, the author attempted to introduce a provocative concept from cosmology – cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is the residual thermal radiation from a hot early Universe – to the field. For this purpose, the author revisited a recently deduced biomarker, the 1,6‐anhydro bond of sugars in bacteria. In vitro, the 1,6‐anhydro bond of sugars reflects and captures residual thermal radiation in thermochemical processes and therefore is somewhat analogous to CMB. In vivo, the formation process of the 1,6‐anhydro bond of sugars on the peptidoglycan of prokaryotic cell wall is parallel to in vitro processes, suggesting that the 1,6‐anhydro bond is an ideal CMB‐like analogue that suggests a hot setting for early life. The CMB‐like 1,6‐anhydro bond is involved in the life cycle of viruses and the metabolism of eukaryotes, underlying this notion. From a novel perspective, the application of the concept of the CMB to microbial ecology may give new insights into a hot environment, such as hydrothermal vents, supporting early life and providing hypotheses to test in molecular palaeontology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3acell walls 3aeukaryotic cells 3ametabolism 3amicrobial ecology 3apaleontology 3apeptidoglycans 3aprokaryotic cells 3asugars 3athermal radiation 3aviruses0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2017 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.203-210dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.125283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010000207300001800307506007600325520169600401592002802097506003702125650001102162650002302173650001502196650001402211650001102225650002202236650001502258650001102273650001102284650001302295650001902308650001702327650001202344653004002356653003902396653002302435653001102458653001102469700002402480700002102504700003002525700001802555700001902573700001902592700002202611700002102633700001602654700001602670700002302686700002002709700002002729773019202749856007902941852000903020655001203029IND60238165420221207051739.0150617e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14064831122doi7 aPMC44759722pmcid7 a260825452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArkema, Katie K.10aEmbedding ecosystem services in coastal planning leads to better outcomes for people and nature  ap. 7390-7395.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent calls for ocean planning envision informed management of social and ecological systems to sustain delivery of ecosystem services to people. However, until now, no coastal and marine planning process has applied an ecosystem-services framework to understand how human activities affect the flow of benefits, to create scenarios, and to design a management plan. We developed models that quantify services provided by corals, mangroves, and seagrasses. We used these models within an extensive engagement process to design a national spatial plan for Belize’s coastal zone. Through iteration of modeling and stakeholder engagement, we developed a preferred plan, currently under formal consideration by the Belizean government. Our results suggest that the preferred plan will lead to greater returns from coastal protection and tourism than outcomes from scenarios oriented toward achieving either conservation or development goals. The plan will also reduce impacts to coastal habitat and increase revenues from lobster fishing relative to current management. By accounting for spatial variation in the impacts of coastal and ocean activities on benefits that ecosystems provide to people, our models allowed stakeholders and policymakers to refine zones of human use. The final version of the preferred plan improved expected coastal protection by >25% and more than doubled the revenue from fishing, compared with earlier versions based on stakeholder preferences alone. Including outcomes in terms of ecosystem-service supply and value allowed for explicit consideration of multiple benefits from oceans and coasts that typically are evaluated separately in management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoasts 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afisheries 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amodels 3aoceans 3aplanning 3arisk reduction 3astakeholders 3atourism 0acoastal and marine spatial planning 0aintegrated coastal zone management 0aecosystem services 0aBelize 0aInVEST1 aVerutes, Gregory M.1 aWood, Spencer A.1 aClarke-Samuels, Chantalle1 aRosado, Samir1 aCanto, Maritza1 aRosenthal, Amy1 aRuckelshaus, Mary1 aGuannel, Gregory1 aToft, Jodie1 aFaries, Joe1 aSilver, Jessica M.1 aGriffin, Robert1 aGuerry, Anne D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 June 16, v. 112, no. 24 p.7390-7395dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14064831123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009600175300001600271520089300287592002801180650001501208650001701223650001301240650002001253650001801273650002201291650001301313653001801326653001501344653001301359653001701372653001501389653001101404700001801415700002101433700002401454700002001478700002501498700002401523700002401547700002401571700002401595700002201619773010801641856008601749852000901835655001201844IND60553113720221121041919.0161021e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055311372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShcharbin, Dzmitry10aNanoparticle corona for proteins: mechanisms of interaction between dendrimers and proteins  ap. 377-383.  aProtein absorption at the surface of big nanoparticles and formation of ‘protein corona’ can completely change their biological properties. In contrast, we have studied the binding of small nanoparticles – dendrimers – to proteins and the formation of their ‘nanoparticle corona’. Three different types of interactions were observed. (1) If proteins have rigid structure and active site buried deeply inside, the ‘nanoparticle corona’ is unaffected. (2) If proteins have a flexible structure and their active site is also buried deeply inside, the ‘nanoparticle corona’ affects protein structure, but not enzymatic activity. (3) The ‘nanoparticle corona’ changes both the structure and enzymatic activity of flexible proteins that have surface-based active centers.

The overall study population included 21,059 patients (3,939 vaccinations vs. 17,150 controls). The results showed a significant risk reduction for the development of new high-grade intraepithelial lesions after HPV vaccination (relative risk (RR) 0.41; 95% CI [0.27; 0.64]), independent from HPV type. Due to the heterogeneous study population multiple sub analyses regarding HPV type, age of patients, time of vaccination and follow-up were performed. Age-dependent analysis showed no differences between women under 25 years (RR 0.47 (95%-CI [0.28; 0.80]) and women of higher age (RR 0.52 (95%-CI [0.41; 0.65]). Results for HPV 16/18 positive CIN2+ showed a RR of 0.37 (95% CI [0.17; 0.80]). Overall, the number of women that would have to be vaccinated before or after conization to prevent one case of recurrent CIN 2+ (NNV) is 45.5.Meta-analysis showed a significant risk reduction of developing recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after surgical excision and HPV vaccination compared to surgical excision only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aexcision 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3arelative risk 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aKampers, J.1 aBecker, J.1 aSibbertsen, P.1 aHillemanns, P.0 tVaccine.g2020 Sept. 22, v. 38, no. 41 p.6402-6409dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011300175300001600288520199000304592002802294650002102322650001302343650001902356650001802375650001102393650001902404650001802423650002102441650002502462653002702487653003402514653001102548653002502559653002802584653003302612700002202645773008402667856008602751852000902837655001202846IND60561208320221118221559.0170607e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056120832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarzoha, Ronald J.10aEffect of carbon nanotube interfacial geometry on thermal transport in solid–liquid phase change materials  ap. 271-276.  aFor nearly two decades, research groups have attempted to increase the thermal conductivity of bulk materials by saturating them with different concentrations and types of nanoparticles. However, optimal enhancements in the thermal conductivity of these materials continue to go unrealized, primarily due to interfacial phenomena that impede phonon propagation from the bulk material to the nanoparticle or between individual, contacting nanoparticles. Though it is almost certain that interfacial resistances between contacting nanoparticles are responsible for the underwhelming thermal performance of nanoparticles in bulk materials, the physical mechanisms that limit thermal transport at nanoparticle junctions is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the effect of nanoparticle constriction size (i.e. the contact area between linked nanoparticles) on the bulk thermal conductivity of a surrounding paraffin-based phase change material. To this end, we measure the effective thermal conductivity of different Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT)/paraffin nanocomposites is measured with the transient plane source technique. Using a newly developed physical model, the interfacial thermal resistance between the contacting nanoparticles is determined as a function of the constriction geometry. Results suggest that the thermal conductance (i.e. the rate of heat transfer) between contacting MWCNTs can be increased by a factor of 27 by increasing their diameter by only 58nm. This is in direct conflict with effective medium approximations, which predict an increase in the bulk thermal conductivity of MWCNT–PCM composites when MWCNT diameters are reduced. Such a result indicates that the contact area between individual, contacting nanoparticles has a significant impact on thermal transport within the PCM nanocomposite, and therefore its bulk thermal conductivity. It is expected that these results will strongly impact the design of nanoparticle-laden PCMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3ageometry 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3athermal conductivity 0aPhase change materials 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aPhonon 0aThermal conductivity 0aConstriction resistance 0aThermal boundary conductance1 aFleischer, Amy S.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.271-276dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245007700204300001800281506007600299520188500375592002802260506003702288650001702325650002302342650001202365650001502377650001202392650001602404650001102420650001802431650001702449651001402466653001702480653001402497653001202511653001302523653001702536700001802553700002302571700001602594700002502610700001902635700002002654700001802674700002502692773019202717856007902909852000902988655001202997IND60238165520221207051734.0150617e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816552DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14064841122doi7 aPMC44759892pmcid7 a260779062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBateman, Ian,10aConserving tropical biodiversity via market forces and spatial targeting  ap. 7408-7413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent report from the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity [(2010) Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 ] acknowledges that ongoing biodiversity loss necessitates swift, radical action. Protecting undisturbed lands, although vital, is clearly insufficient, and the key role of unprotected, private land owned is being increasingly recognized. Seeking to avoid common assumptions of a social planner backed by government interventions, the present work focuses on the incentives of the individual landowner. We use detailed data to show that successful conservation on private land depends on three factors: conservation effectiveness (impact on target species), private costs (especially reductions in production), and private benefits (the extent to which conservation activities provide compensation, for example, by enhancing the value of remaining production). By examining the high-profile issue of palm-oil production in a major tropical biodiversity hotspot, we show that the levels of both conservation effectiveness and private costs are inherently spatial; varying the location of conservation activities can radically change both their effectiveness and private cost implications. We also use an economic choice experiment to show that consumers' willingness to pay for conservation-grade palm-oil products has the potential to incentivize private producers sufficiently to engage in conservation activities, supporting vulnerable International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listed species. However, these incentives vary according to the scale and efficiency of production and the extent to which conservation is targeted to optimize its cost-effectiveness. Our integrated, interdisciplinary approach shows how strategies to harness the power of the market can usefully complement existing—and to-date insufficient—approaches to conservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aendangered species 3afunding 3alandowners 3amarkets 3aplantations 3aprices 3aprivate lands 3apublic lands 3aIndonesia 0aconservation 0aeconomics 0aSumatra 0aoil-palm 0abiodiversity1 aCoombes, Emma1 aFitzherbert, Emily1 aBinner, Amy1 aBad’ura, Tomááš1 aCarbone, Chris1 aFisher, Brendan1 aNaidoo, Robin1 aWatkinson, Andrew R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 June 16, v. 112, no. 24 p.7408-7413dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14064841123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011400175300001600289520140300305592002801708650001401736650001901750650002501769650001401794650001301808650002501821650002501846650001301871650001801884650001501902650001301917650001801930650001301948650001401961650000901975650001501984650002501999650002302024650001602047653002002063653002602083653000802109653002302117653001602140653002702156700003002183700002702213700002402240773010802264856008602372852000902458655001202467IND60553113820221121041948.0161021e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055311382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, Sreepathy10aCardiogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells with gold nanoparticle loaded functionalized nanofibers  ap. 346-354.  aCardiac tissue engineering promises to revolutionize the treatment of patients with end-stage heart failure and provide new solutions to the serious problems of shortage of heart donors. The influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an influential role along with nanostructured components for guided stem cell differentiation. Hence, nanoparticle embedded Nanofibrous scaffolds of FDA approved polycaprolactone (PCL), Vitamin B12 (Vit B12), Aloe Vera(AV) and Silk fibroin(SF) was constructed to differentiate mesenchymal stem cells into cardiac lineage. Cardiomyocytes (CM) and Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were co-cultured on these fabricated nanofibrous scaffolds for the regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Results demonstrated that synthesized gold nanoparticles were of the size 16nm and the nanoparticle loaded nanofibrous scaffold has a mechanical strength of 2.56MPa matching that of the native myocardium. The gold nanoparticle blended PCL scaffolds were found to be enhancing the MSCs proliferation and differentiation into cardiogenesis. Most importantly the phenotype and cardiac marker expression in differentiated MSCs were highly resonated in gold nanoparticle loaded nanofibrous scaffolds. The appropriate mechanical strength provided by the functionalized nanofibrous scaffolds profoundly supported MSCs to produce contractile proteins and achieve typical cardiac phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3acardiomyocytes 3acell differentiation 3acoculture 3acolloids 3acontractile proteins 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroins 3aheart failure 3ananofibers 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asilk 3astem cells 3astrength (mechanics) 3atissue engineering 3avitamin B12 0aElectrospinning 0aNanofibrous scaffolds 0aPCL 0aGold nanoparticles 0aVitamin B12 0aMesenchymal stem cells1 aVenugopal, Jayarama Reddy1 aSridhar, Radhakrishnan1 aRamakrishna, Seeram0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 134 p.346-354dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007200165300001600237520164200253592002801895650002201923650001401945650002101959650002301980650003002003650001902033650001102052650001002063650002102073650001102094650001502105650001402120650002002134650001602154650002902170650000902199650002102208650001002229650001002239650001402249651001702263651000902280700003502289773009402324856008102418852000902499655001202508IND60524393620221117225158.0160706e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052439362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-016-0596-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTito, Richard10aEffects of an aphid pest on an invasive plant in the Peruvian Andes  ap. 817-823.  aAn exotic aphid pest (Aphis cytisorum) has infested an invasive plant (Spartium junceum) in the Peruvian Andes since 2005. In turn, the aphids facilitated the spread of sooty mold fungus (Capnodium sp.) that covers the surface of ephemeral leaves and stems. We evaluated the infestation of aphids and fungus on S. junceum and on another Andean plant species in 2007 and 2015, measuring the effects of infestation on reproductive output of S. junceum in 2008. Individuals of S. junceum were heavily infested by aphids and fungus and close to half of populations were dead in the early years of infestation, although mortality had decreased over time. Infested plants produced larger fruits and seeds, but approximately a quarter of the production of uninfested plants. Viability and germination of seeds produced by infested plants were similar to those produced by uninfested plants. Aphis cytisorum was monophagous on S. junceum, although there is a risk that it can eventually infest other Andean plant species, because this aphid is polyphagous elsewhere. The strong impact of aphid/fungus infestation on survival and reproduction of S. junceum suggest that initially these natural enemies could have worked as a biological control. However, the population of S. junceum persists and shows evidence of repopulation, indicating the ineffectiveness of biocontrol. Our results support the importance of a long-term monitoring to determine the effectiveness of biocontrol agents and provide critical information for future related studies, considering that plant pests and disease infestations will likely increase under changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis (Aphididae) 3aCapnodium 3aSpartium junceum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimate change 3afruits 3afungi 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aplant pests 3areproductive performance 3arisk 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3astems 3aviability 3aAndes region 3aPeru1 ade la Torre-Mayorga, Fructuosa0 tPlant ecology.g2016 July, v. 217, no. 7 p.817-823dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-016-0596-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04172naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008800181300001600269500001500285520215700300592002802457650002802485650001102513650001602524650002002540650001202560650002002572650000902592650001002601650003102611650002402642650001502666650002802681650001502709650001502724650001602739650001202755650002502767650002802792650001402820650003802834650001102872650001502883650001802898650004102916650005702957650002003014650002203034650003103056650001603087651001003103651001003113653002503123700001603148700002003164700001903184700002003203700001703223700001603240700002003256773012903276856004803405852000903453655001203462IND4471715720221116182013.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447171572DNAL7 a212901202pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9641-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Zhang10aMercury Biomagnification in the Aquaculture Pond Ecosystem in the Pearl River Delta  ap. 491-499.  a2019-12-05  aThis is the first study to investigate the rate of mercury (Hg) biomagnification in the aquaculture pond ecosystem of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, by analyzing total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations in various species of fish at different trophic levels (TLs). Species representing a gradient of trophic positions in the aquaculture pond food chains were chosen for analyzing THg and MeHg concentrations. In this study, there were two kinds of the aquaculture pond food chains: (1) omnivorous (fish feeds, zooplankton, grass carp [Ctenopharyngodon idellus], and bighead carp [Aristichthys nobilis]) and (2) predatory (zooplankton, mud carp [Cirrhina molitorella], and mandarin fish [Siniperca kneri]). Bighead carp and mandarin fish had the highest MeHg and THg concentrations, i.e., an order of magnitude higher than other species, in their respective food chains. More than 90% of the THg concentrations detected in bighead carp, mandarin fish, and mud carp were in the methylated form. In this study, %MeHg increased with TLs and MeHg concentrations, reflecting that MeHg is the dominant chemical species of Hg accumulated in higher concentrations in biota, especially biota associated with higher TLs in the food chains. The trophic magnification factors were 2.32 and 2.60 for MeHg and 1.94 and 2.03 for THg in omnivorous and predatory food chains, respectively, in PRD. Hg concentrations in fish tissue correlated to Hg levels in the ambient environment, and sediment seemed to be the major source for Hg accumulated in fish. In addition, feeding habit also affected Hg accumulation in different fish species. Four significant linear relationships were obtained between log-THg and δ15N and between log-MeHg and δ15N. The slope of the regression equations, as biomagnification power, was smaller in magnitude compared with those reported for temperate and arctic marine and freshwater ecosystems, indicating that THg and MeHg biomagnifications were lower in this PRD subtropical aquaculture pond ecosystem. This was probably due to low Hg bioavailability at lower TLs as well as individual feeding behavior of fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3arivers 3aaquaculture 3abioaccumulation 3amercury 3abioavailability 3acarp 3aponds 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3achemical speciation 3afish feeds 3amethylmercury compounds 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3azooplankton 2aAnimals 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aBiological Availability 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFishes 2aFood Chain 2aLinear Models 2aMercuryxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aPondsxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aZooplankton 3aChina 0aChina 0aAristichthys nobilis1 aLiang, Peng1 aShao, Ding-Ding1 aWu, Sheng-Chun1 aNie, Xiang-Ping1 aChen, Kun-Ci1 aLi, Kai-Bin1 aWong, Ming-Hung0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Oct., v. 61, no. 3 p.491-499dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9641-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016400171300001600335520162700351592002801978650001402006650001902020650002602039650001102065650002402076650001802100650002902118650001502147650001602162651001602178653004402194653002302238653001802261653001802279653004102297653002802338700001802366773008402384856008602468852000902554655001202563IND60561208420221118221121.0170607e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056120842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoo, Choongwan10aDevelopment of a dynamic operational rating system in energy performance certificates for existing buildings: Geostatistical approach and data-mining technique  ap. 254-270.  aThe operational rating system in building energy performance certificates (EPCs) has been used for systematically monitoring and diagnosing the energy performance in the operation and maintenance phases of existing buildings. However, there are several limitations of the conventional operational rating system, which can be subdivided into three aspects: (i) building category; (ii) region category; and (iii) space unit size. To overcome these challenges, this study conducted the problem analysis of the conventional operational rating system for existing buildings by using the statistical and geostatistical approaches. Based on the problem analysis, this study developed the dynamic operational rating (DOR) system for existing buildings by using the data-mining technique and the probability approach. The developed DOR system can be used as a tool for building energy performance diagnostics. To validate the applicability of the developed DOR system, educational facilities were selected as the representative type of existing buildings in South Korea. As a result, it was determined that the developed DOR system can solve the irrationality of the conventional operational rating system (i.e., the negative correlation between the space unit size and the CO2 emission density). Namely, the operational ratings of small buildings were adjusted upward while those of large buildings were adjusted downward. The developed DOR system can allow policymakers to establish the reasonable operational rating system for existing buildings, which can motivate the public to actively participate in energy-saving campaigns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon dioxide 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3ageostatistics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3aSouth Korea 0aBuilding energy performance certificate 0aOperational rating 0aEnergy policy 0aDecision tree 0aOne-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) 0aGeostatistical approach1 aHong, Taehoon0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.254-270dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005200146245012400198300002000322520073800342592002801080650002101108650001501129650001101144650000901155650002301164650003001187700005701217700006001274700005501334773013801389856008001527852000901607655001201616IND60606718820221121144920.0180727e20180709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060671882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b040782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3143-654X10aFabrication of Sharp Gold Tips by Three-Electrode Electrochemical Etching with High Controllability and Reproducibility  ap. 16950-16955.  aGold (Au) tips have wide application in local spectroscopies not only because of their high chemical stability but also their strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the visible and near-infrared regions. The energy and intensity of LSPR strongly depend on the tip shape. However, the conventional fabrication method of Au tips using electrochemical etching with two electrodes has problems regarding both the controllability and reproducibility of the tip shape. Here, we demonstrate a novel three-electrode electrochemical etching method to fabricate the Au tips by precisely tuning the applied electrochemical potential. The sharpness of the tip is well controlled by the applied potential, with high reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agold 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aKazuma, Emiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0834-98321 aYokota, Yasuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8541-12791 aKim, Yousoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7730-07040 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 09, v. 122, no. 29 p.16950-16955dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b040783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245007300167300001600240520086000256592002801116650000901144650001001153650002301163650001501186650002401201650003101225650002901256650003701285653001301322653002401335653003701359700002301396773015301419856007901572852000901651655001201660IND60522846020221119043848.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052284602DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1991-9-10132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKőmíves, Tamás10aChemistry and Structure-Activity Relationships of Herbicide Safeners  ap. 798-804.  aThe discovery and commercial success of safeners against thiolcarbamate herbicide injury to corn has stimulated a rapid progress and opened new possibilities for further research and development in the last decade. Compounds with new chemistry, increased efficacy, and a broader selectivity spectrum were synthesized and developed for agricultural use. Structure-activity relationship studies helped to optimize their chemical properties and to understand their biological modes of action. Several examples indicate close similarity between chemical structures possessing herbicidal and safener properties. In some cases this differentiation may be marginal, as shown in crops pretreated with low herbicide doses leading to safening effects. In other examples, however, structural optima for safening and herbicidal efficacy can be clearly differentiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrops 3aherbicide safeners 3aherbicides 3amechanism of action 3aphysicochemical properties 3aresearch and development 3astructure-activity relationships 0aSafeners 0aChemical Properties 0aStructure-Activity Relationships1 aHatzios, Kriton K.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 46, no. 9-10 p.798-804dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1991-9-10133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165520144800282592002801730650004401758650002201802650001201824650001401836650001501850650003701865650002901902650001401931650001301945650001801958650001701976650001401993650001502007650001602022650002102038650002402059653001302083653001402096653003902110653002102149653002402170653001402194700005602208700002502264700002702289700002402316700002902340773011802369856008202487852000902569655001202578IND60720106920221120084406.0211129e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072010692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazmi, Balkis10aSynthesis and characterization of bifunctional magnetic nano-catalyst from rice husk for production of biodiesel  aIn this work, bifunctional magnetic nano-catalyst was successfully derived from rice husk char doped with potassium oxide and nickel oxide by impregnation techniques, and their catalytic ability was tested via transesterification of used cooking oil (UCO). The catalyst was characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive x-ray analyzer (FESEM-EDX), and Vibrating sampling magnetometer (VSM) for magnetic properties. The optimized nanomagnetic bifunctional catalyst (RHC/K₂O-20%/Ni-5%) had 3.014 mmol g−1& 4.485 mmol g−1 of acidity and basicity, respectively, with the magnetic strength was recorded at 2.312 emu g⁻¹. For the catalytic evaluation, a maximum biodiesel yield of 98.2% was accomplished with 4 wt% of catalyst loading, 12:1 methanol to UCO molar ratio at 65 °C within 2 h of reaction time. The catalyst was reused for up to 5 reaction cycles and producing 70% of biodiesel at the last cycles. The fuel properties of optimized biodiesel were measured using Biodiesel - American Standard Testing Method (ASTM) D6751. Due to the magnetic properties of the catalyst, it was easily recovered by an external magnetic device and has the potential to improve the separation and purification processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3abiodiesel 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenvironmental technology 3amagnetism 3amethanol 3ananocatalysts 3anickel oxide 3apotassium 3arice hulls 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransesterification 0aMagnetic 0aRice husk 0aBifunctional magnetic nanocatalyst 0aUsed cooking oil 0aTransesterification 0aBiodiesel1 aRashid, Umer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6224-413X1 aIbrahim, Mohd Lokman1 aNehdi, Imededdine Arbi1 aĀjama, Mohāmmada,1 aAl-Resayes, Saud Ibrahim0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Feb., v. 21 p.101296-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245013400210300001600344520101000360592002801370596004101398596004101439596005101480596005101531650002801582650002101610650001101631650001501642650001501657650001801672650002101690650001701711650002201728700002401750700002001774700002601794773009801820856008201918852000902000655001202009IND60642369120221122122852.0200301e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236912DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-018-0628-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkosun, Olabimpe O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5548-567X10aTergal gland components of reproductively dominant honey bee workers have both primer and releaser effects on subordinate workers  ap. 173-182.  aThe primer and releaser effects of dominant honey bee workers’ tergal gland pheromones are not known under queenless conditions. The Cape honey bee, Apis mellifera capensis, is the ideal model to investigate such question since workers normally reproductively dominate workers of all other subspecies. We determined the effects that short- and long-term exposure to pheromone blends from dominant A. m. capensis workers had on subordinate workers of A. m. scutellata. Three putative pheromonal blends, 1 (palmitic acid, oleic acid, n-heneicosene and n-tricosene), 2 (ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) and 3 (mixture of blends 1 + 2), were tested. All the three putative pheromonal blends elicited releaser effects in the form of retinue formation and primer effects by suppressing ovarian activation in workers. The resultant effects indicated that these pheromonal blends appear to play a role in establishing dominance among workers and hence regulating opportunities to reproduce.  aPublisher supplied data  a108019cNational Research Foundation  a103710cNational Research Foundation  a90579 and 111683cNational Research Foundation  a91419 and 109380cNational Research Foundation 3aApis mellifera capensis 3achronic exposure 3amodels 3aoleic acid 3apalmitates 3apalmitic acid 3apheromone blends 3astearic acid 3aworker honey bees1 aYusuf, Abdullahi A.1 aCrewe, Robin M.1 aPirk, Christian W.

Scanty reports evaluated the rotavirus vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Asian countries.From February 2014-July 2017, we conducted a prospective case-control study in ten hospitals in Taiwan. Case-patients included children aged 8–59 months, and hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE). For each case patient, up to four controls, rotavirus-negative AGE or non-AGE illnesses, respectively, were matched by gender, age and enrolled date. Vaccination history was confirmed through vaccination card or hospital record. VE was calculated as (1 − odds ratio of vaccination) × 100%.Totally 4248 AGE patients and 2242 non-AGE controls were enrolled. A total of 330 case-patients with rotavirus AGE, 1226 rotavirus-negative AGE controls and 1122 non-AGE controls were included for analysis. Unvaccinated rate was 85.15% for rotavirus-positive cases, 42.9% for rotavirus-negative controls, and 34.31% for non-AGE controls. VE of two-dose RV1 was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]:77.7%, 90.1%) for rotavirus-negative AGE and 88.9% (95% CI: 83.4%, 92.8%) for non-AGE controls, while VE of three-dose RV5 was 92.5% (95% CI: 85.1%, 96.7%) and 96.4% (95% CI: 91.9%, 98.6%), respectively. For respective vaccine, VEs were not significantly different in term of rotavirus genotypes. VEs of both vaccines declined <80% in children aged three years by combined controls.Both vaccines provided excellent and sustained protection against rotavirus AGE hospitalization in children in Taiwan, but the effectiveness declined slightly in children aged three years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3agastroenteritis 3agender 3ahospitals 3amarkets 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aTaiwan 0aRotavirus vaccine 0aVaccine effectiveness 0aRotavirus 0aCase-control 0aAGE 0aVE 0aRV1 0aRV5 0aNIP 0aEIA1 aWu, Fang-Tzy1 aHuang, Yi-Chuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4351-89531 aLiu, Ching-Chun1 aChun-Yi-Lee, 1 aLin, Hsiao-Chuan1 aChi, Hsin1 aHuang, Li-Min1 aHo, Yu-Huai1 aLee, Jian-Te1 aShih, Shu-Man1 aChing-Yi-Huang, 1 aHsiung, Chao A.2 aTaiwan Pediatric Infectious Disease Allianceeauthor0 tVaccine.g2020 Sept. 22, v. 38, no. 41 p.6435-6441dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009200166500001900258520152400277592002801801650001501829650002901844650001501873650001801888650002301906650001501929650002401944650002401968650001201992650002302004650001702027650000902044650002102053651001302074700002502087700002302112700003002135700002402165700001602189700001902205700002502224773012002249856007802369852000902447655001202456IND60729443920221119040847.0210228e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072944392DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesta, Mesfin  K.10aPlant Available Zinc Is Influenced by Landscape Position in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZinc (Zn) is an important element determining the grain quality of staple food crops and deficient in many Ethiopian soils. However, farming systems are highly variable in Ethiopia due to different soil types and landscape cropping positions. Zinc availability and uptake by plants from soil and fertilizer sources are governed by the retention and release potential of the soil, usually termed as adsorption and desorption, respectively. The aim of this study was to characterize the amount of plant available Zn at different landscape positions. During the 2018/19 cropping season, adsorption-desorption studies were carried out on soil samples collected from on-farm trials conducted at Aba Gerima, Debre Mewi and Markuma in the Amhara Region. In all locations and landscape positions, adsorption and desorption increased with increasing Zn additions. The amount of adsorption and desorption was highly associated with the soil pH, the soil organic carbon concentration and cation exchange capacity, and these factors are linked to landscape positions. The Freundlich isotherm fitted very well to Zn adsorption (r² 0.87–0.99) and desorption (r² 0.92–0.99), while the Langmuir isotherm only fitted to Zn desorption (r² 0.70–0.93). Multiple regression models developed by determining the most influential soil parameters for Zn availability could be used to inform Zn fertilizer management strategies for different locations and landscape positions in this region, and thereby improve plant Zn use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acation exchange capacity 3adesorption 3agrain quality 3alandscape position 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asorption isotherms 3astaple foods 3azinc 3azinc fertilizers 3aEthiopia1 aBroadley, Martin R.,1 aMcGrath, Steve P.,1 aHernandez-Allica, Javier 1 aHassall, Kirsty  L.1 aGameda, S.,1 aTilahun Amede,1 aHaefele, Stephan  M.0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014200165300001600307520062100323592002800944650002100972650001100993650001401004650001201018650001101030650001001041651001101051651001301062700003201075700002001107700002401127773011801151856007401269852000901343655001201352IND60481829820221118124153.0160210e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048182982DNAL7 a10.1111/ijcs.122342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun Santos, Danilo10aPredictors of credit card use and perceived financial well‐being in female college students: a Brazil‐United States comparative study  ap. 133-142.  aThis article examines predictors of the financial well‐being of female college students living in São Paulo or New York, focusing upon the relationship with their credit card use behaviour.

A general trend is that climatic factors do not explain the species richness of species with small to medium‐sized geographic ranges, suggesting that geological and evolutionary processes must be considered. On the African continent, several hypotheses including both refugial and geographic uplift models have been advanced to explain avian speciation and diversity in the lowland forest and montane regions of central and eastern Africa; montane regions in particular are recognized as hotspots of vertebrate endemism. Here, we examine the possible role of these models in driving speciation in a clade of African forest robins. Location Africa. Methods We constructed the first robustly supported molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of forest robins. On this phylogeny, we reconstructed habitat‐based distributions and geographic distributions relative to the Albertine Rift. We also estimated the timing of lineage divergences via a molecular clock. Results Robust estimates of phylogenetic relationships and clock‐based divergences reject Miocene tectonic uplift and Pleistocene forest refugia as primary drivers of speciation in forest robins. Instead, our data suggest that most forest robin speciation took place in the Late Pliocene, from 3.2 to 2.2 Ma. Distributional patterns are complex, with the Albertine Rift region serving as a general east–west break across the group. Montane distributions are inferred to have evolved four times. Main conclusions Phylogenetic divergence dates coincide with a single period of lowland forest retraction in the late Pliocene, suggesting that most montane speciation resulted from the rapid isolation of populations in montane areas, rather than montane areas themselves being drivers of speciation. This conclusion provides additional evidence that Pliocene climate change was a major driver of speciation in broadly distributed African animal lineages. We further show that lowland forest robins are no older than their montane relatives, suggesting that lowland areas are not museums which house ‘ancient’ taxa; rather, for forest robins, montane areas should be viewed as living museums of a late Pliocene diversification event. A forest refugial pattern is operating in Africa, but it is not constrained to the Pleistocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological speciation 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3ageographical distribution 3alowland forests 3alowlands 3amodels 3amontane forests 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3azoogeography 3aAfrica1 aOutlaw, Robert K.1 aBowie, Rauri C.

A total of five different systems were prepared, and characterized by photon correlation spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and infrared spectroscopy. The SLN formulation showing optimal properties (lowest size and polydispersity index and highest zeta potential) was obtained with stearic acid and taurodeoxycholate as cosurfactant. This formulation was loaded with Calendula officinalis extract, a natural compound used on ophthalmic formulations given its anti-inflammatory, emollient, and wound repairing activity. Calendula-loaded SLN preparations were characterized in order to determine loading capacity and entrapment efficiency. In vitro cytotoxicity and wound healing efficacy of Calendula-loaded SLN compared to that of a free plant extract were evaluated on a conjunctival epithelium cell line WKD. Our results suggest that this SLN formulation is a safe and solvent-free Calendula extract delivery system which could provide a controlled therapeutic alternative for reducing disease-related symptoms and improving epithelium repair in ocular surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalendula officinalis 3abile salts 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aepithelium 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananoparticles 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphotons 3aplant extracts 3astearic acid 3atissue repair 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aSLN 0aPA 0aSA 0aAA 0aC 0aTC 0aTDC 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aCalendula officinalis 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aCytotoxicity 0aRe-epithelialization1 aSalado, Clarisa1 aVega, Sandra1 aAizpurua-Olaizola, Oier1 aArada, Igor de la1 aSuarez, Tatiana1 aUsobiaga, Aresatz1 aArrondo, José Luis R.,1 aAlonso, Alicia1 aGoñi, Félix M.,1 aAlkorta, Itziar0 tColloids and surfaces.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 135 p.18-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245006600168300001600234520192900250592002802179650002202207650001502229650001602244650003302260650001002293650002002303650002302323650001602346650001202362650002302374650002402397650001502421650002702436650002802463650001702491653001502508653001302523653002502536773015302561856007902714852000902793655001202802IND60522846420221119043915.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052284642DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1991-9-10172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatzios, Kriton K.13aAn Overview of the Mechanisms of Action of Herbicide Safeners  ap. 819-827.  aHerbicide safeners are chemicals used for manipulating the tolerance of large-seeded grass crops to selected soil-applied herbicides. The physiological interactions of herbicides and their respective safeners are characterized by the following facts: a) safeners are most effective when applied prior to or simultaneously with the herbicides whose injury they prevent; b) safeners exhibit a high degree of botanical and chemical specificity protecting only certain grasses against injury caused from specific classes of herbicides; and c) protected grass crops are moderately tolerant to the antagonized herbicides. At the biochemical level, safeners may act either as “bioregulators” regulating the amount of a given herbicide that reaches its target site in an active form or as “antagonists” of herbicidal effects at a similar site of action. A safener-induced enhancement of herbicide detoxication in protected plants is currently viewed as the most apparent mechanism for the action of the currently available safeners. Safeners enhance the conjugation of carbamothioate and chloroacetanilide herbicides with glutathione either by elevating the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) or by inducing the activity of specific glutathione S̱-transferases (GSTs). A safener-induced enhancement of the activity of other degradative enzymes such as the cytochrome P450-dependent mixed function oxidases or UDP-glucosyl transferases seems to be important for the protective action of safeners against injury from aryloxyphenoxypropionate, imidazolinone, and sulfonylurea herbicides. Metabolic processes related to acetyl-CoA metabolism have been implicated as likely target sites for a competitive antagonism between safeners and chloroacetanilide or carbamothioate herbicides. At the molecular level, the “gene activation” and “gene amplification” theories offer a likely explanation for the action of safeners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3achloroacetanilide herbicides 3acrops 3agene activation 3agene amplification 3aglutathione 3agrasses 3aherbicide safeners 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amixed function oxidase 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3atransferases 0aHerbicides 0aSafeners 0aMechanisms of Action0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 46, no. 9-10 p.819-827dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1991-9-10173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245013800169300002000307520133300327592002801660650003401688650001101722650003001733650000901763650001501772700001901787700005701806773013801863856008002001852000902081655001202090IND60606719020180918000000.0180727e20180702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060671902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b043422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVölkner, Johannes10aAssignment of NEXAFS Resonances in Alkanethiols and Their Implication on the Determination of Molecular Orientation of Aliphatic SAMs  ap. 16810-16820.  aNear-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy has become a widely used technique to analyze the molecular orientation of functional adlayers by analyzing the dichroism of NEXAFS resonances. In contrast to π-conjugated systems, which exhibit distinct π* resonances whose transition dipole moments are oriented perpendicular to the aromatic planes, the analysis of purely aliphatic systems is not as straightforward and requires a precise identification of the underlying resonances and their polarization. Here, we analyze the carbon K-edge NEXAFS signature and its dichroism of a self-assembling monolayer (SAM) formed by octadecanethiol (ODT) on gold, representing the widely studied class of alkanethiol SAMs. Employing density functional theory calculations and using the transition potential method, the polarizations of all NEXAFS resonances at excitation energies around and below the ionization threshold are precisely determined. This information is then used to simulate expected dichroism curves for various adlayer arrangements that are compared with our experimental findings for ODT SAMs on single-crystalline Au(111) and polycrystalline gold surfaces. This analysis demonstrates a novel strategy to precisely deduce the molecular orientation from the experimental NEXAFS data of aliphatic SAMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3aionization1 aKlues, Michael1 aWitte, Gregor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-09530 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 02, v. 122, no. 29 p.16810-16820dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b043423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015400209300001600363520146500379592002801844596008301872596005201955596005702007596006902064650002202133650001102155650001202166650002202178650001002200650001202210650001602222650001502238650001402253650001602267650001602283650000902299650001102308650001102319650001702330650001102347650001402358650001602372651001002388700002202398700002302420773009802443856008302541852000902624655001202633IND60642369320221122081556.0200301e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236932DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-019-00637-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrillo, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6944-092310aPrevalence of Nosema microsporidians in commercial bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) is not related to the intensity of their use at the landscape scale  ap. 234-242.  aThe use of commercial bumblebees to aid crop pollination may result in overcrowding of agricultural landscapes by pollinators. Consequently, transmission of parasites between pollinators via shared flowers may be substantial. In SW Spain, we assessed the initial infection status of commercial Bombus terrestris colonies and then explored spatial and seasonal influences on changes in parasite prevalence across a landscape where bumblebee colonies are intensively used to pollinate berry crops. Colonies were placed inside strawberry greenhouse crops and in woodlands adjacent and distant to crops, in winter and in spring, as representative periods of high and low use of colonies, respectively. Worker bumblebees were collected from colonies upon arrival from a producer and 30 days after being placed in the field. The abdomen of each bumblebee was morphologically inspected for a range of internal parasites. Upon arrival, 71% of the colonies were infected by spores of Nosema. Three bumblebees from two colonies harboured Apicystis bombi spores at the end of their placement in woodlands adjacent to the crops. Nosema colony prevalence did not change significantly either among sites or between seasons. We found no evidence for the density of commercial B. terrestris impacting Nosema prevalence in those commercial colonies, but our results highlight the potential risk for parasites to be transmitted from commercial bumblebees to native pollinators.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2012-33801cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project FLORMAS  aPCIN-2014-048cBiodiversa-FACCE project ECODEAL  aSVP-2013-067592cSevero-Ochoa predoctoral fellowship  aFA1307:35075cShort Term Scientific Mission from the COST Action 3aBombus terrestris 3aNosema 3aabdomen 3aagricultural land 3acrops 3aflowers 3agreenhouses 3alandscapes 3aparasites 3apollination 3apollinators 3arisk 3aspores 3aspring 3astrawberries 3awinter 3awoodlands 3aworker bees 3aSpain1 aBrown, Mark J.

For this purpose, a model of the solar parabolic cylindrical reactor was used, which was considered the most suitable for the capture of radiation and for its mobilization. The independent variables of the simulated liquid effluent sample were pH, temperature (T), flow (Q), hexavalent chrome concentration and dependent variables were the efficiency of the results, solar radiation and titanium dioxide concentration [TiO₂]. The optimum processing values were: pH= 3.75; Q= 8.2; T= 30; [TiO₂]= 30g. The results of the simulated samples were decreasing from 0.183 mg/L to the values of the maximum permissible limits (MPL) of 0.4 mg/l. In the results carried out before the photocatalytic treatment of the actual tannery sample from the Rio Seco Industrial Park, 326.95 mg/L was obtained, the concentration of hexavalent chromium was 173.28 mg/L. After the photocatalytic treatment, 58.85 mg/L and 25.89 mg/L were obtained respectively, with a reduction of the efficiency from 3 to 1. It is feasible to perform the photocatalytic​ treatment using the Parabolic Cylinder Reactor on a semi-industrial scale for the reduction of Cr+6 to Cr+3. The research solves the current problems of the tanning companies in Arequipa. The optimal operation conditions are an exposure time of 4 h, between 10 am and 2.00 pm, with a radiation intensity of 875 W/m².  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3aenvironmental technology 3aexposure duration 3aliquids 3amodels 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar radiation 3atanneries 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 0aCatalytic photodegradation 0aSolar parabolic cylindrical concentrator 0aTannery effluent1 aBejarano-Meza, María1 aDíaz-Galdos, Miguel1 aRamos-Quispe, Teresa1 aVillalba-Condori, Klinge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8621-79420 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Feb., v. 21 p.101299-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010600162300001600268500002000284520115200304592002801456650002701484650001401511650001301525650002301538650002501561650001301586650001501599700002301614700001901637700002101656773012901677856007901806852000901885655001201894IND60588280920221120023113.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058828092DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.125212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiayue10aInfluence of the alginate production on cell‐to‐cell communication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1  ap. 239-249.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany bacteria communicate with each other through signalling molecules, a process known as cell‐to‐cell communication. During this process, it is important for the signalling molecules to: (1) reach the target cells; and (2) to be received by the cognate receptor. Barriers such as the presence of extracellular matrix may prevent signals from reaching their targets; however, the influence of the extracellular matrix on cell‐to‐cell communication has scarcely been studied. Here, we demonstrate that the overproduction of an extracellular matrix, alginate, in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid variant, alters cell‐to‐cell communication by interfering with the response to quinolone signals while having no effect on N‐acyl‐L‐homoserine lactones. The inhibition of quinolone signalling by alginate is limited to the alginate overproducer and has no effect on neighbour cells that do not produce alginate. Our study indicates that alginate overproduction affects the cell‐to‐cell communication of the mucoid variant, which may results in different downstream behaviours when it emerges in the presence of the wild‐type (WT).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aalginates 3abacteria 3acell communication 3aextracellular matrix 3alactones 3aquinolones1 aToyofuku, Masanori1 aSakai, Ryosuke1 aNomura, Nobuhiko0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2017 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.239-249dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010000173300001600273520095900289592002801248650001501276650001101291650001101302650002001313650001501333650002601348650001901374650001901393650001701412650002301429650001601452653002101468653002301489653002101512653002401533653003301557700002901590700001601619700003001635700002301665773011501688856008401803852000901887655001201896IND60132852620221120232333.0150513e20150528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013285262DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2014.9857432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Kumar Arun10aDeveloping a spectral library of mangrove species of Indian east coast using field spectroscopy  ap. 580-599.  aDevelopment of a spectral library is a prerequisite for the higher order classification of satellite data and hyperspectral image analysis to map any ecosystem with rich diversity. In this study, sampling methodology, collection of field and laboratory spectral signatures and post-processing methodologies were investigated for developing an exclusive spectral library of mangrove species using hyperspectral spectroscopic techniques. Canopy level field spectra and leaf level laboratory spectra were collected for 34 species (25 true and 9 associated mangroves) from two different mangrove ecosystems of the Indian east coast. Post-processing steps such as removal of water vapour absorption bands, correction of drifts which occur due to the thermal properties of the instrument during data collection and smoothing of spectra for its further utilisation were applied on collected spectra. The processed spectra were then compiled as spectral library.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acanopy 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3aspectroscopy 3athermal properties 3awater vapor 0aIndian mangroves 0afield spectroscopy 0aspectral library 0aspectral signatures 0ahyperspectral remote sensing1 aGnanappazham, Lakshmanan1 aSelvam, V.,1 aRamasubramanian, Ramasamy1 aKar, Chandra Sekar0 tGeocarto international.g2015 May 28, v. 30, no. 5 p.580-599dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2014.9857433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245011900172506010400291506007600395520215600471592002802627506003702655650001102692650002202703650001802725650002302743650002402766650001502790650001602805650001302821650001202834650001702846651001402863700001902877700002202896700001702918773009502935856008903030852000903119655001203128IND60706592920221207131246.0220614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070659292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1046162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuliani, E.L.10aForest or oil palm plantation?

International trade is an important factor in this process. Increasing demand on certain crops has triggered plantation expansion and deforestation, and influence local land use in other countries (land teleconnections). Oil palm expansion is one of the most prominent examples of land teleconnections. In Indonesia, oil palm plantations area increased from 1.1 million ha in 1990 to 11.2 million ha in 2015. According to the Indonesian Law on Plantation, the indigenous people's decisions play important roles in land use decisions. This paper investigates what were the factors (drivers) determining the individual-level responses to the oil palm promises in West Kalimantan. These questions are not only important for the future of Kalimantan’s rainforest but will also enrich deforestation and conservation-development discourses. We selected 49 respondents for interviews and focus groups such that people who opposed and people who supported the conversion were both well represented. Much attention was paid to arrive at a balanced set of operational variables, such as the economic resilience, agency and embeddedness of actors and the degree to which actors had appreciated and believed the oil palm promise. Data were analyzed through the QCA method. The outcomes show a perfect association of appreciation of the oil palm promises, belief in them and the decision to support the oil palm. This was not strongly associated with low economic resilience however; economically less resilient respondents could reject the oil palm conversion, while economically resilient respondents could support it. In other words, the data do not point to a poverty/deforestation nexus. Rather, the data suggest the existence of an ‘embeddedness / rejection nexus’; people that were well-connected to community, traditions and nature held long-term motivations and rejected the oil palm promise, and vice versa. More attention to this phenomenon will help bridge conservation-development objectives in Kalimantan.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aElaeis guineensis 3adeforestation 3aindigenous peoples 3ainternational trade 3aland cover 3aland policy 3aland use 3apoverty 3arain forests 3aIndonesia1 ade Groot, W.T.1 aKnippenberg, Luuk1 aBakara, D.O.0 tLand use policy.g2020 July, v. 96 p.104616-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1046163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014900205300001600354520098800370592002801358650001901386650001301405650001501418650001101433650001501444650003101459700001801490700002301508700002701531700002101558700002001579773009801599856008301697852000901780655001201789IND60642369520221122081554.0200301e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-019-00638-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkubo, Satoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3736-513X10aForage area estimation in European honeybees (Apis mellifera) by automatic waggle decoding of videos using a generic camcorder in field apiaries  ap. 243-252.  aThe waggle dances of European honeybees provide important information that can be used to estimate forage areas and identify food resource limitations. However, manually decoding these dances is labor-intensive. This study develops an automatic waggle decoding method applicable to video recordings taken in field apiaries using a generic camcorder with a normal frame rate. Particle image velocimetry was used to detect the typical characteristics of abdominal waggling in bees. We demonstrated our proposed method using video recordings taken at three hives in field apiaries. The decoded information was used to estimate forage area, which was compared against estimates obtained from manual decoding. For all three video recordings, we obtained a 78–87% overlap in the probable forage regions estimated using automatic and manual decoding. Our results suggest that our automatic decoding method is comparable to manual interpretation for the purposes of forage area estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aapiaries 3abee dances 3aforage 3ahoney bees 3aparticle image velocimetry1 aNikkeshi, Aoi1 aS.

By and large, rural producer social networks are important to the exchange of information on such complex systems and associated agrarian management practices. These information networks are not restricted to producers as other agrarian-based organizations are active within the larger agricultural innovation system. However, little is known about the effects of such organizational ties on the emergent properties of producer network structures, which play a critical role in the successful exchange of complex agrarian information and the adoption of management practices that result in higher agrodiversity. Accordingly, this study investigates information network structures within the agrarian environment in order to understand the barriers to, and development of, effective farm management, specifically the management of agrodiversity. Network data was collected from producers in two geographically separate areas in the economically important cocoa (Theobroma cacao) growing region of Ghana [Site A, located close to an urban centre, had high frequency of contact with agro-environmental organizations and Site B, in a remote location, had a low frequency of contact] on the exchange of agroforestry management practices. Results showed that although 31% of producers in Site A relied exclusively on fellow producers for agroecological information, the majority of producers formed ties to one or more of the rural organizations operating within these communities. And producers with greater access to organizations were situated in agrarian information networks with lower density, thus more diffuse networks. Furthermore, producers with ties to organizations were likely to be positioned in more efficient information networks as identified by a low level of redundant ties and this efficiency was positively correlated to higher reported on-farm agrodiversity. The success of information exchange on agro-environmental practices, such as managing agrodiversity, within producer networks may be distinctly coupled with the presence of organizational ties. Unlike common-pooled resources that may require highly dense networks for trust-based collective action, diverse agricultural systems that are innovation driven arguably require diffuse networks for efficient exchange of complex information. Policy that promotes appropriate network structures for the exchange of such information is strategic for persistent cocoa production systems. This study provides further evidence of the role of information networks on the exchange and practice of innovation in agricultural systems, particularly in developing country agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3aagroforestry 3acollective action 3acorrelation 3acrop production 3adeveloping countries 3afarm management 3ainformation exchange 3ainformation networks 3aissues and policy 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3asocial networks 3atopology 3aGhana0 tAgricultural systems.g2012 June, v. 109 p.9-15dElsevier Ltdx0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245008600158300001600244500002000260520111300280592002801393650001201421650001201433650002101445650001801466650001401484650001101498650002201509650002801531700002501559700002201584700002001606700002601626700002301652700002001675773012901695856007901824852000901903655001201912IND60588281020221117182145.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058828102DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.125252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Wei10aInfluence of oxygen availability on the activities of ammonia‐oxidizing archaea  ap. 250-256.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent studies point to the importance of oxygen (O₂) in controlling the distribution and activity of marine ammonia‐oxidizing archaea (AOA), one of the most abundant prokaryotes in the ocean. The AOA are associated with regions of low O₂ tension in oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), and O₂ availability is suggested to influence their production of the ozone‐depleting greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N₂O). We show that marine AOA available in pure culture sustain high ammonia oxidation activity at low μM O₂ concentrations, characteristic of suboxic regions of OMZs (<10 µM O₂), and that atmospheric concentrations of O₂ may inhibit the growth of some environmental populations. We quantify the increasing N₂O production by marine AOA with decreasing O₂ tensions, consistent with the plausibility of an AOA contribution to the accumulation of N₂O at the oxic‐anoxic redox boundaries of OMZs. Variable sensitivity to peroxide also suggests that endogenous or exogenous reactive oxygen species are of importance in determining the environmental distribution of some populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprokaryotic cells 3areactive oxygen species1 aMeinhardt, Kelley A.1 aMoffett, James W.1 aDevol, Allan H.1 aVirginia Armbrust, E.1 aIngalls, Anitra E.1 aStahl, David A.0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2017 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.250-256dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.125253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013000172300001800302520140500320592002801725650002301753650002301776650002401799650002201823650002201845650002701867650004701894650002601941650002001967650001901987700001902006700002102025700001802046700002902064773010402093856004802197852000902245655001202254IND50066535820221116182405.0130519e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006653582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1217-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Janhvi Mishra10aISSR and RAPD based evaluation of genetic fidelity and active ingredient analysis of regenerated plants of Picrorhiza kurroa   ap. 1797-1805.  aGenetic stability and phytochemical analysis of in vitro established plants of Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth, have been carried out. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers were used to assess the genetic fidelity of tissue culture products including three adventitious shoots from three calli and 6 months old tissue culture raised plants growing in green house condition with mother plant. Apparent genetic variation was detected in the five types of plant materials. The percentage of polymorphic bands in the RAPD and ISSR analysis were 16.25 and 14.54 %, respectively. The genetic similarity was calculated on the basis of RAPD and ISSR data among the five types of plant materials and were ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 (mean 0.75) and 0.47 to 1.0 (mean 0.73), respectively. The similarity coefficient by both RAPD and ISSR analysis revealed that differences between tissue culture raised plants and mother plant was not remarkable, but notable differences were observed among three adventitious shoots regenerated from three calli. The phytochemical analysis of tissue culture raised products showed higher secondary metabolite (picrotin and picrotoxinin) content as compare to mother plant. The information gained on genetic stability/variability will be valuable for the large scale propagation and secondary metabolite production of P. kurroa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicrorhiza kurrooa 3aactive ingredients 3aadventitious shoots 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3asecondary metabolites 3atissue analysis 3atissue culture1 aRawat, Balwant1 aMehrotra, Shakti1 aChandra, Anup1 aNautiyal, S.q(Subhash),0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2013 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.1797-1805dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1217-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245009200178500001900270520166400289592002801953650001201981650002301993650001502016650002502031650001602056650001602072650001302088650000902101650001202110650003002122651001702152653001102169653002102180653001602201653003202217653002902249653002802278700001702306700002602323700001902349700002602368700002502394700004202419773009602461856008902557852000902646655001202655IND60706593120221120211153.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070659312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1049392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClements, Hayley S.14aThe relevance of ecosystem services to land reform policies: Insights from South Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLand reform is an important socio-political strategy in many countries. Despite the importance of ecosystem health in attaining land reform objectives, human-nature interactions have been largely absent from contemporary land reform discussions. In this perspectives paper, we highlight why land reform programmes could benefit from considering ecosystem services in their planning processes, to better achieve their goals of socio-economic development and equity. Drawing on examples from South Africa, we argue that an ecosystem services lens can help achieve equity in land reform programmes by providing insight into how land-use legacies and the multi-functional nature of landscapes influence who benefits from land reform across space and through time. An ecosystem services lens also broadens understanding of how fragmentation and a changing climate may affect land reform benefits over time. In ignoring these human-nature interactions, and often unquestioningly applying one-size-fit-all approaches, land-reform policies risk missing the ultimate needs of beneficiaries and broader society. Considering these insights, we discuss practical implications of an ecosystem services lens for land reform programmes. These include the need for context-sensitive, localized land reform planning that accounts for ecosystem service heterogeneity, possible trade-offs, and beneficiaries’ preferences and capacities. Accordingly, extension services need to possess local knowledge and avoid generic, top-down and inflexible approaches. These social-ecological considerations are imperative if countries are to achieve sustainable and equitable land reform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aland policy 3aland reform 3aland use 3arisk 3asociety 3asocioeconomic development 3aSouth Africa 0aEquity 0aHuman well-being 0aLivelihoods 0aMulti-functional landscapes 0aSocial-ecological system 0aSustainable development1 aDe Vos, Alta1 aBezerra, Joana Carlos1 aCoetzer, Kaera1 aMaciejewski, Kristine1 aMograbi, Penelope J.1 aShackleton, C.

A quality by design (QbD) approach was applied to the production of w/o emulsions stabilized by starch. A screening design was conducted to identify the critical variables of the formula and the process affecting the critical quality properties of the emulsion (droplet size distribution). The optimization was made by establishing the Design Space, adjusting the concentration of starch and the quantity of the internal aqueous phase. The emulsion production process was, in turn, adjusted by varying the time and speed of stirring, to ensure quality and minimum variability. The stability was also investigated, demonstrating that an increase in starch concentration improves the stability of the emulsion. Rheological and mechanical studies indicated that the viscosity of the emulsions was enhanced by the addition of starch and, to a higher extent, by the presence of different lipids. The developed formulations was considered non-irritant, by an in vitro assay using human cells from skin (Df and HaCat) with the cell viability higher than 90% and, with self-preserving properties. Finally, the QbD approach successfully built quality in Pickering emulsions, allowing the development of hydrophilic drug-loaded emulsions stabilized by starch with desired organoleptic and structural characteristics. The results obtained suggest that these systems are a promising vehicle to be used in products for topical administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3acolloids 3adroplet size 3adrugs 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ain vitro studies 3alipids 3amixing 3ascreening 3astarch 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 0aPickering emulsions 0aStarch granules 0aQuality by design 0aSkin application1 aGouveia, L.1 aJorge, I.M.1 aDuarte, A.1 aGonçalves, L.M.1 aSilva, S.M.C.1 aAntunes, F.1 aPais, A.A.C.C.1 aOliveira, E.1 aAlmeida, A.J.1 aRibeiro, H.M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 135 p.183-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009900157300001600256520122500272592002801497650001101525650002101536650002301557650001201580650002301592650001101615650002201626650001001648650002501658650001101683650001601694650001101710650001901721650001201740650001201752650000801764651001001772700001501782700001801797700001701815773011801832856007401950852000902024655001202033IND60481830120221118123809.0160210e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048183012DNAL7 a10.1111/ijcs.122492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fuqiao10aWhat factors are influencing tea consumption among Chinese urban residents? An empirical study  ap. 249-254.  aUsing primary data collected from a questionnaire survey in 12 cities in China, we set up a model to analyze the influencing factors of Chinese urban residents' tea consumption. Three groups of factors are considered in the model, i.e., demographic and personal characteristics, economic factors and consumption habits. Research findings indicate that tea consumption is significantly impacted by gender difference, personal income, consumption atmosphere and habitual factors. This has important policy implications for tea marketing. First of all, it is essential to develop more tea products that cater to the needs of urban females while at the meantime securing the steady growth of tea consumption among males. Second, in light of the consumption discrepancies between families, areas and occupations, differentiated marketing strategies should be created with an emphasis on cultivating and taking advantage of consumption atmosphere in the society. In addition, income disparities call for diversified tea products with affordable prices. It is also suggested that educational programs on tea consumption be advocated to promote the consumption frequency and quantity of tea both in China and in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aeconomic factors 3aeducation programs 3afemales 3agender differences 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amales 3amarketing strategies 3amodels 3aoccupations 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3asociety 3asurveys 3atea 3aChina1 aLi, Shujie1 aJiang, Renhua1 aJiang, Aiqin0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2016 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.249-254dBlackwell Sciencex1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.122493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245004700172300001800219520125400237592002801491650001601519650001601535650001101551650001101562651001201573653001301585653001401598653001401612653001301626653001701639700001801656700001801674773011101692856008401803852000901887655001201896IND60132852920221120232307.0150513e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013285292DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2013.8020462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoper, Clyde F.E.10aParalarval octopods of the Florida Current  ap. 1281-1304.  aTaxonomic and ecological aspects of paralarval octopods from the Florida Current (Gulf Stream) waters off Fort Pierce, Florida are reported. Nine external morphological features were analysed in each specimen, including chromatophore patterns and meristic characters. The relative abundance of each species present in the collections made at standard stations [2–26 nautical miles (nmi) offshore at 2-nmi intervals; 1 nmi = 1.8520 km] was determined in relation to seasonal occurrence, depth of capture, distance offshore and time of day/night. The most common species in the samples was Octopus “ vulgaris ”, followed by Amphioctopus burryi and Macrotritopus defilippi (two morphs). Two forms could not be verified to species, but they most closely resemble Scaeurgus unicirrhus and “ Octopus ” joubini . The seasonal distribution of the most commonly captured species showed peak relative abundance in the summer months. Paralarval octopods were captured most frequently in the standard stations between 18 and 22 nmi (29.6–40.7 km) offshore in the mid-depth stratum of the water column. Most of the species represented in this study were captured in higher numbers at night than during the day, with the exception of A. burryi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGulf Stream 3aOctopodidae 3amorphs 3asummer 3aFlorida 0aOctopoda 0aIncirrata 0aparalarva 0ataxonomy 0adistribution1 aGutierrez, A.1 aVecchione, M.0 tJournal of natural history.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 49, no. 21-24 p.1281-1304dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2013.8020463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013000172300001600302520135200318592002801670650001601698650001701714650001601731650001601747650001301763650002201776650003801798650001601836650001001852650001601862650002001878650001001898650003101908650002501939650000901964650001301973653001401986653002102000653002402021653002302045653002002068700003002088700002102118700002302139700002302162700002202185700002002207773010802227856008602335852000902421655001202430IND60553114520221121062238.0161021e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055311452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahangiri, Azin10aPhysicochemical characterization and pharmacological evaluation of ezetimibe-PVP K30 solid dispersions in hyperlipidemic rats  ap. 423-430.  aThe aim of this study was to improve the physicochemical properties as well as therapeutic efficacy of ezetimibe (EZT), through preparation of the solid dispersion (SD).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffractometery (PXRD) showed that the drug crystallinity was remarkably decreased during preparation process. Faster drug release pattern of SDs was proved by in vitro dissolution test. Administration the SD of EZT led to a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C level as well as liver index in hyperlipidemic rats (P<0.05) compared to the PM. Furthermore, histological analysis of the liver tissue confirmed the improved efficacy of the SDs on the liver steatosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the SDs of EZT with improved physicochemical characteristics had favorable effects on liver steatosis, liver index and serum lipid levels in the high fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acolloids 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adispersions 3adrugs 3afatty liver 3ain vivo studies 3aliver 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3arats 3asolvents 0aEzetimibe 0aSolid dispersion 0aSolvent evaporation 0aIn vivo evaluation 0aLiver steatosis1 aBarzegar-Jalali, Mohammad1 aGarjani, Alireza1 aJavadzadeh, Yousef1 aHamishehkar, Hamed1 aRameshrad, Maryam1 aAdibkia, Khosro0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 134 p.423-430dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245015900165300001600324500002000340520140900360592002801769650001301797650001701810650002001827650001301847650001501860650001501875650001001890650001201900650002101912650002301933650002501956650001101981650002201992650002902014650002702043650002502070650001502095650001702110650004102127650001902168650000902187650001002196650001902206651001102225700002802236700002502264700002302289700002702312700002002339700001902359700003302378700002702411700002102438700002002459700002002479700002102499700002002520700003602540700002002576700001702596700002602613700001702639700002502656700002202681700003002703700001902733773012902752856007902881852000902960655001202969IND60588281220221117182059.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058828122DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.125022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaoro, Helisson14aThe oil‐contaminated soil diazotroph Azoarcus olearius DQS‐4T is genetically and phenotypically similar to the model grass endophyte Azoarcus sp.

The genome sequence showed high synteny with Azoarcus sp. BH72, a model endophytic diazotroph, but low synteny with five non‐plant‐associated strains (Azoarcus CIB, Azoarcus EBN1, Azoarcus KH32C, A. toluclasticus MF63ᵀ and Azoarcus PA01). Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) revealed that DQS‐4ᵀ shares 98.98% identity with Azoarcus BH72, which should now be included in the species A. olearius. The genome of DQS‐4ᵀ contained several genes related to plant colonization and plant growth promotion, such as nitrogen fixation, plant adhesion and root surface colonization. In accordance with the presence of these genes, DQS‐4ᵀ colonized rice (Oryza sativa) and Setaria viridis, where it was observed within the intercellular spaces and aerenchyma mainly of the roots. Although they promote the growth of grasses, the mechanism(s) of plant growth promotion by A. olearius strains is unknown, as the genomes of DQS‐4ᵀ and BH72 do not contain genes for indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis nor phosphate solubilization. In spite of its original source, both the genome and behaviour of DQS‐4ᵀ suggest that it has the capacity to be an endophytic, nitrogen‐fixing plant growth‐promoting bacterium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzoarcus 3aOryza sativa 3aSetaria viridis 3aadhesion 3aaerenchyma 3aendophytes 3agenes 3agrasses 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3aintercellular spaces 3amodels 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anitrogen-fixing plants 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apolluted soils 3arice 3aroots 3asolubilization 3aTaiwan1 aRene Menegazzo, Rodrigo1 aBattistoni, Federico1 aGyaneshwar, Prasad1 ado Amaral, Fernanda P.1 aTaulé, Cecilia1 aRausch, Sydnee1 aGonçalves Galvão, Patricia1 ade los Santos, Cecilia1 aMitra, Shubhajit1 aHeijo, Gabriela1 aSheu, Shih‐Yi1 aChen, Wen‐Ming1 aMareque, Cintia1 aZibetti Tadra‐Sfeir, Michelle1 aIvo Baldani, J.1 aMaluk, Marta1 aPaula Guimarães, Ana1 aStacey, Gary1 ade Souza, Emanuel M.1 aPedrosa, Fabio O.1 aMagalhães Cruz, Leonardo1 aJames, Euan K.0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2017 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.223-238dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.125023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245006300207300001600270520086000286592002801146650001901174650002201193650001101215650001501226650002501241650001501266650001201281650002001293650002001313650001001333650001101343700001901354700002501373700002001398700002201418773009801440856008201538852000901620655001201629IND60642369820221122081616.0200301e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236982DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-018-0625-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColin, Théotime1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0223-447910aEffects of thymol on European honey bee hygienic behaviour  ap. 141-152.  aThe parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a major threat to the European honey bee Apis mellifera. Beekeepers apply the miticide thymol directly within the hives to kill this parasitic mite. Thymol is repellent to bees and causes them to ventilate the hive, yet its impact on bee hygienic behaviours that prevent the spread of diseases has never been studied. We measured the efficiency of colonies at removing dead adult bees, uncapping dead pupal cells and removing dead brood in two miticide-free Australian environments where the mite is absent. Thymol increased the uncapping and removal of dead brood by 24 to 36% after 48 h at both locations but had no effect on the removal of dead adult bees. The increased removal of brood could enhance the effect of thymol on V. destructor, especially if bees preferentially remove cells infected with the mite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aadults 3abeekeepers 3adisease transmission 3ahoney bees 3ahygiene 3ainsect behavior 3aparasitic mites 3apupae 3athymol1 aLim, Meng Yong1 aQuarrell, Stephen R.1 aAllen, Geoff R.1 aBarron, Andrew B.0 tApidologie.g2019 Apr., v. 50, no. 2 p.141-152dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-018-0625-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001800253520173900271592002802010650000802038650005202046650002402098650002502122650000902147650001502156650001302171650002402184650005202208650000902260650001902269700001402288700001702302700005402319700005702373773012902430856008502559852000902644655001202653IND60770364820221119184259.0220315e20220302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077036482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c001692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyaruaba, Raphael10aLong-Term Preservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Silk for Downstream RT-PCR Tests  ap. 4522-4530.  aPositive controls made of viral gene components are essential to validate the performance of diagnostic assays for pathogens like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, most of them are target-specific, limiting their application spectrum when validating assays beyond their specified targets. The use of an inactivated whole-virus RNA reference standard could be ideal, but RNA is a labile molecule that needs cold chain storage and transportation to preserve its integrity and activity. The cold chain process stretches the already dwindling storage capacities, incurs huge costs, and limits the distribution of reference materials to low-resource settings. To circumvent these issues, we developed an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference standard and studied its stability in silk fibroin matrices, i.e., silk solution (SS) and silk film (SF). Compared to preservation in nuclease-free water (ddH₂O) and SS, SF was more stable and could preserve the SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference standard at room temperature for over 21 weeks (∼6 months) as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The preserved RNA reference standard in SF was able to assess the limits of detection of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. In addition, SF is compatible with RT-PCR reactions and can be used to preserve a reaction-ready primer and probe mix for RT-PCR at ambient temperatures without affecting their activity. Taken together, these results offer extensive flexibility and a simpler mechanism of preserving RNA reference materials for a long time at ambient temperatures of ≥25 °C, with the possibility of eliminating cold chains during storage and transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aambient temperature 3aanalytical chemistry 3acold 3acold chain 3afibroins 3areference standards 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asilk 3atransportation1 aHong, Wei1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aYang, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6750-14651 aWei, Hongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9948-88800 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 02, v. 94, no. 10 p.4522-4530dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c001693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001600269520110900285592002801394650001101422650001501433650002101448650001501469650002201484650001701506650001501523650001501538650001401553650002601567650001701593650001401610650001801624653001901642653003701661653002401698653003401722653001901756700002201775700001701797700001801814700002001832773011201852856008201964852000902046655001202055IND60634675120221120175518.0190325e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063467512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Thy L.T.10aDetermining mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell count using electrochemical collision events  ap. 155-159.  aBlood tests (e.g., red blood cell (RBC) count) are crucial for detecting, diagnosing, and monitoring the progression of blood disorders. Here, we report the development of a new and rapid method for electrochemically detecting RBCs using single-particle collision events. The principle of this method relies on the electrochemical oxidation of an electroactive redox species (potassium ferrocyanide) hindered by an RBC attached to an electrode surface. A decrease in staircase current, caused by the collision of RBCs on the electrode, was observed. The magnitude of this current decrease could provide quantitative information on the size and concentration of RBCs, which could be converted into the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and used for diagnosis. Anemia-related diseases caused by abnormal count of RBCs (e.g., erythrocytosis, pernicious anemia) or abnormal RBC size (e.g. megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia) could be detected easily and quickly using this electrochemical collision method, potentially leading to extensive applications in hematology and point-of-care blood testing devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aerythrocyte count 3aerythrocytes 3ahematology 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolycythemia 3apotassium 3arapid methods 0aRed blood cell 0aElectrochemical collision method 0aUltramicroelectrode 0aMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 0aAnemia sensing1 aHoang, Nhung T.T.1 aLee, Jungeun1 aPark, Jun Hui1 aKim, Byung-Kwon0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 July 01, v. 110 p.155-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012700165300001400292500001500306520137500321592002801696650001301724650002001737650002001757650001401777650002001791650001601811650001401827650002401841650001301865650001401878650001201892650002101904650001101925653003201936653003401968653000802002653000802010653001002018653000802028653000902036653001202045653003602057653001202093653001202105653001002117653000802127653000902135653001102144653000802155653000802163653001302171653001102184653002302195653000802218653001302226653000802239653000702247653000702254653000802261700001802269700002002287700005202307700001402359700005802373773008802431856008502519852000902604655001202613IND60560717820221119052825.0180905e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056071782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lifang10aIsolation and characterization of curcin genes with distinct expression patterns in leaves and seeds of Jatropha curcas L.  ap. 34-44.  a2019-12-06  aJatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is an emerging biofuel plant, of which its seed oil is suitable for biodiesel production. Curcin, a type 1 ribosome inactivating protein, is the major toxic protein found in jatropha seeds. Here we report the cloning and characterization of three curcin genes from J. curcas MD44. The Curcin 1 (C1) gene encodes a Type I curcin precursor containing 293 amino acid residues. The C1 gene is specifically expressed in the endosperm of jatropha seeds at late developmental stage. The Curcin 2A (C2A) gene encodes a Type II curcin precursor containing 309 amino acid residues and is mainly expressed in young leaves of J. curcas. The Curcin 2B (C2B) gene is another Type II curcin gene that is physically linked to the C1 gene. However, the expression of the C2B gene was not detected in leaves or seeds of jatropha plants growing under normal growth condition. A conserved 227-bp or 228-bp intron was identified or predicted in the 5′ untranslated region of the three curcin genes. A C1 promoter (−2888bp to +293bp) was identified to harbor all cis-elements that are required for full promoter activity in jatropha endosperm. The isolation of the three curcin genes and the endosperm-specific C1 promoter provide useful information and research materials for further functional study of curcin proteins and genetic engineering of J. curcas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3aJatropha curcas 3afuel production 3aribosomes 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3aendosperm 3agenetic engineering 3atoxicity 3abiodiesel 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3aleaves 0aEndosperm-specific promoter 0aRibosome inactivating protein 0aGUS 0aRIP 0agenes 0aBAC 0aRACE 0a5′UTR 0aTissue-specific gene expression 0a3′UTR 0aqRT-PCR 0aseeds 0aERE 0aUbi1 0aX-Gluc 0aC2A 0aPAG 0aTAIL-PCR 0aCurcin 0aJatropha curcas L. 0aC2B 0aJcActin1 0akDa 0aC1 0aSD 0aSNP1 aGoh, Mei Ling1 aTian, Dongsheng1 aGu, Keyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3300-18731 aHong, Yan1 aYin, Zhongchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8519-58790 tPlant gene.g2017 Mar., v. 9 p.34-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011700211300002000328520118300348592002801531650001601559650002301575650001801598650002001616650001801636650001201654650001101666650001301677650002201690650001601712650001601728650001101744653002401755653001201779653002501791700006101816700001601877700006401893700005901957773014602016856008602162852000902248655001202257IND60760375220220219000000.0211220e20211109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076037522DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c053532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPin, Thaynara C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9597-123410aEffect of Protic Ionic Liquids in Sugar Cane Bagasse Pretreatment for Lignin Valorization and Ethanol Production  ap. 16965-16976.  aIonic liquids have been called designer solvents because it is possible to fine-tune their properties from a huge range of possible combinations of cations and anions. In this work, we evaluate the potential of protic ionic liquids (PILs) in the fractionation of sugar cane bagasse in a biorefinery context. The PILs were designed to selectively solubilize lignin and leave a polysaccharides solid fraction. The carbohydrate fraction was further hydrolyzed to obtain pentose and hexose sugars, which were fermented using a pentose-consuming yeast. The results have shown that, differently from pretreatments that solubilize hemicelluloses, pentoses could be fermented together with hexoses without a prior detoxification step with high yield and productivity. The lignin recovered was characterized by 2D HSQC NMR, ³¹P NMR, and GPC, showing that the design of the PIL influences lignin characteristics, but pretreatment temperature and time do not. The lignins obtained are sulfur-free, and the richness of their functional groups makes them attractive for conversion into a diversity of value-added products, which can make a biorefinery based on the proposed process viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3aethanol production 3afractionation 3agreen chemistry 3ahemicellulose 3ahexoses 3alignin 3apentoses 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3avalue added 3ayeasts 0aprotic ionic liquid 0abiomass 0aenzymatic hydrolysis1 aRabelo, Sarita C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-76741 aPu, Yunqiao1 aRagauskas, Arthur J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-554X1 aCosta, Aline C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4586-68820 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Nov. 09, v. 9, no. 50 p.16965-16976dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c053533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245016300193300001800356520102500374592002801399650002101427650002301448650002101471650001501492650001201507650001701519650001301536650003901549650001601588650001401604650004301618650003201661650002701693650002701720650004001747650005401787650002401841650001701865650004401882700002101926700002201947700002201969773012701991856004802118852000902166655001202175IND4479676320221120144032.0121003e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447967632DNAL7 a226387892pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-012-1122-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Gutiérrez, Iván10aCell surface display of a β-glucosidase employing the type V secretion system on ethanologenic Escherichia coli for the fermentation of cellobiose to ethanol  ap. 1141-1152.  aWe used the autodisplay system AIDA-I, which belongs to the type V secretion system (TVSS), to display the β-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca on the outer membrane of the ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain MS04 (MG1655 ∆pflB, ∆adhE, ∆frdA, ∆xylFGH, ∆ldhA, PpflB::pdc Zm -adhB Zm ). MS04 that was transformed with the plasmid pAIDABglCRHis showed cellobiase activity (171 U/gCDW) and fermented 40 g/l cellobiose in mineral medium in 60 h with an ethanol yield of 81 % of the theoretical maximum. Whole-cell protease treatment, SDS-PAGE, and Western-blot analysis demonstrated that BglC was attached to the external surface of the outer membrane of MS04. When attached to the cells, BglC showed 93.3 % relative activity in the presence of 40 g/l ethanol and retained 100 % of its activity following 2 days of incubation at 37 °C with the same ethanol concentration.

Whilst it is known that underweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m²) and malnourished individuals have an increased risk of developing PI, few studies have investigated the effects of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) on PI prevalence. This study aimed to determine whether PI prevalence was associated with levels of obesity; the complex association between morbid obesity, malnutrition and PI prevalence in hospital inpatients was also explored.Data collected from annual Queensland Patient Safety Bedside Audits conducted between 2010 and 2015 was used to examine the outcomes of interest (n = 2479). Bivariate tests were used to explore relationships between age, gender, BMI, malnutrition and PI prevalence. Regression analysis explored associations between BMI, malnutrition and PI, adjusting for potential confounders.Overall PI prevalence was 6.9% and was significantly higher in the underweight and morbidly obese groups (underweight 12.7%, healthy weight 7.8%, overweight 5.7%, obese 4.8%, morbidly obese 12%; p = 0.001). In addition to BMI, malnutrition and age were significantly associated with PI prevalence. After adjusting for confounders, morbidly obese inpatients had over three times the odds of developing a PI compared to healthy weight inpatients (OR = 3.478, 95% CI 1.657–7.303; p = 0.001). Morbidly obese inpatients who were also malnourished had eleven-fold greater odds of developing a PI compared to the morbidly obese well-nourished in logistic regression analysis (OR = 11.143, 95% CI 2.279–54.481, p = 0.003).Morbid obesity is a significant and independent risk factor for PI development. However, the clustering of nutritional risk factors (morbid obesity and malnutrition) substantially increases this risk. Therefore, routine and formal assessment of both BMI and malnutrition status are important to enable the identification of patients at high risk of PI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaudits 3abody mass index 3agender 3ahealth care costs 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3anutrition risk assessment 3aobesity 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aunderweight 3aQueensland 0aPressure injury 0aPressure ulcer 0aObesity 0aBody Mass Index 0aMalnutrition 0aNutrition status 0aBMI 0aPI 0aWHO1 aHickling, Donna F.1 aBell, Jack J.1 aCollins, Peter F.0 tClinical nutrition.g2018 Oct., v. 37, no. 5 p.1569-1574dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245012600170500001900296520153700315592002801852650002101880650001501901650002601916650002401942650001701966650002501983650001202008650002302020650001102043650001002054650001002064650001502074650001702089650001202106650004302118650001202161650002102173650002002194700002002214700002502234700002102259700002102280700002002301700002402321700001902345700002002364700002202384700001702406700002102423700002302444700002002467700002402487700002602511773012602537856007802663852000902741655001202750IND60738708120221122235829.0210524e20210430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073870812DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100507112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWardelmann, Kristina 10aCentral Acting Hsp10 Regulates Mitochondrial Function, Fatty Acid Metabolism, and Insulin Sensitivity in the Hypothalamus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMitochondria are critical for hypothalamic function and regulators of metabolism. Hypothalamic mitochondrial dysfunction with decreased mitochondrial chaperone expression is present in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, we demonstrated that a dysregulated mitochondrial stress response (MSR) with reduced chaperone expression in the hypothalamus is an early event in obesity development due to insufficient insulin signaling. Although insulin activates this response and improves metabolism, the metabolic impact of one of its members, the mitochondrial chaperone heat shock protein 10 (Hsp10), is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that a reduction of Hsp10 in hypothalamic neurons will impair mitochondrial function and impact brain insulin action. Therefore, we investigated the role of chaperone Hsp10 by introducing a lentiviral-mediated Hsp10 knockdown (KD) in the hypothalamic cell line CLU-183 and in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of C57BL/6N male mice. We analyzed mitochondrial function and insulin signaling utilizing qPCR, Western blot, XF96 Analyzer, immunohistochemistry, and microscopy techniques. We show that Hsp10 expression is reduced in T2D mice brains and regulated by leptin in vitro. Hsp10 KD in hypothalamic cells induced mitochondrial dysfunction with altered fatty acid metabolism and increased mitochondria-specific oxidative stress resulting in neuronal insulin resistance. Consequently, the reduction of Hsp10 in the ARC of C57BL/6N mice caused hypothalamic insulin resistance with acute liver insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acell lines 3afatty acid metabolism 3aheat shock proteins 3ahypothalamus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleptin 3aliver 3amales 3amicroscopy 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3astress response1 aRath, Michaela 1 aCastro, José  Pedro1 aBlümel, Sabine 1 aSchell, Mareike 1 aHauffe, Robert 1 aSchumacher, Fabian 1 aFlore, Tanina 1 aRitter, Katrin 1 aWernitz, Andreas 1 aHosoi, Toru 1 aOzawa, Koichiro 1 aKleuser, Burkhard 1 aWeiss, Jürgen,1 aSchurmann, Annette,1 aKleinridders, André 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Apr. 30, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100507113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011800156300002200274520097100296592002801267650001301295650002101308650001001329650001001339650001801349650001301367650001901380650001301399650001601412650001501428700001801443700001601461700001601477773012701493856007501620852000901695655001201704IND60641329820221120072425.0210813e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064132982DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22674d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yuxiao10aConstruction of ZnO/Cu₂SnS₃ nanorod array films for enhanced photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity  ap. 104041-104048.  aZnO nanorod array films grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrates were homogeneously coated with visible light responsive Cu₂SnS₃ nanoparticles through a controllable one-step electrodeposition process.

A three-dimensional interpenetrating network of TiO₂ nanowires (3-D IPN TNWs) was successfully prepared on Ti foil through a facile hydrothermal approach. A TiO₂ colloid was coated on the 3-D IPN TNWs to form a large-area flexible anode using a doctor-scraping technique. The influences of the concentration of NaOH on the growth of 3-D IPN TNWs and on the photovoltaic performances of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated. Under an optimized condition, the power conversion efficiency of a large-area (100 cm²) flexible DSSC reached 6.43%, with a short-circuit current density of 6.83 mA cm⁻², an open circuit voltage of 0.724 V, and a fill factor of 0.715. Under irradiation with a natural light intensity of 55 mW cm⁻² outdoors, the efficiency of power conversion was increased by 10.29% compared with the flexible DSSC without 3-D IPN TNWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3afoil 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3ananowires 3aplatinum 3asolar cells 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aWu, Jihuai1 aYue, Gentian1 aLin, Jianming1 aHuang, Miaoliang1 aFan, Leqing1 aLan, Zhang0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 2, no. 28 p.10550-10555dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21580b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01379naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008400206520038800290592002800678650001100706650001100717650001600728650002400744653001500768653002200783653001200805653001400817700002100831773012100852856008300973852000901056655001201065IND60759665720221117062917.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075966572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1038342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeasley, Brian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9213-932210aNovel Technique for Transducer Handling in Sterile Ultrasound Guided Procedures  aThe objective of this paper is to describe a novel technique for handling an ultrasound transducer while performing sterile ultrasound guided procedures.

A brief review of the meteorological conditions leading to episodes is given. A definition of ‘episodicity’ was considered and applied to a 6 month data set collected at high temporal resolution using a microprocessor based acid rain monitor at a site in south-east England. The deposition was highly episodic for all of the measured variables when data from individual rain events were considered. Combining the data into daily averages resulted in changes of episodicity classification for several chemical species. A large percentage of the total deposition recorded during the field experiment occurred in a 5 day period when there was an independent report of ecological damage at other locations in England. Nitrate deposition showed the highest degree of episodicity with 51% of the 6 month total occurring during the 5 day episode. Meteorological details of the transport and wet deposition processes during this period were examined. Back trajectory analysis indicated that the episode was the result of pollutant loading in eastern and central Europe of the air masses reaching the site together with an absence of upwind precipitation scavenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3achemical speciation 3awet deposition 3arain 3aair 3afield experimentation 3apollution load 3anitrates 3aEngland 0aacid deposition1 aCROWTHER, J.

Doing so would increase understanding of how cyclin D genes respond to the regulatory states established by developmental gene regulatory networks, linking cell cycle and growth control to the ontogenetic program. Therefore, we conducted a cis-regulatory analysis on the cyclin D gene, SpcycD, of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, during embryogenesis, identifying upstream and intronic sequences, located within six defined regions bearing one or more cis-regulatory modules each.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStrongylocentrotus 3acell cycle 3aembryogenesis 3aloci 3aregulator genes 3avertebrates 0ahpf 0aCRM 0aGRN 0a5′ UTR 0aSea urchin embryo 0aDevelopment 0aCyclin D 0aStrongylocentrotus purpuratus 0acis-Regulatory analysis1 aCoffman, James A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 440 p.413-418dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006700161300001500228500001500243520079100258592002801049650002501077650001101102650002201113650001901135650000901154650000801163651001301171651001201184653002001196700002001216700002301236773011601259856007401375852000901449655001201458IND60440094820221119173910.0151024e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044009482DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024071982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBEVERLAND, I.

High resolution data was obtained using a microprocessor-based acid rain monitor at two sites in SW Scotland and SE England. Meteorological details of the transport and wet deposition processes during two frontal rain events were examined and related to rainfall composition. Rapid depletions of ion concentrations during heavy rainfall in the first event were interpreted using a rainfall scavenging model. The sub-event data for the second event showed the influence of frontal discontinuities. Increasing ionic concentrations during this second event were attributed both to the change in air mass, and to diminished upwind precipitation scavenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3amodels 3achemical analysis 3awet deposition 3arain 3aair 3aScotland 3aEngland 0aacid deposition1 aCROWTHER, J.

John William’s Broadleaf and the tobacco aurea mutant Su/su were permanently grown under 700 ppm CO₂ in air. In comparison to plants grown under 350 ppm CO₂ in air but under otherwise identical conditions growth was substantially enhanced. Gas exchange measurements carried out by mass spectrometry show that the rate of photosynthesis in the wild type and in the mutant is increased by more than 100%. The photorespiratory rate in the wild type measured as ¹⁸O₂-uptake in the light in the “700 ppm CO₂-plants” is not reduced to the extent expected or deduced from experiments in which the 350 ppm system responds under in vitro conditions to 700 ppm CO₂. An analysis of the induction kinetics of room temperature fluorescence kinetics of the adapted (700 ppm CO₂) system and the control system (350 ppm CO₂) under various CO₂-partial pressures shows that permanent growth under the elevated CO₂-partial pressure leads to a structural modification of the photosynthetic apparatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aphotorespiration 3atobacco 0aHigh CO2-Pressure 0aMass Spectrometry 0aTobacco 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPhotorespiration1 aBader, K.

Steaming, cooking, extrusion, deep frying, stir-frying and baking, as the six traditional thermal treatments commonly used in starchy food processing, induce changes in the molecular architecture of starch granules, which alters their functional properties, such as their ability to thicken, gel, or stabilize foods. However, knowledge about how these traditional thermal treatments affect the structure and properties of starch during cooking is diffuse. In this paper, the mechanism of heat and mass transfer of traditional thermal treatments is reviewed, and their effects on the structure and functional properties of starch are discussed. Water phase (steaming, cooking, and extrusion), lipid phase (frying, stir-frying) and air phase (baking) thermal treatments are considered. The main structural changes induced by these treatments are gelatinization and retrogradation, which alter the textural properties of starchy foods, as well as their digestibility. This review provides a single resource that may be beneficial for those trying to control and improve the processing conditions of starchy foods. Finally, future developments and challenges in the thermal processing of starchy foods are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adigestibility 3aextrusion 3agelatinization 3agels 3aheat 3ahuman nutrition 3ahydrocolloids 3alipids 3amass transfer 3aretrogradation 3astir frying 0aWater phase treatments 0aLipid phase treatments 0aAir phase treatment 0aStarch 0aStructure 0aProperties1 aChen, Long1 aYang, Tianyi1 aMa, Yun1 aMcClements, David Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-12911 aRen, Fei1 aTian, Yaoqi1 aJin, Zhengyu0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Apr., v. 113 p.106543-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005300137245009400190300001800284500002000302520142800322592002801750596003001778596003601808650002901844650001101873650001201884650000901896650001401905650001001919650001201929650001801941650001701959650001201976650001301988650001602001650001102017650001202028650002002040650002202060650001202082650001602094650001702110700001202127700001902139700006402158773012602222856007102348852000902419655001202428IND60666239420221119153736.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066623942DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.53962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSang, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6574-672510aParental hypoxic exposure influences performance of offspring in Callosobruchus maculatus  ap. 2810-2819.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Modified atmosphere based on lack of O₂ can protect stored grains from insect pest damage. Although population expansion of cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius)) could be temporarily arrested when exposed to 2% O₂, this insect could survive extended periods of hypoxia and continue its normal development if normoxic conditions resumed. It is not clear whether parental hypoxic treatment has any effects on offspring performance and response to hypoxia. RESULTS: Hypoxia postponed development of treated parental bruchids at all stages. Its negative effects on oviposition and hatch rate of these eggs were significant only when hypoxia was administered at the parental fourth instar larval stage or later. When the F1 generation was exposed to hypoxia at the fourth instar larval stage, they exhibited comparable developmental delay and reduction in adult emergence and fecundity whether the parents experienced hypoxia or not. Interestingly, eggs laid by hypoxia‐treated F1s had increased hatch rates if their parents had also been exposed to hypoxia. Stronger suppression of the digestive protease gene CatL and elevated basal expression of the stress responsive gene Hsp27 were observed in F1 larvae with parental hypoxic experience. CONCLUSION: Parental hypoxic experience appeared to better prepare the F1 progenies for further hypoxic challenge. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cChina Scholarship Council  a2014‐67013‐21781cUSDA AFRI 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aadults 3acowpeas 3aeggs 3afecundity 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3anormoxia 3aoviposition 3aoxygen 3aparents 3apest management 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3aproteinases 3astored grain1 aJi, Rui1 aLei, Chaoliang1 aZhu‐Salzman, Keyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2443-43270 tPest management science.g2019 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.2810-2819dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.53963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012100166520123300287592002801520650001501548650001201563650001701575650001601592650001601608650001401624650001901638650001801657650001301675650001101688650001401699653001701713653001101730653001401741653001601755653001201771700001201783700001601795700001401811700001401825700001801839700001201857773010101869856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60720568920221120090953.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072056892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Meihui10aInteractions between caffeic acid and corn starch with varying amylose content and their effects on starch digestion  aThis study aimed to evaluate the physical-chemical interaction between caffeic acid (CA) and gelatinized corn starch with varying amylose and its potential effect on starch digestion. Iodine binding reaction indicated that the absorbance of starch-iodine complex was lower than that in the starch-CA sample. Furthermore, the decrease of absorbance in high amylose corn starch was the most obvious. The affinity constant for CA obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry analysis increased with the amylose content. In the ¹H NMR analysis, the peaks of starch hydroxyl groups at 5.4 and 5.5 ppm became broader after the addition of CA, demonstrating that CA interacted with the selected starches via the hydroxyl groups to form hydrogen bonds. In vitro digestibility studies revealed that the interaction between CA and starch had different effects on starch with different amylose content. Moreover, it was revealed that 2% of CA promoted the hydrolytic process, but a drastic reduction of the hydrolytic process occurred upon increasing the CA to 10% for CS. These results suggested that amylose content and certain interactions with CA was a potential reason affecting the mode of interaction, thus altering the digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aamylose 3acaffeic acid 3acalorimetry 3acorn starch 3adigestion 3agelatinization 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen 3aiodine 3atitration 0aCaffeic acid 0aStarch 0aDigestion 0aInteraction 0aAmylose1 aLiu, Bo1 aZhong, Fang1 aWan, Qian1 aZhu, Song1 aHuang, Dejian1 aLi, Yue0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 May, v. 114 p.106544-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013700171300001600308520169500324592002802019650001002047650002202057650001402079650002502093650001902118650000902137650001702146650002402163650001702187650000902204650001302213650001802226650001902244650001102263650000702274650001702281650001502298650001302313700002402326700002302350700002802373700002102401700003302422700001802455773009702473856008102570990002302651852000902674655001202683IND60093117120221120110835.0141103e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009311712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaafar, Nur Farhana10aPhotodecolorization of methyl orange over α-Fe₂O₃-supported HY catalysts: The effects of catalyst preparation and dealumination  ap. 112-122.  aAn α-Fe₂O₃-supported HY zeolite (α-Fe₂O₃/HY) was prepared by introducing nanosized α-Fe₂O₃ into an HY zeolite support through in situ (α-Fe₂O₃/HYIS) and ion-exchange (α-Fe₂O₃/HYIE) methods. The effect of the preparation methods on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst were studied via XRD, FESEM-EDX, TEM, UV–vis DRS, FTIR, XPS, ²⁹Si and ²⁷Al MAS NMR, ESR and BET surface area analysis. In this study, dealumination was accomplished by using a facile electrolysis system without any strong acids, reactive compounds and/or hydrothermal treatment. Dealumination accompanied by ion exchange of Al with Fe³⁺ ions in the HY zeolite framework resulted in the formation of an active species that had a higher photoactivity towards the decolorization of methyl orange (MO). A 5wt% α-Fe₂O₃/HYIS was found to produce an 80% photodecolorization of 30mgL⁻¹ of MO at pH 2 with 0.375gL⁻¹ catalyst, while 5wt% α-Fe₂O₃/HYIE only produced 23% photodecolorization under similar conditions (2h reaction time). This study showed that the kinetics follow a pseudo-first order Langmuir–Hinshelwood model with an activation energy (Eₐ) calculated for both 5wt% α-Fe₂O₃/HYIS and 5wt% α-Fe₂O₃/HYIE to be 45.8kJmol⁻¹ and 70.2kJmol⁻¹, respectively. Measurements of the mineralization of MO by COD, BOD₅ and TOC analysis were 27.0%, 69.6% and 16.9%, respectively, after 2h of contact time. The Fe dissolution from the catalyst showed insignificant leaching of Fe (<1%) when subjected to AAS. A reusability study demonstrated that α-Fe₂O₃/HYIS could be a promising photocatalyst for the degradation of various dyes in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aelectrolysis 3ahot water treatment 3aion exchange 3aions 3aleaching 3amethyl orange 3amineralization 3amodels 3apH 3asurface area 3awastewater 3azeolites1 aAbdul Jalil, Aishah1 aTriwahyono, Sugeng1 aMuhd Muhid, Muhd Nazlan1 aSapawe, Norzahir1 aSatar, Mohammad Azrul Hisham1 aAsaari, Hanak0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 May 15, v. 191 p.112-122dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0773Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013100160300001600291520097400307592002801281650001301309650003501322650001401357650001201371650001701383650000901400650002801409650002501437651001001462700002301472700001301495700002401508700002001532700002201552773011701574856007401691852000901765655001201774IND60440095020221119174005.0151024e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044009502DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024072012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMORENO-GRAU, S.10aDetermination of lead in aerosol samples collected on glass fiber filters by an improved atomic absorption spectrometry method  ap. 145-153.  aThis paper presents a simple, reliable, economical, safe, accurate and reproducible method for atmospheric aerosol lead determination in glass fiber filters, consisting on an acid digestion procedure and atomic absorption spectrometry quantification. The acid digestion is accelerated by the use of a microwave oven with capped Teflon PFA vessels, and a two steps power and time program. The mixture of 10 mL HNO³ and 1 mL HF was selected between many tries, for both economic and environmental reasons. The use of direct standards for quantification is proposed instead of added standards on filters, using background correction (deuterium lamp). The filter lead content quantification was carried out through blank analyses. Lead determinations were carried out then in 2629 samples of atmospheric aerosol at three sampling points in the city of Cartagena (Spain), from 1990 to 1994. We present the annual average of these values for each year and sampling location.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3adeuterium 3afilters 3aglass fibers 3alead 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3awet digestion method 3aSpain1 aPÉREZ-TORNELL, A.1 aBAYO, J.1 aSERRANO-ANIORTE, J.1 aMORENO-GRAU, J.1 aMORENO-CLAVEL, J.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g1997 May, v. 96, no. 1-4 p.145-153dKluwer Academic Publishersx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024072013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245012400183300001600307520097900323592002801302650002201330650001501352650002001367650002301387650001701410650001401427650003301441650001801474650001501492650001401507650001101521650002901532650002901561650005501590650003101645650004801676650001201724650003001736650002701766650002001793650006101813650006101874650000901935650005001944650002301994650002302017650004102040650002502081650006102106650006002167650002502227650002902252650001602281650002202297700001702319700002702336773008902363856008402452852000902536655001202545IND60088255320221116184440.0141102e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825532DNAL7 a222092602pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Y.M.14aThe contribution of exopolysaccharides induced struvites accumulation to ammonium adsorption in aerobic granular sludge  ap. 986-992.  aAerobic granular sludge from a lab-scale reactor with simultaneous nitrification/denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal processes exhibited significant amount of ammonium adsorption (1.5 mg NH₄ ⁺–N/g TSS at an ammonium concentration of 30 mg N/L). Potassium release accompanied ammonium adsorption, indicating an ion exchange process. The existence of potassium magnesium phosphate (K-struvite) as one of potassium sources in the granular sludge was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Artificially prepared K-struvite was indeed shown to adsorb ammonium. Alginate-like exopolysaccharides were isolated and their inducement for struvite formation was investigated as well. Potassium magnesium phosphate proved to be a major factor for ammonium adsorption on the granular sludge. Struvites (potassium/ammonium magnesium phosphate) accumulate in aerobic granular sludge due to inducing of precipitation by alginate-like exopolysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3adenitrification 3aexopolysaccharides 3aion exchange 3amagnesium 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3anitrification 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asludge 2aAdsorptionxdrug effects 2aAerobiosisxdrug effects 2aAlginatesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAnaerobiosisxdrug effects 2aBiodegradation, Environmentalxdrug effects 2aBiomass 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aChemical Precipitation 2aCrystallization 2aGlucuronic Acidxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHexuronic Acidsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aIons 2aMagnesium Compoundsxisolation & purification 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitritesxanalysis 2aPhosphatesxisolation & purification 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPolysaccharidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxisolation & purification 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSolubilityxdrug effects 2aTemperature 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aBassin, J.P.1 avan Loosdrecht, M.C.M.0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 46, no. 4 p.986-992dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013900165500001900304520114600323592002801469650001001497650001201507650002101519650001501540650002301555650001701578650001301595650000901608650001801617650001301635650001901648650001501667650002001682650001201702650002701714653001201741653001901753653001901772653001901791700001601810700002001826700001901846773010201865856008601967852000902053655001202062IND60720569020221120091025.0210124e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072056902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qin10aPhysicochemical, structural and gelation properties of arachin-basil seed gum composite gels: Effects of salt types and concentrations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the effects of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) and sodium chloride (NaCl) with different concentrations (0–20 mM) on the properties of arachin and basil seed gum composite gels were investigated. The results showed that the G′, G″ and gel strength of the composite gels were enhanced by Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ at a low concentration and decreased at high concentrations. An appropriate concentration of Ca²⁺ or Na⁺ (10 mM) strengthened the electrostatic forces, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and facilitated a conformation conversion of the secondary structures from α-helix to β-sheet. These changes were responsible for the improved hydration properties including water-holding capacity, freeze-thaw stability and swelling behavior of the composite gels in the presence of 10 mM Ca²⁺ or Na⁺, which could be explained by the images of compact and uniform microstructures.

In this study, a total number of 87 road dust samples were collected at 29 sampling sites from five different functional areas (commercial area (CA), residential area (RA), educational area (EA), industrial area (IA), and park area (PA)) in Zhengzhou to study the contamination status, distribution, source identification, ecological risk assessment, and spatial distribution of human health risks due to eight heavy elements. The geo-accumulation index (Igₑₒ) and pollution index (PI) revealed that there was very high contamination with Cd and Hg caused by atmospheric deposition, which should be paid special attention. Additionally, the source identification indicated that Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb originate from anthropogenic activities related to traffic, and Hg can originate from medical equipment and agricultural chemicals, while the extremely low level of pollution with As could be explained by geographic sources. Moreover, the calculated ecological risk index values were increased in the order of CA > RA > EA > IA > PA in different functional areas. According to the human health risks of the whole city, children exposed to Pb have the highest health risk, especially for CA and IA, as calculated by the noncarcinogenic hazard index (HI). For adults and children, health risks caused by Cu, Zn, and Pb were higher in the CA, RA, and PA of the downtown area, whereas Cr and Ni had the highest noncarcinogenic exposure risk in northwestern Zhengzhou due to point source pollution. Calculations of the carcinogenic risk (CR) values for Cr, Ni, As, and Cd indicate that the value of Cr is highest (1.17 × 10⁻⁷), especially inside the industrial area (8.55 × 10⁻⁷), which is close to the lower limit of the threshold values (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁴). These results can provide a theoretical basis and data support for air treatment, pollution control, and the implementation of public prevention in different functional areas of Zhengzhou.  aPublisher supplied data  a51879242cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51739009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aair 3aatmospheric deposition 3acarcinogenicity 3adust 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amedical equipment 3apoint source pollution 3apollution control 3apublic health 3aresearch 3aresidential areas 3arisk 3aChina1 aShen, Chenyang1 aKang, Yongfei1 aDeng, Qiao1 aLin, Xiaoying0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 July, v. 27, no. 21 p.26650-26667dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08942-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003100135040001800166100002000184245017800204300001200382506007600394520176200470592002802232506003702260650002402297650001202321650002102333650001202354650002202366650001102388650001102399650004302410650001302453650001402466650000902480650000902489650002002498650002502518700002402543700002102567700002502588700002102613700002002634773009602654856004402750852000902794655001202803IND50058765020221207071240.0121003e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005876502DNAL7 a212446992pmid7 aPMC30332362pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-8-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasimir, Marina12aA role for pancreatic beta-cell secretory hyperresponsiveness in catch-up growth hyperinsulinemia: Relevance to thrifty catch-up fat phenotype and risks for type 2 diabetes   ap. 303.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent notions about mechanisms by which catch-up growth predisposes to later type 2 diabetes center upon those that link hyperinsulinemia with an accelerated rate of fat deposition (catch-up fat). Using a rat model of semistarvation-refeeding in which catch-up fat is driven solely by elevated metabolic efficiency associated with hyperinsulinemia, we previously reported that insulin-stimulated glucose utilization is diminished in skeletal muscle but increased in white adipose tissue. Here, we investigated the possibility that hyperinsulinemia during catch-up fat can be contributed by changes in the secretory response of pancreatic beta-cells to glucose. Using the rat model of semistarvation-refeeding showing catch-up fat and hyperinsulinemia, we compared isocalorically refed and control groups for potential differences in pancreatic morphology and in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during in situ pancreas perfusions as well as ex vivo isolated islet perifusions. Between refed and control animals, no differences were found in islet morphology, insulin content, and the secretory responses of perifused isolated islets upon glucose stimulation. By contrast, the rates of insulin secretion from in situ perfused pancreas showed that raising glucose from 2.8 to 16.7 mmol/l produced a much more pronounced increase in insulin release in refed than in control groups (p < 0.01). These results indicate a role for islet secretory hyperresponsiveness to glucose in the thrifty mechanisms that drive catch-up fat through glucose redistribution between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Such beta-cell hyperresponsiveness to glucose may be a key event in the link between catch-up growth, hyperinsulinemia and risks for later type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acompensatory growth 3aglucose 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3alipids 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apancreas 3aphenotype 3arats 3arisk 3askeletal muscle 3awhite adipose tissue1 ade Andrade, Paula B1 aGjinovci, Asllan1 aMontani, Jean-Pierre1 aMaechler, Pierre1 aDulloo, Abdul G0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.303-303dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-8-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013700173300001600310520170400326592002802030650001302058650001602071650001902087650001502106650001102121650002402132653000802156653001002164653000802174653000802182653000902190653000802199653000802207653001902215653001902234653001302253653003202266653002102298700002102319700002702340700002402367700002402391773012102415856008202536852000902618655001202627IND60089813020221118141945.0160728e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008981302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCourilleau, Delphine14aThe (R)-enantiomer of CE3F4 is a preferential inhibitor of human exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP isoform 1 (Epac1)  ap. 443-448.  aIsoform 1 and isoform 2 of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2) contribute to cAMP signaling in numerous cellular processes. Their guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity toward the small GTP-binding protein Rap1 is stimulated by the agonist cAMP. CE3F4, a tetrahydroquinoline analog, prevents Epac1 activation in vitro and in living cultured cells by inhibiting the GEF activity of Epac1. However, the activity of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of CE3F4, as well as the ability of CE3F4 and its analogs to inhibit Epac2 GEF activity, have not yet been investigated. In this study, we report that (R)-CE3F4 is a more potent cAMP antagonist than racemic CE3F4 and (S)-CE3F4, inhibiting the GEF activity of Epac1 with 10-times more efficiency than (S)-CE3F4. Epac2, in contrast to Epac1, is activated more efficiently by cAMP than by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (007), an Epac-selective cAMP analog. (R)-CE3F4 displays Epac isoform preference, with 10-fold selectivity for Epac1 over Epac2. Deletion of the N-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of Epac2 does not affect the characteristics of activation of Epac2 by cAMP and by 007, nor its inhibition by CE3F4. Finally, the evaluation of a series of CE3F4 structural analogs as GEF inhibitors allowed identifying structural features that are important for high Epac1 inhibitory activity of CE3F4. We conclude that the (R)-enantiomer of CE3F4 is a preferential inhibitor of Epac1 with high potency in the low micromolar range, and we suggest that this compound may be a useful pharmacological tool for investigating the functional role of Epac1 in cAMP signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acultured cells 3acyclic AMP 3ahumans 3aregulatory proteins 0a007 0aCE3F4 0aCNB 0aDEP 0aEpac 0aGEF 0aPKA 0acAMP signaling 0aEpac inhibitor 0aRap1 GEF 0aTetrahydroquinoline analogs 0aDrug enantiomers1 aBouyssou, Pascal1 aFischmeister, Rodolphe1 aLezoualc’h, Frank1 aBlondeau, Jean-Paul0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 440 p.443-448dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009300187300001800280520190200298592002802200650002702228650002302255650002402278650001802302650001602320650001102336650001602347650002402363650001902387650000902406650001302415650001102428650002002439650002902459650002602488650004802514650003002562650003502592650003102627650005902658650001302717650002102730650004802751650005402799650005002853650002202903650004502925650002302970650001602993700002803009700001503037700001803052773009103070856008403161852000903245655001203254IND60088255620221116184603.0141102e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825562DNAL7 a222092782pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhikang14aThe role of extracellular polymeric substances on the sorption of natural organic matter  ap. 1052-1060.  aIn this study, the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composition and quantity was explored for biosorption of natural organic matter (NOM), using variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Model EPS (sodium alginate beads) were tested and sorption capacity for NOM was also elucidated. In the absence of divalent ions, minimal NOM biosorption was observed and differences among strains were negligible. Under presence of divalent ions, biosorption of NOM was proportional to the amount of EPS secreted by P. aeruginosa variants. For sorption tests with model EPS, divalent ions also promoted biosorption of tested NOM, and total biosorption was also proportional to alginate quantity. Carboxyl group content in both alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be linked to increased biosorption via bridging with divalent ions. The alginate overproducing strain possessed more potential NOM biosorption sites, while the wild-type and alginate deficient strains possessed fewer potential binding sites. In comparison, P. putida, secreting protein-based EPS, behaved differently for NOM biosorption, due to its hydrophobicity and the structural characteristics of proteins. Hydrophobic interactions appeared to enhance the biosorption of more hydrophobic Suwannee River humic acid by P. putida, whose biosorption of more hydrophilic NOM variants was similar to the alginate deficient strain. Mechanistically, the presence of a diffuse electrical double layer will present potential energy barriers limiting biosorption; however, divalent ion concentrations in the aquatic environment will promote biosorption processes, permitting functional group interactions between EPS and NOM. Bridging between hydrophilic carboxyl groups on alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be the dominant form of biosorption, while hydrophobic interactions enhanced biosorption for protein-based EPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas putida 3aaquatic environment 3abinding sites 3abiosorption 3aenergy 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3aproteins 3arivers 3asodium alginate 2aAdsorptionxdrug effects 2aBenzopyransxanalysis 2aBiodegradation, Environmentalxdrug effects 2aBiopolymersxpharmacology 2aExtracellular Spacexchemistry 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactionsxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aOrganic Chemicalsxisolation & purification 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPseudomonas putidaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aStatic Electricity 2aTemperature1 aHessler, Christopher M.1 aXue, Zheng1 aSeo, Youngwoo0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 46, no. 4 p.1052-1060dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04964naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004300151245012300194520259900317592002802916650002502944650002102969650002602990650001503016650002903031650002403060650003603084650002603120650001503146650001303161650002203174650001003196650001503206650002003221650002003241650002803261650001403289650001703303650001003320650002203330650001503352650002903367650001703396650003003413650002103443650001603464650001503480650001503495650001403510651001003524653002903534653000903563653001903572653002703591653002003618700005903638700006503697700002603762700002103788700002103809700002103830700002603851700002803877700005603905700001903961700002803980773010304008856008604111852000904197655001204206IND60759666420221117062203.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075966642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarasinakuppe Krishnegowda, Dharanesha10aMolecular epidemiological studies on avian pathogenic Escherichia coli associated with septicemia in chickens in India  aBacterial septicemia causes huge economic losses in the poultry industry and there is no systematic research available in India on the connection of various pathogens associated with septicemia. The present molecular epidemiological study was conducted to investigate the association of different bacterial and immunosuppressive viral pathogens in septicemia suspected chickens. A total of 443 chicken carcasses with septicemic conditions from 71 different flocks were included in this study. Heart blood swabs were subjected to bacterial culture for Salmonella spp., Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, and Gallibacterium anatis. Of these 51 flocks tested for E. coli, 49 (96.1%) flocks were found positive. Among flocks tested for Salmonella spp., 2 flocks were found positive. All tested flocks were found negative for G. anatis and P. multocida as well as air sac swabs tested negative for Mycoplasma spp. Bacterial cultural examination revealed that majority of septicemic chickens were found to be infected with E. coli and these E. coli isolates showed the highest resistance to vancomycin (60%), followed by erythromycin (50%) and cefotaxime (38%) and maximum sensitivity to cefotaxime and clavulanic acid combinations (81.5%), followed by chloramphenicol (69.6%) and ertapenem (67.2%). Among the 5 avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) virulence genes were detected in 36 flocks and highest frequency of iss (100%), followed by ompT or iutA (97.2%), hly (61.1%) and iroN (47.2%) genes. On polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening, 10.5, 4.5, 52.2, 19.4, 9.0, 4.5, 20.1 and 19.4% of the flocks were positive for G. anatis, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, APEC, Salmonella spp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, chicken infectious anemia virus and Marek's disease virus, respectively. To our knowledge, the present study is first on the etiology of septicemia in chicken flocks in India. The present study infers that the majority of septicemic deaths in broiler chickens less than 8 weeks have been connected with APEC and majority of E. coli isolates are multidrug resistance, suggesting the need for surveillance and intervention to curb the inadvertent use of antibiotics. Although, incidence of G. anatis association with septicemia was reported, still requires a rigorous epidemiological study to determine the actual prevalence. However, more detailed studies encompassing vast geographical area with large sample size and long duration of the studies are necessary to provide a clear picture of the interaction of different pathogens causing septicemia in chicken.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChicken anemia virus 3aEscherichia coli 3aGallibacterium anatis 3aMardivirus 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma synoviae 3aOrnithobacterium rhinotracheale 3aPasteurella multocida 3aSalmonella 3aair sacs 3abacterial culture 3ablood 3acefotaxime 3achloramphenicol 3aclavulanic acid 3aepidemiological studies 3aertapenem 3aerythromycin 3aheart 3aimmunosuppression 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry industry 3asample size 3asepticemia 3avancomycin 3avirulence 3aIndia 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aAPEC 0aChicken flocks 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aVirulence genes1 aSingh, Bhoj Raj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3008-18361 aMariappan, Asok Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6348-07241 aMunuswamy, Palanivelu1 aSingh, Karam Pal1 aMonalisa sahoo, 1 aSaminathan, Mani1 aRamalingam, Rajasekar1 aChellappa, Madhan Mohan1 aSingh, Vidya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-65231 aDhama, Kuldeep1 aReddy, Maddula Ramakoti0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Jan., v. 162 p.105313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245014800204520173200352592002802084650001102112650001502123650002502138650002702163650001002190650001602200650001002216650001302226650003002239650002602269650002302295650001502318650001702333650002402350650002102374650001602395653001902411653002902430700001302459700001202472700001602484700001802500700001502518700005402533773010302587856008602690852000902776655001202785IND60759666520221117062532.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075966652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9383-853910aAnalysis of gut microbiota in patients with epilepsy treated with valproate: Results from a three months observational prospective cohort study  aGrowing evidence implicates the potential effect of microbiota on the pathogenesis and course of epilepsy. However, the effects of valproate (VPA), a broad spectrum anti-epileptic drugs, on gut microbiota have not been investigated in humans. This study aimed to analyze fecal microbiota in patients with epilepsy treated with valproate.A total of 10 participants, who were newly diagnosed of cryptogenic epilepsy with treatment naïve and received 1000 mg daily doses of VPA, were recruited in our prospective study. Microbiota compositions were evaluated at baseline and after three months of VPA treatment using 16S rDNA sequencing.VPA treatment was associated with clinical improvements in all patients, but not changes in gut microbiota richness and complexity (Shannon: p = 0.82). Microbiome composition structure differences also revealed no statistical difference in dissimilarity (Adonis: p = 0.90). No statistical difference taxa were found between two groups. However, the ratio of phyla Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes (ANOVA: p = 0.037) markedly raised after three months of VPA-treatment. A correlation matrix based on the spearman correlation distance confirmed associations between specific fecal taxa and VPA-related clinical metabolic parameters, including drug concentration in the blood, total cholesterol, triglyceride, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and weight gain. (p < 0.05)Among those patients treated with VPA, characterization of the gut microbiota altered, and gut microbiota associated with weight gain and clinical biochemical indexes, suggesting that microbiome composition data might involve in the mechanisms of VPA induced metabolic disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdonis 3aFirmicutes 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adrugs 3aepilepsy 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactate dehydrogenase 3ametabolic diseases 3amicrobiome 3apathogenesis 3aprospective studies 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain 0aGut microbiota 0aValproate administration1 aLiu, Yue1 aLiu, Xu1 aLi, Ai Qing1 aGuo, Kun Dian1 aZhou, Dong1 aHong, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0014-68730 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Jan., v. 162 p.105340-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1053403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245007200205300001600277506007600293520103200369592002801401506003701429650003201466650003101498650002001529650001901549650002301568650002901591650003601620653000901656653000801665653000801673653000801681653000801689653000901697653000901706653001201715653001801727653001001745653000901755653002001764700002501784773012101809856008201930852000902012655001202021IND60089813220221207143718.0160728e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008981322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.1282doi7 aPMC39475292pmcid7 a240997732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng14aThe Groucho protein Grg4 suppresses Smad7 to activate BMP signaling  ap. 454-459.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGroucho related genes encode transcriptional repressor proteins critical for normal developmental processes. The bone morphogenetic proteins belong to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and play important signaling roles in development and disease. However, the regulation of BMP signaling, especially within cells, is largely unknown. In this report, we show that expression of the Groucho related gene Grg4 robustly activates the expression of a BMP reporter gene, as well as enhancing and sustaining the upregulation of the endogenous Id1 gene induced by BMP7. BMP7 administration did not affect the endogenous level of Grg4 nor did it enhance the phosphorylation of receptor activated Smad proteins. Rather, Grg4 expression reduced the levels of the endogenous inhibitory Smad7, thus increasing the transcriptional responses mediated by BMP responsive sequences. The data point to a novel mechanisms for attenuating BMP signaling through altering the ratio of activating versus inhibitory Smad proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3agene expression regulation 3aphosphorylation 3areporter genes 3arepressor proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aGrg4 0aTle 0aBMP 0aTGF 0aBRE 0aPRC2 0aEGFP 0aGroucho 0aBMP signaling 0aSmad7 0aGrg4 0aKidney fibrosis1 aDressler, Gregory R.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 440 p.454-459dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245007300169300001600242520168100258592002801939650001201967650001701979650001601996650001002012650002402022650001002046650001602056650002002072650001502092650001802107650001502125650000902140650001202149650001302161650001402174650001602188653003202204653002702236653001502263653002402278700002002302700002002322700001602342700002202358773011002380856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60480055520221120065520.0160125e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048005552DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.40.2012.3.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTereshchenko, O.

In the current study, we demonstrated that the D genome of bread wheat ‘Purple’ carries one of two complementary genes determining purple grain colour. This gene was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 7D 2.5 cM distal to the locus <i>Rc-D1</i> determining red coleoptile colour. This position is highly comparable with that of the <i>Pp1</i> gene mapped earlier on the short arm of chromosome 7B in tetraploid <i>T. durum</i>.We suggest the <i>Pp</i> genes on <i>T. durum</i> chromosome 7B and <i>T. aestivum</i> chromosome 7D are orthologous. We designated them <i>Pp-B1</i> and <i>Pp-D1</i>, respectively. Microsatellite-based genotyping of near-isogenic lines ‘i:S29Pp1Pp2<sup>PF</sup>’ and ‘i:S29Pp1Pp3<sup>P</sup>’, their recurrent (<i>T. aestivum</i> ‘Saratovskaya 29’) and donor (<i>T. aestivum</i> ‘Purple Feed’ and ‘Purple’, respectively) parents showed the presence of donor introgressions on chromosomes 2A and 7D in both near-isogenic lines. In addition to previously described purple pericarp, anthers and culms, phenotyping of these lines in the current study showed dark red coleoptile colour (with anthocyanin contents four times higher than in ‘Saratovskaya 29’ coleoptiles) and purple leaf blade and leaf sheath colour. It was concluded that each of the lines ‘i:S29Pp1Pp2<sup>PF</sup>’ and ‘i:S29Pp1Pp3<sup>P</sup>’ carry clusters of genes <i>Rc-D1, Pc-D1, Pan-D1, Plb-D1, Pls-D1</i> and <i>Pp-D1</i> on chromosome 7D between microsatellite markers <i>Xgwm0044</i> and <i>Xgwm0676</i>.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthers 3aanthocyanins 3acoleoptiles 3acolor 3acomplementary genes 3aculms 3adurum wheat 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3aintrogression 3aleaf blade 3aloci 3aparents 3apericarp 3aphenotype 3atetraploidy 0a<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L. 0amicrosatellite markers 0agenotyping 0anear-isogenic lines1 aGordeeva, E.

Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy(PEMF) has perceived pain-relieving effects and improves the reduction in muscle and fascial tension. Both are used in therapeutic protocols. The study objectively assessed the influence of MCT and PEMF therapy on mechanical nociceptive thresholds(MNTs) at 3 specific muscular junction trigger points(TPs) of the thoracolumbar musculature. MNTs are a measure of sensitivity to musculoskeletal tenderness. A controlled randomized study using 12 sound cob-type horses from the same yard and training schedule randomly assigned into 3 groups of n = 4. Control group, no intervention; 2 treatment groups:(A) MCT only (10min assessment, 10min treatment by a qualified McTimoney animal practitioner) and (B) combined (MCT plus Biomag 2TM PEMF mat(200hz) placed cranial to T18, 5min per side). Stood square, triplicate MNTs were measured using pressure algometry on both sides at 3 muscle TPs[TP 45(junction of spinalis, longissimus thoracis and trapezius thoracis); 47 (longissimus thoracis et lumborum); and 62 (gluteus medius)] at 4 time points 0(pre-treatment), 30(post MCT), 60(post PEMF), 150min.Statistical tests: Shapiro-Wilk test, paired T- test compared left/right MNTs, ANOVA analyzed group data for each TP over time with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. There was no difference (P > 0.05) between left and right MNTs for all measurement sites. There was no changes in MNTs over time at all TPs for control group(P > 0.05). There was a significant increase in mean MNTs pre-treatment to 150min for both treatment groups (A:P = 0.03, B:P = 0.01). Significant changes in MNTs at each muscle TP shown in Table 1. This study provides positive evidence that chiropractic and when combined with PEMF treatment show a significant reduction in sensitivity to musculoskeletal tenderness (increased MNTs) over the time period compared with no treatment. Different muscle groups behave differently. Further research is required on difference in muscle tonicity effects and over a longer period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectromagnetic field 3ahorses 3alongissimus muscle 3aneurons 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine1 aDavidson, V.1 aCharlton, S.1 aHunnisett, A.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 100 p.103479-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009100168300001600259520110800275592002801383650002001411650001401431650002001445650001601465650001401481650001601495650001501511650001401526650001801540650002101558650002401579650001901603650001201622650002101634650002301655650001001678650000901688650002101697650002501718650002101743653000801764653000801772653000801780653000901788653000901797653000701806653000801813653000701821653000701828653000701835653001001842653001001852653000801862653000701870653000801877653000801885653000801893653000701901653000701908653001801915653000801933653001001941653000901951653000901960653000801969653002001977653000901997653002402006653002502030700001702055700001602072700001702088700001602105700001202121700001802133773011102151856008602262852000902348655001202357IND60566531320221120024613.0200515e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056653132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Zhaohui10aLipid metabolism potential and mechanism of CPe-III from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  ap. 126-133.  aThe effects of CPe-III on hyperlipidemic mice were investigated, along with molecular docking and dynamics analyses between CPe-III and CETP. This study was conducted in order to explore the lipid metabolism potential and mechanism of CPe-III. CPe-III significantly (P<0.05) reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and hepatic triglyceride levels and increased serum superoxide dismutase activity. CPe-III reversed liver changes induced by a high-fat diet and significantly (P<0.05) reduced kidney and epididymal fat indices. The activities of hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase, as well as fecal fat excretion, were significantly (P<0.05) enhanced. Furthermore, CPe-III was found to bind in the cavity of CETP, forming four stable hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic interactions were the main driving force during binding. This study demonstrates that CPe-III improves dyslipidemia in mice. The binding of CPe-III to CETP demonstrates that CPe-III blocks cholesterol transport. These results indicate that CPe-III may be useful as an adjuvant element for hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aadjuvants 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3achickpeas 3acholesterol 3aepididymis 3aexcretion 3ahigh fat diet 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahyperlipidemia 3akidneys 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3amice 3amolecular models 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 0aHFD 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aVLDL 0aCETP 0aCE 0aRCT 0aMD 0aTC 0aTG 0aHDL-C 0aLDL-C 0aLPL 0aHL 0aSOD 0aMDA 0aSPF 0aNC 0aPC 0aCL, CM and CH 0aH&E 0aANOVA 0aRMSD 0aRMSF 0aCVD 0aCPe-III peptide 0aCETP 0aHyperlipidemic mice 0aMolecular simulation1 aHou, Xiaonan1 aYu, Wancong1 aWen, Haichao1 aZhang, Qian1 aLi, Dan1 aKou, Xiaohong0 tFood research international.g2018 Feb., v. 104 p.126-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008900166300002000255500001900275500001100294520121300305592002801518596006601546650002301612650002501635650000901660650003001669650002301699650001801722650001401740650001301754700006901767700002501836700002301861700002601884773015501910856008302065852000902148655001202157IND60700709520221119020129.0210716e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070070952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09015-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjith, Nithin10aGlobal distribution of microplastics and its impact on marine environment—a review  ap. 25970-25986.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aMicroplastics are the major environmental health hazards spotted in almost all the marine habitats and biota of world. The earlier research on microplastics have mainly focused on studying abundance and distribution as well as impacts on organisms, while the existing review articles have reviewed on any one of the above aspects or the environmental fate of microplastics. The current review focuses on all the above facets thereby bringing out the incompleteness in information globally in the respective facets. Our findings suggest that among 192 countries of the world, only 22.9% (44) of the countries have carried out research regarding microplastics, while impacts on organisms have mostly targeted fish (38%), whereas studies on other highly affected organisms such as turtles (1%) are not well documented. Therefore, we suggest expanding research in all the above aspects of microplastics considering that there are several pristine marine environments and organisms that are yet unexplored. Quantifying research in these regards would enable to propose a microplastic threshold level and formulate control measures to reduce the use of plastics and its subsequent threat to the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aMoES / ICMAM-PD/ME/CAS-MB/53/2017cMinistry of Earth Sciences 3aenvironmental fate 3aenvironmental health 3afish 3ageographical distribution 3amarine environment 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aresearch1 aArumugam, Sundaramanickam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2682-445X1 aParthasarathy, Surya1 aManupoori, Sathish1 aJanakiraman, Sivamani0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 July, v. 27, no. 21 p.25970-25986dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09015-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011900161300001600280520131600296592002801612650001101640650001701651650001201668650001501680650000901695650001801704650002201722650001101744650001001755650000901765650001401774650002001788650002201808650002501830653001901855653001701874653002201891653001201913653001401925700002601939700002901965700001501994700001602009700002402025700002302049773015402072856008002226852000902306655001202315IND60522893820221120043256.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052289382DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1995-11-12182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Casa, C10aRole of Mucus Secretion and Sulfhydryl Groups in Gastroprotection Mediated by a Flavonoid Fraction of Bidens aurea  ap. 854-861.  aThe aerial parts of Bidens aurea (Aiton) Sherff have been used in folk medicine as an antiulcer agent. The efficacy of an ether extract to prevent gastric mucosal damage produced by several necrotic agents was studied in rats. The best efficiency was against lesions induced by 30% NaCl with a significant decrease of damage at all doses tested (250, 125 and 62.5 mg kg⁻¹). In contrast, only the highest dose (250 mg kg⁻¹) was effective on gastric erosions induced by 0.6 ɴ HCl. This effect could not be related with the mucus gel production only since the groups treated with of absolute ethanol or 30% NaCl before and then received 250 mg kg⁻¹ of the ether extract increased significantly the amount of gastric mucus and its glycoprotein content. However, the ether extract of Bidens aurea enhanced the production of mucosal non-protein SH groups at all doses assayed after treatment with absolute ethanol and 0.6 ɴ HCl. With NaCl-induced gastric injury, also the highest dose (250 mg kg⁻¹) produced an increase of this parameter. The results suggest that a slight augmentation of the mucus gel concentration and the increase of non-protein sulfhydryl compounds, could con­ tribute to the functional protection mechanism mediated by a flavonoid fraction of B.aurea in these experimental models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBidens 3aaerial parts 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3agels 3aglycoproteins 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels 3amucus 3arats 3asecretion 3asodium chloride 3asulfhydryl groups 3atraditional medicine 0aCytoprotection 0aBidens aurea 0aSulfhydryl Groups 0aAurones 0aChalcones1 aCalero, M.

Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle, is a major agricultural pest that damages stored grains and cereal products. With the completion of the sequencing of its genome, two T. castaneum species‐specific CYP genes, CYP4BN6, and CYP6BQ11, were identified. However, it is unknown whether the functions of most CYPs are shared by TcCYP4BN6 and TcCYP6BQ11, and the upstream regulatory mechanism of these two CYPs remains elusive. RESULTS: QRT‐PCR analysis indicated that TcCYP4BN6 and TcCYP6BQ11 were both most highly expressed at the late pupal stage and were mainly observed in the head and gut, respectively, of adults. Moreover, the transcripts of these two CYPs were significantly induced by dichlorvos and carbofuran, and RNA interference (RNAi) targeting of each of them enhanced the susceptibility of beetles to these two insecticides. Intriguingly, knockdown of the latrophilin (lph) gene, which has been reported to be related to the insecticide susceptibility, reduced the expression of TcCYP4BN6 and TcCYP6BQ11 after insecticide treatment, suggesting that these two CYP genes are regulated by lph to participate in insecticide susceptibility in T. castaneum. CONCLUSION: These results shed new light on the function and mechanism of CYP genes associated with insecticide susceptibility and could facilitate research on appropriate and sustainable pest control management. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31872970cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572326cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aRNA interference 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3acarbofuran 3acytochrome P-450 3adichlorvos 3adigestive system 3agenes 3agrain products 3ahead 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic detoxification 3apest control 3apesticide application 3apests 3aphytotoxins 3apupae 3astored grain1 aGao, Shanshan1 aMao, Jinjuan1 aWei, Luting1 aXie, Jia1 aLiu, Juanjuan1 aBi, Jingxiu1 aSong, Xiaowen1 aLi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4544-45320 tPest management science.g2019 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.2744-2755dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.53843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010400158300001800262520038800280592002800668650001600696650002300712650001100735650001300746650001300759650004400772650001400816650001400830700008900844700002100933700001700954700001900971700002100990700002801011773013401039856007401173852000901247655001201256IND60639063720221122235058.0190501e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063906372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc09749a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTepper, Ronny10aHalogen-bond-based cooperative ion-pair recognition by a crown-ether-embedded 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazole  ap. 2260-2263.  aA crown-ether containing the iodo-triazole moiety for simultaneous cation–anion binding through Lewis-basic nitrogen atoms and C–I⋯I halogen-bond-donating iodine atoms was prepared.

Two related F<sub>8:9</sub> recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations comprising 485 and 229 lines were used. Two hundred and nine putative additive QTL for the eight traits were identified, 35 of which showed significance in at least three trials. Of these, at least 11 pairwise QTL were common to the two populations. PH components at the QTL level had different effects on PH, confirming our previous multivariate conditional analysis (Cui et al. 2011). Eleven major QTL that showed consistency in expression across environments should be of great value in the genetic improvement of PH in wheat. The results above will enhance the understanding of the genetic basis of PH in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic improvement 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3awheat 0awheat 0ainternode length 0ainternode component index 0aplant height component index 0aQTL1 aLi, J.1 aDing, A.

Because no threshold levels are established for T. urticae in cassava cropping, many growers in China are applying excessive chemical applications per cassava cropping period. This is not only expensive, but also results in lower yields because of severe leaf damage and development of resistance. This study aims to develop an immediate threshold level for T. urticae control which could be determined in the laboratory and fit the field application requirements. RESULTS: The mite density of 25 mites/leaf was the threshold which caused significant decrease of photosynthetic pigment contents and protective enzyme activities in cassava leaves in the laboratory. Moreover, 25 mites/leaf was also the threshold density which resulted in significantly lower leaf damage and higher yield levels compared with a higher level of mites/leaf where calendar sprays were used. CONCLUSION: The mite density threshold that brought about significant physiological and biochemical changes in the laboratory basically coincided with the threshold that resulted in significant yield loss in the field. It is therefore concluded that the optimum threshold acaricide spray for T. urticae on cassava is 25 mites/leaf. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0201100cNational Key R&D Program of China  aCARS‐11‐HNCQcEarmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System  a31601649cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201508cProgram of Hainan Association for Science and Technology Plans to Youth R & D Innovation 3aTetranychus evansi 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacaricides 3acassava 3acrop production 3aenzyme activity 3afinancial economics 3agrowers 3aleaves 3amites 3apesticide application 3apests 3aphotosynthesis 3aChina1 aLiang, Xiao1 aWu, Chunling1 aGao, Jintao1 aChen, Qian1 aZhang, Zhe0 tPest management science.g2019 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.2634-2641dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.53663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001400250520103100264592002801295650001901323650001501342650002001357650001901377650002301396650002101419650001501440650001301455651001001468700001601478700001501494773011501509856008101624852000901705655001201714IND60440096020221119173921.0151024e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044009602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-003-5041-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhaofu, Li10aSoil-surface CO2 fluxes in a Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland in Sanjiang Plain, China  ap. 35-41.  aIn many temperate-zone ecosystems, seasonal changes in environmental and biological factors influence the dynamics and magnitude of surface–atmosphere exchange. Research was conducted between July and October 2001 to measure growing season surface-layer fluxes of CO₂ in a Deyeuxia angustifolia dominated wetland on the Sanjiang Plain in northeastern China. Seasonal fluctuation and daily change in soil-surface CO₂ fluxes were measured as well as the edaphic factors controlling CO₂ fluxes. Soil-surface CO₂ fluxes were measured with a closed-chamber system. The results revealed that there were both seasonal fluctuations and daily change in CO₂ fluxes. The ranges of measured soil-surface CO₂ flux were 0.208 – 1.265 g CO₂m⁻²h⁻¹. Soil-surface CO₂ fluxes averaged 0.620 g CO₂ m⁻²h⁻¹. An analysis of several edaphic factors including soil temperature and soil moisture of the D. angustifolia wetland showed that there was a significant relationship between flux and temperature (R² = 0.77).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3agrowing season 3aseasonal variation 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3awetlands 3aChina1 aXianguo, Lu1 aQing, Yang0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2005 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.35-41dKluwer Academic Publishersx0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-003-5041-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005600155245017100211500001900382520112000401592002801521650003001549650002101579650001601600650000801616650002901624650000901653650001401662650001901676650002201695650001501717650001601732650001501748650001001763650001601773650001501789650001301804650001701817650001101834653001701845653001301862653001501875653001501890700001901905700002101924700002601945773013001971856009002101852000902191655001202200IND60700076720221119160327.0200913e20201102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070007672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1087692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaram, Layal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6970-017410aAntimicrobial effect of thymol and carvacrol added to a vinegar-based marinade for controlling spoilage of marinated beef (Shawarma) stored in air or vacuum packaging  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aControlling spoilage of the popular ethnic marinated beef “Shawarma” is crucial to achieve high quality, extend shelf-life, reduce food waste and meet the need of the globalized supply chain. Active essential oil (EO) components (thymol and carvacrol) were added at 0.4% and 0.8% (w/w) to preserve marinated beef, stored under aerobic or vacuum packaging. Microbiological and sensory (odor) parameters were assessed during 21 days at 4 °C. The treatments with higher EO concentration achieved higher antimicrobial activity than the lower ones and significantly reduced the mesophilic total viable count (TVC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas spp., total coliforms, Escherichia coli, yeasts and molds. The higher EO concentration extended the microbiological shelf-life by 6 days, as judged by TVC and compared to the controls (aerobic and vacuum packaging) but was unacceptable sensorially. The lower EO concentration increased the microbiological shelf-life by 3 days and the sensorial shelf-life by 9 and > 12 days, under aerobic and vacuum conditions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas 3aair 3aantimicrobial properties 3abeef 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3afood microbiology 3afood waste 3alactic acid 3amarinating 3aodors 3aplate count 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3asupply chain 3athymol 0aPreservation 0aShawarma 0aMarination 0aShelf-life1 aChehab, Rayane1 aOsaili, Tareq M.1 aSavvaidis, Ioannis N.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Nov. 02, v. 332 p.108769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1087693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245012700151300001800278520113400296592002801430650000801458650002201466650001601488650002101504650001301525650002301538650002101561650001301582650001301595650001901608650001601627650001401643650002401657700002001681700002201701700001901723700002001742700001901762700002101781773009901802856007501901852000901976655001201985IND60577219420221122060947.0170807e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057721942DNAL7 a10.1021/la504777b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zha10aSolubilization of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Using a Peptide Aptamer in Water below the Critical Micelle Concentration  ap. 3482-3488.  aThe solubilizing ability of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in water with several dispersants was investigated. Among the dispersants, including low-molecular-weight surfactants, peptides, DNA, and a water-soluble polymer, the peptide aptamer, A2 (IFRLSWGTYFS), exhibited the highest dispersion capability below the critical micelle concentration at a concentration of 0.02 w/v%. The dispersion of supernatant aqueous solution of SWCNTs containing aptamer A2 was essentially unchanged for several months after high-speed ultracentrifugation and gave rise to an efficient and stable dispersion of the SWCNTs in water. From the results of isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulations, the effective binding capability of A2 was due to π–π interaction between aromatic groups in the peptide aptamer and the side walls of SWCNTs. Interestingly, the peptide aptamer showed the possibility of diameter separation of semiconducting SWCNTs using a uniform density gradient ultracentrifuge. These phenomena are encouraging results toward an effective approach to the dispersion and separation of SWCNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaqueous solutions 3acalorimetry 3acarbon nanotubes 3amicelles 3amolecular dynamics 3aoligonucleotides 3apeptides 3apolymers 3asolubilization 3asurfactants 3atitration 3aultracentrifugation1 aKameda, Tomoshi1 aIsoshima, Takashi1 aKobatake, Eiry1 aTanaka, Takeshi1 aIto, Yoshihiro1 aKawamoto, Masuki0 tLangmuir.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 31, no. 11 p.3482-3488dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504777b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013300168300001600301520137800317592002801695650001601723650001401739650003801753650001101791650002401802650003101826650005201857650001401909650001501923653003701938653003401975653001702009653003102026700002502057700003402082700002202116700002902138773012102167856008202288852000902370655001202379IND60089813620221118141934.0160728e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008981362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazavi, Shahnaz10aCo-culture with neurotrophic factor secreting cells induced from adipose-derived stem cells: Promotes neurogenic differentiation  ap. 381-387.  aAdipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) can be equally proper in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, ADSCs have practical benefits. In this study, we attempted to induce the secretion of neurotrophic factors (NTF) in human ADSCs. We then evaluated the effects of co-culture with NTF secreting cells in neural differentiation of human ADSCs. Isolated human ADSCs were induced to neurotrophic factors secreting cells. To evaluate the in vitro effects of NTF-secreting ADSCs on neurogenic differentiation of ADSCs, we used neurogenic induction medium (control group), the combination of neurogenic medium and conditioned medium, or co-cultured NTF-secreting ADSCs which were encapsulated in alginate beads (co-culture) for 7days. ELISA showed increased (by about 5 times) release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in NTF-secreting ADSCs compared to human ADSCs. Real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that NTF-secreting ADSCs highly expressed NGF and BDNF. In addition, co-culture with NTF-secreting ADSCs could also promote neuronal differentiation relative to gliogenesis. Overall, NTF-secreting ADSCs secrete a range of growth factors whose levels in culture could promote neuronal differentiation and could support the survival and regeneration in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3acoculture 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3anerve growth factor 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3astem cells 0aHuman adipose-derived stem cells 0aNeurotrophic factor secretion 0aNeurogenesis 0aNeurodegenerative diseases1 aRazavi, Mohamad Reza1 aKheirollahi-Kouhestani, Mahsa1 aMardani, Mohammad1 aMostafavi, Fatemeh Sadat0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 440 p.381-387dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245009600182506010400278506007600382520122000458592002801678506003701706650002101743650002101764650001301785650001101798650001301809650001401822650001801836653002601854653001901880653001901899653001601918700003001934700003201964700003701996700002102033700006602054773009302120856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60770324520221207141118.0220830e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077032452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz Meneses, Rodrigo A.10aPlastic recycling and their use as raw material for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPollution by polymeric materials - in particular plastics - has a negative effect on the health of our planet. Approximately 4.9 billion tons of plastic are estimated to have been improperly disposed of, with the environment as their final destination. This scenario comes from a linear economic system, extraction-production-consumption and finally disposal. The alarming panorama has created the need to find technological solutions that generate new uses for discarded polymeric materials or turn them into part of the production process to produce new and novel materials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, or other carbonaceous materials of high added value, modifying the economy for a circular and sustainable production model. This review highlights the negative impact that the disposal of plastic materials has on the environment and the research needs that allow solving the pollution problems generated in the environment by these wastes.

Electronic patient records from a cat-dominant primary practice in metropolitan Sydney, Australia, where the body condition of cats was regularly recorded using a nine-point BCS scale were obtained. The maximum BCS of each cat during the visits was used as the primary exposure variable. Two survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations of BCS with cats’ survival and lifespan. In total, 2609 cats met the selection criteria from 4020 cats screened. The median of the maximum BCS was 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 5–7). Compared with cats with a maximum BCS of 6, increased hazards of death were observed in cats with a maximum BCS of 3 (hazard ratio [HR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.00–7.27), 4 (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.95–3.49), 5 (HR 1.43, 95% CI 11.5–1.76) and 9 (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.11–2.93). Median lifespan was 15.8 (IQR 13.5–17.6) years. Compared with cats reaching a maximum BCS of 6 in the same age group, cats reaching a maximum BCS of 4 (HR 4.15, 95% CI 1.26–13.67) or 5 (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.07–2.85) between age 1 and 3 years, and a maximum BCS of 3 (HR 6.09, 95% CI 1.47–25.25) and 9 (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.27–4.04) between the age of 3 and 11 years had shorter lifespans. There are significant associations of nine-point body condition scoring with survival and lifespan, and BCSs <5 and of 9 were found to be negatively associated with both. The study yielded information regarding a desirable BCS for cat longevity that veterinarians could consult with.  aFunding The authors are grateful to the Sydney School of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, for funding this project.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody condition 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3alongevity 3apatients 3aprimary contact 3aselection criteria 3aveterinarians 3aAustralia1 aMcGreevy, Paul D1 aToribio, Jenny-Ann LML1 aRaubenheimer, David1 aKendall, Kim1 aDhand, Navneet K0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 12 p.1110-1118dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X177521983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04181naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002500197245018700222300001600409506007600425520228000501592002802781506003702809650000802846650001602854650001902870650001402889650002002903650001302923650001702936650001702953650001002970650002102980650001103001650001903012650001103031650001503042650001803057650001403075650001503089650001503104650001503119650001903134653001303153653001703166653001503183653002103198653001803219653002403237700002103261700001903282700002503301700001803326700002203344773007803366856009003444852000903534655001203543IND60581483620221207095331.0171005e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058148362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.0262doi7 aPMC56101092pmcid7 a288890812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteffes, Victoria M.10aDistinct solubility and cytotoxicity regimes of paclitaxel-loaded cationic liposomes at low and high drug content revealed by kinetic phase behavior and cancer cell viability studies  ap. 242-255.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLipid-based particles are used worldwide in clinical trials as carriers of hydrophobic paclitaxel (PTXL) for cancer chemotherapy, albeit with little improvement over the standard-of-care. Improving efficacy requires an understanding of intramembrane interactions between PTXL and lipids to enhance PTXL solubilization and suppress PTXL phase separation into crystals. We studied the solubility of PTXL in cationic liposomes (CLs) composed of positively charged 2,3-dioleyloxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP) and neutral 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a function of PTXL membrane content and its relation to efficacy. Time-dependent kinetic phase diagrams were generated from observations of PTXL crystal formation by differential-interference-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, a new synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering in situ methodology applied to DOTAP/DOPC/PTXL membranes condensed with DNA enabled us to detect the incorporation and time-dependent depletion of PTXL from membranes by measurements of variations in the membrane interlayer and DNA interaxial spacings. Our results revealed three regimes with distinct time scales for PTXL membrane solubility: hours for >3 mol% PTXL (low), days for ≈ 3 mol% PTXL (moderate), and ≥20 days for < 3 mol% PTXL (long-term). Cell viability experiments on human cancer cell lines using CLPTXL nanoparticles (NPs) in the distinct CLPTXL solubility regimes reveal an unexpected dependence of efficacy on PTXL content in NPs. Remarkably, formulations with lower PTXL content and thus higher stability show higher efficacy than those formulated at the membrane solubility limit of ≈3 mol% PTXL (which has been the focus of most previous physicochemical studies and clinical trials of PTXL-loaded CLs). Furthermore, an additional high-efficacy regime is seen on occasion for liposome compositions with PTXL ≥9 mol% applied to cells at short time scales (hours) after formation. At longer time scales (days), CLPTXL NPs with ≥3 mol% PTXL lose efficacy while formulations with 1–2 mol% PTXL maintain high efficacy. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the relationship of the kinetic phase behavior and physicochemical properties of CLPTXL NPs to efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aX-radiation 3acell viability 3achlorides 3aclinical trials 3acrystals 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amicroscopy 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3aseparation 3asolubility 3asolubilization 0aLiposome 0aNanoparticle 0aPaclitaxel 0aHydrophobic drug 0aDrug delivery 0aCancer chemotherapy1 aMurali, Meena M.1 aPark, Yoonsang1 aFletcher, Bretton J.1 aEwert, Kai K.1 aSafinya, Cyrus R.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Nov., v. 145 p.242-255dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001500167245008900182300001400271520148500285592002801770650002301798650002501821650001001846650002201856650004001878650003801918650002601956650004701982650001802029650002702047650002702074650002502101650002802126650002602154650001402180650002602194650003202220650003502252650002302287650002402310700001402334700001302348700002102361700001802382773008102400856008202481852000902563655001202572IND60098911120221117212714.0141105e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891112DNAL7 a216642592pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiao10aUnusual signatures of highly adaptable R-loci in closely-related Arabidopsis species  ap. 24-33.  aPlant resistance genes (R-genes) evolve rapidly in response to changing environments. What are the most remarkable signatures of fast adaptive genes, besides the commonly revealed rapid divergence and high non-synonymous substitution rate? Here we investigated these changes in five R-loci following recent differentiation between Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata. Extreme differences in evolutionary rates were observed: e.g., an overall 5.46–9.83-fold different nucleotide diversity at two R-loci between species, ten-fold higher non-synonymous substitution rates within one species versus the other, significantly different Ka/Ks ratios between species for the same R-gene, and high interspecific divergence at one R-locus. Particularly, we observed an elevated level of trans-specific polymorphism at one R-locus and a differentially maintained presence/absence polymorphism at another. The high frequency of ancestral polymorphisms amongst R-genes suggests that the persistence of some functional variation is an important evolutionary mechanism shaping genetic variation in R-genes, while the variation of presence/absence polymorphisms provides a potential mechanism for malleable activation of adaptive resistance response pathways. The distinct patterns among R-genes suggest that the same R-gene ortholog can be quickly shaped by different evolutionary processes, e.g., purifying selection in one species but positive selection in a closely-related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis lyrata 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenes 3agenetic variation 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Substitutionxgenetics 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleotidesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpecies Specificity1 aZhang, Li1 aLi, Jing1 aLawton-Rauh, Amy1 aTian, Dacheng0 tGene.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 482, no. 1-2 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245009400174300001600268500001900284500002000303520183000323592002802153650001602181650001302197650001602210650001202226650001702238650001902255650001302274650001502287650001002302650001302312650001002325650001802335650002102353651001102374700001902385773011802404856009002522852000902612655001202621IND60734302720221122043315.0210417e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073430272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb03692.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, J.

Karst. were exposed in chambers to 240μg O₃ m‐³ for 70 d, 6hd‐¹ and then hardened for 14 d at 4°C day/night. The winter hardiness of trees was tested by subjecting excised shoots, bearing previous and current year's needles, to night temperatures of –6, –9, –12, –15 and – 18°C in a computer‐controlled freezer. No visible injury was observed during the fumigation, hardening period or on the current year's needles of any of the clones. However, during post‐freezing recovery in a mist spray unit four of the clones exposed to ozone developed extensive visible injury on the previous year's needles, in the form of severe, uniform necrosis. The affected needles began to fall prematurely. Induced chlorophyll fluorescence was significantly reduced by O₃ in two of the clones that showed post‐freezing injury. This suggested that O₃‐induced membrane injury increased the sensitivity of needles to freezing. One clone (no. 4076), which exhibited no effect of ozone on fluorescence kinetics, showed severe ozone‐induced injury of the previous year's needles, developing about 40 d after fumigation independent of temperature. Previous year's needles of O₃‐treated plants of this clone showed significantly greater rates of euticular transpiration, so the O₃ may have induced gradual desiccation of the needles. The restriction of damage to the older needles of certain clones of Norway spruce is consistent with symptoms of forest decline affecting high‐altitude forests on acid soils. Results indicate that O₃ predisposes trees to freezing injury, winter desiccation and drought, and it is proposed that such interactions are important factors contributing to the decline of high‐altitude forests of Norway spruce in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3afluorescence 3aforest decline 3afreezers 3afumigation 3amists 3anecrosis 3aozone 3atranspiration 3awinter hardiness 3aEurope1 aDavison, A.

Intradermal vaccination with dissolvable microneedle arrays (MNA) appears promising in this respect, as an easy-to-use and painless method. In this work, we have developed an MNA patch (MNAP) made of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and chondroitin sulphate (CS). In swines, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) formulated with the saponin QS-21 as adjuvant, both incorporated in HES-based MNAP, demonstrated the same level of immunogenicity as a commercially available aluminum-adjuvanted HBsAg vaccine, after two immunizations 28 days apart. MNAP application was associated with transient skin reactions (erythema, lump, scab), particularly evident when the antigen was delivered with the adjuvant. The thermostability of the adjuvanted antigen when incorporated in the HES-based matrix was also assessed by storing MNAP at 37, 45 or 50 °C for up to 6 months. We could demonstrate that antigenicity was retained at 37 and 45 °C and only a 10% loss was observed after 6 months at 50 °C. Our results are supportive of MNAP as an attractive alternative to classical syringe-based vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3achondroitin sulfate 3aerythema 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aimmune response 3asaponins 3astarch 3athermal stability 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHydroxyethyl starch 0aMicroneedle 0aHepatitis B antigen 0aQS-21 0aThermostability 0aVaccine1 aRenaud, Frédéric1 aDewar, Vincent1 aStrodiot, Laurent1 aWauters, Florence1 aJanimak, Jim1 aShimada, Toshio1 aNomura, Tatsuya1 aKabata, Koki1 aKuruma, Koji1 aKusano, Takayuki1 aSakai, Masaki1 aNagasaki, Hideo1 aOyamada, Takayoshi0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Nov., v. 145 p.256-265dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008000166300001800246520134000264592002801604650002901632650000901661650001801670650001101688650000901699650001601708650001401724650001801738650002301756651000901779700002101788773012301809856008101932852000902013655001202022IND60616504220221118090652.0181017e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061650422DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293181000952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwliaie, H.

The ratio of Feₒ/Fed varied from 0.03 to 0.64. χₗf ranged from 1.8 to 113 × 10⁻⁸ m³ kg⁻¹ in the soil studied. The variation of χfd ranged from 0.0 to 9.65%. The χfd values observed in non-aquic soils were larger than in aquic soils (4.00% vs. 1.37%). Positive correlations were observed between χ and clay contents in both aquic and non-aquic soils; however, non-aquic soil samples showed a larger coefficient of determination. A positive correlation existed between χfd and χ in aquic and non-aquic soils. Higher values of χfd were observed at the soil surface of non-aquic soil samples than at deeper levels, suggesting a greater proportion of ultrafine grains. Of the soil properties that were assessed, clay, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), Fed, Feₒ/Fed ratio, χₗf and χfd contents, changed significantly in response to the aquic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3agrains 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3asoil sampling 3asoil water regimes 3aIran1 aNajafi Ghiri, M.0 tEurasian soil science.g2018 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.1252-1265dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3978911x1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293181000953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245011500172520142000287592002801707650001001735650001401745650001901759650001501778650001501793650001301808650001501821650003001836650001001866650001301876650002301889650001801912650001501930650001901945650002101964650001201985651001101997700002802008700002902036700002702065700003402092700003302126700002502159700002202184773012002206856007902326852000902405655001202414IND60707860120221121050007.0200821e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070786012DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110804682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, David  Campos10aDiversity of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Caatinga Biome, Brazil, from the Widespread to the Endemic  aMosquito fauna in the northeast semiarid region of Brazil, Caatinga biome, are poorly known. Studies on the diversity are scarce and the few surveys available focus on local fauna. In order to understand the ecological pattern of mosquito’s distribution, information available from studies from 2008 to 2015 were gathered. A partitioning framework of the beta diversity, the turnover (βJTU) and nestedness (βJNE) components were used to determine dissimilarity among communities. Eighty-two morphospecies were recorded and 47 of the species were not shared between the areas. The most representative genera were Aedes, Anopheles, Psorophora, Haemagogus, Coquillettidia, and Mansonia, which all include species of medical interest. The communities had high rates of variation, and the mechanism of turnover accounted for the observed diversity pattern. Despite differences in collection methods, the observed dissimilarity may be related to the broad environmental heterogeneity of the biome, the intrinsic relationships of the species with their habitats, and the environmental degradation caused by different types of anthropogenic interference. Considering the mosquito species richness and endemicity, the hypothesis that the Caatinga harbor poor biodiversity is rejected. The spatial variation observed is of particular importance and should be taken into account for the knowledge of Caatinga biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes 3aAnopheles 3aCoquillettidia 3aHaemagogus 3aPsorophora 3acaatinga 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3afauna 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amorphospecies 3anestedness 3asemiarid zones 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3aBrazil1 aMorais, Sirlei  Antunes1 aMarteis, Letícia  Silva1 aGama, Renata  Antonaci1 aFreire, Renato  Cesar de Melo1 aRekowski, Belgrano  Santiago1 aUeno, Helene  Mariko1 aLa Corte, Roseli 0 tInsects.g2020 July 24, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110804683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245005600186300001400242520132400256592002801580650001601608650001901624650001801643650001001661650001801671650001101689650001401700650002401714650002401738650001201762650003301774650003901807650002501846650002001871650002201891650002101913650001101934650002201945650002801967650002101995650001402016650003202030650002302062650003402085700002002119700002102139773008102160856008202241852000902323655001202332IND60098911320221117212654.0141105e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891132DNAL7 a216401722pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavisankar, V.10aMolecular evolution of the EGF–CFC protein family  ap. 43-50.  aThe epidermal growth factor-Cripto-1/FRL-1/Cryptic (EGF–CFC) proteins, characterized by the highly conserved EGF and CFC domains, are extracellular membrane associated growth factor-like glycoproteins. These proteins are essential components of the Nodal signaling pathway during early vertebrate embryogenesis. Homologs of the EGF–CFC family have also been implicated in tumorigenesis in humans. Yet, little is known about the mode of molecular evolution in this family. Here we investigate the origin, extent of conservation and evolutionary relationships of EGF–CFC proteins across the metazoa. The results suggest that the first appearance of the EGF–CFC gene occurred in the ancestor of the deuterostomes. Phylogenetic analysis supports the classification of the family into distinct subfamilies that appear to have evolved through lineage-specific duplication and divergence. Site-specific analyses of evolutionary rate shifts between the two major mammalian paralogous subfamilies, Cripto and Cryptic, reveal critical amino acid sites that may account for the observed functional divergence. Furthermore, estimates of functional divergence suggest that rapid change of evolutionary rates at sites located mainly in the CFC domain may contribute towards distinct functional properties of the two paralogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acarcinogenesis 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3asignal transduction 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxchemistry 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExonsxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenomexgenetics 2aHumans 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aSingh, Taran P.1 aManoj, Narayanan0 tGene.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 482, no. 1-2 p.43-50dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001800296520204400314592002802358650001302386650001502399650001702414650001502431650002402446650002602470650001002496650001202506650001402518650001902532650001402551650001402565650001602579650001902595650001802614650001102632650001202643650001502655650001102670651001102681700001502692700001702707700001602724700001602740700001502756773012302771856008102894852000902975655001202984IND60616504320221118090604.0181017e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061650432DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293181001492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillenave, C.10aRapid Changes in Soil Nematodes in the First Years after Technosol Construction for the Remediation of an Industrial Wasteland  ap. 1266-1273.  aTechnosol construction is an emergent technology that uses an assemblage of technogenic materials for the ecological reclamation of derelict land and waste recycling. Knowledge about the colonisation of Technosols by soil biota is limited, despite the latter’s central role in ecosystem functioning. In this four-year field (2008 to 2011) study, we characterized the development over time of the diversity and the abundance of soil nematodes in two types of Technosols in North-Eastern France. We also studied the nematode community structure, abundance of taxa and functional groups in both Technosol profiles in the third year of the study. Samples were collected from the top soil layer (0–20 cm) each year in the spring (April), on a one ha. field experiment that had spatially divided in 24 sampling areas. For soil profiles, three samples were collected in three horizons within six pits (three pits per Technosol). Nematodes were extracted from soil and identified at the family or genus level and then classified into functional feeding guilds. In the first year, the community was dominated by opportunistic bacterial feeders. The taxonomic and functional nematode diversity increased with time, with a dominance of non-opportunistic bacterial feeders after four years, but also the significant presence of fungal feeders, omnivorous and carnivorous, as well as plant parasites and insect parasites. No significant difference was observed between the two Technosols. Each layer showed distinct communities, with nematode diversity and abundance decreasing with depth. Abundance and diversity, coupled with the analysis of several indexes, commonly used for nematodes, including Maturity index (MI), Enrichment index (EI), Structure index (SI) and Nematode channel ratio (NCR), lead to the conclusion that the high organic matter content, particularly in the upper horizon of both Technosols, guaranteed nematode colonization and progressive diversification, and is likely to be the key for successful biodiversity reclamation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aTechnosols 3abiodiversity 3acarnivores 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3ainsects 3aomnivores 3aorganic matter 3aparasites 3arecycling 3aremediation 3asoil nematodes 3asoil profiles 3aspring 3atopsoil 3awastelands 3awastes 3aFrance1 aSéré, G.1 aSchwartz, C.1 aWatteau, F.1 aJimenez, A.1 aCortet, J.0 tEurasian soil science.g2018 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.1266-1273dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3978911x1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293181001493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009800177300001400275520188900289592002802178653001302206653001202219653002502231653002502256700001402281700003002295700002902325700002002354773009502374856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60592198720221120232326.0180331e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059219872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.neuro.2017.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkinyemi, Ayodele Jacob10aCurcumin administration suppress acetylcholinesterase gene expression in cadmium treated rats  ap. 75-79.  aCurcumin, the main polyphenolic component of turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes have been reported to exert anticholinesterase potential with limited information on how they regulate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression. Hence, this study sought to evaluate the effect of curcumin on cerebral cortex acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and their mRNA gene expression level in cadmium (Cd)-treated rats. Furthermore, in vitro effect of different concentrations of curcumin (1–5μg/mL) on rat cerebral cortex AChE activity was assessed. Animals were divided into six groups (n=6): group 1 serve as control (without Cd) and receive saline/vehicle, group 2 receive saline plus curcumin at 25mg/kg, group 3 receive saline plus curcumin 50mg/kg, group 4 receive Cd plus vehicle, group 5 receive Cd plus curcumin at 25mg/kg and group 6 receive Cd plus curcumin at 50mg/kg. Rats received Cd (2.5mg/kg) and curcumin (25 and 50mg/kg, respectively) by oral gavage for 7days. Acetylcholinesterase activity was measured by Ellman’s method and AChE expression was carried out by a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. We observed that acute administration of Cd increased acetylcholinesterase activity and in addition caused a significant (P<0.05) increase in AChE mRNA levels in whole cerebral cortex when compared to control group. However, co-treatment with curcumin inhibited AChE activity and alters AChE mRNA levels when compared to Cd-treated group. In addition, curcumin inhibits rat cerebral cortex AChE activity in vitro. In conclusion, curcumin exhibit anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and suppressed AChE mRNA gene expression level in Cd exposed rats, thus providing some biochemical and molecular evidence on the therapeutic effect of this turmeric-derived compound in treating neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCurcumin 0aCadmium 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0amRNA gene expression1 aOboh, G.,1 aFadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun1 aOlatunji, Babawale Peter1 aAkomolafe, Seun0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.75-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001400159245007000173300001400243520191500257592002802172650001902200650002702219650002302246650002602269650002402295650001302319650001102332650001402343650001302357650001202370650001302382650003802395650001602433650002502449651001702474651001002491651001002501700001702511700001502528700001802543700001902561700002502580700002202605700002402627700001502651700001302666700001802679700001802697700002002715700001702735700001402752773011802766856004102884852000902925655001202934IND50072433020221120063753.0140129e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007243302DNAL7 a239925992pmid7 a10.1111/cobi.121352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan,10aRole of Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in Snow Leopard Conservation  ap. 87-94.  aThe snow leopard (Panthera uncia) inhabits the rugged mountains in 12 countries of Central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. Due to poaching, decreased abundance of prey, and habitat degradation, it was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1972. Current conservation strategies, including nature reserves and incentive programs, have limited capacities to protect snow leopards. We investigated the role of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in snow leopard conservation in the Sanjiangyuan region in China's Qinghai Province on the Tibetan Plateau. From 2009 to 2011, we systematically surveyed snow leopards in the Sanjiangyuan region. We used the MaxEnt model to determine the relation of their presence to environmental variables (e.g., elevation, ruggedness) and to predict snow leopard distribution. Model results showed 89,602 km² of snow leopard habitat in the Sanjiangyuan region, of which 7674 km² lay within Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve's core zones. We analyzed the spatial relation between snow leopard habitat and Buddhist monasteries and found that 46% of monasteries were located in snow leopard habitat and 90% were within 5 km of snow leopard habitat. The 336 monasteries in the Sanjiangyuan region could protect more snow leopard habitat (8342 km²) through social norms and active patrols than the nature reserve's core zones. We conducted 144 household interviews to identify local herders’ attitudes and behavior toward snow leopards and other wildlife. Most local herders claimed that they did not kill wildlife, and 42% said they did not kill wildlife because it was a sin in Buddhism. Our results indicate monasteries play an important role in snow leopard conservation. Monastery‐based snow leopard conservation could be extended to other Tibetan Buddhist regions that in total would encompass about 80% of the global range of snow leopards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera uncia 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amountains 3awildlife 2aAnimals 2aBuddhism 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironment 2aPantheraxphysiology 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 0aChina1 aWang, Dajun,1 aYin, Hang,1 aZHAXI, DUOJIE1 aJIAGONG, ZHALA1 aSchaller, George B.,1 aMISHRA, CHARUDUTT1 aMCCARTHY, THOMAS M.1 aWang, Hao,1 aWu, Lan,1 aXIAO, LINGYUN1 aBASANG, LAMAO1 aZhang, Yuguang,1 aZHOU, YUNYUN1 aLü, Zhi,0 tConservation biology.g2014 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.87-94dBlackwell Science, IncwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12135  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011900165300001800284520177800302536012002080592002802200650000902228650001902237650000902256650002402265650001402289700002102303700002302324773012702347856008002474852000902554655001202563IND60623888820221122120106.0181129e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388882DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X187575922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspadas, Irene10aOptimal safe implantation corridors in feline cervical vertebrae (C2–T1): CT study in 16 domestic shorthair cats  ap. 1149-1157.  aThe objective of this study was to define safe corridors for the optimal placement of bicortical implants in the feline cervical spine (C2–T1) using CT. CT images of feline cervical spines (n = 16) were reviewed retrospectively. Multiplanar reconstructions were used to define the optimal safe corridors. Safe corridors were defined by their angle of insertion, width and length. The insertion point within the vertebral body was also described. Vertebral measurements were compared between vertebrae using multilevel linear regression, and left and right measurements within vertebrae were compared with the paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A P value <0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. The safe corridor insertion points were located within the caudal third of the vertebral body in C2 (mean cranial vertebral ratio 0.73) and in the cranial third of the vertebral bodies from C3–T1 (mean cranial vertebral ratios 0.34–0.38). Mean safe corridor widths ranged from 1.04 mm in C2 to 2.30 mm in C7 and T1. The mean right and left optimal angles of implantation were, respectively, 21.79° and 21.49° for C2, 45.26° and 46.19° for C3, 51.48° and 51.04° for C4, 53.52° and 54.30° for C5, 56.36° and 56.65° for C6, 63.40° and 64.92° for C7, and 53.90° and 52.90° for T1. There were statistically significant differences between vertebrae in almost every measurement. Cervical vertebral safe corridors in cats are narrow and differ to those reported in dogs. Safe corridors are located in the caudal third of C2 and cranial third of the C3–T1 vertebral bodies. Current recommendations for implant sizes should be reviewed, as 1.5–2 mm implants would be oversized for bicortical implantation in most of the feline cervical vertebrae.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3acervical spine 3adogs 3aregression analysis 3avertebrae1 aMaddox, Thomas W1 ade Vicente, Felipe0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 12 p.1149-1157dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187575923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016200156300001800318520184800336592002802184650001202212650001302224650002302237650002102260650001902281650002302300650001102323650001302334700002502347773012102372856007502493852000902568655001202577IND60558815820221120172618.0161117e20130425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055881582DNAL7 a10.1021/jp308589b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Susmita10aChemical Unfolding of Chicken Villin Headpiece in Aqueous Dimethyl Sulfoxide Solution: Cosolvent Concentration Dependence, Pathway, and Microscopic Mechanism  ap. 4488-4502.  aUnfolding of a protein often proceeds through partial unfolded intermediate states (PUIS). PUIS have been detected in several experimental and simulation studies. However, complete analyses of transitions between different PUIS and the unfolding trajectory are sparse. To understand such dynamical processes, we study chemical unfolding of a small protein, chicken villin head piece (HP-36), in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. We carry out molecular dynamics simulations at various solution compositions under ambient conditions. In each concentration, the initial step of unfolding involves separation of two adjacent native contacts, between phenyl alanine residues (11–18 and 7–18). This first step induces, under appropriate conditions, subsequent separation among other hydrophobic contacts, signifying a high degree of cooperativity in the unfolding process. The observed sequence of structural changes in HP-36 on increasing DMSO concentration and the observed sequence of PUIS, are in approximate agreement with earlier simulation results (in pure water) and experimental observations on unfolding of HP-36. Peculiar to water-DMSO mixture, an intervening structural transformation (around 15% of DMSO) in the binary mixture solvent retards the progression of unfolding as composition is increased. This is reflected in a remarkable nonmonotonic composition dependence of RMSD, radius of gyration and the fraction of native contacts. At 30% mole fraction of DMSO, we find the extended randomly coiled structure of the unfolded protein. The molecular mechanism of DMSO induced unfolding process is attributed to the initial preferential solvation of the hydrophobic side chain atoms through the methyl groups of DMSO, followed by the hydrogen bonding of the oxygen atom of DMSO to the exposed backbone NH groups of HP-36.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3achickens 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3asolvents1 aBagchi, B.q(Biman),0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 117, no. 16 p.4488-4502dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp308589b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245013700170300001400307520205600321592002802377650003102405650001602436650001802452650001902470650002302489650002402512650002402536650002502560650001302585650001902598653002502617653001002642653002102652653001802673653002202691700001702713700001802730700002002748700001802768700002002786700001602806700001702822700001902839700001502858700001602873773010502889856009102994852000903085655001203094IND60581484120221120073810.0181010e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058148412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Minae10aExtracellular matrix-derived extracellular vesicles promote cardiomyocyte growth and electrical activity in engineered cardiac atria  ap. 49-59.  aExtracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in the provision of the necessary microenvironment for the proper regeneration of the cardiac tissue. However, specific mechanisms that lead to ECM-mediated cardiac regeneration are not well understood. To elucidate the potential mechanisms, we investigated ultra-structures of the cardiac ECM using electron microscopy. Intriguingly, we observed large quantities of micro-vesicles from decellularized right atria. RNA and protein analyses revealed that these contained exosomal proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs), which we referred to herein as ECM-derived extracellular vesicles (ECM-EVs). One particular miRNA from ECM-EVs, miR-199a-3p, promoted cell growth of isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes and sinus nodal cells by repressing homeodomain-only protein (HOPX) expression and increasing GATA-binding 4 (Gata4) acetylation. To determine the mechanisms, we knocked down Gata4 and showed that miR-199a-3p actions required Gata4 for cell proliferation in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes and sinus nodal cells. To further explore the role of this miRNA, we isolated neonatal cardiac cells and recellularized into atrial ECM, referred here has engineered atria. Remarkably, miR-199a-3p mediated the enrichment of cardiomyocyte and sinus nodal cell population, and enhanced electrocardiographic signal activity of sinus nodal cells in the engineered atria. Importantly, antisense of miRNA (antagomir) against miR-199a-3p was capable of abolishing these actions of miR-199a-3p in the engineered atria. We further showed in Ang II-infused animal model of sinus nodal dysfunction that miR-199-3p-treated cardiac cells remarkably ameliorated and restored the electrical activity as shown by normalization of the ECG, in contrast to untreated cells, which did not show electrical recovery. In conclusion, these results provide clear evidence of the critical role of ECM, in not only providing a scaffold for cardiac tissue growth, but also in promoting atrial electrical function through ECM-derived miR-199a-3p.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3aacetylation 3aanimal models 3acardiomyocytes 3acell proliferation 3aelectrocardiography 3aelectron microscopy 3aextracellular matrix 3amicroRNA 3aultrastructure 0aExtracellular matrix 0amiRNA 0aEngineered heart 0aCardiomyocyte 0aSinus nodal cells1 aKwon, Kihwan1 aPark, Junbeom1 aRyu, Dong-Ryeol1 aShin, Jung-A.1 aLee Kang, Jihee1 aChoi, Ji Ha1 aPak, Ŭn-mi,1 aLee, Kyung Eun1 aWoo, Minna1 aKim, Minsuk0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Nov., v. 146 p.49-59dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002300150245011800173300001600291520192900307592002802236650001502264650001302279650004302292650001302335650001202348650001302360650002202373650001802395650001302413650001102426650001102437773008402448856008602532852000902618655001202627IND4468955720221122230212.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446895572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElÅ¼bieta, Rytel13aTheeffect of industrial potato processing on the concentrations of glycoalkaloids and nitrates in potato granules  ap. 380-384.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of the different stages of industrial processing of potatoes, on the content of glycoalkaloids (chaconine and solanine) and nitrates in the raw material, intermediates, finished granules and waste products. The material used for the study included samples of raw tubers, semi-finished products and finished products taken directly from 8 points in the technological line for the production of potato granules, and 3 points from the waste product line. The samples were collected three times within two years of research (in 2009 and 2010) from the following places: 1/unpeeled potato, 2/potato after peeling, 3/potato after blanching, 4/potato after cooling, 5/steamed potato, 6/pneumatically dried potato, 7/product after fluidization drying, 8/granulated product, and waste products: 9/peels, 10/waste after air drying and 11/after fluidization drying. In the raw material, intermediates, finished granules and waste products, the concentrations of glycoalkaloids (Î±-chaconine and Î±-solanine) were determined using an HPLC method, and nitrates were determined colorimetrically using an RQflex analyser. It was found that the industrial processes of potato granules significantly decreased the concentration of glycoalkaloids (chaconine and solanine) and nitrates in intermediates and finished products when compared to raw material. The highest decrease in glycoalkaloids was caused by peeling (50%) and blanching (63%). The concentration of nitrates decreased the most after thermal processes â after blanching a decrease of 20% and after air drying â by 50%. The dehydrated potato granules contained on average 14% of the initial quantity of glycoalkaloids and 48% of nitrates. High content of toxic compounds was found in potato peels but dry wastes after pneumatic drying or after fluidization contained proportionally low contents of those compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3agranules 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anitrates 3apeeling 3apotatoes 3aprocessing stages 3araw materials 3asolanine 3atubers 3awastes0 tFood control.g2012 Dec., v. 28, no. 2 p.380-384dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245007200168300001800240520139500258592002801653650002401681650001901705650001501724650002401739650002301763650003101786700002301817700001901840700001501859700002601874700002401900773012101924856007502045852000902120655001202129IND60558815920221120182941.0161117e20130425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055881592DNAL7 a10.1021/jp308594b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardo, Christopher J.10aDevice Physics and Operation of Lateral Bulk Heterojunction Devices  ap. 4503-4509.  aMeasurements of lateral bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices have recently been reported as a means to characterize charge transport and recombination properties within organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials. These structures allow for the direct measurement of the lateral extents of the space charge regions, potential and electric field profiles, current versus voltage characteristics, and other physical and chemical properties. This article describes numerical simulations that show three different transport regimes present within lateral BHJ devices and two different experimental methods, which verify those findings. These measurement techniques utilize typical confocal microscopy tools as well as steady-state current versus voltage measurements on high aspect ratio nanofabricated structures in order to probe the material properties between the electrodes. Experimental results show that the lateral extents of space charge regions within these devices are approximately 1–5 μm, which are related to the drift lengths of the charge carriers, and that the mechanism of bimolecular recombination is shown to be a bulk material property. The results within this article describe a series of methods to evaluate charge transport and recombination along the in-plane direction in BHJ films and provide complementary insights to those obtained from vertical-device-based measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal microscopy 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3amathematical models 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysicochemical properties1 aDanielson, Eric L.1 aGlaz, Micah

The concentration of organic matter in the solution after its interaction with the E horizon increased by 10–44% due to the release of native soluble organic matter. This was accompanied by changes in the quality of water-soluble organic matter: the portion of hydrophobic components increased, the coefficients of extinction at 254–280 nm decreased, and the portion of low-molecular-weight compounds slightly decreased with a corresponding increase in the portion of high-molecular-weight compounds. Upon the interaction of water-soluble organic substances with the E horizon, the pH values first decreased and then slightly increased, which could be due to sequential desorption of organic acids of different strengths. Dissolved organic substances from the E horizon were partly sorbed in the BF horizon at the rate of about 65 mg С/100 g, or 22% of Cₒᵣg in the BF horizon. The sorption resulted in the removal of mainly hydrophobic medium- and high-molecular-weight (>7000 Da) organic substances from the solution. As judged from the coefficients of extinction in the UV area, the sorbed substances were characterized by a higher aromaticity in comparison with the substances remaining in the solution. The sorption of organic substances in the BF horizon was accompanied by the rise in the pH of the solution, which corresponded to binding of organic anions on the surface of iron hydroxides according to the mechanism of ligand exchange with OH ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aE horizons 3aPodzols 3aanions 3adesorption 3aextinction 3aforest litter 3ahydrophobicity 3airon hydroxides 3aligands 3amodels 3aorganic acids and salts 3aorganic matter 3apH 3asorption 3awater solubility1 aKaravanova, E.

The bacterium–vector initial interactions involve bacterial membrane-bound adhesins that mediate cell attachment to the foregut of insect vectors. We investigated the role of the afimbrial adhesin XadA2 in the binding and biofilm formation of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca to vector surfaces in vitro, as well as its potential to disrupt pathogen transmission. We showed that XadA2 has binding affinity for polysaccharides on sharpshooter hindwings, used as a proxy for the interactions between X. fastidiosa and vectors. When in a medium without carbon sources, the bacterium used wing components, likely chitin, as a source of nutrients and formed a biofilm on the wing surface. There was a significant reduction in X. fastidiosa biofilm formation and cell aggregation on vector wings in competition assays with XadA2 or its specific antibody (anti-XadA2). Finally, pathogen acquisition and transmission to plant were significantly reduced when the vectors acquired X. fastidiosa from an artificial diet supplemented with anti-XadA2. These results show that XadA2 is important in mediating bacterial colonization in the insect and that it could be used as a target for blocking X. fastidiosa transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca 3aadhesins 3aantibodies 3aartificial diets 3abacterial colonization 3abinding capacity 3abiofilm 3achitin 3adisease transmission 3aforegut 3ainsect vectors 3anutrients 3apathogens 3awings1 aLopes Nalin, Julia 1 aKudlawiec, Karla 1 aCaserta Salviatto, Raquel 1 ade Melo Sales, Tiago 1 aSicard, Anne 1 aPiacentini Paes de Almeida, Rodrigo 1 aAlves de Souza, Alessandra 1 aRoberto Spotti Lopes, João 0 tInsects.g2020 July 26, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110804733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245007100172300001600243520174800259592002802007650001402035650001402049650002202063650001702085650002102102650001902123650001402142650001202156650001802168650001702186650002202203650002802225650001902253650002302272650001702295653002302312653001402335653001702349653003302366653000802399700002002407700002002427700002002447773009302467856009102560852000902651655001202660IND60581484320221120205500.0181010e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058148432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Xinggui10aAIEgens for biological process monitoring and disease theranostics  ap. 115-135.  aBiological processes are of great significance for the normal physiological functions of living organisms and closely related to the health. Monitoring of biological processes and diagnosis of diseases based on fluorescent techniques would provide comprehensive insight into mechanism of life and pathogenesis of diseases, precisely guiding therapeutic effect in theranostics. It largely relied on fluorophores with the properties of excellent photostability, large Stokes shift, high signal-to-noise ratio and free of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. Luminogens with aggregation-induced emission characteristic (AIEgens) could serve as superior agents for biological process monitoring and disease theranostics. Herein, we review the recent results in the aspects of monitoring biological processes such as autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrion-related dynamics, cell mitotic, long-term cellular tracing and apoptosis as well as the diagnosis of related diseases based on AIEgens in real time. As part of AIEgens and AIEgen-based nanoparticles with the functionalities of drugs, photosensitizers and adjuvants accompanied with imaging, they exhibit huge potential in theranostic systems for image-guided chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy and so on. Collectively, these examples show the potentials of AIEgens for understanding disease pathogenesis, for drug development and evaluation, and for clinical disease diagnosis and therapy. Future research efforts focused on developing long-wavelength excitable and phosphorescence-emissive AIEgens with improved depth-penetration and minimized background interference for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, will extend the potential applications of AIEgens in in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aapoptosis 3adisease diagnosis 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amitophagy 3amitosis 3ananoparticles 3apathogenesis 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphotostability 3aprocess monitoring 3aradiotherapy 0aBiological process 0aDiagnosis 0aTheranostics 0aAggregation-induced emission 0aAIE1 aKwok, Ryan T.K.1 aLam, Jacky W.Y.1 aTang, Ben Zhong0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Nov., v. 146 p.115-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245023900169520174000408592002802148650000902176650002102185650001302206650001502219650001602234650001602250650001102266650001202277650001102289650003002300650002702330650001702357650000902374651001002383653002902393653004502422653001502467653003202482653002802514700001702542700001802559700001702577700001502594700001702609700001902626700001702645700001402662700001802676700005602694773009602750856008702846852000902933655001202942IND60741877120221118053555.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xianli12aA multi-plug filtration (m-PFC) cleanup method based on carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes for the detection of 14 perfluorinated compounds and dietary risk assessment of chicken, beef, and mutton collected from Shanghai markets  aDietary intake is a major pathway of human exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Livestock and poultry meats (chicken, beef, mutton) account for a significant proportion of dietary consumption in China, and thus it is crucial to investigate the levels and composition profiles of PFCs in consumer meats to assess and mitigate potential health risks. However, rapid and simple analytical methods for such investigations are lacking. This study addresses this shortcoming by developing a rapid filtration clean-up method using carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) for the detection of 14 PFCs. Good linearities (R² > 0.99) were obtained for all 14 PFCs in chicken, beef, and mutton. Recoveries ranged from 65 to 145% (except perfluorotetradecanoic acid, PFTeDA) with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 16%. Method limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.12 and 0.83 ng g⁻¹d.w. Subsequently, this method was applied for the analysis of 46 livestock and poultry meat samples collected from markets in Shanghai. PFCs were detected in all samples with total concentrations of 1.61–4.27 ng g⁻¹ wet weight (w.w) in chicken, 1.51–5.56 ng g⁻¹ w.w in beef and 1.61–8.15 ng g⁻¹ w.w in mutton. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant compounds in these samples and accounted for over 92% of ΣPFCs. For regulated compounds such as PFOA, risk quotients (RQs) were determined to be much lower than 1. This suggests that chicken, beef, and mutton from Shanghai market pose very low PFC exposure risk to residents. However, high detection frequency of the unregulated PFBA demands further investigation of short-chain PFCs in consumer meats.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acarbon nanotubes 3achickens 3afiltration 3afood intake 3afood safety 3ahumans 3amarkets 3amutton 3anutrition risk assessment 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apoultry meat 3arisk 3aChina 0aPerfluorinated compounds 0aCarboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aLivestock and poultry meats 0aDietary risk assessment1 aZhang, Qicai1 aZhao, Zhiyong1 aSong, Weiguo1 aCheng, Lin1 aYang, Junhua1 aChen, Shanshan1 aGuan, Shuhui1 aSong, Wei1 aRao, Qinxiong1 aZhao, Zhihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-28800 tFood control.g2021 Dec., v. 130 p.108330-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002100168245013300189300001400322520154200336592002801878650001501906650001901921650002201940650001101962650001001973650001601983650002701999650001402026650002102040650001702061650001302078650001102091650001302102650001202115650003102127650001602158650002102174650001502195650002202210650002802232650004702260650004602307650003502353650002702388650004802415700002702463700002202490700003002512700002202542700001902564773009302583856008502676852000902761655001202770IND4446546220221120065156.0141110e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444654622DNAL7 a209471832pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrevisan, Rafael10aSelenium in water enhances antioxidant defenses and protects against copper-induced DNA damage in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis  ap. 64-71.  aSelenium and copper are naturally occurring elements in the environment that have important roles in cellular function. Selenium is known for its role in antioxidant defense, whereas copper is a redox-active metal capable of acting as a pro-oxidant. We investigated the effects of short term selenium (Na₂SeO₃) supplementation (4μg/L for 3 days) on antioxidant parameters of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and its possible protective effects against a subsequent copper (CuSO₄) exposure (56μg/L for 3 days). Selenium supplementation caused a 4-fold increase in glutathione levels in gills. The activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was modulated by selenium in gills (2-fold increase) and also in cell-free haemolymph (40% increase). Copper exposure produced decreases in protein thiol levels (35%) and in thioredoxin reductase activity (60%) in gills and induced an increase in DNA damage in haemocytes (70% increase in % tail DNA observed using the comet assay). The decrease in thioredoxin reductase activity may constitute a mechanism of copper toxicity in bivalves, warranting further investigation. Pre-treatment with selenium largely prevented these deleterious effects of copper on protein thiols, thioredoxin reductase activity and DNA damage. The results suggest that induction of key antioxidant defenses such as glutathione and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, as a result of selenium supplementation, may play an important role in protection of aquatic organisms against oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aMytilus edulis 3aaquatic organisms 3acopper 3agills 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemocytes 3aoxidative stress 3apretreatment 3aselenium 3athiols 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aComet Assay 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aDNA Damage 2aGillsxmetabolism 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aMytilus edulisxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aSeleniumxpharmacology 2aThioredoxin-Disulfide Reductasexmetabolism1 aFerraz Mello, Danielle1 aFisher, Andrew S.1 aSchuwerack, Petra-Manuela1 aDafre, Alcir Luiz1 aMoody, A.

Chronic exposure to insecticides has adverse effects on various human body organs. In this study, hematological findings were assessed in workers in an insecticide manufacturing plant. Hematological parameters and clinical symptoms were recorded in 99 workers exposed to insecticides and 107 workers not exposed to them in a cross-sectional study. Assessment of the hematological results showed a higher prevalence of thrombocytosis in the exposed group than the non-exposed group (P < 0.05). Mean white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, anisocytosis of red blood cells (RBCs), and neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group (P < 0.05). Prevalence rates of headache, itchy skin, cough, and sleep disorders were higher in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group (P < 0.05). Chronic exposure to insecticides can alter hematological parameters in the normal range. Occupational exposure to insecticides may increase WBCs, platelet count, NLR, and red cell distribution width (RDW). It can also cause thrombocytosis. Complete blood count (CBC), as an inexpensive and accessible tool, can help monitor workers' health status exposed to insecticides properly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood platelet count 3achronic exposure 3acough 3across-sectional studies 3aheadache 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3ainsecticides 3aneutrophils 3aoccupational exposure 3asleep 0aInsecticides 0aOccupational exposure 0aHematologic tests 0aChronic toxicity1 aAbdollahi, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0123-12091 aAttarchi, Mirsaeed1 aRoushan, Zahra Atrkar1 aDeilami, Alireza Etemadi1 aJoshan, Maryam1 aRahattalab, Fateme1 aFaraji, Niloofar1 aKojidi, Hamid Mohammadi0 tHeliyon.g2022 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.e09040-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245010500185300001400290520127700304592002801581650002101609650002901630650004101659650003901700650001201739650002201751650001601773650003101789650001001820650001301830650002201843650005201865650002201917650002001939650003201959650001701991650001802008650001302026650003802039650001702077650003202094650002802126650002602154650002302180650002602203650002302229700001602252700001802268773008102286856008202367852000902449655001202458IND60098911920221117212704.0141105e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891192DNAL7 a216359422pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas, Stuart10aTMPIT1 from wild emmer wheat: First characterisation of a stress-inducible integral membrane protein  ap. 22-28.  aIn this study a gene for a drought stress-inducible putative membrane protein was cloned and characterised from root tissue of wild emmer wheat. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein is a member of the widespread but hitherto uncharacterised TMPIT (transmembrane protein inducible by TNF-α) family, so it was labelled TdicTMPIT1. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the TdicTMPIT1 gene is upregulated on drought stress in drought-tolerant wild emmer wheat, but not in a drought-sensitive accession or in cultivated durum wheat. The TdicTMPIT1 product was predicted to be a membrane protein with four transmembrane helices. The protein was expressed and analysed in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cellular localisation of the protein in the cell was also investigated using an eGFP-tagged form of the protein in S. cerevisiae. Results obtained by confocal laser microscopy indicated that the TdicTMPIT1 tagged with GFP was localised in a membraneous compartment. It is concluded that TdicTMPIT1 is a membrane protein associated with the drought stress response in wild emmer wheat, and so it may be useful for the improvement of modern wheat genotypes. Members of this protein family in other organisms are proposed also to be involved in stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adurum wheat 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3amembrane proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awater stress 2aBase Sequence 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Rootsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aStress, Physiological 2aTriticumxgenetics1 aDogan, Esen1 aBudak, Hikmet0 tGene.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 483, no. 1-2 p.22-28dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010500167300001600272500001400288520184300302592002802145650002702173650001702200650001702217650001402234650001502248650001902263650002802282650001402310650003102324650001202355650001202367650001002379650001502389650001602404650002502420650001202445650001402457650001202471650000902483651001202492653000802504653001302512653001402525653001502539653001602554653001802570700002702588700002602615700002302641773008002664856008002744852000902824655001202833IND60711267920221119152728.0200920s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071126792DNAL7 a10.1163/156854109X4295472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanzaki, Natsumi10aPoikilolaimus floridensis n. sp. (Rhabditida: Rhabditidae) associated with termites (Kalotermitidae)  ap. 203-216.  aNAL-light  aA survey of termite-associated nematodes was done in southern Florida to compare the diversity of such associations with other latitudes in the Neotropics. Six species (15 colonies) of termites (Isoptera) were collected from the field and eight species (15 colonies) from laboratory populations were examined for nematode associates. All six field-collected termite species, Cryptotermes cavifrons, Incisitermes snyderi, Neotermes jouteli, N. castaneus, Prorhinotermes simplex and Reticulitermes flavipes, representing two families (Kalotermitidae and, for the latter two species, Rhinotermitidae), were associated with nematodes. Nematodes were also isolated from laboratory populations of I. snyderi and Coptotermes formosanus. In total, seven putative species of nematodes were discerned using molecular bar-coding and culturing (when successful) including four rhabditids, one diplogastrid, Rhabditis rainai and a nematode that we are describing herein as Poikilolaimus floridensis n. sp. This nematode was isolated as dauer juveniles in the foregut of N. jouteli, N. castaneus and I. snyderi. It was recovered from workers, a soldier and an alate, suggesting internal phoresy. It is characterised by six triangular cuticular flaps covering the stomatal opening, simple tube-like stomatal structure, i.e., absence of teeth and glottoid apparatus, cuticularised and refractile secretory-excretory pore, conical male tail lacking 'bursa' or spike, short and conical female tail and didelphic female reproductive system. Poikilolaimus floridensis n. sp. is morphologically characteristic and does not easily fit the current genus definition of Poikilolaimus which is redefined herein. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on near full length SSU ribosomal DNA sequence showed that the new species occupies a basal position in the genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoptotermes formosanus 3aCryptotermes 3aIncisitermes 3aNeotermes 3aNeotropics 3aProrhinotermes 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3aRhabditis 3afemale reproductive system 3afemales 3aforegut 3amales 3anematology 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphoresy 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3atail 3aFlorida 0aSEM 0aTAXONOMY 0aMOLECULAR 0aMORPHOLOGY 0aDESCRIPTION 0aMORPHOMETRICS1 aGiblin-Davis, Robin M.1 aScheffrahn, Rudolf H.1 aCenter, Barbara J.0 tNematology.g, v. 11, no. 2 p.203-216dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854109X4295473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01212naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130245005600148300001300204520050300217592002800720650001800748651001800766773010700784856008200891852000900973655001200982IND60620195120221119152434.0181106e196401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062019512DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764264007005032doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aNew Studies in Behavioral Science and Public Policy  ap. 8-15.  aThese items are selected and annotated by the ABS staff in a periodic search of new issues of 350 journals and reviews, including about 100 that are published outside the United States, and from announcements and review copies of books and fugitive materials recently published.

The major pathognomonic hallmarks of progeria cells are seen as nuclear deformations or blebs that are related to the redistribution of A- and B-type lamins within the nuclear lamina. However, the functional significance of these progeria-associated blebs remains unknown. We have carried out an analysis of the structural and functional consequences of progeria-associated nuclear blebs in dermal fibroblasts from a progeria patient carrying a rare point mutation p.S143F (C428T) in lamin A/C. These blebs form microdomains that are devoid of major structural components of the nuclear envelope (NE)/lamina including B-type lamins and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and are enriched in A-type lamins. Using laser capture microdissection and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, we show that, while these domains are devoid of centromeric heterochromatin and gene-poor regions of chromosomes, they are enriched in gene-rich chromosomal regions. The active form of RNA polymerase II is also greatly enriched in blebs as well as nascent RNA but the nuclear co-activator SKIP is significantly reduced in blebs compared to other transcription factors. Our results suggest that the p.S143F progeria mutation has a severe impact not only on the structure of the lamina but also on the organization of interphase chromatin domains and transcription. These structural defects are likely to contribute to gene expression changes reported in progeria and other types of laminopathies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3aheterochromatin 3ainterphase 3alaser capture microdissection 3anuclear lamina 3anuclear pore 3apatients 3apoint mutation 0ablebs 0achromatin organization 0alamins 0aprogeria 0atranscription1 aTaimen, Pekka1 aButin-Israeli, Veronika1 aShimi, Takeshi1 aLanger-Freitag, Sabine1 aMarkaki, Yolanda1 aGoldman, Anne E1 aWehnert, Manfred1 aGoldman, Robert D0 tNucleus.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 6, no. 1 p.66-76dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27386x1949-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2015.10042563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005200168300001400220520048900234592002800723650002400751650001200775650001300787650001400800650001900814650002300833650001200856650001100868773011000879856008300989852000901072655001201081IND60623889420221122120105.0181203e196704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388942DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677677810068022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Lawrence14aThe Histology of The Oral Mucosa of Macaca Irus  ap. 65-72.  aThe histology of the oral mucosa of Macaca irus was studied in nineteen monkeys.

While the insecticidal actions and acute toxicity of CPF are attributed to its oxon metabolite (CPO) which potently inhibits the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), there is significant evidence that CPF, CPO, and other organophosphates may affect a variety of neuronal targets and processes that are not directly related to AChE. Previously, in adult rat sciatic nerves ex vivo and postnatal neurons from rats in vitro we observed that CPF and CPO impaired the movements of vesicles and mitochondria in axons. Here, in embryonic neurons from rats in culture, we evaluated 24h exposures to CPF and CPO across picomolar to micromolar concentrations for effects on fast axonal transport of membrane bound organelles (MBOs) that contained the amyloid precursor protein (APP) tagged with the fluorescent marker, Dendra2 (APPDendra2). The most notable observations of this study were concentration-dependent decreases in the velocity and percentage of MBOs moving in the anterograde direction, an increase in the number of stationary MBOs, and an increased frequency of pauses associated with both CPF and CPO. These effects occurred at concentrations that did not significantly inhibit AChE activity, they were not blocked by cholinergic receptor antagonists, and they were not associated with compromised cell viability. These effects of CPF and CPO may be significant given the importance of axonal transport to neuronal development as well the function of fully developed neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPesticide 0aOrganophosphate 0aAxonal transport 0aAmyloid precursor protein 0aNeurodevelopment 0aGulf war illness1 aNaughton, Sean X.1 aBeck, Wayne D.1 aHernandez, Caterina M.1 aWu, Guangyu1 aWei, Zhe1 aYang, Xiangkun1 aBartlett, Michael G.1 aTerry, Alvin V.0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.111-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245015300188300001400341520097700355592002801332650001601360650001201376650001301388650001401401650001401415650002501429650002701454650001201481650001001493650002501503650001501528650001101543650002501554650002201579650001301601650002401614650001401638650002301652650002301675700002701698700002801725700002401753700002101777773008101798856008201879852000901961655001201970IND60098912020221117212500.0141105e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009891202DNAL7 a216401732pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Maola M.G.10aMaximum likelihood analysis of mammalian p53 indicates the presence of positively selected sites and higher tumorigenic mutations in purifying sites  ap. 29-35.  aThe tumor suppressor gene TP53 (p53) maintains genome stability. Mutation or loss of p53 is found in most cancers. Analysis of evolutionary constrains and p53 mutations reveal important sites for concomitant functional studies. In this study, phylogenetic analyses of the coding sequences of p53 from 26 mammals were carried out by applying a maximum likelihood method. The results display two branches under adaptive evolution in mammals. Moreover, each codon of p53 was analyzed by the PAML method for presence of positively selected sites. PAML identified several statistically significant amino acids that undergo positive selection. The data indicates that amino acids responsible for the core functions of p53 are highly conserved, while positively selected sites are predominantly located in the N- and C-terminus of p53. Further analysis of evolutionary pressure and mutations showed the occurrence of more frequent tumorigenic mutations in purifying sites of p53.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3amammals 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aphylogeny 3aprobability analysis 3atumor suppressor genes 2aAnimals 2aCodon 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, p53 2aHumans 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMammalsxgenetics 2aMutation 2aNeoplasmsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment1 aRydén, Anna-Margareta1 aChowdhury, M.

Assembly of a nuclear pore complex requires the organization of many soluble sub-complexes into a final massive structure embedded in the nuclear envelope. By use of a LacI/LacO reporter system, we were able to assess nucleoporin (Nup) interactions, show that they occur with a high level of specificity, and identify nucleoporins sufficient for initiation of the complex process of NPC assembly in vivo. Eleven nucleoporins from different sub-complexes were fused to LacI-CFP and transfected separately into a human cell line containing a stably integrated LacO DNA array. The LacI-Nup fusion proteins, which bound to the array, were examined for their ability to recruit endogenous nucleoporins to the intranuclear LacO site. Many could recruit nucleoporins of the same sub-complex and a number could also recruit other sub-complexes. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Furthermore, Nup133 and Nup153 efficiently targeted the LacO array to the nuclear periphery. Our data support a hierarchical, seeded assembly pathway and identify Nup133 and Nup153 as effective “seeds” for NPC assembly. In addition, we show that this system can be applied to functional studies of individual nucleoporin domains as well as to specific nucleoporin disease mutations. We find that the R391H cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death mutation of Nup155 prevents both its subcomplex assembly and nuclear rim targeting of the LacO array.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aarrhythmia 3achromatin 3adeath 3ahuman cell lines 3amutation 3anuclear pore 3anucleoporins 0acardiac arrhythmia 0aELYS 0aLacO array 0aLacI 0anuclear pore assembly 0anuclear rim localization 0aNup133 0aNup153 0aNup160/107 complex 0aNup155 R391H1 aTravesa, Anna1 aMartell, Steven W1 aForbes, Douglass J0 tNucleus.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 6, no. 1 p.40-54dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27386x1949-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2015.10042603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013000176506011700306506007600423520136300499592002801862506003701890650002201927650001501949650001101964650002401975650001501999650001302014650001802027650001902045650002202064653002102086653001902107653001702126653001802143700001502161773009302176856008602269852000902355655001202364IND60770325920221207143400.0220830e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077032592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Amariz, A.10aEffect of adding ZrM (M=Fe, Ni) intermetallic compounds on the hydrogen absorption/desorption properties of TiCr1.1V0.9 alloy  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this paper, the effect of intermetallic compounds Zr₂Fe and Zr₇Ni₁₀ on the microstructure and first hydrogenation kinetic of TiCr₁.₁V₀.₉ alloy is reported. Samples were synthesized by arc melting separately and then 5% of each intermetallic was co-melt with TiCr₁.₁V₀.₉ alloy. First hydrogenation of all alloys was performed at room temperature under 2.0 MPa of hydrogen. Kinetics and absorption capacities were measured at room temperature, by using apparatus type sieverts. Results indicate that the addition of the intermetallic has an enhancing effect on the kinetic reaction without further modification of hydrogen storage capacities, going from 3.6 wt.% for as-cast alloy, to 3.61 wt.% for alloys +5 wt.% intermetallic. On the other hand, the structure and microstructural analysis were carried out by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. These results show conservation of the structure in the body-centered cubic, and two additional minor phase formations: C14 laves phase for both alloys, and an additional Ti₂Ni phase for the TiCr₁.₁V₀.₉ + 5% Zr₇Ni₁₀ alloy. Finally, the thermal stabilization of the sample was determined by using differential scanning calorimetry. The results show two types of hydrides that form trapped in different clamping sites with different energies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3adesorption 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amicrostructure 3athermal stability 0aHydrogen storage 0aMetal hydrides 0aTiCrV system 0aIntermetallic1 aBellon, D.0 tHeliyon.g2022 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.e09042-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04436naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245016100176300001600337520281400353592002803167650001103195650001203206650001103218650000903229650001203238650001903250650001403269650002103283650001403304650001703318650001503335650001503350651001103365651001003376651001603386653002003402653001903422653001503441653001603456653002103472653003003493653001103523700003303534700001803567700002303585700002103608700002003629700002103649773011903670856008403789852000903873655001203882IND60544923020221116191121.0160901e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054492302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestermann, Stéphane10aPaleoenvironmental changes during the Valanginian: New insights from variations in phosphorus contents and bulk- and clay mineralogies in the western Tethys  ap. 196-208.  aPaleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes during the Valanginian carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) have been investigated in the western Tethys. For this purpose, bulk-rock and clay mineralogies, as well as phosphorus (P) contents were evaluated in a selection of five sections located in the Vocontian Basin (Angles, SE France; Alvier, E Switzerland; Malleval, E France), and the Lombardian Basin (Capriolo, N Italy; Breggia, S Switzerland).Within the CIE interval, bulk-rock and clay mineralogies are inferred to reflect mostly climate change. The onset of the CIE (Busnardoites campylotoxus ammonite Zone) is characterized by higher detrital index (DI: sum of the detrital minerals divided by calcite contents) values and the presence of kaolinite in their clay-mineral assemblages. In the late Valanginian (from the Saynoceras verrucosum Zone up to the end of the Valanginian), the samples show relatively variable DI and lower values or the absence of kaolinite. The variation in the mineralogical composition is interpreted as reflecting a change from a climate characterized by optimal weathering conditions associated with an increase in terrigenous input on the southern European margin during the CIE towards an overall unstable climate associated with drier conditions in the late Valanginian. This is contrasted by a dissymmetry (proximal vs distal) along the studied transect, the northern Tethyan margin being more sensitive to changes in continental input compared to the distal environments.P accumulation rates (PAR) present similar features. In the Vocontian basin, P content variations are associated with changes in terrigenous influx, whereas in the Lombardian basin (i.e. Capriolo and Breggia), PAR values are less well correlated. This is mainly because the deeper part of the Tethys was less sensitive to changes in continental inputs. The onset of the CIE (top of the B. campylotoxus Zone) records a general increase in PAR suggesting an increase in marine nutrient levels. This is linked to higher continental weathering rates and the enhanced influx of nutrients into the ocean. In the period corresponding to the shift itself, P contents show a dissymmetry between the Vocontian and Lombardian basins (proximal vs distal). For the sections of Malleval, Alvier and Angles, a decrease in P concentrations associated to a decrease in detrital input is observed. In Capriolo and Breggia, PAR show maximum values during the plateau, indicating a more complex interaction between different P sources. The time interval including the top of S. verrucosum Zone up to the end of the Valanginian is characterized by variable PAR values, suggesting variable nutrient influxes. These changes are in agreement with an evolution towards seasonally contrasted conditions in the late Valanginian.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acalcite 3acarbon 3aclay 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3akaolinite 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apaleoecology 3aphosphorus 3aweathering 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland 0aClay mineralogy 0aDetrital index 0aPhosphorus 0aValanginian 0aClimatic changes 0aCarbon cycle perturbation 0aTethys1 aDuchamp-Alphonse, Stéphanie1 aFiet, Nicolas1 aFleitmann, Dominik1 aMatera, Virginie1 aAdatte, Thierry1 aFöllmi, Karl B.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 392 p.196-208dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245016800170520194700338592002802285650001902313650001502332650004302347650001502390650001602405650002102421650002202442650001502464650002102479650002002500650002202520650002202542650001302564650001302577650003402590650001002624650001102634650001802645650001702663650001502680650001402695650001502709650001602724650001402740650002402754650002502778651001102803700002202814700001902836700002602855700002002881700001802901773012002919856007903039852000903118655001203127IND60707861220221121065744.0200821e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070786122DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110804782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAudusseau, Hélène 10aEcology and Genetic Structure of the Parasitoid Phobocampe confusa (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) in Relation to Its Hosts, Aglais Species (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)  aThe biology of parasitoids in natural ecosystems remains very poorly studied, though they are key species for their functioning. Here we focused on Phobocampe confusa, a Nymphalini specialist, responsible for high mortality rates in charismatic butterfly species in Europe (genus Aglais). We studied its ecology and genetic structure in connection with those of its host butterflies in Sweden. To this aim, we gathered data from 428 P. confusa individuals reared from 6094 butterfly larvae (of A. urticae, A. io, and in two occasions of Araschnia levana) collected over two years (2017 and 2018) and across 19 sites distributed along a 500 km latitudinal gradient. We found that P. confusa is widely distributed along the latitudinal gradient. Its distribution seems constrained over time by the phenology of its hosts. The large variation in climatic conditions between sampling years explains the decrease in phenological overlap between P. confusa and its hosts in 2018 and the 33.5% decrease in the number of butterfly larvae infected. At least in this study, P. confusa seems to favour A. urticae as host. While it parasitized nests of A. urticae and A. io equally, the proportion of larvae parasitized is significantly higher for A. urticae. At the landscape scale, P. confusa is almost exclusively found in vegetated open land and near deciduous forests, whereas artificial habitats are negatively correlated with the likelihood of a nest to be parasitized. The genetic analyses on 89 adult P. confusa and 87 adult A. urticae using CO1 and AFLP markers reveal a low genetic diversity in P. confusa and a lack of genetic structure in both species, at the scale of our sampling. Further genetic studies using high-resolution genomics tools will be required to better understand the population genetic structure of P. confusa, its biotic interactions with its hosts, and ultimately the stability and the functioning of natural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAglais urticae 3aPhobocampe 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abiocenosis 3abutterflies 3aclimatic factors 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystems 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic markers 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahabitats 3ahost-parasitoid relationships 3ahosts 3aimagos 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect nests 3alandscapes 3amortality 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aphenology 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3aSweden1 aBaudrin, Gaspard 1 aShaw, Mark  R.1 aKeehnen, Naomi  L.

The knowledge on whether and how vanadium exposure caused neurobehavioral changes remains incomplete. This study was designed to investigate the changes in learning and memory following drinking water exposure to vanadium, and to conduct the preliminary study on underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to vanadium dissolved in drinking water at the concentration of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0g/L, as the control, low-, medium-, and high- dose groups, respectively, for 12 weeks. The results by the Morris water maze test showed that the time for the testing animal to find the platform in the high exposed group was increased by 82.9% and 49.7%, as compared to animals in control and low-dose groups (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer rats in the medium- and high- dose groups than in the control group who were capable of crossing the platform (p<0.05). Quantitation of vanadium by atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed a significant dose-dependent accumulation of vanadium in striatum (r=0.931, p<0.01). Histopathological examination further demonstrated a degenerative damage in vanadium-exposed striatum. Interestingly, with the increase of the dose of vanadium, the contents of neurotransmitter ACh, 5-HT and GABA in the striatum increased; however, the levels of Syn1 was significantly reduced in the exposed groups compared with controls (p<0.05). These data suggest that vanadium exposure apparently reduces the animals’ learning ability. This could be due partly to vanadium’s accumulation in striatum and the ensuing toxicity to striatal structure and synaptic plasticity. Further research is warranted for mechanistic understanding of vanadium-induced neurotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aV 0aSyn1 0aAAS 0aVanadium 0aStriatum 0aLearning and memory 0aNeurotransmitter 0aSynapsin-11 aWang, Keyue1 aLi, Yan1 aFan, Qiyuan1 aZheng, Wei1 aLi, Hong0 tNeurotoxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 62 p.124-129dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:19553x0161-813X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2017.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009200166300001000258520123300268592002801501650002101529650002701550650001601577650001201593650001201605650002501617650002101642650001401663650001801677650001501695650001101710700001901721700001201740700001601752700001601768700001701784773014601801856008201947852000902029655001202038IND60616505320221118082444.0200323e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061650532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-019-1085-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Guangrong10aEffect of chemical dose on phosphorus removal and membrane fouling control in a UCT-MBR  ap. 1.  aTo enhance phosphorus removal and make the effluent meet the strict discharge level of total phosphorus (TP, 0.5 mg/L), flocculant dosing is frequently applied. In this study, the performance of aluminum sulfate dosing in a University of Cape Town Membrane Bioreactor (UCT-MBR) was investigated, in terms of the nutrients removal performance, sludge characteristics and membrane fouling. The results indicated that the addition of aluminum sulfate into the aerobic reactor continuously had significantly enhanced phosphorus removal. Moreover, COD, NH₄⁺₋N and TN removal were not affected and effluent all met the first level A criteria of GB18918-2002. In addition, the addition of aluminum sulfate had improved the sludge activity slightly and reduced transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase rate from 1.13 KPa/d to 0.57 KPa/d effectively. The alleviation of membrane fouling was attributed to the increased average particle sizes and the decreased accumulation of the small sludge particles on membrane surface. Furthermore, the decline of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) concentration in mixed sludge liquid decreased its accumulation on membrane surface, resulting in the mitigation of membrane fouling directly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum sulfate 3achemical oxygen demand 3aflocculants 3afouling 3aliquids 3amembrane bioreactors 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3asludge1 aZhang, Chuanyi1 aLi, Wei1 aYuan, Limei1 aHe, Shilong1 aWang, Liping0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.1-1dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-019-1085-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245006800199300001600267500001900283520109100302592002801393650000801421650002601429650001101455650001001466650001201476650000901488650002401497650002801521650001701549650001301566650001301579653001101592653002301603700001101626700001501637700001301652773013501665856008101800852000901881655001201890IND60650515520221118230306.0190710e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065051552DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596180006062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1345-740010aAssessment of milk quality based on bovine BAF60c gene mutation  ap. 570-574.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonitoring milk quality traits and the classification of raw milk are important steps for generating high-quality dairy products. Given the important roles of the BRG1/BRM-associated factor 60c (BAF60c) gene in the regulation of physiological growth and production, the objective of the current study was to analyse the association between the BAF60c gene and milk quality and establish a gene-based method for pre-evaluating raw milk quality. For this purpose, DNA was isolated from 507 milk samples and genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism method. Milk quality traits including milk protein percentage (MPP), milk fat percentage (MFP), lactose percentage (LP) and total solids content (TSC) were also evaluated from the same 507 milk samples. The newly found 6060 T > C mutation of the BAF60c gene was associated significantly with MPP and LP, but not with MFP and TSC. The results demonstrated that this mutation could be used for the pre-evaluation of MPP and LP; therefore, raw milk could be graded according to different genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagricultural sciences 3acattle 3agenes 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk quality 3amutation 3araw milk 0aBAF60c 0abovine genomic DNA1 aKu, T.1 aLiu, Y.

The aim of the current study was to isolate the bacteria, and then identify and assess the degree of genomic diversity. The molecular identification of microsymbionts isolated from the endosphere (root and stem) of plants grown in agricultural soils was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To evaluate the genomic diversity between strains that occurred in multiple host plants, 18 bacterial isolates representing four species were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The 16S rDNA analysis assigned all bacterial isolates to ten genera, from which Rhizobium was represented by 19 isolates, Delftia by 11, Agrobacterium by five, Stenotrophomonas by three, Brevundimonas by two and Novosphingobium, Variovorax, Collimonas, Achromobacter and Comamonas by only one isolate. Furthermore, the genomic diversity of the 11 isolates of Delftia sp. was assessed using the BOX – polymerase chain reaction (BOX-PCR) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus – PCR (ERIC-PCR) methods. Typing patterns and analysis using BOX-PCR and ERIC-PCR data demonstrated similarities among the tested isolates. In general, the results obtained with BOX-PCR and ERIC-PCR were in good agreement. However, a greater degree of differentiation patterns of the genomic DNA was obtained in the ERIC-PCR method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aAgrobacterium 3aArctium lappa 3aBrevundimonas 3aComamonas 3aDelftia 3aRhizobium 3aSphingomonas 3aStenotrophomonas 3aVariovorax 3aagricultural sciences 3acorn 3aendophytes 3afaba beans 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amicrosymbionts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arepetitive sequences 3arye 3awheat 0a16S rRNA gene 0abiodiversity 0aPCR1 aGałązka, A.1 aGrządziel, J.1 aGłodowska, M.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2018 May, v. 156, no. 4 p.547-556dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46135x1469-51467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596180006183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245014200172300001400314520143300328592002801761650001701789650002401806650001801830650002201848650001701870650001901887650001001906650001501916650001901931650002101950650001701971650001301988650001402001650001302015650004102028653001702069653001602086653001002102653001202112653002202124700001602146700001602162700002102178700001502199700001302214700001202227700001702239700002502256700001302281700001602294700001802310700001402328700001802342700001702360700001502377700001602392700001702408700002002425700001502445700001402460773009102474856009102565852000902656655001202665IND60581485020221123033242.0200523e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058148502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chao10aTumor cell-targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 by aptamer-functionalized lipopolymer for therapeutic genome editing of VEGFA in osteosarcoma  ap. 68-85.  aOsteosarcoma (OS) is a highly aggressive pediatric cancer, characterized by frequent lung metastasis and pathologic bone destruction. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), highly expressed in OS, not only contributes to angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment via paracrine stimulation of vascular endothelial cells, but also acts as an autocrine survival factor for tumor cell themselves, thus making it a promising therapeutic target for OS. CRISPR/Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology and holds tremendous promise for cancer treatment. However, a major bottleneck to achieve the therapeutic potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 is the lack of in vivo tumor-targeted delivery systems. Here, we screened an OS cell-specific aptamer (LC09) and developed a LC09-functionalized PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC) lipopolymer encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids encoding VEGFA gRNA and Cas9. Our results demonstrated that LC09 facilitated selective distribution of CRISPR/Cas9 in both orthotopic OS and lung metastasis, leading to effective VEGFA genome editing in tumor, decreased VEGFA expression and secretion, inhibited orthotopic OS malignancy and lung metastasis, as well as reduced angiogenesis and bone lesion with no detectable toxicity. The delivery system simultaneously restrained autocrine and paracrine VEGFA signaling in tumor cells and could facilitate translating CRISPR-Cas9 into clinical cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aautocrine signaling 3aencapsulation 3aendothelial cells 3agene editing 3agene targeting 3alungs 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligonucleotides 3aosteosarcoma 3aplasmids 3asecretion 3atoxicity 3avascular endothelial growth factor A 0aOsteosarcoma 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aVEGFA 0aAptamer 0aIn vivo delivery1 aLi, Fangfei1 aWang, Luyao1 aZhang, Zong-Kang1 aWang, Chao1 aHe, Bing1 aLi, Jie1 aChen, Zhihao1 aShaikh, Atik Badshah1 aLiu, Jin1 aWu, Xiaohao1 aPeng, Songlin1 aDang, Lei1 aGuo, Baosheng1 aHe, Xiaojuan1 aAu, D.W.T.1 aLü, Cheng,1 aZhu, Hailong1 aZhang, Bao-Ting1 aLu, Aiping1 aZhang, Ge0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Dec., v. 147 p.68-85dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012800209506011700337506007600454520093100530592002801461506003701489650001301526650001801539650001001557653003401567653001301601653003001614653002601644653002001670700001601690700002501706700002201731700002101753700002401774700001701798700006101815773009301876856008601969852000902055655001202064IND60770326220221207143353.0220830e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077032622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoso, Mardi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0636-838610aSynthesis, α-glucosidase inhibition, α-amylase inhibition, and molecular docking studies of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe synthesized 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones 1a-p showed desired higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activities and lower α-amylase inhibitory activities than standard drug acarbose.

These species and flyways altogether represent terrestrial, brackish and marine ecosystems spanning from the Western to the Eastern and Northern part of the Baltic Sea. Plasma of these species was analysed for seroprevalence of specific avian influenza A (AI) antibodies to obtain information on circulating AI serotypes and exposure. Overall, antibody prevalence was 55% for the eiders and 47% for the pink-footed geese. Of AI-antibody seropositive birds, 12% (22/183) of the eiders and 3% (12/427) of the pink-footed geese had been exposed to AI of the potentially zoonotic serotypes H5 and/or H7 virus. AI seropositive samples selected at random (n = 33) showed a low frequency of serotypes H1, H6 and H9. Future projects should aim at sampling and isolating AI virus to characterize dominant serotypes and virus strains (PCR). This will increase our understanding of how AI exposure may affect health, breeding and population viability of Baltic common eiders and pink-footed geese as well as the potential spill-over to humans (zoonotic potential).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser 3aSomateria mollissima 3aavian influenza 3ablood plasma 3aenvironment 3apopulation viability 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3aspring 3aviruses 3azoonoses 3aBaltic Sea 3aNorway 0aFitness 0aHealth 0aReproduction 0aWaterfowl1 aTjørnløv, Rune Skjold1 aTherkildsen, Ole Roland1 aChristensen, Thomas Kjær1 aMadsen, Jesper1 aDaugaard-Petersen, Tobias1 aOrtiz, Jose Maria Castaño1 aPeng, Wanxi1 aCharbonneaux, Maël1 aRivas, Esteban Iglesias1 aGarbus, Svend-Erik1 aLyngs, Peter1 aSiebert, Ursula1 aDietz, Rune1 aMaier-Sam, Kristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2954-49601 aLierz, Michael1 aTombre, Ingunn M.1 aAndersen-Ranberg, Emilie U.1 aSonne, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5723-52630 tEnvironment international.g2020 Sept., v. 142 p.105873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1058733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012300160300001800283520190700301592002802208650001502236650001502251650002802266650001202294650002802306650001902334650002102353650002202374650001902396650001802415650001102433650001302444650003202457650001102489650001302500650002102513700002302534700001802557700002502575700001802600773009902618856007502717852000902792655001202801IND60577216520221120171252.0170807e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057721652DNAL7 a10.1021/la50484972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabaei, Seyed R.10aSolvent-Assisted Lipid Self-Assembly at Hydrophilic Surfaces: Factors Influencing the Formation of Supported Membranes  ap. 3125-3134.  aAs a simple and efficient technique, the solvent-assisted lipid bilayer (SALB) formation method offers a versatile approach to fabricating a planar lipid bilayer on solid supports. Corresponding mechanistic aspects and the role of various governing parameters remain, however, to be better understood. Herein, we first scrutinized the effect of lipid concentration (0.01 to 5 mg/mL) and solvent type (isopropanol, n-propanol, or ethanol) on SALB formation on silicon oxide in order to identify optimal conditions for this process. The obtained fluid-phase lipid layers on silicon oxide were investigated by using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, epifluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The experimental results indicate that, in alcohol, lipid attachment to the substrate is reversible and reaches equilibrium in accordance with the bulk lipid concentration. During the solvent-exchange step, the water fraction increases and the deposited lipids are converted into planar bilayer fragments, along with the concurrent adsorption and rupture of micelles within an optimal lipid concentration range. In addition, fluid-phase lipid bilayers were successfully formed on other substrates (e.g., chrome, indium tin oxide, and titanium oxide) that are largely intractable to conventional methods (e.g., vesicle fusion). Moreover, gel-phase lipid bilayers were fabricated as well. Depending on the phase state of the lipid bilayer during fabrication, the corresponding adlayer mass varied by approximately 20% between the fluid- and gel-phase states in a manner which is consistent with the molecular packing of lipids in the two arrangements. Taken together, our findings help to explain the mechanistic details of SALB formation, optimize the corresponding procedure, and demonstrate the general utility for fabricating gel- and fluid-phase planar lipid bilayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3aethanol 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3aindium tin oxide 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alipid bilayers 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicelles 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asilica 3asolvents 3atitanium dioxide1 aJackman, Joshua A.1 aKim, Seong-Oh1 aZhdanov, Vladimir P.1 aCho, Nam-Joon0 tLangmuir.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 31, no. 10 p.3125-3134dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla50484973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245009100200300001800291506007600309520182500385592002802210506003702238650003202275650002002307650002002327650001902347650001102366650002302377650003302400650001402433650001602447650002702463700001802490700001802508700002002526700002102546700002402567773013102591856007502722852000902797655001202806IND60540951020221207115126.0160820e20140226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054095102DNAL7 a10.1021/ja41298392doi7 aPMC39859122pmcid7 a244946702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohner, Niklaus10aProtein and Lipid Interactions Driving Molecular Mechanisms of in meso Crystallization  ap. 3271-3284.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent advances in the in meso crystallization technique for the structural characterization of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) proteins have established the usefulness of the lipidic-cubic phases (LCPs) in the field of crystallography of membrane proteins. It is surprising that despite the success of the approach, the molecular mechanisms of the in meso method are still not well understood. Therefore, the approach must rely on extensive screening for a suitable protein construct, for host and additive lipids, and for the appropriate precipitants and temperature. To shed light on the in meso crystallization mechanisms, we used extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study, in molecular detail, LCPs under different conditions (compositions and temperatures relevant to crystallogenesis) and their interactions with different types of GPCR constructs. The results presented show how the modulation of the lattice constant of the LCP (triggered by the addition of precipitant during the in meso assay), or of the host lipid type, can destabilize monomeric proteins in the bilayer of the LCP and thus drive their aggregation into the stacked lamellae, where the residual hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and the membrane can drive the formation of lateral contacts leading to nucleation and crystal growth. Moreover, we demonstrate how particular protein designs (such as transmembrane proteins engineered to contain large polar regions) can promote protein stacking interactions in the third, out-of-plane, dimension.

The two recycling processes included accelerated thermal and photochemical aging steps to simulate the degradation experienced by post-consumer plastics during their service life. One of them also included a demanding washing process prior to the reprocessing. A decrease in the molecular weight of PLA was observed in the recycled materials, especially in those subjected to the washing step, which explained the small decrease in microhardness and the increased water uptake at long immersion times. Water absorption at short immersion times was similar in virgin and recycled materials and was accurately described using a Fickian model. The recycled materials showed increased thermal, optical and gas barrier properties due to the improved clay dispersion that was observed by XRD and TEM analysis. The results suggest that recycled PLA-clay nanocomposites can be used in demanding applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aclay 3adurability 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3ananocomposites 3apackaging 3aphotochemistry 3aplastics 3apolylactic acid 3arecycled materials 3arecycling 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awashing 3awastes 3awater uptake1 aOrtega, E.1 aSolvoll, A.M.1 aLorenzo, V.1 ade la Orden, M.U.1 aMartínez Urreaga, J.0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2018 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.2142-2152dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-017-1117-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015000170300001600320520101600336592002801352650002301380650001301403650001901416650001201435650001601447650002401463650004401487650001301531650001301544650002601557650001801583650002201601650001501623653001601638653002001654653001601674653002201690653002201712700002401734700002501758700002601783700002201809700002301831773010601854856008701960852000902047655001202056IND60566528520221119184700.0190409e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Carlos10aSimultaneous partial nitrification and 2-fluorophenol biodegradation with aerobic granular biomass: Reactor performance and microbial communities  ap. 232-240.  aAn aerobic granular bioreactor was operated for over 4months, treating a synthetic wastewater with a high ammonium content (100mgNL−1). The inoculum was collected from a bioreactor performing simultaneous partial nitrification and aromatic compounds biodegradation. From day-56 onwards, 2-fluorophenol (2-FP) (12.4mgL−1) was added to the feeding wastewater and the system was bioaugmented with a 2-FP degrading bacteria (Rhodococcus sp. FP1). By the end of operation, complete 2-FP biodegradation and partial nitrification were simultaneously achieved. Aerobic granules remained stable over time. During the 2-FP loading, a shift in the community structure occurred, coinciding with the improvement of 2-FP degradation. DGGE analysis did not allow to infer on the bioaugmented strain presence but pyrosequencing analysis detected Rhodococcus genus by the end of operation. Together with other potential phenolic-degraders within granules, these microorganisms were probably responsible for 2-FP degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agranules 3ainoculum 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3asequence analysis 3awastewater 0aGranulation 0aBioaugmentation 0aNitritation 0aPhenolic compound 0aMolecular biology1 aAmorim, Catarina L.1 aMesquita, Daniela P.1 aFerreira, Eugénio C.1 aCarrera, Julián,1 aCastro, Paula M.L.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Aug., v. 238 p.232-240dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245009600168300001400264520208200278592002802360650001902388650001902407650001702426650001302443650001902456650001302475650002102488650001902509650001502528650001602543650001802559700001802577700002202595700001902617773009802636856008402734852000902818655001202827IND4475459520221122071651.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447545952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2011.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuntiñas, M.E.10aEffects of moisture and temperature on net soil nitrogen mineralization: A laboratory study  ap. 73-80.  aClimate change will lead to changes in soil moisture and temperature, thereby affecting organic matter mineralization and the cycling of biophilic elements such as nitrogen. However, very few studies have considered how the sensitivity of the rate of net nitrogen mineralization to temperature and/or moisture content may be modified by changes in these parameters. To investigate how changes in temperature and moisture content affect net nitrogen mineralization (as regards both the mineralization rate and the sensitivity of the mineralization rate to changes in temperature and moisture content), a laboratory experiment was carried out in which three soils under different types of use (Forest, Grassland, Cropland) were incubated for 42 days under different moisture conditions (between 40 and 100% field capacity) and temperatures (between 10 and 35 °C); total inorganic nitrogen levels were determined at different times throughout the experiment. The rate of mineralization was determined at each temperature and moisture level considered, by use of the mono-compartmental model developed by Stanford and Smith (1972). For all soils, changes in the rate of mineralization with temperature followed the pattern described by the Q₁₀ model, while the models used to determine the effect of moisture content on the net rate of mineralization (linear, semilogarithmic, partial parabolic and complete parabolic) were only verified for the Forest soil. In general, the sensitivity to temperature was maximal at 25 °C, and the optimal moisture content for nitrogen mineralization was between 80% and 100% of field capacity. A relatively simple model that included the temperature–moisture–time interaction was also tested. This model provided a significant fit for the three soils under study, in contrast with the other models tested. In any case, further studies are necessary in order to address the extent to which changes in the quality of organic matter, caused by land use, affect any modifications to soil nitrogen that may be generated by climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3afield capacity 3aforest soils 3aland use 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater content1 aLeirós, M.C.1 aTrasar-Cepeda, C.1 aGil-Sotres, F.0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2012 , v. 48 p.73-80dElsevier Masson SASx1164-55637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2011.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014200162300001800304520054600322592002800868650001600896650002000912650001800932650001600950650001100966700002100977773013100998856007501129852000901204655001201213IND60540951120221118041411.0160820e20140226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054095112DNAL7 a10.1021/ja412996f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbofana, Curren

It relies on expert knowledge to classify the desired classes from the imagery at hand. The definition of classes is subjective, usually project-specific and not shared with the community. Ontologies as a form of knowledge representation technique are acknowledged as solution to establish and document class definitions independently of an OBIA framework. However, ontologies have not yet been strongly integrated in this image analysis framework. This paper presents a method to automatically integrate ontologies in OBIA. The method has been implemented as a tool to be used with the eCognition® software (Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A case study was conducted for classifying the land cover classes defined by the Environment Agency of Austria in the Land Information System Austria (LISA) project using WorldView-2 image. The strength of this approach is the direct integration of ontologies into the OBIA process, which reduces the effort necessary to define the classes for image analysis and simultaneously reduces its subjectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aexpert opinion 3aimage analysis 3ainformation systems 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3aAustria1 aHofer, Barbara1 aHofmann, Peter0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 June 3, v. 5, no. 6 p.530-538dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.9305633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245010800199500001900307520193300326592002802259650001402287650001102301650001402312650001302326650001302339650001802352650002302370651001002393653002802403653003502431653001302466653002202479653001702501700005402518700001902572700001502591700001602606700001702622700001102639773012302650856008202773852000902855655001202864IND60738555120221120031219.0210619e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073855512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1081792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9782-167810aOptimum planting date and cultivar maturity to optimize potato yield and yield stability in North China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPotato (Solanum tuberosom L.) is one of most important food crops in North China. Optimizing potato planting date and cultivar maturity is of great importance for increasing yield and reducing yield variability in North China. The APSIM-Potato model was calibrated and validated with field experimental data from a 2-year х 3-planting dates х 3-cultivars study, and used to determine the optimal combinations of planting date and cultivar maturity for rainfed potato production in North China. APSIM-Potato performed well in simulating phenology (mean RMSE = 3.6 days), soil water content in the 0–100 cm soil profile (mean RRMSE = 23.5 %), total dry matter (mean RRMSE = 26 %), and fresh potato yield (mean RRMSE = 22.5 %) under different combinations of planting date and cultivar maturity. Simulated rainfed fresh potato yield in North China was 16,407 ± 6432 kg ha⁻¹. Late planting coupled with middle- to late-maturing cultivars could increase rainfed potato yield in North China. To achieve high yield and yield stability, later planting coupled with early-maturing cultivars is recommended along a ‘N-S’ transect, while a later planting coupled with late-maturing cultivars should be selected along a ‘W-E’ transect. Growth period and growing season precipitation explained 90 % and 85 %, respectively, of the variation in high-stable index of potato yield. Within the potential planting window, the onset of the optimal planting window was negatively correlated with March-May precipitation (R² = 0.82, P < 0.05), and corresponding optimal potato cultivars could be determined based on the onset of the optimal planting window and mean growing season thermal time (R² = 0.92, P < 0.01). Study results determined a simple but feasible rule for farmers to use in selecting the optimal combination of planting date and cultivar maturity to increase rainfed potato yield and yield stability in North China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3amodels 3aphenology 3apotatoes 3aresearch 3asoil profiles 3asoil water content 3aChina 0aPrecipitation variation 0aEarly- and late-planting dates 0aCultivar 0aHigh-stable index 0aAPSIM-Potato1 aWang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7960-03961 aTang, Jianzhao1 aWang, Enli1 aPan, Zhihua1 aPan, Xuebiao1 aHu, Qi0 tField crops research.g2021 July 15, v. 269 p.108179-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1081793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171300001600268520109300284592002801377650001101405650002201416650001701438650001801455650001101473650001501484650001201499650005001511650001901561650001101580650001101591650001201602650001101614651001201625700001701637700001801654773009901672856008401771852000901855655001201864IND60123177820221122171238.0150325e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317782DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.9332752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Jacqueline10aWhiting events in SW Florida coastal waters: a case study using MODIS medium-resolution data  ap. 539-547.  aWhitings, floating patches of calcium carbonate mud, have been found in both shallow carbonate banks and freshwater environments around the world. Although these events have been studied for many decades, much of their characteristics remain unknown. Recent sightings of whitings near Ten Thousand Islands, Florida suggest a phenomenon that has not previously been documented in this area. Using medium-resolution (250-m) data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from December 2010 to November 2013, we documented whiting events and their spatial and temporal patterns in this region. Classification rules were first established, and then applied to all 474 cloud-free and sun glint-free MODIS images. Whiting occurrences were found between 25°46′N and 25°20′N and less than 40 km from the southwest Florida coastline. Over the 3-year period, whiting occurrence peaked in spring and autumn and reached a minimum during the winter and summer months. Further field and laboratory research are needed to explain driving force(s) behind these events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acalcium carbonate 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3afreshwater 3aislands 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3asummer 3awhiting 3awinter 3aFlorida1 aHu, Chuanmin1 aRobbins, Lisa0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 June 3, v. 5, no. 6 p.539-547dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.9332753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011300164300001800277520201900295592002802314650001502342650002402357650002202381650001202403650002202415650001802437650001602455650001102471650001402482650001102496650002402507650000902531650001702540650001702557650001102574650001902585650002302604650002002627700002002647700001702667700001902684700002002703773009902723856007502822852000902897655001202906IND60577216820221120181554.0170807e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057721682DNAL7 a10.1021/la50496122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, Paul D. I.10aModel Study of Enhanced Oil Recovery by Flooding with Aqueous Surfactant Solution and Comparison with Theory  ap. 3076-3085.  aWith the aim of elucidating the details of enhanced oil recovery by surfactant solution flooding, we have determined the detailed behavior of model systems consisting of a packed column of calcium carbonate particles as the porous rock, n-decane as the trapped oil, and aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT). The AOT concentration was varied from zero to above the critical aggregation concentration (cac). The salt content of the aqueous solutions was varied to give systems of widely different, post-cac oil–water interfacial tensions. The systems were characterized in detail by measuring the permeability behavior of the packed columns, the adsorption isotherms of AOT from the water to the oil–water interface and to the water–calcium carbonate interface, and oil–water–calcium carbonate contact angles. Measurements of the percent oil recovery by pumping surfactant solutions into calcium carbonate-packed columns initially filled with oil were analyzed in terms of the characterization results. We show that the measured contact angles as a function of AOT concentration are in reasonable agreement with those calculated from values of the surface energy of the calcium carbonate–air surface plus the measured adsorption isotherms. Surfactant adsorption onto the calcium carbonate–water interface causes depletion of its aqueous-phase concentration, and we derive equations which enable the concentration of nonadsorbed surfactant within the packed column to be estimated from measured parameters. The percent oil recovery as a function of the surfactant concentration is determined solely by the oil–water–calcium carbonate contact angle for nonadsorbed surfactant concentrations less than the cac. For surfactant concentrations greater than the cac, additional oil removal occurs by a combination of solubilization and emulsification plus oil mobilization due to the low oil–water interfacial tension and a pumping pressure increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acontact angle 3aemulsifying 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3apermeability 3asalt content 3asodium 3asolubilization 3asorption isotherms 3asurface tension1 aSavory, Luke D.1 aWoods, Freya1 aClarke, Andrew1 aHowe, Andrew M.0 tLangmuir.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 31, no. 10 p.3076-3085dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla50496123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010700166300001600273520136800289592002801657650000801685650002401693650002701717650002601744650002201770650001001792650001101802650001901813650001401832650002301846653000901869653000801878653000901886653003001895653002701925653002601952653002001978700001601998700001802014773012102032856008202153852000902235655001202244IND60089811020221118141951.0160728e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008981102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yongwoon10aCrystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptional regulator PA2196 bound to its operator DNA  ap. 317-321.  aPseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic human pathogen. PA2196 from P. aeruginosa is a member of TetR family of transcriptional repressors, which is involved in adaptation to environmental changes as well as bacterial antibiotic resistance. PA2196 consists of nine α-helical bundles divided into two separate domains. The N-terminal domain, called the DNA-binding domain, is composed of helices α1–α3 and has a helix-turn-helix motif. The C-terminal domain, called the ligand-binding domain, has a hydrophobic pocket for ligand binding. Here, PA2196 was shown to bind to a 25bp semi-palindromic dsDNA located in the upstream region of its own gene. The crystal structure of the PA2196–25mer dsDNA complex determined at a resolution of 2.9Å revealed that two dimers of PA2196 bound to one dsDNA, with each monomer interacting with the major groove of DNA. Especially, residues in helix α3, including Lys41, Gly42, Ser43, and Tyr45, interacted mainly with the base and phosphate backbone of dsDNA. PA2196 underwent large conformational changes upon DNA binding, as the distances between DNA-binding domains measured between two G42s in subunits A and B decreased from 41.7Å to 36.8Å. Our crystal structure of PA2196–25mer dsDNA complex revealed that PA2196 is similar to QacR in that two dimers bound to one dsDNA through specific interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibiotic resistance 3acrystal structure 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3apathogens 3arepressor proteins 0aTetR 0aHTH 0aRMSD 0aTranscriptional regulator 0aHelix-turn-helix motif 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aCrystallography1 aKang, Yoora1 aChoe, Jungwoo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 18, v. 440 p.317-321dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018900172300001500361520096000376592002801336650004401364650002501408650002201433650002101455650001201476650001401488650002501502650002801527650002501555650001201580650001801592650001201610650001101622650002001633650003301653650002101686650001001707650001701717653002501734653002401759653001801783653003101801700002001832700002101852700002101873700002001894700002401914700002001938773010501958856008702063852000902150655001202159IND60566528820221119184737.0190409e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMund, Nitesh K.10aEvaluation of efficient glucose release using sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid as pretreating agents from the biomass of Sesbania grandiflora (L.)

In this study, biomass of 2years old S. grandiflora was selected for the chemical composition, pretreatments and enzymatic hydrolysis studies. The stem biomass with a wood density of 3.89±0.01gmcm−3 contains about 38% cellulose, 12% hemicellulose and 28% lignin. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass revealed that phosphoric acid (H3PO4) pretreated samples even at lower cellulase loadings [1 Filter Paper Units (FPU)], could efficiently convert about 86% glucose, while, even at higher cellulase loadings (60FPU) alkali pretreated biomass could convert only about 58% glucose. The effectiveness of phosphoric acid pretreatment was also supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSesbania grandiflora 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkali treatment 3abiomass 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3alegumes 3alignin 3aphosphoric acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3atrees 3awood density 0aSesbania grandiflora 0aBiomass composition 0aPretreatments 0aEnzymatic saccharification1 aDash, Debabrata1 aBarik, Chitta R.1 aGoud, Vaibhav V.1 aSahoo, Lingaraj1 aMishra, Prasannajit1 aNayak, Nihar R.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 July, v. 236 p.97-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013000167300001600297520222600313592002802539650001402567650002702581650001202608650001102620650002802631650001602659650001302675650002202688650001002710650001702720650002002737650001902757650001002776650001102786650001402797700002202811700003002833700002302863700002502886700002202911773011702933856007903050852000903129655001203138IND60440093420221119174440.0151024e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044009342DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10264964208092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Joseph E.10aInfluence of a mycorrhizal fungus and/or rhizobium on growth and biomass partitioning of subterranean clover exposed to ozone  ap. 233-248.  aThe influence of soilborne symbionts such as rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi on plant response to ozone (O₃) has not been well defined. Leguminous plants in the field are infected by both types of organisms, which influence plant nutrition and growth. We studied the effects of infection withRhizobium leguminosarum biovartrifolii and/orGigaspora margarita on response of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L. cv Mt. Barker) to O₃. Exposures were conducted in greenhouse CSTR chambers using four O₃ concentrations [charcoal-filtered (CF), 50, 100, or 150 ppb; 6 h day⁻¹, 5 day wk⁻¹ for 12 weeks] as main plots (replicated). Four inoculum types were subplot treatments, i.e., inoculated with one, both, or neither microorganisms. At 2-wk intervals, plants were exposed to¹⁴CO₂ and harvested 24 h later for determination of biomass and¹⁴C content of shoots and roots. Ozone at 100 or 150 ppb suppressed clover growth during the experiment. Inoculation withG. margarita alone suppressed clover growth by the last two harvests, whereasR. leguminosarum alone enhanced growth during this time period. When both symbionts were present, the plants grew similarly to the noninoculated controls. Shoot/root ratios were increased by 100 or 150 ppb O₃ compared to that for CF-treated plants. Shoot/root ratios were greater for all inoculated plants compared to noninoculated controls. Under low O₃ stress (CF or 50 ppb), plants inoculated with bothR. leguminosarum andG. margarita transported a greater proportion of recent photosynthate (¹⁴C) to roots than did noninoculated plants; we attribute this to metabolic requirements of the microorganisms. At the highest level of O₃ stress (150 ppb), this did not occur, probably because little photosynthate was available and the shoots retained most of it for repair of injury. Statistically significant interactions occurred between O₃ and inoculum types for shoot and total biomass. When averaged across harvests, 50 ppb O₃ suppressed biomass in the plants inoculated withG. margarita alone. Apparently, the mycorrhizal fungus is such a significant C drain that even a small amount of O₃ stress suppresses plant growth under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adry matter partitioning 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aozone 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aplant response 3aroots 3ashoots 3asymbionts1 aShafer, Steven R.1 aSchoeneberger, Michele M.1 aPursley, Walter A.1 aHorton, Stephanie J.1 aDavey, Charles B.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g1997 May, v. 96, no. 1-4 p.233-248dKluwer Academic Publishersx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10264964208093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001600281520157900297592002801876650001501904650002001919650001301939650001401952650002101966650001901987650001002006650000902016650001902025651001002044700002002054700002002074700002002094700001602114773009902130856008402229852000902313655001202322IND60123178020221122195241.0150325e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317802DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.9344012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Satya10aAgreement between monthly land rainfall estimates from TRMM-PR and gauge-based observations over South Asia  ap. 558-567.  aThere is a demand for reliable rainfall data-set over the South Asia region covering both land and ocean for model validation/development and various applications. For satellite rainfall estimates (SREs), the algorithm development groups also need validation information on SRE. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) project has produced recently improved version 7 (V7) rainfall data-sets. Version 6 (V6) and V7 of 3A25, the surface rainfall products derived from TRMM precipitation radar (PR), are compared with gauge-based observations at 0.5° latitude/longitude resolution for the period of 1998–2007 over the South Asian land region. Both 3A25V7 and 3A25V6 represent the mean rainfall distribution patterns reasonably well. However, 3A25 products overestimate rainfall over the Indonesian region compared to gauge-based data. For some parts of South Asia, SREs show considerable difference in the magnitude of coefficient of variation compared to gauge-based information. At seasonal scale, a contrasting feature in bias over India during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons is noticed from both the versions of 3A25 data-set. In general, 3A25 rainfall data-sets are able to capture the interannual variability of rainfall over South Asia. The frequency distribution of monthly rainfall rate reveals that 3A25 products marginally underestimate rainfall below 10 mm day ⁻¹ and overestimate higher rainfall rate compared to gauge-based data. Overall, 3A25V7 product is marginally better than its previous version (3A25V6) over the South Asian land region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodel validation 3amonsoon season 3aradar 3arain 3aremote sensing 3aIndia1 aMitra, Ashis K.1 aMomin, Imran M.1 aRajagopal, E.N.1 aBasu, Swati0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 June 3, v. 5, no. 6 p.558-567dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.9344013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245011000160300001600270520196500286592002802251650002602279650002102305650001402326650001202340650002402352650001602376650001702392650001302409650001402422650000902436650001102445650001202456650001002468651001002478651002002488653001002508653001302518653001102531653001602542653002102558653001602579700001702595700001302612700001502625700001602640773010902656856008202765852000902847655001202856IND60480053420221121033423.0160125e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048005342DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.40.2012.1.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, S.10aOn-farm nitrogen use pattern in wheat in rice-wheat cropping system of the trans-gangetic plains of India  ap. 122-134.  aApart from the issue of sustainability and resource drain, the yield plateau in the rice-wheat cropping system of south-east Asia is the major area of concern. Realizing that genetic gain is a remote possibility, efforts are directed to management options for yield improvement. Adequate crop nutrition in general and nitrogen (N) in particular figure at the top among various management issues. A survey was conducted covering the rice-wheat belt of Haryana state, India representing Trans-Gangetic plains to know about on-farm practices related to N management in wheat crop and how far it deviates from the blanket recommendations given by State Agricultural Universities. The survey revealed that about 42.7 per cent farmers used either recommended dose of N (150 kg/ha) or less and others used higher dose of N. Positive correlation between the size of the farm and extent of N used was established. Whenever the farmers tended to use higher dose of N, they also tended to partition it in more number of splits (up to 3 splits, excluding basal application) staggering upto 54 days after sowing (DAS) as against the recommended practice of two splits (including basal application) within 35 DAS. The study confirmed deviation from the recommended practices of N management but major revelation came about reverse gap holding that the practice of N management in wheat crop being followed by the farmers is better in terms of grain yield. The N<sub>Physical optimum</sub> and N<sub>Economic optimum</sub> exceeded the current use (165.7 kg/ha) and recommended levels. This study suggests a fit case for the upward revision of recommended dose of N in wheat crop involving no element of risk as arising from aggravated problem of insect pest and disease complex. Nearly half of the farmers use either recommended dose of N or less than that and it is here, where opportunity lies in augmenting the wheat productivity by enhancing the existing level of N use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural colleges 3acropping systems 3afarm size 3afarmers 3agenetic improvement 3agrain yield 3ainsect pests 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3arisk 3asowing 3asurveys 3awheat 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia 0awheat 0anitrogen 0asplits 0atopdressing 0aN-use efficiency 0agrain yield1 aMalik, R.

We demonstrate that reversible Li intercalation is also achievable in the hybrid organic/inorganic dimensionally reduced 1D van der Waals solid TiS₂(ethylenediamine). Upon intercalation, electrons are injected into the lattice as Ti⁴⁺ is reduced to Ti³⁺ leading to an order of magnitude decrease in electrical resistivity. This reversible intercalation process opens up new opportunities to fine-tune the physical properties in this emerging family of dimensionally reduced materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrons 3aphysical properties 3atitanium 3avan der Waals forces1 aLiu, Yi-Hsin1 aChitara, Basant1 aGoldberger, Joshua E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Feb. 26, v. 136, no. 8 p.2986-2989dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja41323993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008700162300001400249520037900263592002800642650001600670650001000686650001400696650001600710651001000726653001800736653002000754700001900774773009400793856008100887852000900968655001200977IND60698850520221121224731.0210116e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069885052DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.464.84032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cheng10aThree species of Hitobia Kamura, 1992 (Araneae, Gnaphosidae) from south-west China  ap. 25-34.  aTwo new species and one new record of the Hitobia are described from Gaoligong Mountains, Yunnan Province, China: Hitobia tengchong sp. n.

It has been suggested to be able to exert a non-specific beneficial effect as protection against other infectious diseases. The duration of protection against tuberculosis is estimated to be from 10 to 15 years, but the duration of the protection against other infections is not known, maybe up to 20 years, maybe much shorter than that. We don’t know it for sure. BCG induced trained immunity paradigm is based on experimental models, cohort studies with low number of individuals, and some epidemiological data in which other possible interfering factors are not controlled. The titles and scopes of scientific articles should be cautiously considered as they can promote indications of getting vaccinated or revaccinated with BCG, before its effectiveness is confirmed and recommendations are published. Besides, revaccination with BCG can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Maybe BCG vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 deaths or reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with poor health politics and assistance? It is very difficult to compare the epidemiologic data about COVID-19 in different countries. There are countless factors, mainly social and related to the healthcare system, which can be more decisive than the hypothesis of trained immunity induced by BCG. Until now, we can say that BCG’s protective role is, at least, insufficient, given many other factors that corroborate SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or its severity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBCG vaccine 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ahealth services 3aimmunosuppression 3apolitics 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3atuberculosis1 aGoudouris, Ekaterini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1937-91241 aSolé, Dirceu0 tVaccine.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 39, no. 3 p.460-462dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010800171300001600279520097500295592002801270650001201298650001501310650001201325650001801337650002501355650001201380650002301392650001701415650001801432650001101450650001101461650002101472650001801493650001101511653001101522653002501533653001201558653001101570653001701581653001101598700001801609773010601627856008701733852000901820655001201829IND60566529020221119184445.0190409e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhaoyang10aEvaluation of an integrated process to fully utilize bamboo biomass during the production of bioethanol  ap. 202-211.  aAiming for the complete utilization of bamboo biomass, an integrated process which combines ethanol production with the recovery of silica and lignin was proposed. To reduce chemical charge required for the fractionation of silica and lignin from bamboo and improve the digestibility of the obtained substrate, a sequentially two-stage pretreatment process of autohydrolysis and alkaline extraction was carried out. From the view of enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis and recovery of silica and lignin, a two-stage treatment of autohydrolysis at 180°C for 90min followed by alkaline extraction at 100°C with 6% NaOH (based on pretreated chips) for 120min was optimized. About 93.7% of original silica and 75.7% of original lignin could be recovered from bamboo. Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of carbohydrates showed that an overall sugar yield of 88.6% of original sugar content and an ethanol recovery of 0.467g/g sugar were achieved based on the proposed scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3adigestibility 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afractionation 3alignin 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3asugar content 3asugars 0aBamboo 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aEthanol 0aLignin 0aPretreatment 0aSilica1 aWen, Yangbing0 tBioresource technology.g2017 July, v. 236 p.202-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.03.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010800167300001400275500001400289520062700303592002800930650001400958650001300972650001200985650003000997650001301027650001001040650001601050651001201066651001101078653001501089653001601104653001701120653002501137700002201162773009401184856008101278852000901359655001201368IND60698850620221121224843.0210116e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069885062DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.464.84242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran, Daniel P.12aA new species of tiger beetle from southeastern Arizona and Mexico (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Cicindelini)  ap. 35-47.  aNAL-light  aA new tiger beetle species, Cicindelidia melissa Duran & Roman, sp. n., of the tribe Cicindelini, is described from high elevation montane forests of southeastern Arizona and Mexico.

Since including these process alternatives creates a large number of possible process configurations, a framework for process synthesis and optimization is proposed. This approach is supported on kinetic models fed with experimental data and a plant-wide techno-economic model. Among 150 process configurations, 40 show an improved MESP compared to a well-documented base case (BC), almost all include solid separators and some show energy retrieved in products 32% higher compared to the BC. Moreover, 16 of them also show a lower capital investment per unit of ethanol produced per year.

In addition, the two ZR lines developped an identical resistance to atrazine since the I₅₀ for this herbicide in each line was 75 times larger than in wild type. Special TL characteristics were evidenced in the two lines. Bands after 2 flashes (or more) showed a shift of the peak maximum towards low temperature, the shift being the largest in the most DCMU-resistant cells. Similar results were obtained with isolated thylakoids, except that the TL bands appeared at a temperature higher than in corresponding cells. Oscillations in the amplitude of the bands in a flash sequence were largely damped in cells (and thylakoids), particularly in the most DCMU-resistant lines. The results are interpreted as indicating accumulation of Qᴀ ⁻Qʙ after flashes due to a decrease of the equilibrium constant for the reaction Qᴀ − Qʙ ⇄ QᴀQʙ⁻ accompanying the DCMU resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglena 3aatrazine 3adiuron 3atemperature 3athermoluminescence 3athylakoids 0aDiuron 0aEuglena 0aHerbicide-Resistance 0aPhotosystem II 0aThermoluminescence1 aLaval-Martin, Danielle0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 50, no. 1-2 p.86-92dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1995-1-2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015100160300002000311500001900331520087900350592002801229596005101257596011801308596006801426650002501494650001301519650001201532650001101544650001101555650001901566650001401585650001301599650002201612700001701634700001601651700001901667700001301686773015501699856008301854852000901937655001201946IND60700706720221119020042.0210716e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070070672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08700-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Mei10aRecommended turbulent energy dissipation rate for biomass and lipid production of Scenedesmus obliquus in an aerated photosynthetic culture system  ap. 26473-26483.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffects of turbulent energy dissipation rate (increased from 1.28 × 10⁻⁶ to 1.67 × 10⁻⁵ m² s⁻³) on Scenedesmus obliquus biomass and lipid accumulation at different aeration rates (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 L min⁻¹) were investigated.

Because the identification of proteins involved in metabolic pathways could help to extend green-life and improve the quality of the fruit, this study aimed to compare the proteins of banana pulp at the pre-climacteric and climacteric stages. The use of two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) revealed 50 differentially expressed proteins, and comparing those proteins to the Mass Spectrometry Protein Sequence Database (MSDB) identified 26 known proteins. Chitinases were the most abundant types of proteins in unripe bananas, and two isoforms in the ripe fruit have been implicated in the stress/defense response. In this regard, three heat shock proteins and isoflavone reductase were also abundant at the climacteric stage. Concerning fruit quality, pectate lyase, malate dehydrogenase, and starch phosphorylase accumulated during ripening. In addition to the ethylene formation enzyme amino cyclo carboxylic acid oxidase, the accumulation of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase was needed because of the increased ethylene synthesis and DNA methylation that occurred in ripening bananas. Differential analysis provided information on the ripening-associated changes that occurred in proteins involved in banana flavor, texture, defense, synthesis of ethylene, regulation of expression, and protein folding, and this analysis validated previous data on the transcripts during ripening. In this regard, the differential proteomics of fruit pulp enlarged our understanding of the process of banana ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aMusa 3aamino acid sequences 3abananas 3abiochemical pathways 3acarboxylic acids 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afluorescence 3afruit pulp 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agel electrophoresis 3aheat shock proteins 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amass spectrometry 3apectate lyase 3aphosphorylase 3aprotein folding 3aripening 3astarch1 aNogueira, Silvia Beserra1 aCordenunsi, Beatriz Rosana1 aGozzo, FÃ¡bio CÃ©sar1 aPilau, Eduardo Jorge1 aLajolo, Franco Maria1 ado Nascimento, JoÃ£o Roberto Oliveira0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2012 Aug., v. 70 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.x0925-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008200172300001600254520126800270536024201538592002801780596001301808650002301821650001801844650001101862650001801873650001001891650001501901650001701916653001901933653001901952653001801971653001901989700002202008773014302030856008602173852000902259655001202268IND60792058520221121222422.0220905e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205852DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2022.20386992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, Sarah E.10aCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of phytoene desaturase in Carica papaya L  ap. 580-592.  aDespite a long history of genetic engineering in Carica papaya L., genome editing protocols have not been previously validated for this species. To address this gap in the papaya improvement toolkit, we deployed CRIPSR/Cas9 to target the candidate Carica papaya L. phytoene desaturase (CpPDS) gene with the goal of inducing a visually scorable albino phenotype in edited tissue. A total of 73 plant lines stably transformed with pAC0025 (CRISPR construct targeting CpPDS) were obtained. Of these, 59 (81%) were fully albino. Genotyping of the targeted region within CpPDS was carried out for ten pAC0025 (CpPDS construct) lines, one untransformed control, and one line transformed with a negative control construct pAC0026 (no gRNA construct). Alignment of Sanger sequencing results revealed diverse edits in pAC0025-transformed plants including insertions of up to 415 bp, inversions and large deletions between gRNA target sites, and many smaller deletions. Mutations were observed at all three gRNA target sites. Overall, the high percentage of albino plants recovered in combination with the abundance of mutations observed across CpPDS gRNA target sites suggests an efficient genome editing protocol that could be used to improve papaya at the genetic level.  aThis material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Southern Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program under award number GS19-199.  aPublisher supplied data  aGS19-199 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCarica papaya 3aalbino 3abiotechnology 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ahorticulture 0atransformation 0atissue culture 0aAgrobacterium 0atropical fruit1 aChambers, Alan H.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 97, no. 5 p.580-592dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2022.20386993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016300163300001800326520202000344592002802364650001802392650001702410650001502427650002202442650001302464650001102477650001202488650001302500650001402513650001102527650000702538650001902545650001302564650001702577650001702594650001502611700002002626700002302646700002202669700001602691700002202707773010202729856007502831852000902906655001202915IND60531029720221122235444.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102972DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201659f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDilbeck, Preston
L.14aThe D1-D61N Mutation in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Allows the Observation of pH-Sensitive Intermediates in the Formation and Release of O2 from Photosystem II  ap. 1079-1091.  aThe active site of photosynthetic water oxidation by Photosystem II (PSII) is a manganese–calcium cluster (Mn₄CaO₅). A postulated catalytic base is assumed to be crucial. CP43-Arg357, which is a candidate for the identity of this base, is a second-sphere ligand of the Mn₄–Ca cluster and is located near a putative proton exit pathway, which begins with residue D1-D61. Transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved O₂ polarography reveal that in the D1-D61N mutant, the transfer of an electron from the Mn₄CaO₅ cluster to YZᴼX and O₂ release during the final step of the catalytic cycle, the S₃–S₀ transition, proceed simultaneously but are more dramatically decelerated than previously thought (t₁/₂ of up to ∼50 ms vs a t₁/₂ of 1.5 ms in the wild type). Using a bare platinum electrode to record the flash-dependent yields of O₂ from mutant and wild-type PSII has allowed the observation of the kinetics of release of O₂ from extracted thylakoid membranes at various pH values and in the presence of deuterated water. In the mutant, it was possible to resolve a clear lag phase prior to the appearance of O₂, indicating formation of an intermediate before the onset of O₂ formation. The lag phase and the photochemical miss factor were more sensitive to isotope substitution in the mutant, indicating that proton efflux in the mutant proceeds via an alternative pathway. The results are discussed in comparison with earlier results obtained from the substitution of CP43-Arg357 with lysine and in regard to hypotheses concerning the nature of the final steps in photosynthetic water oxidation. These considerations led to the conclusion that proton expulsion during the initial phase of the S₃–S₀ transition starts with the deprotonation of the primary catalytic base, probably CP43-Arg357, followed by efficient proton egress involving the carboxyl group of D1-D61 in a process that constitutes the lag phase immediately prior to O₂ formation chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis 3aactive sites 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aisotopes 3alysine 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotosystem II 3aplatinum 3apolarography 3aspectroscopy 3athylakoids1 aHwang, Hong Jin1 aZaharieva, Ivelina1 aGerencser, Laszlo1 aDau, Holger1 aBurnap, Robert L.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1079-1091dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201659f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520122600311592002801537650001601565650001801581650001701599650001101616650002601627650002401653650001101677650002601688650001101714650002001725650001701745650002201762651001001784651001001794651001001804653001501814653001601829653001001845653001201855653000901867653001501876773014301891856008602034852000902120655001202129IND60792058620221121192845.0220905e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205862DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2022.20414932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhie, Seid Hussen10aPreharvest production practices, and postharvest treatment and handling methods for best quality onion bulbs: review  ap. 552-559.  aOnion (Allium cepa L.), a member of the family Amaryllidaceae, is the second most widely cultivated and oldest crop used as vegetable, spice and medicinal values. It is produced in many countries where China, India and Egypt being the top three producers. It is used as cousins and value addition for different dishes across the world. Onion is also produced and marketed under medium and small scale in urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries and is used as an income generating crop that improves the livelihoods along the value chain. However, because of its perishable nature, it is subjected to significant postharvest losses. Therefore, it is worth to know some preharvest production practices, and postharvest treatment and handling methods so as to produce best quality onion bulbs and maintain the quality for a relatively longer storage periods. Nutrient management, irrigation frequency and water requirement, use of growth regulators, harvest maturity and curing methods are vital factors to produce best quality onion bulbs and maintain the quality with minimum postharvest losses.

In this study, we identified six specific protein subunits in Faba bean (cv. Qinghai 13) combining liquid chromatography (LC), liquid chromatography-electronic spray ionization mass (LC–ESI–MS/MS) and bio-information technology. The results suggested a diversity of seed storage proteins in faba bean, and a total of 16 proteins (four GroEL molecular chaperones and 12 plant-specific proteins) were identified from 97-, 96-, 64-, 47-, 42-, and 38-kD-specific protein subunits in faba bean based on the peptide sequence. We also analyzed the composition and abundance of the amino acids, the physicochemical characteristics, secondary structure, three-dimensional structure, transmembrane domain, and possible subcellular localization of these identified proteins in faba bean seed, and finally predicted function and structure. The three-dimensional structures were generated based on homologous modeling, and the protein function was analyzed based on the annotation from the non-redundant protein database (NR database, NCBI) and function analysis of optimal modeling. The objective of this study was to identify the seed storage proteins in faba bean and confirm the structure and function of these proteins.

The spike proteins of these coronaviruses are critical for host cell entry by receptors. Thus, searching for broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus candidates, such as spike protein inhibitors, is vital and desirable due to the mutations in the spike protein. In this study, a combination of computer-aided drug design and biological verification was used to discover active monomers from traditional Chinese medicine. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and NanoBit assays were used to verify the predicated compounds with their binding activities to spike proteins and inhibitory activities on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 interaction, respectively. Furthermore, an MTT assay was used to evaluate the cell toxicities of active compounds. As a result, glycyrrhizic acid (ZZY-44) was found to be the most efficient and nontoxic broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus molecule in vitro, especially, the significant effect on SARS-CoV-2, which provided a theoretical basis for the study of the pharmacodynamic material basis of traditional Chinese medicine against SARS-CoV-2 and offered a lead compound for further structural modification in order to obtain more effective candidate drugs against SARS-CoV-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adrug design 3aglycyrrhizin 3apathogenicity 3apharmacodynamics 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atoxicity testing 0aTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aMERS-CoV 0aSARS-CoV 0aSpike protein 0aACE2 0aCADD 0aMASMC 0aMERS 0aPDB 0aRBD 0aSARS 0aSPR 0aTCM 0aWHO1 aZhu, Yuying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-26051 aXu, Jiaruo1 aYao, Guangtao1 aZhang, Pei1 aWang, Mengge1 aZhao, Yongfang1 aLin, Guoqiang1 aChen, Hongzhuan1 aChʻen, Li-li,1 aZhang, Jiange1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3610-26880 tPhytomedicine.g2021 May, v. 85 p.153364-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010000169300001200269520147100281592002801752650001501780650002101795650002601816650001401842650001801856650001301874650001701887650000901904650001401913650001101927650001501938650001501953650001201968650001501980650001301995653000802008653001902016653001102035653001302046653001202059700002202071700002202093700002802115773010502143856008602248852000902334655001202343IND60533307320221120090852.0190319e20140609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053330732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonora, Elisa12aA new simple modeling approach for the early prediction of harvest date and yield in nectarines  ap. 1-9.  aThe ripeness at harvest of stone fruit should ensure the best balance between consumer satisfaction and ease logistic management, even if this compromise is not easy to achieve. In fact, as consequence of too early harvesting, an increased consumer dissatisfaction with peach and nectarine fruit is frequently observed. The use of the new non-destructive vis/NIR based, ripening index of absorbance difference (IAD) in planta, may help to overcome this problem. In our experiments, the IAD gave an objective measure of the nectarine ripening stage and showed a linear trend during stage 3 (S3) of fruit development, that did not appear affected nor by the climatic conditions of different years, neither by the training systems. The combined field monitoring of fruit ripening (IAD) and growth (mm) during stage 3 of nectarine development allowed two-three weeks advance predictions for harvest date and yield with low errors. The new approach also appeared a more reliable method in predicting harvest date than the till now used growing degree heat unit accumulation at 30 days after full bloom (growing degree days GDD30). The model developed in the present work offers promises for future real applications under field conditions, to obtain early objective and precise predictions for harvest date and yield. Moreover, taking into account fruit ripening stage at harvest, would allow an increase in fruit quality and improve fruit management during post-harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aclimatic factors 3aconsumer satisfaction 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3aharvest date 3aheat 3aheat sums 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anectarines 3apeaches 3aprediction 3aripening 0aIAD 0aPrunus persica 0aGrowth 0aRipening 0aQuality1 aNoferini, Massimo1 aStefanelli, Dario1 aCosta, G.q(Guglielmo),0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 June 09, v. 172 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245012900204300001800333506007600351520176900427592002802196506003702224650002102261650001302282650001702295650004902312650002402361650001102385650001302396650001102409650001602420650001702436650001202453650002002465650002402485650001302509700002002522700002402542700002602566773010202592856007502694852000902769655001202778IND60531029920221207120921.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102992DNAL7 a10.1021/bi20176242doi7 aPMC32932472pmcid7 a222640792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, Ezelle
T.10aSequence, Structure, and Dynamic Determinants of Hsp27 (HspB1) Equilibrium Dissociation Are Encoded by the N-Terminal Domain  ap. 1257-1268.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) undergoes concentration-dependent equilibrium dissociation from an ensemble of large oligomers to a dimer. This phenomenon plays a critical role in Hsp27 chaperone activity in vitro enabling high affinity binding to destabilized proteins. In vivo dissociation, which is regulated by phosphorylation, controls Hsp27 role in signaling pathways. In this study, we explore the sequence determinants of Hsp27 dissociation and define the structural basis underlying the increased affinity of Hsp27 dimers to client proteins. A systematic cysteine mutagenesis is carried out to identify residues in the N-terminal domain important for the equilibrium between Hsp27 oligomers and dimers. In addition, spin-labels were attached to the cysteine mutants to enable electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of residue environment and solvent accessibility in the context of the large oligomers, upon dissociation to the dimer, and following complex formation with the model substrate T4 Lysozyme (T4L). The mutagenic analysis identifies residues that modulate the equilibrium dissociation in favor of the dimer. EPR analysis reveals that oligomer dissociation disrupts subunit contacts leading to the exposure of Hsp27 N-terminal domain to the aqueous solvent. Moreover, regions of this domain are highly dynamic with no evidence of a packed core. Interaction between T4L and sequences in this domain is inferred from transition of spin-labels to a buried environment in the substrate/Hsp27 complex. Together, the data provide the first structural analysis of sHSP dissociation and support a model of chaperone activity wherein unstructured and highly flexible regions in the N-terminal domain are critical for substrate binding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding capacity 3acysteine 3adissociation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aheat shock proteins 3ahumans 3alysozyme 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutagenicity 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3asolvents1 aBortolus, Marco1 aKoteiche, Hanane A.1 aMchaourab, Hassane S.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1257-1268dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi20176243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245012100172300001600293520105100309592002801360650004401388650002301432650002201455650001301477650002901490650002001519650003601539653002801575653002901603653003701632700002701669700002301696700001601719700002001735700002701755773012301782856008901905852000901994655001202003IND60543426820221120092203.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunç, Turgay10aAntimony(III) complexes with 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidines: Synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation  ap. 206-214.  aNovel pyrimidine compound bearing disulfide bridge, 5,5′-disulfanediylbis(2-amino-4,6-dimetoxypyrimidine) (3) was synthesized by reduction of 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxy-5-thiocyanatopyrimidine for the first time, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.

The pancreas of these animals is highly inflamed, a phenotype replicated by treatment with poly(I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA. Trypsinogen5 mRNA was constitutively up-regulated about 1,000-fold in Irf2â/â mice compared with controls as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Further knockout of IFNÎ±/Î² receptor 1(Ifnar1) abolished poly(I:C)-induced pancreatitis but had no effect on the constitutive up-regulation of trypsinogen5 gene, indicating crucial type I IFN signaling to elicit the inflammation. Analysis of Ifnar1â/â mice confirmed type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation of dsRNA-sensing pattern recognition receptor genes MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3, which induced poly(I:C)-dependent cell death in acinar cells in the absence of IRF2. We speculate that Trypsin5, the trypsinogen5 gene product, leaking from dead acinar cells triggers a chain reaction leading to lethal pancreatitis in Irf2â/â mice because it is resistant to a major endogenous trypsin inhibitor, Spink3.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apancreas 3amessenger RNA 3acell death 3apancreatitis 3aphenotype 3atranscriptional activation 3aacinar cells 3amodels 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3aLymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus 3agenes 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ainterferons 0aLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus1 aKohno, Tomoko1 aYasui, Kiyoshi1 aMurota, Hiroyuki1 aKimura, Tohru1 aDuncan, Gordon S.1 aNakashima, Tomoki1 aYamamoto, Kazuo1 aKatayama, Ichiro1 aMa, Yuhua1 aChua, Koon Jiew1 aSuematsu, Takashi1 aShimokawa, Isao1 aAkira, S.,1 aKubo, Yoshinao1 aMak, Tak Wah1 aMatsuyama, Toshifumi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 108, no. 46 p.18766-18771dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11162731083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245011200177300001600289520122500305592002801530650004401558650001601602650002101618650001401639650002101653650003601674650001701710650001401727650001501741650001801756650001601774653001901790653001401809653001601823653001601839653001701855700002901872700002601901700002301927700003001950773012301980856008902103852000902192655001202201IND60543426920221120092141.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekar, Gajalakshmi10aBinding studies of hydroxylated Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes to hemoglobin, gamma globulin and transferrin  ap. 222-232.  aBiocompatibility of nanoparticles depends on their binding behavior with biomolecules. Herein, we have reported the interaction of three different biological macromolecules such as hemoglobin, gamma globulin and transferrin with hydroxyl group functionalized Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (OH-MWCNTs). Multiple spectroscopic methods were utilized to identify the binding cum structural changes in biomolecules upon their interaction. Hyperchromic effect observed in the UV–visible spectra, and the quenching behavior from fluorescence emission evidences the existence of bio-nanotube complex formation. Synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of biomolecules, in correspondence with Trp and Tyr residues showed the possible disturbance towards their aromatic micro-environment. Changes observed in the FTIR and FT-Raman amide bands, and amino acid residue position of biomolecules upon interaction with CNTs showed the possible effect towards their secondary structure. Further studies with CD spectroscopy indicated the loss of alpha-helical structures quantitatively. The study remains significant in evaluating the biosafety profile of functionalized MWCNTs for their in vivo biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamino acids 3abiocompatibility 3abiosafety 3acarbon nanotubes 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3aglobulins 3ahemoglobin 3ananoparticles 3atransferrin 0aMacromolecules 0aQuenching 0aAmide bands 0aAlpha-helix 0aConformation1 aKandiyil, Shirona Thazae1 aSivakumar, Amaravathy1 aMukherjee, Amitava1 aChandrasekaran, Natarajan0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Dec., v. 153 p.222-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245008500170300001800255520104000273592002801313650004901341650001301390650003201403650003101435650002701466700002601493700001701519700002001536773010201556856007501658852000901733655001201742IND60531030020221120141357.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053103002DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201769z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnamani, Venkatramanan10aSecondary and Tertiary Structure of Bacteriorhodopsin in the SDS Denatured State  ap. 1051-1060.  aWe characterized the structure of partially unfolded bacteriorhodopsin in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and compared it with its in vitro refolded structure after reconstitution with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (DMPC/CHAPS). Intrahelical and interhelical distances were mapped in the protein using strategically located spin-label pairs at helical ends, assayed by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (double electron–electron spin resonance, DEER). We find that in SDS the intrahelical end-to-end distances exhibit broad distributions, suggesting a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations with differing secondary structures. Nevertheless, a majority of the denatured population retains end-to-end distances similar to those in the native state. In contrast, the observed greatly increased interhelical distances, in addition to their very broad distributions, suggest that in the SDS micelles very little of the native tertiary structure remains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amicelles 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprotein tertiary structure 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aHegde, Balachandra G.1 aLangen, Ralf1 aLanyi, Janos K.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1051-1060dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201769z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001600175245007600191300001600267520166600283592002801949650000801977650001401985650002201999650001502021650001502036650001202051650001702063650002102080650001202101650002702113650002002140650001302160650001002173650001002183650002402193650001902217650001602236650001202252650002202264650001202286650001102298650004802309650003302357650001102390650003902401650006202440650004102502650000902543650001402552650002302566650003102589650003502620650002302655650004002678700001902718700001702737700001702754700001602771700001502787773009102802856009202893852000902985655001202994IND4478100720221119084026.0141111e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447810072DNAL7 a217050582pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLessard, C.10aInfertility in a beef bull due to a failure in the capacitation process  ap. 891-899.  aThe objective of this case report was to identify the cause of apparent idiopathic infertility in a Red Angus (beef) bull. Semen was collected by electroejaculation and submitted to a series of assays, including evaluation of sperm motility by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), sperm morphology and DNA integrity, semen cryopreservation, AI, IVF, induction of the acrosome reaction, and determination of the level of sperm proteins associated with bull fertility potential. Total (92 ± 2%) and progressive (79 ± 4%) sperm motility; sperm concentration (1647 ± 429 × 10⁶ sperm/mL); proportions of morphologically normal sperm (83 ± 6%) and DNA integrity (96 ± 2), and acrosome-intact sperm (64 ± 4%) exceeded minimum acceptable values. Frozen sperm had good total (58.7 ± 6.7%) and progressive (43.9 ± 9.2%) motility immediately after thawing. However, AI of 16 heifers resulted in no pregnancies and blastocyst production rate (following IVF using sperm from this infertile bull) was nearly identical to that produced using dead sperm (a control of parthenogenesis; 2 ± 2 and 2 ± 3%; respectively P < 0.05). Treatment with a calcium ionophore (A23187) failed to induce the acrosome reaction in sperm from the infertile bull (P < 0.05). Evaluation of several proteins associated with the fertility potential of bulls revealed that the level of Binder Sperm Protein-1 (BSP1), known to be associated with the capacitation process, was much greater on sperm from the infertile bull compared to that of his sire. In conclusion, we inferred that the idiopathic infertility in this bull was caused by a failure to complete the capacitation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRed Angus 3aacrosome reaction 3abeef bulls 3ablastocyst 3acalcium 3acase studies 3acryopreservation 3aheifers 3ain vitro fertilization 3aparthenogenesis 3aproteins 3asemen 3asires 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 2aAcrosome Reaction 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aInfertility, Malexetiologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aSemen Analysisxveterinary 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSperm Capacitation 2aSpermatozoaxchemistryxphysiology.1 aSiqueira, L.G.1 aD'Amours, O.1 aSullivan, R.1 aLeclerc, P.1 aPalmer, C.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 76, no. 5 p.891-899dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010200208300001800310520120500328592002801533650001501561650001501576650002001591650001701611650001501628650001301643650002601656650001901682650001201701650001201713650003001725653002601755653001201781653002101793653002501814653000701839653001001846653000801856653001001864653000801874700001601882700002101898700002101919700001901940773014801959856008302107852000902190655001202199IND60612854420221121064404.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061285442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiozawa, Kumiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9173-679810aExtracellular vesicle-encapsulated microRNA-761 enhances pazopanib resistance in synovial sarcoma  ap. 1322-1327.  aThe development of drug resistance in tumor cells leads to relapse and distant metastasis. Secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) enclosed in extracellular vesicles (EVs) can act as intercellular messengers. The objective of our study was to elucidate the role of secreted miRNAs to better understand the regulatory network underlying pazopanib-resistance in synovial sarcoma cells. We performed a comprehensive analysis of secreted miRNA abundance in pazopanib treated/untreated synovial sarcoma cells from four different cell lines (SYO-1, HS-SYII, 1273/99, and YaFuSS) using microarray technology, and discovered miR-761 in EVs as a potential biomarker of pazopanib-resistance in synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, we showed that miR-761 putatively targeted three proteins, thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 (TRIP6), lamin A/C (LMNA), and NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Knockdown of any of these proteins was shown in previous studies to confer increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Our findings provide new insight into the potential role of miR-761, an EV-secreted miRNA from synovial sarcoma cells, making it a potential candidate for use in sarcoma therapy in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acell lines 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3arelapse 3asarcoma 3athyroid hormone receptors 0aExtracellular vesicle 0aMiR-761 0aSynovial sarcoma 0aPazopanib-resistance 0aEV 0amiRNA 0aNTA 0aNSCLC 0aSTS1 aShuting, Ji1 aYoshioka, Yusuke1 aOchiya, Takahiro1 aKondo, Tadashi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.1322-1327dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002100188245013200209300001100341506007600352520140100428592002801829506003701857650002501894650001101919650002501930650002001955650002101975650001101996650002102007650000702028650002602035650003302061650000902094700002302103700002402126700001802150700003102168773010602199856008202305852000902387655001202396IND60572725520221207131719.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057272552DNAL7 aPMC54281092pmcid7 a284520232pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0716-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzami, Nor Azura10aEnhanced degradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) by newly isolated Burkholderia cepacia DP1 with high depolymerase activity  ap. 75.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe contribution of microbial depolymerase has received much attention because of its potential in biopolymer degradation. In this study, the P(3HB) depolymerase enzyme of a newly isolated Burkholderia cepacia DP1 from soil in Penang, Malaysia, was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The factors affecting P(3HB) depolymerase enzyme production were studied using one-variable-at-a-time approach prior to optimization. Preliminary experiments revealed that the concentration of nitrogen source, concentration of carbon source, initial pH and incubation time were among the main factors influencing the enzyme productivity. An increase of 9.4 folds in enzyme production with an activity of 5.66 U/mL was obtained using optimal medium containing 0.028% N of di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate and 0.31% P(3HB-co-21%4HB) as carbon source at the initial pH of 6.8 for 38 h of incubation. Moreover, the RSM model showed great similarity between predicted and actual enzyme production indicating a successful model validation. This study warrants the ability of P(3HB) degradation by B. cepacia DP1 in producing higher enzyme activity as compared to other P(3HB) degraders being reported. Interestingly, the production of P(3HB) depolymerase was rarely reported within genus Burkholderia. Therefore, this is considered to be a new discovery in the field of P(3HB) depolymerase production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3acarbon 3adiammonium phosphate 3aenzyme activity 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3apH 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoil1 aWirjon, Ira Aryani1 aKannusamy, Shantini1 aTeh, Aik-Hong1 aAbdullah, Amirul Al-Ashraf0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.75-75dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0716-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245021000175300001100385520152600396592002801922650002301950650005001973650002502023650001802048650001402066650004102080650003102121650001402152650001802166650000902184650002702193650002502220700001902245700002102264700006102285700002502346700002102371700002202392773012602414856008302540852000902623655001202632IND60777754020221121050925.0221002e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077775402DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-022-00696-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifiarab, Gholamali10aEvaluation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in bottled water samples (non-carbonated, mineral, carbonated and carbonated flavored water) in Tehran with MSPE-GC/MS method: a health risk assessment  ap. 32.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are dangerous environmental compounds that are sometimes found in food. The objective of present study was to measure the level of 16 PAHs in bottled water samples (non-carbonated or drinking, mineral, carbonated and carbonated flavored water) in Tehran by using magnetic solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (MSPE/GC–MS) method. The limit of detections (LOD), limit of quantifications (LOQ) and recovery of PAH compounds were 0.010–0.210, 0.03–0.700 μg/L and 92.5–103.4%, respectively. The results showed that the mean of total PAHs in samples was 2.98 ± 1.63 µg/L and the mean of Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was 0.08 ± 0.03 µg/L, which were lower than standard level of the US-EPA (0.2 µg/L, BaP in drinking water). Also, our results showed that carbonated flavored water had maximum mean of total PAHs (4.95 ± 0.8 µg/L) and mineral water had minimum mean of total PAHs (1.24 ± 0.8 µg/L). The Monte Carlo method was applied to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Incremental Life Cancer Risk (ILCR) indexes. In all samples, the rank order of the estimated CDI values based on the 95 percent percentile was F > B(a)A > Ace > Fl > Na > Ph > B(b)F > B(k)F > B(a)P > P > Ac > A. The cancer risk and uncertainty analysis of 95th Percentile for bottled waters studied gave values lower permissible limit of 10⁻⁶, indicating not pose a serious concern to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aaverage daily intake 3abottled water 3achemistry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahealth effects assessments 3amagnetism 3amineral water 3arisk 3asolid phase extraction 3auncertainty analysis1 aMehraie, Abbas1 aArabameri, Majid1 aShariatifar, Nabi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2861-57581 aMortazavian, Amir M.1 aMoazzen, Mojtaba1 aSohrabvandi, Sara0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2022 Dec., v. 65, no. 1 p.32-32dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-022-00696-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012300169300001600292500002000308520110300328592002801431650002101459650002501480650003301505650002001538650001801558650002101576650001501597650002401612650001001636650001901646650002201665650001201687651001301699700002101712700002001733773014201753852000901895856008901904655001201993IND4369042320221118020710.0200105e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436904232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00581.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErsado, Lire10aProductivity and Land Enhancing Technologies in Northern Ethiopia: Health, Public Investments, and Sequential Adoption  ap. 321-331.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe adoption of more efficient farming practices and technologies that enhance agricultural productivity and improve environmental sustainability is instrumental for achieving economic growth, food security, and poverty alleviation in sub‐Saharan Africa. Our research examines the interaction between public investments, community health, and adoption of productivity and land enhancing technologies by households in the northern Ethiopian state of Tigray. Agricultural technology adoption decisions are modeled as a sequential process where the timing of choices can matter. We find that time spent sick and opportunity costs of caring for sick family members are significant factors in adoption. Sickness, through its impact on household income and labor allocation decisions for healthcare and other activities, significantly reduces the likelihood of technology adoption. Our findings suggest that agencies working to improve agricultural productivity and land resource conservation should consider not only the financial status of potential adopters, but also their related health situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity health 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afarming systems 3afood security 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3alabor 3aland resources 3aopportunity costs 3apoverty 3aEthiopia1 aAmacher, Gregory1 aAlwang, Jeffrey0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2004 May, v. 86, no. 2 p.321-331dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00581.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02625naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166300001600263520127000279592002801549596005901577650002201636650001601658650002601674650002401700650001601724650001801740650001101758650001301769650001101782650001101793650001301804650001801817650001501835650002401850650000901874700002101883700001601904700005701920773011001977856008302087852000902170655001202179IND60777754120221121051038.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077775412DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-021-00559-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsra, Lilatul10aNutritional Evaluation and Shelf-Life Study of Mackerel Tuna (Euthynnus affinis) Fish Pickle  ap. 249-257.  aFish pickle was prepared from mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis) fish, and the nutritional contents, shelf-life at different storage conditions, and cost-profit were analyzed. The moisture, protein, lipid, and ash content of produced mackerel tuna pickle (MTP) were found 47.70%, 29.96%, 18.37%, and 3.7%, respectively. The effects of acetic acid inclusion and storage temperature were evaluated on MTP storage using a 5-point scoring system by a group of 10 trained panelists. MTP added with 4% acetic acid (10%, v/v) and stored at refrigeration temperature (4 °C) showed longer shelf-life than MTP without acetic acid and stored at ambient temperature. There were eight essential and seven nonessential amino acids detected in MTP. Among the essential amino acids, lysine content was found the highest (431.43 mg/100 g MTP) and among the nonessential amino acids, glutamic acid content was found the highest (643.86 mg/100 g MTP). A simple cost-profit analysis showed that the marginal profit in MTP production was 28.0% of the sale value. So, the production of MTP at household and small industry level will generate additional income for commercial fishermen and producers, and will enhance per capita fish protein consumption by urban and rural consumers.  aPublisher supplied data  aBS-270cMinistry of Science and Technology, Bangladesh 3aEuthynnus affinis 3aacetic acid 3aagricultural research 3aambient temperature 3aash content 3aglutamic acid 3aincome 3aindustry 3alipids 3alysine 3amackerel 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3atuna1 aSuraiya, Sharmin1 aSalma, Umme1 aHaq, Monjurul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-26190 tAgricultural research.g2022 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.249-257dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-021-00559-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245010300157520114900260592002801409650002401437650001701461650001701478650001401495650001701509650001701526650002001543650003001563650001601593700001601609700001801625700001801643700002001661700001501681700001701696773012001713856007801833852000901911655001201920IND60760640620221121072957.0211223e20211208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064062DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ding,10aModulation of Gut Microbiota by Lactobacillus casei Fermented Raspberry Juice In Vitro and In Vivo  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of gut microbiota by fermented raspberry juice (FRJ) both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of FRJ reached the highest after fermentation for 42 h. Seventeen phenolic compounds were contained in FRJ, mainly including ellagic acid (496.64 ± 2.91 μg/g) and anthocyanins (total concentration: 387.93 μg/g). FRJ modulated the gut microbiota into a healthy in vitro status, with increase of valeric and isovaleric acids production. In healthy mice, all FRJ treatments improved the production of acetic, butyric and isovaleric acids as well as the gene expression of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, Ocdudin, E-cadherin and Muc-2. Moreover, variable gut microbial compositions were found among the groups fed diet-supplemented the different doses of FRJ, within low and median doses of FRJ may regulate the microbiota to a healthier state compared to the high dose supplementation. This study indicated that fermentation is a potential way to produce plant-based juices, which could reshape the gut microbiota and improve the host health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3acadherins 3aellagic acid 3afermentation 3agene expression 3aintestinal microorganisms 3araspberries1 aChu, Xueqi 1 aCheng, Yuxin 1 aTang, Shuxin 1 aZogona, Daniel 1 aPan, Siyi 1 aXu, Xiaoyun 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 08, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008700163500002000250520108700270592002801357650002701385650001501412650001801427650001201445650002101457650001301478650002501491650001401516650001001530650001801540650002001558700002201578700002201600773011401622856007401736852000901810655001201819IND60791236320221122080422.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079123632DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.11122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassett, Stetson S.10aEvaluation of a side‐by‐side, full‐scale conversion to biological filtration  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate water quality and operational trends of a side‐by‐side, full‐scale biofiltration conversion. Four filters at a water treatment plant, treating low turbidity and low total organic carbon water, were monitored for one year. One filter was a prechlorinated control, and the other three were biofilters. One was a standard biofilter, one had chlorinated backwash, and the third was supplemented with nutrients. Slightly higher concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (175–2,300 ng ATP/cm³) and extracellular polymeric substances (0.00–0.08 mg glucose/g total solids) were found in the biofilters compared with the control. Total trihalomethanes and haloacetic acid were lower in the biofilters relative to the control (60 and 30%, respectively). Conversion to biological filtration resulted in slightly higher (0.019 ntu) and more variable (0.013 ntu) effluent turbidity, but filter run volumes were unaffected. At the conclusion of the study, a decision was made to convert all the filters in the plant to biofilters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3aglucose 3ahaloacetic acids 3apolymers 3atotal organic carbon 3aturbidity 3awater 3awater quality 3awater treatment1 aNieminski, Eva C.1 aStevens, David K.0 tAWWA water science.g2019 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.e1112-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.11123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010600162300001600268520064300284592002800927650001600955650001300971650001100984650002200995650002201017650003701039650002101076650001101097650001101108650001701119653002101136653001101157653001301168653002201181700002601203700001701229773015001246856007701396852000901473655001201482IND60522255820221122233747.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225582DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrewes, Daniel10aSynthesis and Crystal Structure of the Tetra-nickel Substituted [Ni4(H2O)2(AsW9O34)2]10- Polyoxoanion  ap. 980-984.  aThe new polyoxotungstate (NH₄)₆Na₄[Ni₄(H₂O)₂(AsW₉O₃₄)₂] · 20 H₂O (1) was synthesized in aqueous solution and characterized by IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and single-crystal X-ray analysis.

Then, T-OE was grafted onto the NG to fabricate a dual-functionalized nanogel (TNG), and both the NG and TNG possessed a uniform diameter (∼160 nm) and excellent stability. The DOX-loaded nanogel (NG/D and TNG/D) displayed appropriate release properties under reducing conditions. MCF-7/ADR cell experiments showed that although both the NG/D and TNG/D could increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), only the TNG could effectively overcome the drug efflux by inducing mitochondrial depolarization and by interfering with the metabolism of ATP. Both the cell cytotoxicity and the MCF-7/ADR solid cancer assay indicated that TNG/D possessed a long-acting drug enrichment and enhanced the inhibition, resulting from the combined action of the high ROS level and the suppressed drug efflux. These results demonstrated that the T-OE-functionalized and the DADS-crosslinked NG had a great potential for use in the treatment of MCF-7/ADR tumours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acopolymerization 3acytotoxicity 3adiallyl disulfide 3adrugs 3afree radicals 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3atransesterification1 aHe, Le1 aWang, Xin1 aTang, Rupei0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 7, no. 2 p.240-250dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb02742k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009700207300001600304520176100320592002802081650002602109650001602135650000902151650001402160650001602174650001102190650002702201650001702228650002502245650002402270650002402294700001802318700002002336700002602356700002502382700002302407700002502430700001902455773011002474856008302584852000902667655001202676IND60777754320221121051110.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077775432DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-021-00567-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Sneha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3564-178610aIdentification of QTL for Banded Leaf and Sheath Blight in Teosinte-Derived Maize Population  ap. 155-163.  aBanded leaf and sheath blight is considered as the most important disease of maize, and development of resistant varieties is the most viable option. Total one seventy-one [169 BC₁F₅ teosinte-derived maize lines along with teosinte (resistant) and DI-103 (susceptible) as a check] were planted in randomized complete block design in two different dates of sowing (DE₁ and DE₂) under artificially inoculated environments. Molecular profiling of population was carried out with identified 76 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Association of the markers with the quantitative trait loci (QTL) was performed by single marker analysis (SMA) using linear regression and maximum likelihood analysis. The single marker analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed one major QTL on chromosome 5 and four minor QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 8, respectively, for BLSB resistance under first sowing (DE₁). In second sowing (DE₂), four minor QTLs were detected on four chromosomes 1, 3, 5 and 8. Out of these, nine QTLs two were identified across the environments, which were linked with markers umc1500 and phi10918, considered as stable QTLs. Among seven detected QTLs for BLSB resistance, a major QTL linked with phi10918 was co-localized with three minor QTLs for ear length, kernel rows per ear and kernels per row. These results suggest that the morphological traits and QTLs which have been found to associate with banded leaf and sheath blight resistance are a good choice to enhance BLSB resistance. Utilization of QTLs governing morphological traits like days to anthesis, days to silking, flag leaf architecture, plant height, etc., could be a good choice along with QTLs governing BLSB resistance to enhance BLSB resistance through QTL pyramiding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3achromosomes 3acorn 3aflowering 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant height 3aprobability analysis 3aquantitative traits 3aregression analysis1 aJoshi, Anjali1 aKumar, Amarjeet1 aSingh, Narendra Kumar1 aJaiswal, Jai Prakash1 aJeena, Anand Singh1 aSingh, Rajesh Pratap1 aPandey, Dinesh0 tAgricultural research.g2022 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.155-163dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-021-00567-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010300166500001900269520137600288592002801664650003001692650001401722650001201736650001101748650002501759650001001784650001101794700002101805700002701826773012001853856007901973852000902052655001202061IND60738795920221119113244.0210524e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073879592DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120503952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrausa, Kathrin 10aGuarding Vibrations—Axestotrigona ferruginea Produces Vibrations When Encountering Non-Nestmates  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlower visiting stingless bees store collected pollen and nectar for times of scarcity. This stored food is of high value for the colony and should be protected against con- and heterospecifics that might rob them. There should be high selective pressure on the evolution of mechanisms to discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates and to defend the nest, i.e., resources against intruders. Multimodal communication systems, i.e., a communication system that includes more than one sensory modality and provide redundant information, should be more reliable than unimodal systems. Besides olfactory signals, vibrational signals could be used to alert nestmates. This study tests the hypothesis that the vibrational communication mode plays a role in nest defense and nestmate recognition of Axestotrigona ferruginea. Substrate vibrations induced by bees were measured at different positions of the nest. The experiments show that guarding vibrations produced in the entrance differ in their temporal structure from foraging vibrations produced inside the nest. We show that guarding vibrations are produced during non-nestmate encounters rather than nestmate encounters. This further supports the idea that guarding vibrations are a component of nest defense and alarm communication. We discuss to whom the vibrations are addressed, and what their message and meaning are.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3aevolution 3aflowers 3anectar 3anestmate recognition 3anests 3apollen1 aHager, Felix  A.1 aKirchner, Wolfgang  H.0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120503953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010000160500002000260520113100280592002801411596006701439596002901506596003001535650002101565650001201586650001701598650001301615650001701628650002901645650002301674650001301697650001001710700001701720700001801737700001701755700006001772773011401832856007401946852000902020655001202029IND60791236620221122080446.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079123662DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.11192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Natalia10aChlorine addition prior to granular activated carbon contactors improves trihalomethane control  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOptimizing granular activated carbon (GAC) operation can reduce costs for removing disinfection byproducts or their precursors. This article investigates prechlorination to enhance the removal of total trihalomethane (TTHM) precursors and reduce TTHM concentrations in finished water. Rapid small‐scale column tests (RSSCTs) and pilot tests using virgin and reactivated GAC were conducted on water with and without prechlorination. Prechlorination (1 or 2 mg Cl₂/L) increased (by 15 and 30%, respectively) the number of bed volumes treated by GAC. On the basis of size exclusion chromatography, prechlorination followed by GAC preferentially removed low‐molecular‐weight dissolved organic carbon by GAC. Simulated distribution system (SDS) chlorination tests on GAC effluent showed lower TTHM concentrations with prechlorination. Prechlorination lowered the bromine incorporation factor values in GAC effluents after SDS tests, which suggests a reduction in toxicity potential from trihalomethanes. RSSCT results were validated by pilot testing, showing that RSSCTs can be used to optimize the prechlorination process.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel  cArizona State University  cWater Research Foundation 3aactivated carbon 3abromine 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic carbon 3agel chromatography 3atoxicity 3awater1 aGhosh, Amlan1 aTalabi, Binga1 aSeidel, Chad1 aWesterhoff, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9241-87590 tAWWA water science.g2019 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.e1119-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.11193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245010900200300001800309520192000327592002802247650002102275650001902296650001802315650001602333650001602349650002202365650001302387650001802400650002002418650003102438650001002469650001802479650001902497650003202516650001902548650002102567650001002588650001802598650000902616650002602625650002402651650002002675650004302695650001402738650001702752650001302769650003602782650002102818700001602839700001502855700001402870700001502884700001502899700001702914700001202931700001402943700001502957773012502972856007403097852000903171655001203180IND60639965420221119054606.0190503e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996542DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00654c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieThese authors contribute equally to this work., Ying10aAnti-hyperlipidemic effect of rice bran polysaccharide and its potential mechanism in high-fat diet mice  ap. 4028-4041.  aHyperlipidemia occurs very often in modern society along with a high calorie intake and is regarded as one of the greatest risk factors for the prevalence of cardiac vascular disease (CVD). In this study, we investigated the anti-hyperlipidemic effect of the rice bran polysaccharides (RBP) and its mechanism in a high fat diet animal model. 60 ICR mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, which included Control, HFD (high fat diet) and HFD + RBP, and each group included 20 mice. The control group was fed with a standard diet while the other two groups were fed with HFD. In addition, the HFD + RBP group was fed with 500 mg kg⁻¹ of rice bran polysaccharides by intragastric administration while the other two groups were intragastrically administered with water. The results showed that RBP treatment for 10 weeks obviously decreased the body weight, liver weight and adipose tissues of mice; and it decreased the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoprotein–cholesterol (LDL-c) in the plasma. H&E staining of the liver tissues showed that RBP treatment decreased the size of fat droplets compared with the HFD group. Microarray analysis revealed that RBP treatment results in 80 genes being up-regulated while 72 genes were down-regulated in the tissues of liver. IPA software analysis suggested that NF-κB may play a vital role in the lipid-lowering effect of RBP. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that the mRNA levels of PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, PPAR-δ, SREBP-1C, FASN, ACC, SIRT and CD36, which are related to lipid metabolism, were significantly regulated by RBP supplementation compared to HFD. The western blot analysis further confirmed these altered expressions after RBP treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that the oral administration of RBP exerts lipid-lowering in high fat diet mice via regulating the lipid metabolism-related gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal models 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3acomputer software 3adroplets 3aenergy intake 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3aintragastric administration 3alipemic effect 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aoral administration 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice bran 3arisk factors 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols1 aLuo, Feijun1 aWang, Long1 aYang, Tao1 aShi, Limin1 aLi, Xinhua1 aShen, Junjun1 aXu, Wei1 aGuo, Ting1 aLin, Qinlu0 tFood & function.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 8, no. 11 p.4028-4041dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00654c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245010200170300001600272520094300288592002801231650001801259650001301277650001401290650001301304650002001317650003801337650003501375650001701410650001301427700001701440700001501457700001401472773011501486856005701601852000901658655001201667IND4501384720221119214003.0150424e198704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450138472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.1987.tb04924.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlarcon, B.10aComparative study of Agrobacterium biotypes 1, 2 and 3 by electrophoresis and serological methods  ap. 295-308.  aA comparative study by electrophoresis and serology of strains representing the three Agrobacterium biotypes was carried out.

The strains were studied by immunodiffusion, indirect immunofluorescence and indirect ELISA. Serological relationship among all the strains was observed, although serological heterogeneity within each of the biotypes occurred. Biotype 3 appears as serologically related to biotypes 1 and 2, having an intermediate position. This observation is in agreement with their biochemical characteristics. Electrophoretic analysis of the three biotypes showed that there was high variability. Three main bands appeared in the six strains studied.

The floristic relationships between 13 sites of montane grasslands, distributed from north-east to south Brazil (roughly 13–28 °S), were analyzed on the basis of grass species composition. After a compilation of the published literature, the floristic lists were updated according to current taxonomic circumscriptions. The final list had 311 species within 72 genera. The genus Paspalum had the highest number of species (49), whereas 25 genera contained only a single species. Relatively many species (∼50%) were restricted to single study sites, and very few species were widespread. Multivariate analysis supported four groups (bootstrap values >70), primarily distinguishing between seasonal tropical versus humid temperate climates and secondarily between surrounding biomes (caatinga versus cerrado) in the northern tropical sites and geological substrates (granitic versus basaltic) in the southern temperate sites. Our study documents the effects of large-scale climatic and geological factors on the floristic differentiation of montane grasslands and contributes to knowledge of the major vegetation types occurring within Brazilian mountain systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaspalum 3aaltitude 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahumid zones 3amultivariate analysis 3aspecies diversity 3aBrazil 0abiogeography 0acampos 0acampos rupestres 0ahigh-altitude fields 0aPoaceae 0arocky fields1 aDorneles Welker, Cassiano Aimberê1 aWaechter, Jorge Luiz0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 10, no. 4 p.537-550dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2012.753487  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245016700208300001600375520172200391592002802113650001902141650002602160650000902186650001402195650001302209650003702222650001802259650001502277650001302292650001502305651000902320700002002329700003502349700003202384700002702416700002902443700002102472773011002493856008302603852000902686655001202695IND60777754720221121051005.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077775472DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-021-00565-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, Bahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0448-321710aGenotype × Environment Interactions and Simultaneous Selection for High Seed Yield and Stability in Winter Rapeseed (Brassica napus) Multi-Environment Trials  ap. 185-196.  aMulti-environment trials have a fundamental role in selecting the better performing genotypes stable across different environments before its commercial release. Thus, the study was carried out to identify high-yielding stable rapeseed genotypes using different parametric and nonparametric statistics involving 11 new advanced genotypes and 2 cultivars. The genotypes were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replications across 12 environments (combination of years and locations) during 2015–2017 growing seasons. The results indicated that genotype, environment and genotype × environment (G × E) effects were significant for seed yield, indicating differential responses of the genotypes to the environments, enabling the stability analysis. According to correlation coefficient and principal components analysis (PCA), the nonparametric measures of Sᵢ⁽²⁾, Sᵢ⁽³⁾, Sᵢ⁽⁶⁾, NPᵢ⁽²⁾, NPᵢ⁽³⁾, NPᵢ⁽⁴⁾ and KR were positively and significantly correlated with mean seed yield and thus these measures can be used for selection of the stable genotypes. In general, based on our results four genotypes, G13, G2, G1 and G5 had higher seed yield and stability than control genotypes (G10 and G11). The genotype G13 with the highest yielding and stability performance is the most recommended as promising genotype for commercial release to farmers for cultivation in cold and moderately cold regions of Iran and other similar environments for adoption.

Compared to the control emulsion, ultrasound treatments for 3, 6 and 9 min significantly decreased the average droplet size (P＜0.05) and produced more stable emulsions with no creaming phenomenon. Ultrasound-induced emulsions had much lower interfacial tension and Turbiscan stability index. Ultrasound treatment significantly enhanced the adsorbed proteins concentration (P＜0.05); moreover, SDS-PAGE showed that the content (band intensity) of αs₁-, αs₂-, and β-casein were increased. Ultrasound treatment led to a decrease in peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance during 14 d of storage. The 6 min of ultrasound-induced emulsion had higher content of interfacial proteins (P＜0.05) than other ultrasound-induced emulsions. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that 6 min of ultrasound treatment created a thicker and more compact interfacial protein films in the SC-stabilized emulsions. Ultrasound treatments improved interfacial properties and oxidative stability of SC-prepared pre-emulsified soybean oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-casein 3acreaming 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3aoxidative stability 3aperoxide value 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium caseinate 3asoybean oil 3asurface tension 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aHigh-intensity ultrasound 0aO/W emulsion 0aCasein 0aLipid oxidation 0aInterfacial film1 aLi, Yan1 aLiu, Junlin,1 aFu, Lei1 aZhao, Ying-Ying1 aZhang, Yan-Yan1 aWang, Yun-Tao1 aBai, Yan-Hong0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.109755-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1097553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011400184300001800298500001500316520183000331592002802161650002102189650002502210650001202235650001502247650001402262650001402276650000902290650001302299650001202312650001002324650002102334650001402355650001502369650001102384650000902395650002302404650001302427650000902440650002202449650001802471650001902489650001102508650001002519650001202529650002202541650002902563650002102592650002002613650001402633650001102647650001902658650002202677650002902699651001002728653001902738700002502757700002102782773011702803856004802920852000902968655001202977IND4467021120221118020412.0120427e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446702112DNAL7 a215737122pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2097-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadejón, Paula10aPasture composition in a trace element-contaminated area: the particular case of Fe and Cd for grazing horses  ap. 2031-2043.  a2019-12-06  aPasture selection by livestock is an essential topic for rangeland management, especially in trace element-contaminated soils. We have studied the composition (nutrients and trace elements) of a grass-based diet from soils affected by a mine spill at different growth stages (October 2008 to May 2009). A diet based on other plants (mainly Compositae species) was also studied (May 2009) for comparison. Faeces and mane hair of horses feeding on these pastures were also analysed. Micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) and potentially toxic trace element (As, Cd, Pb, Tl) concentrations were below the maximum tolerable levels (MTL) for horses, except for Fe (at early growth of pastures) and Cd (in the diet based on ‘other’ plants). Values of potential ingestion of Fe by horses were higher than 10 mg kg body weight − 1 day − 1. Cadmium concentrations in some pasture samples (those composed of Compositae species) were higher than 3 mg kg − 1. Potential toxicity of such Cd levels in pastures is uncertain, since a high disparity of criteria about MTL by cattle exists (between 0.5 and 10 mg kg − 1 diet). Nutrient concentrations were adequate for horses, which could counteract possible harmful effects derived from trace element ingestion. The analyses of excreta and mane hair point to the low risk of toxicity derived from the consumption of these contaminated pastures. However, the ingestion of regenerating pastures (autumnal samples) should be avoided due to the greater risk of ingestion of contaminated soil attached to the plant material. Management of these pastures by grazing requires periodic monitoring. Special attention should be given to Fe and particularly Cd (non-essential element) which accumulates in animal organs, where it could provoke uncertain long-term effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient content 3adevelopmental stages 3agrazing 3aAsteraceae 3anutrients 3aingestion 3arisk 3apastures 3acadmium 3afeces 3arange management 3ageophagia 3amonitoring 3acattle 3asoil 3agrazing management 3atoxicity 3adiet 3along term effects 3aanimal organs 3atrace elements 3ahorses 3ahairs 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFecesxchemistry 2aHairxchemistry 2aHerbivory 2aHorses 2aLeadxanalysis 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 0aSpain 0asoil ingestion1 aDomínguez, Maria T.1 aMurillo, Jose M.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Apr., v. 184, no. 4 p.2031-2043dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2097-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010300162300001600265500002000281520161200301592002801913650001501941650001601956650003001972650000902002650001102011700002102022700002202043773011902065856007302184852000902257655001202266IND60679304620221122043034.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930462DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.132932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGleason, Hadley E.10aMeniscal click in cranial cruciate deficient stifles as a predictor of specific meniscal pathology  ap. 155-159.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive value of meniscal click for specific meniscal tear morphology. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. ANIMALS: Client‐owned dogs (104) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) deficiency treated with stifle arthroscopy (111). METHODS: All stifles underwent a standardized examination for meniscal click before anesthesia (EBA) and during anesthesia (EDA). Presence or absence of a medial meniscal tear and diagnosis of tear morphology were confirmed with arthroscopic examination. RESULTS: Complete CCL tears were noted in 93 dogs, and incompetent partial tears were noted in 18 dogs. Medial meniscal tears were noted in 40.5% (55/111) of dogs, including bucket handle tears (BHT) in 65.6% (36/55) of tears. Frays of the lateral meniscus were noted in 6.3% of dogs (7/111). Examination for meniscal click before anesthesia was 38% sensitive and 94.5% specific, and EDA was 38% sensitive and 98.2% specific for all meniscal tear morphologies. Positive meniscal click at EBA was associated with a meniscal BHT but not with a meniscal non‐BHT (P < .0001 and P = .3515, respectively). Positive meniscal click at EDA was associated with a meniscal BHT but not with a meniscal non‐BHT (P < .0001 and P = .1909, respectively). CONCLUSION: A meniscal click is more commonly associated with a meniscal BHT than with a non‐BHT. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Meniscal tear morphology influences the presence or absence of meniscal click. Because of the high incidence of meniscal disease, this study provides evidence to support joint exploration in the treatment of CCL disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3aarthroscopy 3acranial cruciate ligament 3adogs 3astifle1 aHudson, Caleb C.1 aCerroni, Brittany0 tVeterinary surgery.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.155-159dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.132933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013600165300001800301520083800319592002801157650002201185650001201207650001301219650001301232650002101245650001301266650002101279650001601300653002701316653002501343653002101368653001301389653002601402700001801428700001901446773015201465856007701617852000901694655001201703IND60522256520221121021921.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225652DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarychta, Bartosz10aPhase Transitions and Distortion of [BiCl6]3– Octahedra in (C3H5NH3)3[BiCl6] – DSC and Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction Studies  ap. 1029-1034.  aThe DSC diagram of tris(allylammonium) hexachlorobismuthate(III), (C₃H₅NH₃)₃[BiCl₆], revealed three anomalies at 152, 191 and 299 K. The structure of the salt was determined at 200 and 315 K, below and above the high-temperature phase transition at 299 K. In both phases the crystals are monoclinic. At 200 K the space group is C2/c whereas at 315 K it is C2/m. The structures, at both temperatures, are composed of [BiCl₆]³⁻ octahedra and allylammonium cations. The organic and inorganic moieties are attracted to each other by a network of the N-H. . .Cl hydrogen bonds. The relationship between corresponding parameters of the unit cells has been found. The phase transition at 299 K, of the order-disorder type, is attributed to the ordering of one non-equivalent allylammonium cation in the low-temperature phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acations 3acrystals 3ageometry 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3aphase transition 3atemperature 0aChlorobismuthates(III) 0aAllylammonium Cation 0aPhase Transition 0aDisorder 0aOctahedral Distortion1 aBujak, Maciej1 aZaleski, Jacek0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 59, no. 9 p.1029-1034dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2004-09133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245013800187300001400325500001500339520149800354592002801852650002601880650001501906650002201921650002601943650004001969650000802009650002002017650002602037650001002063650001502073650002402088650002302112650001402135650003002149650005002179650003502229650002802264650004302292650003602335650002102371650001502392650002902407650003702436650001102473650000902484650002002493650006002513650005002573650004602623650003002669650004202699653001302741700001702754700001902771700001602790700001502806700002402821700001802845700001902863773009602882856008402978990002303062852000903085655001203094IND60092192020221120114818.0141103e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009219202DNAL7 a236930772pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yongqing10aInduction of DNA damage and ATF3 by retigeric acid B, a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor, promotes apoptosis in prostate cancer cells  ap. 66-76.  a2019-12-06  aRetigeric acid B (RB) has been reported to exhibit its anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we found that RB significantly inhibited activity of topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα), leading to remarkable DNA damage in prostate cancer (PCa) cells as evidenced by a strong induction of γH2AX and DNA fragmentation. Activation of ATM and ATR sequentially led to induction of phospho-Chk1/2 and phospho-Cdc25 in response to RB. Blockade of ATM/ATR signaling resulted in the attenuation of RB-induced γH2AX, and partially rescued RB-mediated cell death. RB treatment also resulted in inactivation of DNA repair proteins such as phospho-BRCA1, impairment of HR, and NHEJ repair as indicated by DNA end-joining assays. Meanwhile, a stress-responsive gene activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was noted for its predominant expression in response to RB-induced DNA damage. Knockdown of ATF3 inhibited the RB-induced expression changes of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes such as DR5, DDIT4, CDC25A, GADD45A, and partially blocked RB-mediated inhibition on cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, suggesting the crucial involvement of ATF3 in this event. Microarray data displayed that RB caused changes of genes required for damaged-DNA binding and repair, as well as ATF3 and its target genes. Our data firstly demonstrated that RB was a novel DNA Topo II inhibitor and triggered cell death by inducing DNA damage and stress-response, suggesting a promising anticancer agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3amicroarray technology 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aDNA 3astress response 3aantineoplastic agents 3agenes 3aDNA repair 3aprostatic neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aActivating Transcription Factor 3xphysiology 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleus 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAtaxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDNA Damage 2aDNA Repairxdrug effects 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhosphorylation 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism. 2aTopoisomerase II Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aTriterpenesxpharmacology 2aTumor Suppressor Proteinsxmetabolism 0aproteins1 aGao, Fengbin1 aJiang, Hanming1 aNiu, Leilei1 aBi, Yiling1 aYoung, Charles Y.F.1 aYuan, Huiqing1 aLou, Hongxiang0 tCancer letters.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 337, no. 1 p.66-76dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011600164500001900280520146100299592002801760650001001788650001401798650001001812650001301822650002001835650002101855650002301876650000901899650000901908650002101917650001701938650001701955651001201972700001901984700002602003700002002029773012002049856007902169852000902248655001202257IND60738796520221119113320.0210524e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073879652DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120503742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPernat, Nadja 10aBuzzing Homes: Using Citizen Science Data to Explore the Effects of Urbanization on Indoor Mosquito Communities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrbanization has been associated with a loss of overall biodiversity and a simultaneous increase in the abundance of a few species that thrive in urban habitats, such as highly adaptable mosquito vectors. To better understand how mosquito communities differ between levels of urbanization, we analyzed mosquito samples from inside private homes submitted to the citizen science project ‘Mückenatlas’. Applying two urbanization indicators based on soil sealing and human population density, we compared species composition and diversity at, and preferences towards, different urbanization levels. Species composition between groups of lowest and highest levels of urbanization differed significantly, which was presumably caused by reduced species richness and the dominance of synanthropic mosquito species in urban areas. The genus Anopheles was frequently submitted from areas with a low degree of urbanization, Aedes with a moderate degree, and Culex and Culiseta with a high degree of urbanization. Making use of citizen science data, this first study of indoor mosquito diversity in Germany demonstrated a simplification of communities with increasing urbanization. The dominance of vector-competent species in urban areas poses a potential risk of epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases that can only be contained by a permanent monitoring of mosquitoes and by acquiring a deeper knowledge about how anthropogenic activities affect vector ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes 3aAnopheles 3aCulex 3aCuliseta 3acitizen science 3ahuman population 3apopulation density 3arisk 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3asynanthropes 3aurbanization 3aGermany1 aKampen, Helge 1 aJeschke, Jonathan M.,1 aWerner, Doreen 0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120503743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018500161300002000346520042400366592002800790650002500818650002300843650003600866650001700902650001500919650001500934700002000949700001800969700002000987700001901007700001901026700002001045700002101065700001901086773013601105856007401241852000901315655001201324IND60660274920221120101027.0190823e20140826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027492DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04477k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarada, Takunori10aPlasmon resonance-enhanced circularly polarized luminescence of self-assembled meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin–surfactant complexes in interaction with Ag nanoparticles  ap. 11169-11172.  aThe chiroptical properties of an anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) complexed with cationic surfactants were enhanced by interaction with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in acidic solution.

In marinades on the microbial contamination of the breast chicken fillets infected with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) was also introduced individually or collectively to treat bacterial infections on chicken fillets. Treatment with EOs, ACP, or their combination demonstrated significant reductions in the bacterial growth, although the addition of ACP could lower the cell counts to less than 3.5 log CFU/g. Relative to S. aureus, margination with EOs conferred more sensitivity to Gram-negative E. coli upon exposure to ACP. Exposure of the marinated fillets to EOs, ACP, and their combination significantly decreased DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) however lipid oxidation did not change. The addition of EOs increased sensorial values to a great extent, while on the contrary ACP-treated samples showed reduced scores of odor, flavor, and overall acceptability, not lesser than those of controls. The results revealed that combined treatment reduced the microbial numbers on breast chicken fillets with no undesirable effects on odor, flavor, and overall acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAllium sativum 3aCrocus sativus 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aZataria multiflora 3abacterial growth 3abacterial infections 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3aessential oils 3afillets 3aflavor 3alipid peroxidation 3amarinating 3amicrobial contamination 3anonthermal processing 3aodors 0aAtmospheric cold plasma 0aEssential oil 0aChicken fillet 0aMarinades1 aHosseini, Motaharesadat1 aSharifan, Anoosheh0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.109759-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1097593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245008500196300001400281500002000295520170100315592002802016650002402044650001102068650001402079650001802093650001102111650001502122650002002137650002502157650001202182650001802194700002202212700001902234700002302253773011702276856007302393852000902466655001202475IND60679304820221120152545.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930482DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.132862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurket, Elyse1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9391-423910aMeta‐analysis of the effects of lidocaine on postoperative reflux in the horse  ap. 44-52.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of lidocaine at reducing incidence of postoperative reflux (POR) in horses by using quantitative statistical analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic meta‐analytical review. SAMPLE POPULATION: Studies on horses undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for small intestinal lesions, identified by systematic search between 2001 and 2017. METHODS: A search with PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed, followed by secondary searches of veterinary trade journals and bibliographies of relevant articles. The primary outcome measure for this study was the effect of lidocaine therapy on the odds of POR. Subgroup analysis assessed included the timing of lidocaine therapy, incidence of mortality, and incidence of repeat celiotomy. A meta‐analysis was performed with a random effects model, with the effect size calculated as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: Among 1933 peer reviewed publications that met the initial search criteria, 12 relevant studies were available for analysis. Lidocaine was associated with an increased incidence of diagnosis of POR (OR 6.3, 95% CI [1.4, 27.0], P = .01). Horses treated with lidocaine were more likely to survive to discharge (OR 6.8, 95% CI [3.9, 11.7], P < .01). CONCLUSION: Lidocaine was associated with an increased survival rate in horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy for small intestinal disease according to this meta‐analysis of the recent literature. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This body of published evidence provides support to administer lidocaine in horses to improve survival rather than preventing POR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3ahorses 3alidocaine 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3asmall intestine 3astatistical analysis 3asurgery 3asurvival rate1 aGillen, Alexandra1 aKottwitz, Jack1 aMunsterman, Amelia0 tVeterinary surgery.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.44-52dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.132863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011600160300002000276520038700296592002800683650001100711650002400722650001900746650001400765650001800779650001300797650001700810650001400827650001900841650001300860650001700873700001900890700001700909700001900926700001500945700001400960773013500974856007401109852000901183655001201192IND60660275020221120100859.0190823e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027502DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04479g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yuanbiao10aBimetallic alloy nanocrystals encapsulated in ZIF-8 for synergistic catalysis of ethylene oxidative degradation  ap. 10115-10117.  aHighly dispersed PtPd alloy nanocrystals (NCs) were firstly successfully encapsulated in microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 (PtPd@ZIF-8) with tunable compositions by a “bottle around ship” approach.

Analysis of Mycobacterium smegmatis subcellular fractions and spheroplasts showed that LAM and lipomannan (LM) were primarily found in a cell wall-enriched subcellular fraction and correlated with the presence (or absence) of the mycolic acids in spheroplast preparations, suggesting that LAM and LM are primarily associated with the putative outer membrane of mycobacteria. During the course of these studies significant changes in the LAM/LM content of the cell wall were noted relative to the age of the culture. The LAM content of the M. smegmatis cell wall was dramatically reduced as the bacilli approached stationary phase, whereas LM, mycolic acid, and arabinogalactan content appeared to be unchanged. In addition, cell morphology and acid-fast staining characteristics showed variations with growth phase of the bacteria. In the logarithmic phase, the bacteria were found to be classic rod-shaped acid-fast bacilli, while in the stationary phase M. smegmatis lost the characteristic rod shape and developed a punctate acid-fast staining pattern with carbolfuchsin. The number of viable bacteria was independent of LAM content and phenotype. Taken together, the results presented here suggest that LAM is primarily localized with the mycolic acids in the cell wall and that the cellular concentration of LAM in M. smegmatis is selectively modulated with the growth phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium smegmatis 3aacids 3aarabinogalactans 3abacteria 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aphenotype 3asubcellular fractions1 aDinadayala, Premkumar1 aRyan, Gavin J.1 aLenaerts, Anne J.1 aSchenkel, Alan R.1 aCrick, Dean C.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 193, no. 20 p.5802-5809dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.05299-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011100189300001300300520097300313592002801286650001501314650003001329650001401359650001601373650002101389650001101410650001101421650001301432650001701445650001501462650001201477650002301489650000901512650002301521650001101544650002101555650001101576650001401587650001301601650002801614650001101642650000901653650004001662650002801702650003001730650002801760650001101788650002101799650003201820650004001852650003901892700002301931773009501954856008402049990002302133852000902156655001202165IND60092192220221120114941.0141103e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009219222DNAL7 a237273712pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadhwa, Saurabh10aD-penicillamine and other low molecular weight thiols: Review of anticancer effects and related mechanisms  ap. 8-21.  aLow molecular weight thiols (LMWTs) like N-acetyl cysteine, D-penicillamine, captopril, Disulfiram and Amifostine, etc. have been used as chemo-preventive agents. Recent studies have reported cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in several different types of cancer cells following treatment with several LMWTs. Cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of LMWTs may involve interaction of the thiol group with cellular lipids, proteins, intermediates or enzymes. Some of the mechanisms that have been proposed include a p53 mediated apoptosis, thiyl radical induced DNA damage, membrane damage through lipid peroxidation, anti-angiogenic effects induced by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes and angiostatin generation. LMWTs are strong chelators of transition metals like copper, nickel, zinc, iron and cobalt and may cause metal co-factor depletion resulting in cytotoxicity. Oxidation of thiol group can also generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3achelating agents 3acobalt 3acopper 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3adisulfiram 3aenzymes 3agrowth retardation 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3athiols 3azinc 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aFree Radicalsxmetabolism 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMolecular Weight 2aPenicillaminexpharmacology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxpharmacology1 aMumper, Russell J.0 tCancer letters.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 337, no. 1 p.8-21dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010400162300001400266500001100280520062100291592002800912596005700940596005500997596004201052596003401094596003401128596003401162596004601196650001301242650001901255650001601274650001501290650001401305650000901319650001301328650001501341700001901356700002101375773011701396856007301513852000901586655001201595IND60679304920221120152409.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930492DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.133322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, D.q(David),10aNear‐infrared imaging and optical coherence tomography for intraoperative visualization of tumors  ap. 33-43.  aREVIEW  aSurgical excision is the foundation of treatment for early‐stage solid tumors in man and companion animals. Complete excision with appropriate margins of surrounding tumor‐free tissue is crucial to survival. Intraoperative imaging allows real‐time visualization of tumors, assessment of surgical margins, and, potentially, lymph nodes and satellite metastatic lesions, allowing surgeons to perform complete tumor resections while sparing surrounding vital anatomic structures. This Review will focus on the use of near‐infrared imaging and optical coherence tomography for intraoperative tumor visualization.  aPublisher supplied data  a02204cAmerican Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation  cMari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology Research  aD16FE‐034cMorris Animal Foundation  aCA163256cNIH Clinical Center  aCA193556cNIH Clinical Center  aEB017828cNIH Clinical Center  cUnited States National Science Foundation 3aexcision 3aimage analysis 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3apets 3asurgeons 3atomography1 aSinghal, Sunil1 aSelmic, Laura E.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.33-43dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.133323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01239naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010500157300001600262520024500278592002800523650001600551650002300567650002300590650001800613700012200631773012600753856007300879852000900952655001200961IND60657590820221120103545.0190816e20050117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759082DNAL7 a10.1039/b412090f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chih-Hsiu10aSynthesis of anthracene ethers from anthracene methyl ethers via an acid-catalyzed exchange reaction  ap. 504-506.  aSelective synthesis of anthracene ethers was achieved under mild conditions via an acid-catalyzed ether–ether exchange reaction and its scope and limitations, as well as its potential in synthesizing anthracene-based crown ethers, tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3amethyl ethers1 aRadhakrishnanPresent address: Department of Chemistry, Saraswathi Narayanan College, Madurai-625022, India., Krishnan0 tChemical communications.g2005 Jan. 17, , no. 4 p.504-506dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412090f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004900113040001800162100002000180245005900200300001600259500000900275520171700284592002802001650001302029650001802042650002002060650001702080650002002097700001802117700001702135700001902152773014702171852000902318856011202327856009602439961001302535655001202548IND8802916020221118150838.0191125e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880291602DNAL7 a10113/178262hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200030037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusscher, W. J.10aSoil and Plant Response to Three Subsoiling Implements  ap. 804-808.  aepub  aMany Southeastern Coastal Plain soils require deep (>0.45 m) inrow tillage or subsoiling to disrupt dense tillage/traffic pans and/or eluvial (E) horizons. Three subsoiling implements [Super Seeder (SS), ParaTill (PT), and Kelly (KE)] were compared on Norfolk (Typic Paleudult) loamy sand to assess their effectiveness in developing and maintaining a proper rooting environment for corn (Zea mays L.). Soil strength (cone index) for the implements was evaluated with and without conventional surface tillage (disking). All three subsoiling implements effectively disrupted the E horizon regardless of surface tillage, but the 67% stand establishment in nondisked treatments was significantly lower than for disked treatments (92%). However, yields were not significantly different. Significant differences in soil strength were measured among subsoiling implements at the beginning of each growing season. In 1985 mean profile soil strength was lower (P ≤ 0.10) for SS and PT than for KE. In 1986, soil strength was lower (P ≤ 0.10) for SS than either PT or KE. The consistent difference between SS and KE occurred because SS disrupted a larger area than the thinner-shanked KE. Nondisked treatments had mean soil strength that was 0.32 MPa lower within the row than disked treatments, but disked treatments had mean soil strength that was 0.37 MPa lower between the rows. Soil strength results suggest that Coastal Plain soils, which have been subsoiled, are less likely to restrict root development regardless of implement with, or without, prior surface tillage.

One of these, A. galapagensis has been reported from numerous hydrothermal vents and methane seeps across the Pacific Ocean. Here, a collection of Amphisamytha from a range of Pacific habitats, as well as Amathys lutzi from Atlantic hydrothermal vents, were studied using morphology and DNA sequences from mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and nuclear (18S rRNA) genes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a deep-sea clade comprised of the previously recognized Amphisamytha species, and three lineages that are treated as new species. The morphologically distinct Amathys lutzi was nested within Amphisamytha and the monotypic Amathys is treated as a junior synonym of Amphisamytha, with a resulting name change to Amphisamytha lutzi comb. nov. A revision of the other Amphisamytha species, the description of three new species, and a key are provided. The geographic range of the ‘cosmopolitan’ A. galapagensis is restricted to hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise and the Galápagos Ridge. Amphisamytha fauchaldi, previously only known from sedimented hydrothermal vents of the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California, Mexico), is recorded from cold seeps off the coasts of Costa Rica and Oregon. Amphisamytha carldarei sp. nov. is described from hydrothermal vents of the northeast Pacific (Juan de Fuca), while A. jacksoni sp. nov. spans much of the East Pacific Rise and is sympatric with A. galapagensis for part of its range. Amphisamytha julianeae sp. nov. is found at western Pacific vent systems in sympatry with A. vanuatuensis. Relaxed molecular clock analyses were calibrated using the vicariant event involving the Farallon-Pacific Ridge in the northern Pacific Ocean. This provides mean dates for the origin of the deep-sea Amphisamytha clade at 44 or 55 million years ago, and the separation of the Pacific–Atlantic sister-species pair at 13 or 21 million years ago, depending on the tree used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnelida 3aDNA 3acoasts 3acold 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amethane 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asympatry 3aCosta Rica 3aGulf of California 3aMexico 3aOregon 3aPacific Ocean 0amolecular clock 0apolychaete 0ataxonomic revision1 aRousset, Vincent1 aPleijel, Fredrik1 aChevaldonné, Pierre1 aVrijenhoek, Robert C.1 aRouse, Greg W.0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 11, no. 1 p.35-65dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:J000000156x1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2013.772925  aDNAL 7aarticle01055naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010100158300001800259520011900277592002800396650002300424650001300447650001500460650000900475700002100484700002300505700001400528773012900542856007300671852000900744655001200753IND60657590920221120094239.0190816e20041214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759092DNAL7 a10.1039/b412111b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivieri, Monica10aMultiple functional group cooperation in phosphate diester cleavage promoted by Zn(ii) complexes  ap. 2862-2863.  aZn(ii) complexes bearing multiple auxiliary organic groups greatly accelerate the cleavage of a phosphate diester.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3aphosphates 3azinc1 aMancin, Fabrizio1 aTonellato, Umberto1 aChin, Jik0 tChemical communications.g2004 Dec. 14, , no. 24 p.2862-2863dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412111b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245007200166300001800238520040200256592002800658650001600686650001300702650001300715650001200728650001400740653002700754653001800781653002200799653001700821700001600838700002500854773013900879856007701018852000901095655001201104IND60522256920221121021938.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225692DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, F.

The result shows that the starch granules of rice of low amylose content (AC) have more pores and cavities, which directly led to the swelling of rice starch granule. With the change in temperature, the changes in intensity and width of the IR bands showed that the variation in proportion area of crystalline to non‐crystalline was related to AC of rice. According to the interpretative sensitivity of the data obtained, XRD method was suggested adequate for characterizing the pasting property of different quality of rice. Besides, DSC method showed the AC was not relevant to pasting temperature and enthalpy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acooking 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3apasting properties 3arice 3arice starch 3astarch granules 3atemperature1 aZhu, Bo1 aDu, Xuezhu1 aLi, Bin1 aWu, Xiaofang1 aWang, Shishuai0 tStärke =.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 11 p.846-854dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201100177  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245012800200520094500328592002801273650001601301650001201317650002101329650001401350650001001364650002001374650001701394650001801411650001801429650002001447650001201467650001301479650001801492650004801510650001401558650001401572650001101586650001201597653002201609653001801631653001701649653002601666653001501692700001901707700001701726700001801743700001601761700005501777773013601832856008101968852000902049655001202058IND60679903820221122104757.0200628e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1090002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yuge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6489-657712aA novel fat replacer composed by gelatin and soluble dietary fibers from black bean coats with its application in meatballs  aDifferent edible composite gels were produced by soluble dietary fibers from black bean coats (SDF) and gelatin cross linked by calcium chloride and/or transglutaminase (TGase), which were named as IPN and semi-IPN. The gels were added to produce low-fat meatballs and compared with the control samples (20% fat added). The effects of the SDF-gelatin composite gels on cooking yield, shrinkage, color and texture of low-fat meatballs were detected. Addition of composite gels increased the content of moisture, ash, protein, Na, and Ca. Meanwhile, the composite gels had significant impact on the parameters of the L*(brightness), a*(redness) and b*(yellowness) of meatballs. The composite gels reduced the hardness and chewiness, and increased the springiness of meatballs except for SDF-semi-IPN. The results suggested that the novel composed gels with cross-linking structure could be developed as ideal fat replacers in food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablack beans 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3achewiness 3acolor 3acooking quality 3acrosslinking 3adietary fiber 3afat replacers 3afood processing 3agelatin 3ahardness 3alipid content 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aseed coat 3ashrinkage 3asodium 3atexture 0aLow-fat meatballs 0aComposite gel 0aFat replacer 0aSoluble dietary fiber 0aBlack bean1 aFang, Huicheng1 aHuo, Tianyou1 aSun, Xiangjun1 aGong, Qiang1 aYu, Liangli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6497-08640 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Mar., v. 122 p.109000-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1090003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245009900205300001800304520151100322592002801833650001001861650002501871650002501896650001801921650002801939650001401967650001601981650001101997650002502008650001302033650001302046650002902059650002802088650002502116650003002141650001002171650002002181650000902201650001202210650001502222650002402237650001302261650003602274700001802310700001902328700002002347700001902367700001802386700001602404700001702420700001302437700002002450773012502470856007402595852000902669655001202678IND60639966320221119003556.0190503e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996632DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00700k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHungThese authors contributed equally to this work., Wei-Lun10aProtective effects of theasinensin A against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in mice  ap. 3276-3287.  aTheasinensins have been identified as a major group of unique catechin dimers mainly found in oolong tea and black tea. Among several types of theasinensins, theasinensin A (TSA), an epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) dimer with an R-biphenyl bond, is the most abundant theasinensin prevalent in oolong tea. Previous studies have reported that TSA exhibits antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about the hepatoprotective effect of TSA. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSA on carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. After intraperitoneal injection of CCl₄ for eight weeks, histological lesions in the liver tissue and elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were found in mice. Conversely, oral administration of TSA relieved CCl₄-induced liver injury as well as ameliorated liver functions. Our immunohistochemical staining results revealed that collagen deposition was profoundly reduced due to supplementation with TSA. In addition, we also found that hepatic α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression was suppressed through the inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Taken together, our current findings suggest that TSA may serve as a potent bioactive constituent from oolong tea that acts against liver fibrosis through the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3ablack tea 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acatechin 3acollagen 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amice 3amuscles 3aoolong tea 3aoral administration 3astaining 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aYang, Guliang1 aWang, Yu-Chuan1 aChiou, Yi-Shiou1 aTung, Yen-Chen1 aYang, Meei-Ju1 aWang, Bi-Ni1 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aWang, Yu1 aPan, Min-Hsiung0 tFood & function.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 8, no. 9 p.3276-3287dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00700k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015100161300002000312520024000332592002800572650001600600650002700616650002300643650002300666650002300689700002000712700001600732700001900748773013700767856007500904852000900979655001200988IND60659075320221122063559.0190827e20110920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065907532DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14043d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirakawa, Seiji10aDiastereo- and enantioselective conjugate addition of α-substituted nitroacetates to maleimides under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions  ap. 10557-10559.  aHighly diastereo- and enantioselective conjugate addition of α-substituted nitroacetates to maleimides under base-free neutral phase-transfer conditions was developed for the synthesis of α,α-disubstituted α-amino acid derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aenantioselectivity1 aTerao, Shogo J.1 aHe, Rongjun1 aMaruoka, Keiji0 tChemical communications.g2011 Sept. 20, v. 47, no. 38 p.10557-10559dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc14043d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245008700187300001600274520076400290592002801054650001901082650003501101650000901136650001101145650001501156650000901171650000901180650001401189650002801203650001101231650004301242650001201285650005001297650002401347650001501371650004901386650001101435650000901446650002601455650004801481650005701529650003001586700002201616700001801638700001801656700001801674700001901692773009801711856008401809990002301893852000901916655001201925IND60092192620221120095444.0141103e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009219262DNAL7 a237268412pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Ting-Hui10amiR-211 promotes the progression of head and neck carcinomas by targeting TGFβRII  ap. 115-124.  amiR-211 up-regulation and transforming growth factor-β type II receptor (TGFβRII) down-regulation are associated with poor prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). miR-211 directly targets TGFβRII with the miR-211-TGFβRII-c-Myc axis promoting HNSCC progression. An inverse correlation of miR-211 and TGFβRII expression was found in metastatic HNSCC samples. After 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide induction, more severe epithelial tumorigenesis was detected on K14-miR-211 transgenic mouse dorsal tongues. Human metastatic lesions and mouse tongue tumors showed increased nuclear c-Myc expression. A novel role for miR-211 in the regulation of TGFβRII and c-Myc during tumorigenesis being revealed should help to develop anti-HNSCC therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahead 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneck 3aprognosis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atongue 2a4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxidexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxetiologyxgenetics. 2aDisease Progression 2aGenes, myc 2aHead and Neck Neoplasmsxetiologyxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMicroRNAsxphysiology 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgenetics. 2aReceptors, Transforming Growth Factor betaxgenetics 2aSmad3 Proteinxmetabolism1 aYang, Cheng-Chieh1 aLiu, Chung-Ji1 aLui, Mann-Tin1 aLin, Shu-Chun1 aZhang, Guowei,0 tCancer letters.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 337, no. 1 p.115-124dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008200157300002000239520028600259592002800545650002700573650002300600650002300623700002800646700001900674700001800693700003000711700002800741700001600769773013500785856007500920852000900995655001201004IND60659075520221122063609.0190827e20111004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065907552DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14048e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTa, Van-Thao10aCharacterization of the mixed self-assembled monolayer at the molecular scale  ap. 11261-11263.  aThe mixed SAM obtained by the self-assembly of the monothiolated calix[4]crown-5 receptor 1 and the subsequent addition of the thiolated alkylferrocene guest 3 was characterized at the molecular scale by the favorable receptor–guest interactions by using cyclic voltammetry (CV).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions1 aNimse, Satish Balasaheb1 aSong, Keum-Soo1 aKim, Junghoon1 aSayyed, Danishmalik Rafiq1 aNguyễn, Văn Thuận,1 aKim, Taisun0 tChemical communications.g2011 Oct. 4, v. 47, no. 40 p.11261-11263dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc14048e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245010000157300002000257500001900277520133700296592002801633650001301661650000801674650001501682650002201697650002101719650001901740650001501759650002401774650001301798650001101811650001701822650001001839650002401849650001801873650002001891653002801911653005601939653002801995653002602023653001802049700001702067700001802084700005402102773014202156856007802298852000902376655001202385IND60711364320221122222146.0200923e20200825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c095182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Tao10aNanofibrous Aerogels with Vertically Aligned Microchannels for Efficient Solar Steam Generation  ap. 42686-42695.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUtilizing solar energy to evaporate seawater or sewage to improve water quality is an environment-friendly and sustainable water treatment technology, which has been widely concerned. However, there are still many challenges for efficient solar vapor generation, such as incapable free floating, low water-transfer rates, low energy efficiency, serious salt precipitation, and short service life. Herein, photothermal conversion nanofibrous aerogels (PTCNFAs) with vertically aligned microchannels inside are fabricated. Because of the orderly framework structure and the good hydrophilicity, the PTCNFAs show excellent underwater compressive fatigue durability (nearly no plastic deformation after 50 compressive cycles) and water-transfer rate (0.5 cm s–¹ in the first second). Furthermore, the surface temperature of the PTCNFAs could rise from 28 to 94 °C in air, after being irradiated for 30 s by 1 sun. Benefiting from the excellent mechanical properties, high water-transfer rates, and outstanding photothermal properties, the PTCNFAs are more convenient in application and exhibit an efficient solar water evaporation rate (2.89 kg m–² h–¹), while the energy efficiency under 1 sun is about 90.3%. This work provides a new approach to design and fabricate the solar steam generation materials for water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aair 3adurability 3aenergy efficiency 3aevaporation rate 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofibers 3aplastic deformation 3aseawater 3asewage 3asolar energy 3asteam 3asurface temperature 3awater quality 3awater treatment 0amelt-spinning nanofiber 0avertically aligned microchannel-structured aerogels 0aunderwater superelastic 0asolar steam generator 0afree floating1 aChen, Jiahui1 aZhao, Qinghua1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8139-85020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 12, no. 38 p.42686-42695dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c095183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245013300199300001600332500001900348500002000367520174100387592002802128596009702156650002202253650002502275650001502300650000902315650001602324700002202340700001802362700005602380700006102436773013202497856007302629852000902702655001202711IND60694348620221122000749.0200513e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069434862DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.135952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagmayer, Andres1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5840-235010aLimited mass‐independent individual variation in resting metabolic rate in a wild population of snow voles (Chionomys nivalis)  ap. 608-618.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResting metabolic rate (RMR) is a potentially important axis of physiological adaptation to the thermal environment. However, our understanding of the causes and consequences of individual variation in RMR in the wild is hampered by a lack of data, as well as analytical challenges. RMR measurements in the wild are generally characterized by large measurement errors and a strong dependency on mass. The latter is problematic when assessing the ability of RMR to evolve independently of mass. Mixed models provide a powerful and flexible tool to tackle these challenges, but they have rarely been used to estimate repeatability of mass‐independent RMR from field data. We used respirometry to obtain repeated measurements of RMR in a long‐term study population of snow voles (Chionomys nivalis) inhabiting an environment subject to large circadian and seasonal fluctuations in temperature. Using both uni‐ and bivariate mixed models, we quantify individual repeatability in RMR and decompose repeatability into mass‐dependent and mass‐independent components, while accounting for measurement error. RMR varies among individuals, that is, is repeatable (R = .46) and strongly co‐varies with BM. Indeed, much of the repeatability of RMR is attributable to individual variation in BM, and the repeatability of mass‐independent RMR is reduced by 41% to R = .27. These empirical results suggest that the evolutionary potential of RMR independent of mass may be severely constrained. This study illustrates how to leverage bivariate mixed models to model field data for metabolic traits, correct for measurement error and decompose the relative importance of mass‐dependent and mass‐independent physiological variation.  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A_141110cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aChionomys nivalis 3aevolutionary biology 3ametabolism 3asnow 3atemperature1 aCamenisch, Glauco1 aCanale, Cindy1 aPostma, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0856-12941 aBonnet, Timothée1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7186-52880 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2020 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.608-618dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.135953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245017100175300001800346520174100364592002802105650002202133650002502155650001202180650001002192650001602202650002202218650001702240650001502257650002202272650001702294650001302311650002002324650001002344700002402354700002202378700002602400700002102426773013202447856008202579852000902661655001202670IND60738270020221121083143.0210522e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073827002DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-021-00983-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohsin, Sayed Mohammad10aProtective role of tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under cadmium stress via enhancement of antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems  ap. 1043-1057.  aCadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal and an environmental pollutant that significantly reduces plant growth and productivity. Proper management can ameliorate dysfunction and improve the plant growth and productivity exposed to Cd. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the protective role of the fungicides tebuconazole (TEB) and trifloxystrobin (TRI) in helping wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Norin 61) seedlings to tolerate Cd. Five-day-old hydroponically grown seedlings were allowed to mild (0.25 mM CdCl₂) and severe (0.5 mM CdCl₂) Cd stress separately and with the fungicides (2.75 µM TEB + 1.0 µM TRI) for the next four days. Compared to control, the level of H₂O₂ in the seedlings exposed to mild and severe Cd stress alone increased by 81 and 112%, respectively. The accumulation of Cd also increased in the wheat seedlings along with declining mineral nutrients under Cd stress. The protective effect of TEB and TRI was observed with the enhancement of the antioxidant defense and methylglyoxalase systems and reduction in oxidative damage. Applying TEB and TRI reduced MDA (by 9 and 18%), EL (by 21 and 17%), MG (by 12 and 17%), and LOX activity (by 37 and 27%), respectively, relative to Cd stress alone. Cadmium uptake also decreased in the shoots (by 48 and 50%, respectively) and roots (by 23 and 25%, respectively) of the fungicide-treated wheat seedlings under mild and severe Cd stress, relative to stress alone. These results indicate the exogenous application of TEB and TRI is a promising approach to improve Cd tolerance in wheat plants. Further investigation is needed under field conditions and for other crop species to determine the Cd-tolerance induced by TEB and TRI application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantioxidant activity 3acadmium 3acrops 3ahydroponics 3amolecular biology 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3aprotective effect 3atebuconazole 3atoxicity 3atrifloxystrobin 3awheat1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza1 aParvin, Khursheda1 aShahadat Hossain, Md.1 aFujita, Masayuki0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.1043-1057dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-00983-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016900164500001900333520185600352592002802208650001302236650002402249650001902273650001302292650001902305650000902324650002302333650002602356650001402382650001602396650002102412650002502433650001702458651001002475653002002485653002502505653001602530653002902546653001802575700001702593700001402610700001802624700005702642700001802699700002702717773011402744856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60700803920221119154422.0200719e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2020.1261182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiquan10aYield benefits from replacing chemical fertilizers with manure under water deficient conditions of the winter wheat – summer maize system in the North China Plain  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecycling of livestock manure in agroecosystems has been shown to improve crop yields, increase resource use efficiency, and reduce adverse environmental consequences from intensive crop-livestock systems. However, such effects have not been well explored for the widely planted winter wheat - summer maize double cropping system in the North China Plain, especially under deficit irrigation. A three years split-plot field experiment was established with and without irrigation (at wheat jointing stage) as main plots, and with chemical fertilizer N (Fc), manure N (Fm), and 50 % chemical fertilizer N + 50 % manure N (Fc + m) using the same amount of N input as sub-plots. Irrigation increased wheat yield significantly by 8–19 % in the normal years (2015/2016 and 2016/2017, p < 0.05) and 124 % in the dry year (2017/2018, p < 0.01), which was attributed to the higher spike number and aboveground biomass. Specifically, irrigation increased aboveground biomass before (p < 0.01) and after anthesis (p = 0.08), as well as the fruiting efficiency (grain number per spike weight at anthesis, p < 0.01) and grain number per unit area (p < 0.01), resulting in increased wheat grain yield. However, irrigation in the wheat season reduced maize yield significantly (p < 0.05) by 5 % in the normal years. The maize yield of Fc+m was 7 % higher than that of Fc under irrigated conditions (p < 0.05). Overall, manure application alone had a higher annual yield without irrigation, while mixed fertilization yielded better and earned more (both were 6% higher than Fc) with irrigation. In conclusion, the annual yield of the winter wheat - summer maize system can be maintained or even increased by replacing mineral N with manure, suggesting multiple benefits from integrating manure application into cereal-based cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaboveground biomass 3aagroecosystems 3aagronomy 3aanimal manures 3acorn 3adeficit irrigation 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3amanure spreading 3anitrogen fertilizers 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aYield component 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0aZea mays L. 0aSpike partitioning index 0aHarvest index1 aYang, Yadong1 aZhao, Jie1 aNie, Jiangwen1 aZang, Huadong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2008-143X1 aZeng, Zhaohai1 aOlesen, Jørgen Eivind0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2020 Sept., v. 119 p.126118-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2020.1261183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011600166300001800282520166400300592002801964650000801992650001502000650001602015650001402031650001602045650001202061650000902073700001702082700002002099773011702119856008102236852000902317655001202326IND60440627920221119180936.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044062792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4490-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Chanwen10aMeasurement of the movement parameters of saltating sand over a flat sand bed using a high-speed digital camera  ap. 4865-4874.  aThe movement parameters of saltating sand are basic physical characteristics in aeolian physics, but remain poorly understood because of limitations in the available measurement technology. High-speed photography provides an efficient method to track the trajectories of saltating particles. From a digital recording of the trajectory, movement parameters can be derived. However, accurate and quick reconstruction of particle trajectories from video images is not yet possible, as this requires the use of prohibitively laborious manual methods. In addition, light reflection from the bed decreases contrast between near-surface particles and the bed. This makes saltation information near the surface difficult to obtain, even though this data is vitally important for studying particle entrainment processes and the mechanisms by which particles leave the surface. In this paper, we describe a novel method for tracking the trajectories of saltating particles. Using motion-detection algorithms based on the subtraction of consecutive images and dynamic thresholds, we developed a new series of high-contrast images from the original images. We then tracked particles by combining a manual operation with a computerized operation, after which a polynomial fitting method could be used to obtain various movement parameters of the saltating particles, such as the lift-off velocity and angle, impact velocity and angle, characteristic length and height, and instantaneous velocity vector at each point in the trajectory. The new method can quickly and accurately calculate the movement parameters of saltating sand particles in air and near the bed surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3amethodology 3aparticles 3aphotography 3aphysics 3asand1 aDong, Zhibao1 aZhang, Zhengcai0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.4865-4874dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4490-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011400176300001600290520131100306592002801617650001601645650001701661650002401678650002201702650003001724650001801754650001901772650001801791650003601809650002901845653001901874653001901893653002901912653002201941653003401963653003501997700002902032700002302061773012302084856008902207852000902296655001202305IND60543424220221122101015.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBricker, Terry M.10aRecent advances in the use of mass spectrometry to examine structure/function relationships in photosystem II  ap. 227-246.  aTandem mass spectrometry often coupled with chemical modification techniques, is developing into increasingly important tool in structural biology.

In this review, we will present a brief introduction to Photosystem II, tandem mass spectrometry and protein modification techniques that have been used to examine the photosystem. We will then discuss a number of recent case studies that have used these techniques to address open questions concerning PS II. These include the nature of subunit–subunit interactions within the phycobilisome, the interaction of phycobilisomes with Photosystem I and the Orange Carotenoid Protein, the location of CyanoQ, PsbQ and PsbP within Photosystem II, and the identification of phosphorylation and oxidative modification sites within the photosystem.

Both morphological and molecular data revealed a high level of inter and intra specific variations among the accessions. Accordingly, 90.49% of amplified fragments were polymorphic among the accessions with the mean values of 0.37 for polymorphic information content (PIC), 3.31 for resolving power (RP), and 1.95 for marker index (MI). The phylogenetic clustering clearly delineated the entire germplasm into three well supported distinct clusters according to the species sources. According to the Nei's genetic identity, Z. spina-christi and Z. nummularia were the most similar species and had high differentiation with Z. mauritiana. Moreover, the highest values for Shannon’s information index (I = 0.505) and gene diversity (h = 0.347) were recorded in Z. spina-christi indicating there is higher genetic diversity compared with two other species. Four private alleles were identified in two species which could be beneficial for accessions authentication in argumentative situations. Moreover, results of the Mantel test showed there were moderate correlation between molecular and morphological matrices. In addition, estimation of bivariate correlations revealed there were significant positive and negative correlations between different variables, which offer a practical application of this information during phenotype based selection in ber improvement programs. The results of this investigation highlight the efficiency of translation initiation codon polymorphism for genetic characterization and accurate authentication of Ziziphus accessions as well as detecting and tagging morphologically important traits in this genus that would be helpful for implementation of effective conservation strategies and even broaden current genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3amolecular biology 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology 3astart codon1 aRezaei, Asma1 aEsmailpour, Mohammad1 aEbrahimi, Aziz0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.1007-1025dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-01000-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04290naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245021900169500001400388520214000402592002802542650002302570650003402593650002002627650001802647650001902665650001002684650001702694650001702711650003302728650001702761650001302778653003302791653002902824653001302853653002502866653000902891653000902900653000902909653000802918653001302926653000802939653000702947653001002954653001002964653000902974653000902983653000902992653001003001653000903011653000903020653001103029653000803040653001003048653000803058653000903066653001703075653000803092653000803100653000803108653000903116653001003125653000803135700001703143700001503160700001603175700001403191700001503205700005703220700001903277773009403296856008503390852000903475655001203484IND60714001220221119043457.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071400122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shichao10aNetwork pharmacology analysis of the therapeutic mechanisms of the traditional Chinese herbal formula Lian Hua Qing Wen in Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), gives fundamental support to the clinical use of LHQW  aNAL-light  aThe traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbal formula Lian Hua Qing Wen (LHQW) improves the results of COVID-19 treatment.

Intersection calculations between the LHQW-proteins and ACE2 co-expression-proteins.LHQW herbs have relationships to Stomach-, Heart-, Liver- and Spleen-systems, but most (10 of the 13 herbs) to the Lung system, indicating specific effects in lung diseases. The crucial LHQW PIN has the scale-free property, contains 2,480 targets, 160,266 PPIs and thirty functional modules. Six modules are enriched in leukocyte-mediated immunity, the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, immune response regulating signaling pathway, interleukin 23 mediated signaling pathway and Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis (GO analysis).

LHQW shared 189 proteins with ACE2 co-expression proteins.Detailed network analysis shows, that LHQW herbal TCM treatment modulates the inflammatory process, exerts antiviral effects and repairs lung injury. Moreover, it also relieves the “cytokine storm” and improves ACE2-expression-disorder-caused symptoms. These innovative findings give a rational pharmacological basis and support for treating COVID-19 and possibly other diseases with LHQW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainterleukin-23 3alungs 3aphagocytosis 3apharmacology 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atherapeutics 3atopology 0aTraditional Chinese Medicine 0aLian Hua Qing Wen (LHQW) 0aCOVID-19 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aACE2 0aACEI 0aAKT1 0aARB 0aCOVID-19 0aFYN 0aGO 0aHMGB1 0aIFNγ 0aJAK1 0aKEGG 0aLHQW 0aMCODE 0aMERS 0aPCNA 0aPIK3CG 0aPIN 0aPLCG1 0aPPI 0aSARS 0aSARS­CoV­2 0aSrc 0aTCM 0aTNF 0aVAV1 0aVCAM1 0aWHO1 aBaak, Jan P.1 aLi, Shuang1 aXiao, Wenke1 aRen, Hong1 aYang, Huan1 aGan, Yanxiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3868-68801 aWen, Chuanbiao0 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Dec., v. 79 p.153336-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012300165300001600288500001400304520149400318592002801812650002401840650001701864650001501881650001701896650001301913650001801926650001601944650002401960650001501984650001301999650001502012650001202027650001302039650002002052650001202072650002002084650003102104650001802135650001702153650001202170650002202182650001102204650001002215650000902225650001202234650002402246650001702270650001202287650002502299653002602324653001802350653002402368653001602392700001702408700001702425700001202442700001902454700001902473773016502492856008402657852000902741655001202750IND60700804220221119154708.0200819e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070080422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2020.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yijie10aPaecilomyces tenuipes extracts affect lipid and glucose metabolic parameters similarly to Cordyceps militaris extracts  ap. 746-755.  aNAL-light  aAscocarps of some species of the genus Cordyceps have long been used as a traditional medicine and food source for promoting human health. The compound cordycepin, isolated from C. militaris ascocarps (CE), show similar health effects to CE. In this study, we investigated and compared the anti-obesity and antidiabetic effects of dietary CE and Paecilomyces tenuipes ascocarps (PE) in mice. In addition, we investigated their effects on the expression of genes related to the regulation of obesity and diabetes. We found that dietary CE and PE suppressed body weight gain and fat accumulation in the liver and adipocyte tissues of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Enzyme and lipid profiles induced by HFD returned to normal with CE or PE treatment. Dietary CE or PE reduced fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels in HFD-fed mice. Finally, we show that CE and PE treatment restored to normal the hyperlipidemia- and hyperglycemia-related gene expressions in HFD-fed mice. These results indicate that dietary CE or PE exert their anti-obesity and antidiabetic effects by regulating adipogenesis and insulin signaling pathways. Finally, we show that dietary CE or PE have similar anti-obesity and antidiabetic effects even when included in a normal mouse diet. Although cordycepin is not found in PE, PE treatment improves lipid and glucose metabolic parameters in a manner similar to CE. We find that PE provides alternative potential therapeutic treatments for obesity and diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3aPaecilomyces 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aascomata 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acordycepin 3adiabetes 3aentomology 3aenzymes 3aextracts 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahigh fat diet 3ahuman health 3ainsulin 3alipid composition 3alipids 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atraditional medicine 0aPaecilomyces tenuipes 0aHigh-fat diet 0aMetabolic parameter 0aAntiobesity1 aKim, Bo Yeon1 aPark, Min Ji1 aOk, Min1 aLee, Kwang Sik1 aJin, Byung Rae0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 3 p.746-755dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2020.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014200164300001800306520147000324592002801794650001701822650001301839650002801852650001301880650001601893650002201909650001201931650003301943650001101976650001301987650001102000650001302011650001602024650001402040650002202054650001502076651001602091700003702107700002302144700002602167700002002193700001702213773011702230856008102347852000902428655001202437IND60440628320221119180900.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044062832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4505-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Kazi10aQuantification of the daily dynamics of streamflow components in a small alpine watershed in Switzerland using end member mixing analysis  ap. 4927-4937.  aThere is a growing need to improve our understanding of catchment flow generation processes, especially in alpine watersheds, where the aquatic biodiversity is dependent upon the types of water sources and their seasonal dynamics. In order to identify and quantify the potential sources that contribute to stream runoff, Water samples were collected and discharge was measured. Other physical variables like electric conductivity and water temperature were also collected twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. These measurements continued for two to four consecutive days. In situ measurements were done for temperature, electric conductivity and turbidity of water at different temporal scale. Mass spectrometry was done to analyze silica and sulfate along with chlorine. Three different water sources were identified based on their physiochemical characteristics: glacier melt water, quickly routed surface runoff, and slowly routed ground water. Principal component analysis was performed in order to reduce dimensionality of the chemistry data independently in two hydrological years. End member mixing analysis was carried out for morning and afternoon data to describe the daily variation of runoff components. Our study suggests that glacier melt component has a strong daily variation, which influences the magnitude and timing of peak flow. A sign of early melt and accumulation can be seen in this watershed based on the studied years.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3achlorine 3aelectrical conductivity 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3amass spectrometry 3amelting 3aprincipal component analysis 3arunoff 3asampling 3asilica 3asnowmelt 3astream flow 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aSwitzerland1 aBesacier-Monbertrand, Anne-Laure1 aCastella, Emmanuel1 aLods-Crozet, Brigitte1 aIlg, Christiane1 aBeguin, Olga0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.4927-4937dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4505-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245019600164300002000360500001900380520168200399592002802081650001102109650002302120650002502143650002902168650001602197650001402213650001702227653002802244653002402272653003002296653002502326700005602351700003302407700002302440773014202463856007802605852000902683655001202692IND60711364820210831000000.0200923e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c099122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsrafili, Leili10aDevelopment of Porous Cobalt-/Copper-Doped Carbon Nanohybrids Derived from Functionalized MOFs as Efficient Catalysts for the Ullmann Cross-Coupling Reaction: Insights into the Active Centers  ap. 43115-43124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNewly emerging poly-functional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proved to be a promising alternative method for the hard/soft template to generate different carbon-based heterostructures. Herein, we have synthesized a sulfonyl-amide-based MOF (TMU-81) with an exceptionally high concentration of functional groups, which can interact strongly with metal ions and utilized it as a double-template platform to fabricate versatile catalysts by remaining structural regularity. The preloaded copper ions resided in pores of TMU-81 not only play a significant role in pore-forming by in situ renovating into Cu nanoparticles via the pyrolysis process but also trigger the morphological transformations of the resultant metal/carbon hybrids. The morphology of the TMU-81 was tuned from truncated octahedron to cubic in cobalt-/copper-doped carbon nanohybrids (MC-81), and also the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area increased significantly up to 1450 cm²/g. Benchmarks have been established for the performance of TMU-81, pyrolyzed TMU-81 (P-TMU-81), and MC-81s, as efficient and robust catalysts for the C–N cross-coupling reaction with aryl-halides and amines. The obtained MC-81 showed superior performance compared with pristine TMU-81 and pyrolyzed P-TMU-81. The catalysis performance is found to be closely dependent on the amount of preloaded Cu²⁺ ions in the MOFs. After 5 cycles, the catalysts were reusable without any significant loss of activity. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the present approach offers an intelligent way to synthesis and design of structurally complex MOF hybrid and derived functionalized systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acopper nanoparticles 3across-coupling reactions 3ananohybrids 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 0ametal organic framework 0acomplex MOF hybrids 0adouble-template pyrolysis 0aN-arylation reaction1 aMorsali, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1828-72871 aDehghani Firuzabadi, Fahimeh1 aRetailleau, Pascal0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 12, no. 38 p.43115-43124dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c099123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04632naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013100169500001400300520215600314592002802470650002202498650002402520650001502544650003802559650001902597650002502616650003602641650002402677650002102701650000902722650001402731650001202745650001202757650002402769650002702793650005202820650001902872650000802891651001002899653001402909653002502923653002202948653002002970653002402990653000803014653000703022653000803029653001103037653000803048653000803056653000703064653000803071653000803079653000803087653000803095653000903103653001003112653000803122653000903130653000703139653000903146653000803155653001003163653001103173653000703184653000903191653000903200653000803209653000803217653000903225653000803234653000703242653000703249653000703256653000703263653000803270653002103278653000803299653000803307653000803315700005703323700001803380700001203398700001803410700001803428773009403446856008503540852000903625655001203634IND60714001420221119043509.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071400142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Yun Hee10aPu'er tea water extract protects against cognitive impairment in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation  aNAL-light  aPu'er tea, a type of post-fermented tea made from Camellia sinensis leaves, has long been widely used in East Asian countries. It is mainly produced in southern China and is effective in preventing obesity due to its ability to break down fat. However, the effects of Pu'er tea on cognitive impairment or neuroinflammation by endotoxin have not yet been studied.Here, we assessed the inhibitory activity of Pu'er tea hot water extract (PTW) on neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment and explored its mechanism.The ability of PTW to inhibit cognitive impairment was investigated in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and murine microglia BV2 cells.We examined whether oral administration of PTW prevented cognitive impairment and LPS-induced neuroinflammation using behavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), Griess assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).First, Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests demonstrated that oral administration of PTW effectively attenuated LPS-induced spatial memory loss and inhibited neuronal damage of mouse brains. Histopathological analysis showed that PTW repressed LPS-induced expression of the activation markers ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Furthermore, PTW inhibited the expression of amyloidogenesis proteins such as amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), C99, and β-secretase-1 (BACE-1); production of inflammatory proteins such as Iba-1, GFAP, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2; activation of inflammatory pathways; and expression of inflammatory mediator mRNAs in hippocampal tissue. In cultured microglia, PTW treatment inhibited the generation of various inflammatory factors activated by LPS.Our results in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that PTW effectively prevents cognitive impairment caused by neuroinflammation and is, therefore, a potential candidate for the development of a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3acognitive disorders 3aendotoxins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3alipopolysaccharides 3amemory disorders 3amice 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspatial memory 3atea 3aChina 0aPu'er tea 0acognitive impairment 0aneuroinflammation 0aamyloidogenesis 0aneuronal protection 0aAβ 0aAD 0aAPP 0aBACE-1 0aBBB 0aBSA 0aCA 0aCCK 0aCNS 0aCOX 0aDex 0aDMEM 0aELISA 0aERK 0aGFAP 0aHO 0aHPLC 0aHRP 0aIba-1 0aIκBα 0aIL 0aIndo 0aiNOS 0aJNK 0aLPS 0aMAPK 0aMWM 0aNE 0aNF 0aNO 0aPA 0aPTW 0areal-time RT-PCR 0aSEM 0aTLR 0aTNF1 aOh, You-Chang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9889-77701 aPak, Malk Eun1 aLi, Wei1 aGo, Younghoon1 aLee, Jung-Jin0 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Dec., v. 79 p.153338-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006000137245009500197300001600292500001900308520133500327592002801662650002001690650002201710650001801732650001701750650001901767650001701786650001001803650001401813650001701827650000901844650002301853650002001876650001401896650001301910650001201923650003401935650001401969650002101983650001702004650001002021653002502031653001802056653003102074653000902105653001202114700001202126700001402138700001402152700001802166700001602184700001702200700001602217773011302233856007202346852000902418655001202427IND60729901420221121035422.0210304s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990142DNAL7 a10.1071/CP204342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jia Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9475-787710aIdentification and expression characterisation of SbERECTA family genes in Sorghum bicolor  ap. 125-135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aERECTAs are receptor-like kinases that regulate plant biomass and stress resistance. In this study, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) TaERECTA gene was used as a probe to identify the SbERECTA family genes (SbERs) in the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genome, analyse their subcellular localisation and characterise their expression. Results showed that the two SbER members, SbER10 with three copies (SbER10_X1, SbER10_X2, and SbER10_X3) and SbER4 with two copies (SbER4_X1 and SbER4_X2), were found on chromosomes 10 and 4 of sorghum, respectively. SbER10 had the highest expression level in the pedicel tissue and showed a remarkable response under treatment with abscisic acid, brassinolide, gibberellin and indole-3-acetic acid. SbER10_X1, functioning on the cell membrane and chloroplast, exhibited abundant transcript in only a few sorghum varieties that are grown in mountainous areas and receive strong light, heat, and water supply. Expression of SbER10_X1 was significantly and positively correlated with plant biomass of 32 sorghum germplasm resources. These results indicate that SbER10 genes have an important regulatory role in sorghum growth, and increasing SbER10 transcription level offers a potential strategic target for breeding or biotechnological approaches to enhance sorghum biomass and environmental adaptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3abrassinolide 3acell membranes 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agibberellins 3aheat 3aindole acetic acid 3alight intensity 3amountains 3apastures 3apedicel 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphytomass 3astress tolerance 3awater supply 3awheat 0acorrelation analysis 0aERECTA family 0aexpression characteristics 0aSbER 0asorghum1 aYu, Jie1 aLiu, Ting1 aWang, Xin1 aZhan, Qiu Wen1 aLi, Jie Qin1 aXu, Zhao Shi1 aMa, You Zhi0 tCrop & pasture science.g2021, v. 72, no. 2 p.125-135dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl4206942x1836-09477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP204343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245008100198300002000279506007600299520215300375592002802528506003702556650002102593650003302614650001702647650003402664650001202698650002602710650001802736650001902754650002202773650002202795650001502817650001102832650001402843650001102857650001902868650001402887650001702901650002202918650001502940700002102955700001902976700002002995700002203015773010503037856007503142852000903217655001203226IND60531027520221207132326.0160723e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102752DNAL7 a10.1021/bi301243v2doi7 aPMC35329392pmcid7 a232309672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBera, Asim K.10aStructure of Aminodeoxychorismate Synthase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  ap. 10208-10217.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPabB, aminodeoxychorismate synthase, is the chorismic acid binding component of the heterodimeric PabA–PabB complex that converts chorismic acid to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate, a precursor of p-aminobenzoate and folic acid in microorganisms. The second component, a glutamine amidotransferase subunit, PabA, generates ammonia that is channeled to the PabB active site where it attacks C4 of a chorismate-derived intermediate that is covalently bound, through C2, to an active site lysine residue. The presence of a PIKGT motif was, until recently, believed to allow discrimination of PabB enzymes from the closely related enzyme anthranilate synthase, which typically contains a PIAGT active site motif and does not form a covalent enzyme–substrate intermediate with chorismate. A subclass of PabB enzymes that employ an alternative mechanism requiring 2 equiv of ammonia from glutamine and that feature a noncovalently bound 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate intermediate was recently identified. Here we report the 2.25 Å crystal structure of PabB from the emerging pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It is the first reported structure of a PabB that features the PIAGT motif. Surprisingly, no dedicated pabA is evident in the genome of S. maltophilia, suggesting that another cellular amidotransferase is able to fulfill the role of PabA in this organism. Evaluation of the ammonia-dependent aminodeoxychorismate synthase activity of S. maltophilia PabB alone revealed that it is virtually inactive. However, in the presence of a heterologous PabA surrogate, typical levels of activity were observed using either glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source. Additionally, the structure suggests that a key segment of the polypeptide can remodel itself to interact with a nonspecialized or shared amidotransferase partner in vivo. The structure and mass spectral analysis further suggest that S. maltophilia PabB, like Escherichia coli PabB, binds tryptophan in a vestigial regulatory site. The observation that the binding site is unoccupied in the crystal structure, however, suggests the affinity may be low relative to that of E. coli PabB.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aactive sites 3aaminodeoxychorismate synthase 3aammonia 3aanthranilate synthase 3abinding sites 3achorismic acid 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme substrates 3afolic acid 3agenome 3aglutamine 3alysine 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3apolypeptides 3aspectral analysis 3atryptophan1 aAtanasova, Vesna1 aDhanda, Anjali1 aLadner, Jane E.1 aParsons, James F.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 51, no. 51 p.10208-10217dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi301243v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010700161300002000268500001900288520126600307592002801573650003701601650000801638650001601646650001101662650001501673653003001688653001301718653002201731653002801753653003101781700001601812700006001828700002101888700001601909700001901925700001701944700002001961700001301981700001701994700001602011700005502027700005702082700006402139700005502203773014202258856007802400852000902478655001202487IND60711364920221122222200.0200923e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c099222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mengjiao10aFacile and Reversible Carrier-Type Manipulation of Layered MoTe₂ Toward Long-Term Stable Electronics  ap. 42918-42924.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlexible manipulation of the carrier transport behaviors in two-dimensional materials determines their values of practical application in logic circuits. Here, we demonstrated the carrier-type manipulation in field-effect transistors (FETs) containing α-phase molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe₂) by a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process in dry air for hole-dominated and electron-beam (EB) treatment for electron-dominated FETs. EB treatment induced a distinct shift of the transfer curve by around 135 V compared with that of the FET-processed RTA treatment, indicating that the carrier density of the EB-treated FET was enhanced by about 1 order of magnitude. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the atomic ratio of Te decreased from 66.4 to 60.8% in the MoTe₂ channel after EB treatment. The Fermi level is pinned near the new energy level resulting from the Te vacancies produced by the EB process, leading to the electron-dominant effect of the MoTe₂ FET. The electron-dominated MoTe₂ FET showed excellent stability for more than 700 days. Thus, we not only realized the reversible modulation of carrier-type in layered MoTe₂ FETs but also demonstrated MoTe₂ channels with desirable performance, including long-term stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3amolybdenum 0acarrier-type manipulation 0aα-MoTe2 0atelluride vacancy 0aelectron-beam treatment 0alogic-circuit applications1 aLin, Che-Yi1 aChang, Yuan-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0949-82181 aYang, Shih-Hsien1 aLee, Mu-Pai1 aChen, Ciao-Fen1 aLee, Ko-Chun1 aYang, Feng-Shou1 aChou, Yi1 aLin, Yi-Chun1 aUeno, Keiji1 aShi, Yumeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9623-37781 aChou, Yi-Chia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7775-29271 aTsukagoshi, Kazuhito1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9710-26921 aLin, Yen-Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1545-91430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 38 p.42918-42924dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c099223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010800160300001600268500001100284520213600295592002802431596007302459596001802532596003002550596001102580650002302591650002502614650000902639650001002648650001102658650001402669650001702683650001802700650002002718650001902738650000902757650001802766650001102784650002602795650002002821650002702841650001002868700002602878700003102904700002002935700002202955700002502977700002203002700002203024700006003046700002403106773012603130856007303256852000903329655001203338IND60642334820221121195410.0190507e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064233482DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.125582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossler, Eugenia10aMeta‐analysis of the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter in food‐producing animals worldwide  ap. 359-369.  aREVIEW  aThe objective of this meta‐analysis was to summarize available information on the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter (TC) in different food‐producing animals worldwide. Databases (i.e., PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus) were searched from 1980 to 2017 unrestricted by language. The inclusion criteria were as follows: prevalence or incidence studies, published in peer‐reviewed journals, and they must have reported the total number of animal samples studied and the number of samples that were positive for the presence of TC. When the identification of Campylobacter species was available, this information was included in the analysis. Multilevel random‐effect meta‐analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rate of TC and to compare them among different factors potentially associated with the outcome. The mean occurrence rate of TC in food‐producing animals was 0.424 (95% CI: 0.394–0.455), and the mean occurrence rate of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were 0.214 and 0.133, respectively. Pigs and poultry showed the highest prevalence of TC; however, there were differences in the prevalence of each Campylobacter species. Campylobacter jejuni was observed in broilers (0.322; 95% CI: 0.273–0.377) and hens (0.395; 95% CI: 0.265–0.542), while C. coli was restricted essentially in pigs (0.553; 95% CI: 0.541–0.650). The prevalence of C. jejuni in intensively bred cattle was higher (0.302; 95% CI: 0.227–0.389) than the prevalence in extensively bred cattle (0.172; 95% CI: 0.119–0.242) while the prevalence of C. coli was similar (0.051; 95% CI: 0.028–0.091 vs. 0.050; 95% CI: 0.027–0.091) in both production systems. Agar with or without blood used for the isolation of TC did not affect the prevalence observed. The method of species identification did not seem to generate differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter species. The prevalence of Campylobacter in primary food production has a strong impact on the entire agri‐food chain. National authorities must monitor the situation with the aim to establish the appropriate risk management measures.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 1491cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  cUNL Argentina  a11220120100481COcCONICET  cSENASA 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aagar 3ablood 3acattle 3adatabases 3afood animals 3afood industry 3afood production 3aheat tolerance 3ahens 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aproduction technology 3arisk management 3aspecies identification 3aswine1 aSignorini, Marcelo L.1 aRomero‐Scharpen, Analía1 aSoto, Lorena P.1 aBerisvil, Ayelén1 aZimmermann, Jorge A.1 aFusari, Marcia L.1 aOlivero, Carolina1 aZbrun, María V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7438-98031 aFrizzo, Laureano S.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2019 June, v. 66, no. 4 p.359-369dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.125583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009400210300002000304520128600324592002801610596009801638596009801736650001601834650001201850650001601862650002001878650001201898650002301910650001801933653001701951653002601968653003401994653003202028700006102060700005502121700005802176700005602234773014702290856008602437852000902523655001202532IND60792056320221121045028.0220905e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205632DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c034282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhengcai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5945-030310aMolecular Insights into the Impacts of Calcite Nanoparticles on Methane Hydrate Formation  ap. 11597-11605.  aDespite the potential broad utility of nanoparticles in hydrate-related fields, there remains a paucity of studies on the impacts of nanoparticles on gas hydrate formation. In this study, massive microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the roles of calcite nanoparticles on the formation processes of methane hydrate. Our results indicate that calcite nanoparticles prefer to be in the water phase close to the water/gas interface. They inhibit methane hydrate nucleation because a layer of bound water with a thickness of 0.75 nm forms around each nanoparticle which results in an extremely low methane concentration region. Thus, methane hydrate nucleates away from the nanoparticle, and no clear connection between the nucleated hydrate and the nanoparticle is observed. The nanoparticles associate easily, and a water layer with a thickness of 1.15 nm forms between the associated nanoparticles. Moreover, methane hydrate growth is not influenced by calcite nanoparticles until the growth front approaches the bound water around the nanoparticle. These molecular insights of the impacts of calcite nanoparticles on methane hydrate formation are beneficial for the application of nanoparticles in hydrate mining and hydrate-related technologies.  aPublisher supplied data  a41876051cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a42176212cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3abound water 3acalcite 3agas hydrate 3agreen chemistry 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 0aNanoparticle 0aGas hydrate formation 0aMolecular dynamics simulation 0aMethane hydrate nucleation.1 aKusalik, Peter G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6270-663X1 aWu, Nengyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1734-62491 aLiu, Changling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8655-528X1 aNing, Fulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1236-586X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 10, no. 35 p.11597-11605dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c034283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011200174300001600286500001900302520240100321536009902722592002802821596000902849650001602858650001702874650002002891650001602911650002502927650001502952650001002967653002502977653001003002653000803012653002203020653001403042700002103056700001703077700002103094700002003115700002003135700002003155773012003175856008503295852000903380655001203389IND60719844220221119014419.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984422DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17637422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJennissen, Charles10aJA:2021-12. How to Increase ATV Safe Riding Behaviors in Youth: FFA Members from across the Country Respond  ap. 239-240.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpose: All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are a significant source of rural injuries and deaths. Few studies have examined the best methods to improve adolescent ATV safety practices from the target audience’s perspective. The study’s objective was to explore youth’s thoughts regarding how they might be best reached and persuaded to ride ATVs more safely. Methods: Attendees of three ATV safety workshop sessions at the 2018 National FFA Convention answered provided questions after facilitated discussion. Qualitative analysis of responses was independently performed by three research team members, and differences in coding were resolved through an iterative process. Descriptive and comparative analyses of responses were performed. Results/Findings: 309 FFA members from 62 clubs participated (29 states). Almost all clubs stated that one reason most youth don’t ride ATVs safely is because of personal beliefs (e.g. inconvenient/not as enjoyable to ride safely). Almost three-fourths stated that an unsafe riding behavior young people would be most likely/willing to change was wearing a helmet. The safety behaviors that youth thought their peers would be least willing to change were traveling at lower speeds and not carrying passengers. Over one-half of the clubs stated that one of the best places to reach youth was at schools; the second most frequently mentioned was social media. Safety presenters that clubs felt youth would be most likely to listen to were peers and those just slightly older than the target audience. Other presentation groups frequently mentioned were crash survivors and those whose loved ones had been injured or died in ATV crashes. A variety of celebrities and authority figures were also suggested. Activities thought to be most effective at promoting safe riding were presentations with real-life injury examples including videos that might create a “fear factor,” and hands-on activities. FFA clubs responded that the least effective methods were lengthy, non-interactive presentations and printed materials with lots of facts/statistics. Practical Application: Youth have strong opinions regarding injury prevention information delivery, and what is likely to result in behavioral change. Our study provides important data regarding not only ATV safety information delivery, but other agricultural injury prevention messaging to youth as well.  aThis study was funded by Grinnell Mutual, also known as Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company.   aPublisher supplied data  aNone 3aadolescents 3aagromedicine 3abehavior change 3afearfulness 3aqualitative analysis 3astatistics 3ayouth 0aAll-terrain vehicles 0arural 0aFFA 0ainjury prevention 0amessaging1 aStange, Nicholas1 aWymore, Cole1 aHooyer, Mitchell1 aHoogerwerf, Pam1 aMulford, Lauren1 aDenning, Gerene0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.239-240dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17637423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010200210300001600312520133200328592002801660596004601688650001901734650001501753650001601768650001701784650002001801650000901821650001101830650002401841650002501865650001901890650001501909650001501924651001401939700002001953700002201973700002501995773012302020856008202143852000902225655001202234IND60636355920221120104927.0190408e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-019-00425-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsén, Xiaoli G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8696-072010aTurbulence Characteristics of Wind-Speed Fluctuations in the Presence of Open Cells: A Case Study  ap. 191-212.  aOpen cellular structures are frequently observed accompanying cold fronts over the North Sea. Through a two-day case study, measurements from two sites that are 100 km apart, and both covered by open cells, show that the turbulence is characterized by (1) considerable energy in the spectral gap region; (2) similar large-scale wind variation from surface to 100 m. These observations challenge existing algorithms for calculating parameters relevant to wind energy, including the turbulence intensity. We suggest that, in the presence of open cells, the stability effect is more related to the large-scale process, while the conventional parameter, the surface-layer Obukhov length, is less suitable. This issue is also revealed by the comparison of measurements with an unstable-boundary-layer spectral model. A mesoscale spectral model [Formula: see text] is proposed to include the stability effect, when combined with a boundary-layer turbulence model for neutral conditions. The stability effect is introduced to this mesoscale model in a simple manner through calibration, with the coefficient A obtained from regression using standard 10-min time series (from measurements or numerical modelling). The combined model successfully reproduces the power spectrum of wind-speed fluctuations for the two-day open-cell event.  aPublisher supplied data  a64017-0017/12521cDanish PSO ForskEL/EUDP 3aObukhov length 3aalgorithms 3acalibration 3acase studies 3acell structures 3acold 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3atime series analysis 3aturbulent flow 3awind power 3awind speed 3aNorth Sea1 aLarsen, Søren,1 aPetersen, Erik L.1 aMikkelsen, Torben K.0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2019 May, v. 171, no. 2 p.191-212dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00425-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017200173300001800345520096900363592002801332650002501360650001501385650001501400650001501415650002301430650001501453650001501468650002401483650002001507650003101527650003101558650001301589650001301602650002901615650001401644650004401658650001001702650001601712700002401728700002301752700002201775700002101797700002201818700001801840773009601858856008101954852000902035655001202044IND60572723120221120233008.0171214e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057272312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0720-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Ottavio, Francesca10aDetermination of Pesticides in Wheat Flour Using Microextraction on Packed Sorbent Coupled to Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1699-1708.  aAn ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method for multiclass analysis of pesticide and fungicide residues in wheat flour based is presented. An efficient and rapid cleanup based on microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) has been developed in order to have a good enrichment factor together with a low matrix effect. The target analytes were 25 pesticides widely used in wheat, with different physico-chemical characteristics and different mechanism of action: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphorus, carbamates, neonicotinoids, and inhibitors of ergosterol such as imidazoles and triazoles. MEPS was shown to be successful with reduction of the amount of solvent required and possibility of automation of the cleanup procedure. The whole method was then validated according to the SANCO/12571/2013 guidelines, proving its suitability as confirmation method for the selected analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aautomation 3acarbamates 3aergosterol 3afungicide residues 3aguidelines 3aimidazoles 3amechanism of action 3amicroextraction 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3aphysicochemical properties 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriazoles 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aDella Pelle, Flavio1 aMontesano, Camilla1 aScarpone, Rossana1 aEscarpa, Alberto1 aCompagnone, Dario1 aSergi, Manuel0 tFood analytical methods.g2017 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.1699-1708dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0720-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012600158300001600284520116400300592002801464653002501492653001001517653001101527653001501538653002701553653002401580700002501604700002701629700002101656700001801677700002401695700002101719700002301740773015501763856007201918852000901990655001201999IND60131671420221119193933.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167142DNAL7 a10.1638/05-102.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeem, Sharon L.10aBlood values in free-ranging nesting leatherback sea turtles (dermochelys coriacea) on the coast of the republic of gabon  ap. 464-471.  aLeatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are the most endangered of the seven species of sea turtles. The health status of leatherbacks is largely unknown, although the number of nesting females recorded throughout the world has decreased precipitously in the last few decades. Central African beaches may provide one of the last strongholds for nesting leatherback females. In the region, oil extraction and incidental capture pose significant threats to the health of the population. Physical examinations, hematology, plasma biochemistry, plasma corticosterone concentration, plasma protein electrophoresis, plasma vitamin concentrations, and toxicological parameters were evaluated in nesting female leatherbacks in the Republic of Gabon. The general clinical condition of the 35 turtles examined in this study was rated as good. The blood value results for a subset of these turtles are presented and compared to published results from other sea turtles. To the authors' knowledge, these are the first published baseline hematology, plasma biochemistry, and plasma protein electrophoresis values from clinically healthy nesting leatherback turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDermochelys coriacea 0aGabon 0ahealth 0ahematology 0aleatherback sea turtle 0aplasma biochemistry1 aDierenfeld, Ellen S.1 aSounguet, Guy Phillipe1 aAlleman, A.

Extensive molecular genetic studies have uncovered genes regulating morphogenesis, that is, the generation of shape, however, such genes do not directly determine cell and tissue shape. Recent studies have started to elucidate how mechanical cues mediate the physical shaping of cells and tissues. In particular, the mechanical force generated during cell and tissue growth coordinates deformation at the tissue and organ scale. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of mechanical regulation of plant development. We focus our discussion on how patterns of mechanical stresses are formed, how mechanical cues are perceived, and how they guide cell and organ morphogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aforces 3aplant development 3aplant morphogenesis1 aJiao, Yuling0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2020 Oct., v. 57 p.16-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2020.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006600160300001600226520080900242592002801051653001701079653001201096653001801108653002001126653002201146700002601168700002501194700002101219773015501240856007201395852000901467655001201476IND60131671520221119193656.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167152DNAL7 a10.1638/05-114.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Tara M.10aEnrofloxacin-induced retinopathy in a guanaco (lama guanicoe)  ap. 545-548.  aA 4-yr-old male guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in a multispecies exhibit presented with a laceration in the axillary region.

Heavy metal concentrations (mg/kg) of Hainan Island rivers were in the range of 0.01–0.58 mg/kg for Hg, 0.09–0.70 mg/kg for Cd, 1.80–36.87 mg/kg for As, 15.33–69.32 mg/kg for Pb, 4.46–150.89 mg/kg for Cu, 6.64–104.95 mg/kg for Cr and 22.11–199.11 mg/kg for Zn. Contamination indices including contamination factor, enrichment factor, and geoaccumulation index, and multivariate statistical analyses indicated that Wenlan River was relatively at a considerable pollution level; Nandu, Changhua, Lingshui, Wanquan and Zhubi rivers were at a low-to-moderate pollution level; Beimen and Ningyuan rivers were at a level of relatively low pollution. Principal component analysis indicated that Cd, Pb, Cr and Zn were predominantly sourced from anthropogenic sources; whereas, Cu, As and Hg were from lithogenic sources.

This paucity of information hinders progress to derive indicators of seabed integrity under current policy drivers. Based on data from 327 stations across the Greater North Sea, a sub-region of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), we describe variability in the numerical dominance of ten important macrofaunal traits and their relationships with the physical environment.For six traits (longevity, larval development position, egg development position, sediment position and bioturbation method), macrofaunal assemblages were dominated by one or two trait categories; these traits showed more pronounced spatial patterns than traits with a wider (and more even) trait category expression. Similar spatial distributions of some dominant categories were observed. For example, egg-brooding, surface-dwelling and suspension feeding traits were dominant in the central English Channel and off the Humber Estuary. Traits generally showed weak spatial relationships with environmental variables, although sediment position and feeding type were related to variations in bed shear stress and gravel content. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to monitoring seabed integrity under the MSFD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioturbation 3aeggs 3aestuaries 3afauna 3agravel 3aissues and policy 3alarval development 3alongevity 3aresearch 3ashear stress 3aEnglish Channel 3aNorth Sea 0aTraits 0aMacrofauna 0aSpatial variability 0aIndicators 0aMSFD1 aEggleton, J.1 aBarry, J.0 tJournal of sea research.g2020 Aug., v. 163 p.101923-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2020.1019233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245011200157300001600269520121700285592002801502653002001530653001901550653001501569653001701584653002601601653001901627700002701646700002201673700002401695773015501719856007201874852000901946655001201955IND60131671720221119193706.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167172DNAL7 a10.1638/05-118.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Mario10aAerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles (chelonia mydas) from tortuguero national park, costa rica  ap. 549-552.  aBacteriological examination of 70 nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica was performed to investigate nasal and cloacal aerobic bacteria. A total of 325 bacterial isolates were obtained, including 10 Gram-negative and three Gram-positive genera. Two hundred thirty-nine were Gram-negative and 86 were Gram-positive isolates. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common microbe identified in turtle samples: 27/70 (38.5%%) in cloacal, and 33/70 (47.1%%) in nasal samples. The Enterobacteriaceae family, including Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens, was the largest Gram-negative group of bacteria recovered and comprised 127 of 239 (53.1%%) of the Gram-negative isolates. Staphylococcus species was the largest Gram-positive bacteria group, including S. aureus, S. cromogenes, S. epidermis, and S. intermedius, and made up 63 of 86 (73.2%%) of the Gram-positive isolates recovered. The results of this study demonstrate that the aerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles at Tortuguero National Park is composed of a very wide spectrum of bacteria, including several potential pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBacterial flora 0aChelonia mydas 0aCosta Rica 0agreen turtle 0aKlebsiella pneumoniae 0aStaphylococcus1 aHernáández, Giovanna1 aCaballero, Magaly1 aGarcíía, Fernando0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2006 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.549-552dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/05-118.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04246naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245009500203300001200298506007600310520234200386592002802728506003702756650001902793650002002812650002502832650002502857650001702882650001802899650003102917650001402948650002702962650001602989650001303005650002103018650001303039650001903052650002503071650001703096650002203113650001803135650001203153650001903165650001003184650001403194650004203208650001603250650001303266650003603279650003203315700001703347700002003364700001403384773013103398856008203529852000903611655001203620IND60572723520221207121912.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057272352DNAL7 a284496762pmid7 aPMC54083752pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1739-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Long10aAnti-inflammatory effect of combined tetramethylpyrazine, resveratrol and curcumin in vivo  ap. 233.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Resveratrol and curcumin, as natural flavones products, have good therapeutic effect in acute and chronic inflammation; on the other hand, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has angiogenesis and vessel protection effect as well as anti-inflammatory function. In this paper, the anti-inflammatory effect of the tetramethylpyrazine, resveratrol and curcumin (TRC) combination in acute and chronic inflammation was reported in vivo. METHODS: The dose of the combined three natural products was optimized based on the acute paw swelling mouse model with a Uniform Design methodology. The therapeutic effect of TRC combination on chronic inflammation was investigated by using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model based upon the following indexes: the volume of paw swelling, arthritis score, serum mediators and histological examination as well as immunohistochemical staining. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in serum were measured and the pathological sections of liver and kidney were analysed. LD₅₀ was measured based on the acute oral toxicity (AOT) standard method. RESULTS: The best formulation was the three components combined at the same mass proportion revealed by the Uniform Design methodology. This combination could significantly reduce the paw swelling in acute paw swelling mouse model, could reduce paw swelling and alleviate the damage in joint structural of ankle, cartilages and fibrous tissue in CIA rat model. The dose relationship was clear in both cases. Immunohistochemical staining of ankle tissue revealed that TRC combination was able to inhibit the expression of NF-κB p65 and TNF-α which were closely related to the inflammatory process. Analysis of serum mediators revealed TRC combination could inhibit the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the serum. Toxic study revealed this formulation was low toxic, LD₅₀ was larger than 5 g/kg, both the level of ALT and AST and histopathology in the liver and kidney exhibited no distinctions between the TRC combination and the blank group, no mortality occurred at the administered doses of 5 g/kg. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed this formulation could provide a novel potent treatment for acute and chronic inflammation (RA) without side effect like gastric injury occurring in NSAIDs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aalternative medicine 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acurcumin 3adietary exposure 3aflavones 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alethal dose 50 3aliver 3amortality 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aresveratrol 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLiu, Tianjun1 aWang, Qiangsong1 aLiu, Juan0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.233-233dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1739-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03850naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007400172300001600246500001900262520272700281536001703008592002803025650002603053650001703079650001303096650001503109650003503124650002303159653002003182653001603202653001403218653001103232700001903243773012003262856008503382852000903467655001203476IND60719844820221119014429.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984482DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17637512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundqvist, Peter10aJA:2021-18. Health & Safety Education in Swedish Agricultural Schools  ap. 244-245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpose: Agriculture and forestry is still one of the sectors with the highest rate of work-related injuries, and it is essential that future farmers and employees in the agricultural sector, at an early stage, gain knowledge and insight into the importance of the work environment for safe, secure, and good working conditions in order to create an improved safety culture. The purpose of this study was to survey and analyze the occupational health and safety education provided at Swedish agricultural high schools (16–19 years-of-age). Method: All 29 schools with agricultural programs received surveys, with slightly different content for principals, operating managers, teachers, and instructors with questions about education, teaching materials, communication, and related issues. Results/Findings: The results (response rate 33%) showed that the agricultural high schools had a high standard of safety awareness and well-established procedures for injuries and incidents, and this was well known and perceived as well-functioning procedures by the staff in this study, with a tendency for the instructors to be less satisfied with the follow-ups and actions taken. The basic work environment education placed within the general course “Natural resources management” showed a varying amount of lessons due to the lack of specified minimum teaching time and difficulties in finding adequate teaching material. The widely differing backgrounds of the teachers and their sometimes low motivation for owning initiatives to develop this subject give further argument to the need for relevant and coherent literature. Altogether the results also indicated that teaching in the subject courses (such as “Farm animals” and “Agricultural mechanization”) generally did not take into account the evolving role to be played regarding work environment issues, according to the syllabus’s objective description and central content. Possible explanations could be teaching materials lacking connection and update to current course objectives, individual teachers’ interest in the matter, and/or ambiguities about what is to be taught in the actual course. The insight into how important the instructors or trainers in the practical farming at schools are as role models should lead to increased focus on training them further in health & safety issues. Practical application: The results of this study show that the education regarding health & safety at agricultural schools has some problems regarding the amount and quality of the content. There is a need for improvements and it needs to be further prioritized in the agricultural schools which often form the basic knowledge for the future of our farmers.  aThe SLO-fund  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagromedicine 3aforestry 3amotivation 3aoccupational health and safety 3aworking conditions 0aHealth & safety 0aagriculture 0aeducation 0aSweden1 aGoransson, Eva0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.244-245dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17637513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010200171300001600273520100000289592002801289650002001317650001701337650002701354650000801381650001701389650001001406650001001416650001801426650001901444650002001463650001601483650001901499650003401518650001801552650001901570650001601589650001301605650001001618650001101628653002201639653003401661653001101695653001801706653001801724700002201742700001801764700002401782773010001806856008701906852000901993655001202002IND60542211520221122051437.0190402e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054221152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkin, Celale10aCombined effects of gamma-irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging on quality of some spices  ap. 255-261.  aThyme (Thymus vidgaris L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) in ground form were packaged in either air or 100% N2 and γ-irradiated at 3 different irradiation levels (7kGy, 12kGy, 17kGy). Total viable bacterial count, yeast and mould count, colour, essential oil yield and essential oil composition were determined. Microbial load was not detectable after 12kGy irradiation of all samples. Irradiation resulted in significant changes in colour values of rosemary and black pepper. The discolouration of the irradiated black pepper was lower in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) compared to air packaging. Essential oil yield of irradiated black pepper and cumin was lower in air packaging compared to MAP. Gamma-irradiation generally decreased monoterpenes and increased oxygenated compounds, but the effect was lower in MAP. Overall, spices should be irradiated under an O2-free atmosphere to minimise quality deterioration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuminum cyminum 3aPiper nigrum 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aair 3ablack pepper 3acolor 3acumin 3adiscoloration 3aessential oils 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3amicrobial load 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amolds (fungi) 3amonoterpenoids 3aplate count 3arosemary 3athyme 3ayeasts 0aGamma-irradiation 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aSpices 0aEssential oil 0aSpice quality1 aMitrevski, Blagoj1 aGunes, Gurbuz1 aMarriott, Philip J.0 tFood chemistry.g2014 July 01, v. 154 p.255-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300002000267520088500287592002801172650001401200650001901214650001701233650002101250650001801271650002301289650002001312650001301332650001101345650002101356650001101377650001301388650001301401653002201414653002501436653001101461700005801472700005601530700002201586700005401608773014701662856008601809852000901895655001201904IND60792057020221121045030.0220905e20220823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205702DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c037742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalanti, Anika10aPhenolic Group Distribution as a Function of Molecular Weight in Lignins and Their Fractions  ap. 11680-11691.  aAn analytical approach based on phenol fluorescence labeling with the dansyl fluorophore coupled with gel permeation chromatography using UV and fluorescence detection was applied in an effort to increase the understanding of the phenolic group distribution in different lignin specimens.

Here, we report the functional characterization of P. falciparum chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), which interacts with several proteins namely PfCAF2, Histones, PfHP1 and others. Consistent with the above findings, we demonstrate the presence of PfCAF1 at the telomeric repeat regions, central and subtelomeric var genes of multiple var gene family along with PfHP1. Further, we report the upregulation of PfCAF1 after treatment with genotoxic agents like MMS and HU. Together, these findings establish role of PfCAF1 in heterochromatin maintenance and as histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly and DNA damage repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3acell cycle 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3amutagens 3anucleosomes 3atelomeres 0aMalaria 0aReplication 0aChaperone 0aCAF1 0aHeterochromatin 0aPfHP11 aAgarawal, Meetu1 aKhādijā Banu,1 aReddy, K.

Carbon nanoparticles have demonstrated unique properties that are useful to combat with these issues, including their properties dependent on size, high stability in different solvents, compatible size for drug delivery and ease of surface modifications. Fluorescent carbon nanoparticles with good water solubility were obtained from a carbohydrate source by acid assisted ultrasonic treatment at 35kHz for 4h. This simple and economical method can be used for large scale production. Electron microscopic, spectroscopic and thermo gravimetric analysis techniques were used to characterize these carbon nanoparticles. Functionalized CNPs were further conjugated with anticancer drug-methotrexate and used as fluorescent nano-carriers. In this research work, we determined the in vitro bioactivity of CNPs-methotrexate conjugates by lactate dehydrogenase assay, cell adhesion assay and sulforhodamine B assay in human lung carcinoma cell line (H157). The CNPs showed promising biocompatibility and CNPs-MTX conjugates demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects and high anticancer activities in human lung cancer cell line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiocompatibility 3acell adhesion 3acytotoxicity 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alung neoplasms 3amethotrexate 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater solubility 0aCNPs 0aCNPs–MTX 0aEDC 0aEDS 0aEN 0aFBS 0aHBSS 0aLDH 0aMTX 0aMWCNT 0aPL 0aRPMI-1640 0aSWCNT 0aTCA 0aTGA 0aTris 0aFluorescent carbon nanoparticles 0aCarbon nanoparticles–methotrexate conjugates 0aLung carcinoma cells 0aLactate dehydrogenase assay 0aAdhesion assay 0aSulforhodamine B assay1 aYunus, Uzma1 aMatin, Abdul1 aHaq, Noaman Ul0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Dec., v. 153 p.111-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012000153300001600273520099300289592002801282653001101310653001301321653001401334653001101348653001501359653001301374700002501387700002001412700002301432700001801455700001901473773015501492856007201647852000901719655001201728IND60131671920221119194018.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167192DNAL7 a10.1638/06-013.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayer, R.,10aPrevalence of microsporidia, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp. in beavers (castor canadensis) in massachusetts  ap. 492-497.  aFeces from 62 beavers (Castor canadensis) in Massachusetts were examined by fluorescence microscopy (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Microsporidia species, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. between January 2002 and December 2004.

Based on the DNA specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) for large-scale SNP detection, the genetic diversity and population structure of Salix gordejevii Y. L. Chang et Skv., a valuable sand-fixing shrub, was assessed in 199 accessions from 20 populations in Hunshandake Sandland of northern China. A total of 623.15 M reads resulted in 30.49 × sequencing depth on average and a mean Q30 of 95.70%, and 2,287,715 SNPs in 178,509 polymorphic SLAF tags were obtained. By discarding minor allele frequency > 0.05 and integrity > 0.8, a total of 93,600 SNPs were retained for population genetic analyses, which revealed that 199 individuals could be divided into six groups based on cross-validation errors. However, this grouping pattern did not match the geographical distribution, indicating that there is no apparent geographic barrier in the blank areas where S. gordejevii was not distributed in Hunshandake Sandland. In addition, the physical distance of linkage disequilibrium decay in the analyzed S. gordejevii individuals was 18.5 kb when r² = 0.1. The linkage disequilibrium decay distances for different chromosomes varied from 4.6 kb (chromosome 16) to 37.8 kb (chromosome 3). The obtained SNPs offer suitable marker resources for further genetic and genomic studies and will benefit S. gordejevii breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aNJZZ19185cThe Research Program of Science and Technology at Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region  a41901063cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201605052cThe Program of science and technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 3aDNA 3aSalix gordejevii 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ageographical distribution 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amolecular biology 3apopulation structure 3ashrubs 3aChina1 aNing, Xiao-Li0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.997-1005dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-00994-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012400160300001800284520150000302592002801802650001901830650001601849650001201865650001401877650001601891650002401907650004301931650001901974650001101993650001902004650001502023650001702038650001602055650001502071650001502086650001602101650001702117700001602134700001702150700001602167700001502183773011702198856008102315852000902396655001202405IND60440629520221119180703.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044062952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4513-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Lin13aAn integrated assessment of the impact of precipitation and groundwater on vegetation growth in arid and semiarid areas  ap. 5009-5021.  aIncreased demand for water resources together with the influence of climate change has degraded water conditions which support vegetation in many parts of the world, especially in arid and semiarid areas. This study develops an integrated framework to assess the impact of precipitation and groundwater on vegetation growth in the Xiliao River Plain of northern China. The integrated framework systematically combines remote sensing technology with water flow modeling in the vadose zone and field data analysis. The vegetation growth is quantitatively evaluated with the remote sensing data by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simulated plant water uptake rates. The correlations among precipitation, groundwater depth and NDVI are investigated using Pearson correlation equations. The results provide insights for understanding interactions between precipitation and groundwater and their contributions to vegetation growth. Strong correlations between groundwater depth, plant water uptake and NDVI are found in parts of the study area during a ten-year drought period. The numerical modeling results indicate that there is an increased correlation between the groundwater depth and vegetation growth and that groundwater significantly contributes to sustaining effective soil moisture for vegetation growth during the long drought period. Therefore, a decreasing groundwater table might pose a great threat to the survival of vegetation during a long drought period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adrought 3aequations 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3avadose zone 3avegetation 3awater flow 3awater table 3awater uptake1 aGong, Huili1 aDai, Zhenxue1 aXu, Tingbao1 aSu, Xiaosi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.5009-5021dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4513-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010000165500001900265500002000284520238800304592002802692596005302720650001702773650000902790650001502799650001902814650001202833650001302845650002302858650003402881650001902915650002202934650001802956650003302974650002703007700001703034773013503051856007403186852000903260655001203269IND60729902320221122051013.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990232DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.136352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunç, Merve Tuğçe10aOptimization of ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation of cinnamon and bay leaf essential oil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this work, optimum ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation (OAHD) conditions for extraction of cinnamon (CEO) and bay leaf (BEO) essential oil were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). OAHD were compared with conventional hydrodistillation (HD). Hydrodistillation time (30–120 min), mass of sample (20–40 g) and voltage gradient (7.5–12.5 V/cm), were varied to maximize essential oil (EO) yield and minimize energy consumption. Optimized OAHD conditions were determined as 119.90 min, 8.83 V/cm and 40 g, and 120 min, 8.53 V/cm and 40 g for CEO and BEO, respectively. EO yields of cinnamon and bay leaves at optimum conditions were found 3.98 ± 0.25% and 1.36 ± 0.14%, respectively. Energy consumptions were found 0.42 ± 0.02 and 0.86 ± 0.09 kWh/g EO for CEO and BEO, respectively. EO yield of OAHD was found to be higher when compared with HD methods for both plant materials. Energy consumptions and emitted CO₂ values of OAHD method were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than HD methods. Cinnamaldehyde (CEO) and eucalyptol (BEO) contents of essential oils extracted with OAHD were higher when compared with HD methods. Antioxidant activities of essential oils extracted with different methods were not significantly different. CEO and BEO formed inhibition zones against all tested microorganism strains. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Essential oils of cinnamon bark and bay leaf are commonly used for food and pharmaceutical industries and, have important economic value. Conventional hydrodistillation method to extraction essential oils is time consuming, requires more energy and has more CO₂ emission rates. Ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation as a novel technology, is a promising method to extraction of essential oils from different plant materials with lower process times and energy consumption when compared with conventional hydrodistillation. Ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation method can developed with regard to scale up as a green technology to essential oil production. This work provides a knowledge about the effects of different OAHD process variables on essential oil yield and energy consumption for cinnamon bark and bay leaf essential oils. It is expected that the outcomes of this study will be useful for the designing of large scale ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation units.  aPublisher supplied data  aPYO.MUH.1904.18.022cOndokuz Mayis üniversitesi 3aantioxidants 3abark 3abay (herb) 3acarbon dioxide 3acineole 3acinnamon 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectric potential difference 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3aohmic heating 3aresponse surface methodology 3asustainable technology1 aKoca, İlkay0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13635-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013300211300001600344500001100360520144300371592002801814650001901842650002501861650001401886650001801900650001601918650001501934650001601949650001201965650002201977650001701999650001102016650002202027650002102049650001502070650001402085650003002099650002002129650001902149650001702168650001702185650004502202650001002247650002502257650002702282773011202309856008202421852000902503655001202512IND60655156220221122233715.0190731e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065515622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-019-03128-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeakey, Roger R.

Integrating these over-looked ‘Cinderella’ species into conventional farming systems as new crops is playing a critical role in raising the productivity of staple food crops and improving the livelihoods of poor smallholder farmers. This experience has important policy implications for the sustainability of tropical/sub-tropical agriculture, the rural economy and the global environment. A participatory domestication process has been implemented in local communities using appropriate horticultural technologies to characterize genetic variation in non-timber forest products and produce putative cultivars by the vegetative propagation of elite trees in rural resource centers. When integrated into mainstream agriculture, these new crops diversify farmers’ fields and generate income. Together, these outcomes address land degradation and social deprivation—two of the main constraints to staple food production—through beneficial effects on soil fertility, agroecosystem functions, community livelihoods, local trade and employment. Thus, the cultivation of these ‘socially modified crops’ offers a new strategy for the sustainable intensification of tropical agriculture based on the maximization of total factor productivity with minimal environmental and social trade-offs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aconventional farming 3acultivars 3adomestication 3aelite trees 3aemployment 3aethnobotany 3afarmers 3agenetic variation 3ahorticulture 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland degradation 3alivelihood 3anew crops 3anontimber forest products 3arural economics 3asoil fertility 3astaple crops 3astaple foods 3asustainable agricultural intensification 3atrade 3atropical agriculture 3avegetative propagation0 tPlanta.g2019 Sept., v. 250, no. 3 p.949-970dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03128-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009600171300001600267520136100283592002801644650001501672650002101687650001801708650001501726650001401741650001701755650002901772650002901801650002101830650003001851650001401881650001401895650001001909650001101919650001501930650001801945650002201963651001101985653001801996653002402014653002902038653002602067653001402093700001902107773010202126856005102228852000902279655001202288IND50087108320221119090359.0140412e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008710832DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.5800092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kuan-Chung10aControl of disinfection by-product formation using ozone-based advanced oxidation processes  ap. 487-495.  aThe effects of ozone dosage, water temperature and catalyst addition in an ozonation-fluidized bed reactor (O₃/FBR) on treated water quality and on the control of chlorinated and ozonated disinfection by-products (DBPs) were investigated. A biofiltration column was used to evaluate its removal efficiency on biodegradable organic matter and to reduce DBP formation. The Dong-Gang River, polluted by agricultural and domestic wastewater in Pingtung, Taiwan, was used as the water source. The treated water quality in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biodegradable DOC, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) improved with increasing ozone and catalyst dosages. Catalytic ozonation was more effective than ozonation alone at reducing the formation of DBPs at a given dosage. Experimental results show that water temperature had little effect on the treated water quality with the O₃/FBR system used in this study (p>0.05). The combination of O₃/FBR and the biofiltration process effectively decreased the amount of DBP precursors. The concentration of total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) was less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) requirement, which is 80 μg/L, for all treated waters and the concentration of five haloacetic acids (HAA5) fell below 60 μg/L with an ozone dosage higher than 2.5 mg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiodegradability 3abiofiltration 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental technology 3ahaloacetic acids 3amaximum contaminant level 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3arivers 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3aTaiwan 0abiofiltration 0acatalytic ozonation 0adisinfection by-products 0afluidized bed reactor 0aozonation1 aWang, Yuxiang,0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 33, no. 4 p.487-495dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.580009  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013800214300001600352520199100368592002802359650003202387650001002419650002202429650001002451650001402461650000902475650002002484650001802504650001802522650001102540650002602551650002202577650001502599650001402614650001902628650000902647650002602656650002902682650001002711650001702721650002802738650001102766700002602777700001702803700001902820700005502839700006502894773011202959856008203071852000903153655001203162IND60655156320221123022244.0190731e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065515632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-019-03141-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanzi, Alberto Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4370-564710aWinged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC.) for food and nutritional security: synthesis of past research and future direction  ap. 911-931.  aMAIN CONCLUSION : Winged bean is popularly known as “One Species Supermarket” for its nutrient-dense green pods, immature seeds, tubers, leaves, and mature seeds. This underutilised crop has potential beneficial traits related to its biological nitrogen-fixation to support low-input farming. Drawing from past knowledge, and based on current technologies, we propose a roadmap for research and development of winged bean for sustainable food systems. Reliance on a handful of “major” crops has led to decreased diversity in crop species, agricultural systems and human diets. To reverse this trend, we need to encourage the greater use of minor, “orphan”, underutilised species. These could contribute to an increase in crop diversity within agricultural systems, to improve human diets, and to support more sustainable and resilient food production systems. Among these underutilised species, winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) has long been proposed as a crop for expanded use particularly in the humid tropics. It is an herbaceous perennial legume of equatorial environments and has been identified as a rich source of protein, with most parts of the plant being edible when appropriately prepared. However, to date, limited progress in structured improvement programmes has restricted the expansion of winged bean beyond its traditional confines. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for this and recommend approaches for better use of its genetic resources and related Psophocarpus species in developing improved varieties. We review studies on the growth, phenology, nodulation and nitrogen-fixation activity, breeding programmes, and molecular analyses. We then discuss prospects for the crop based on the greater understanding that these studies have provided and considering modern plant-breeding technologies and approaches. We propose a more targeted and structured research approach to fulfil the potential of winged bean to contribute to food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsophocarpus tetragonolobus 3abeans 3abreeding programs 3acrops 3acultivars 3adiet 3afood production 3afood security 3ahumid tropics 3aleaves 3alow input agriculture 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aphenology 3aplant breeding 3apods 3aproduction technology 3aresearch and development 3aseeds 3asupermarkets 3asustainable agriculture 3atubers1 aEagleton, Graham Ewen1 aHo, Wai Kuan1 aWong, Quin Nee1 aMayes, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4770-36621 aMassawe, F.q(Festo),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0744-47770 tPlanta.g2019 Sept., v. 250, no. 3 p.911-931dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03141-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01579naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011300160300002000273520043100293592002800724650003400752650002300786650002600809650001100835650004400846700001800890700002000908700002100928700001900949700002200968700002100990773013501011856007401146852000901220655001201229IND60660272520221120090728.0190823e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027252DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04370g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorike, Satoshi10aOrder-to-disorder structural transformation of a coordination polymer and its influence on proton conduction  ap. 10241-10243.  aWe observed an ordered-to-disordered structural transformation in a Cu²⁺ coordination polymer and investigated its influence on the proton conductivity.

The preferred food source was P. menziesii, and the mean bark area consumed per seedling was 440.8 ± 147.9 mm². The second most preferred host was P. abies. The coniferous species that suffered the least damage was A. alba (76.8 ± 62.56 mm² per seedling). B. pendula was the least preferred source of food, and it caused mortality of 60% of weevils that fed on it. Weevils exhibited large differences in fecundity when fed with different tree species in a laboratory experiment. The largest number of eggs was laid by females fed with P. abies. Mean egg numbers reached 26.4 ± 24.89 eggs per experiment for P. abies. Similar fecundity was observed in weevils fed with twigs of P. sylvestris. Oviposition was approximately six times lower in females fed with L. decidua and P. menziesii. The maximum number of eggs laid by a single female during a one-month experiment was 90. The results are discussed in relation to management of H. abietis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aBetula pendula 3aHylobius abietis 3aLarix decidua 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aadults 3abark 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3aoviposition 3aseedlings 3atrees1 aKleinová, Lenka 1 aDavídková, Markéta 0 tInsects.g2021 May 19, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120504733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014500158300001800303520049600321592002800817650002300845650001300868650002400881700001500905700001500920700001500935700001800950700001400968700001600982773013400998856007401132852000901206655001201215IND60660272620221120211956.0190823e20140731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027262DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04377d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianming10aBase-promoted synthesis of coumarins from salicylaldehydes and aryl-substituted 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes under transition-metal-free conditions  ap. 9887-9890.  aFacile synthesis of coumarin via the tandem reaction of salicylaldehyde with aryl-substituted 1,1-dibromo-1-alkene was developed.

Therefore, in this study, we compared many products, specifically, 19 traditional doenjang (TD) and 17 industrial doenjang (ID). Subsequently, we performed non-targeted metabolite profiling, and multivariate statistical analysis to discover distinct metabolites in two types of doenjang. Amino acids, organic acids, isoflavone aglycones, non-DDMP (2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4- one) soyasaponins, hydroxyisoflavones, and biogenic amines were relatively abundant in TD. On the contrary, contents of dipeptides, lysophospholipids, isoflavone glucosides and DDMP-conjugated soyasaponin, precursors of the above-mentioned metabolites, were comparatively higher in ID. We also observed relatively higher antioxidant, protease, and β-glucosidase activities in TD. Our results may provide valuable information on doenjang to consumers and manufacturers, which can be used while selecting and developing new products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3adipeptides 3afermentation 3aflavor 3aglucosides 3aisoflavones 3alysophospholipids 3ametabolites 3amultivariate analysis 3aproteinases 3ataste1 aLee, Sunmin 1 aLee, Seung-Hwa 1 aKim, Hae-Jin 1 aLee, Na-Rae 1 aLee, Choong-Hwan 0 tFoods.g2021 June 15, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
